 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, as we approach this particular piece of legislation,  there are other issues that seem to be floating around at this time of  year that seem to have sucked all the air out of Congress. Everyone  seems to be talking about impeachment instead of this stuff. But I  realize it is important for the majority party to try and give the  illusion that we are actually doing something, and, therefore, we have  this bill before us.   If this bill is indeed the vision that the majority party wants to  say is their way of helping climate control or helping the costs and  the betterment of our seas and oceans, if this is their philosophy, if  this is their vision, and if this is their new, really big and giant  kind of really cool thing that they are  [[Page H9971]]  going to bring out here as their statement of what is going to happen,  then they ought to be embarrassed in some way.   This bill is like getting that Christmas package, and once you tear  off all the pretty wrapping paper and the satin bows, Madam Chair, you  will realize, and Americans will realize, this piece of legislation is  an empty box. There is nothing there.   There are 10 bills that we have here. Three would actually qualify to  go as suspensions. We have no qualms with those. But it is certainly  not groundbreaking new ideas that are coming up here.   In fact, one of those bills is the one from Mr. Kilmer. He has a  great bill. It has one small problem with it that could create a  problem in the future, and there was a Democrat amendment that was  proposed to the Rules Committee which would be a perfect solution.   Unfortunately, of all the 29-plus amendments the Rules Committee  decided to make in order, the one that actually fixes something that we  would support, they decided not to make that in order. It is great. It  is marvelous. We will try to fix it over in the Senate side.   Of the other bills, four of them do absolutely nothing. In fact, the  testimony we had in committee on those bills was they are presently  being done by the status quo. The agency said in their testimony that  they have the power and the authority to do this already. The only  thing you are going to add by combining these extra bills, Madam Chair,  is simply a $1.4 billion cost increase to it.   There are four of these bills that have no Senate counterpart, which  means we can pass them over here, but they are going nowhere in the  Senate.   So, once again, this is simply a lost opportunity to do something  when we have so many significant issues. In fact, in the Rules  Committee last night, they mentioned some of the things we need to do  before next Friday, like the NDAA, which should have been done in  September; or the USMCA, which was ready to go in August; or the  funding bill that we need to do, which we should have had done by June;  or even the backlog maintenance bill that Mr. Kilmer and I have, which  has 330 sponsors and cosponsors and still has yet to have a vote on  this floor.   Those actually solve problems. They do something. But we are not  scheduling that stuff. So we are sitting here with this illusion of  coming up with something.   Some of these bills will make amendments to the Coastal Zone  Management Act, an act that was signed into law by Richard Nixon, which  gives the Democrats kind of an ironic sense of humor in actually doing  that kind of amendment in the atmosphere of this particular time  period.   Then we also have a whole bunch of amendments that were made in  order. Four of those 29 amendments are actually bills that other people  have proposed.   Since nothing is really being done in the legislative process here,  this seems to be like the only game in town, so why not add your bill  on to it?   We saw the same thing happening on the NDAA when we did several  things that were in the purview of our committee that were added to  that bill having nothing to do with the military, but it was the only  thing going in town, so add your bill on top of it.   Of those bills, three of them had absolutely no hearings whatsoever;  they are just new. They have been added on here, and we are going to  try and do this and bypass the entire system which is supposed to be  the way you actually do legislating in this body.   One of them did have a hearing. Unfortunately, it was last Congress  when we were in charge. I guess that is close enough for government  work here.   But the problem that we do simply have is that there are so many  potential problems with this bill.   Now, two of these bills that have been added to this have some  specific issues which we will talk about in the course of the  discussion that we have around the bill: one of them dealing with, once  again, whether a city is the same thing as a State for coastal  management planning; one of them will be dealing with some of the  programs that are going to be mandatory under this particular folderol  of legislation that has been kind of cobbled together as if this were a  good, bright, and comprehensive approach to try and solve problems in  America.   Madam Chair, I don't want to be too critical because I realize one of  these bills in here is yours. At the same time, this package of bills  is not a great idea; it is not grand philosophy; and it doesn't solve  anything. In fact, for the majority of it, you already have the power  to do it. You don't need this stuff in here. There are better ways of  doing it, and this is certainly not one of those ways.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Chair, even though this is another  wonderful program that already has three different agencies that do the  same thing and they have the authority to do it, in the Christmas  spirit--maybe the gentleman from Michigan will find the error of his  ways--in the Christmas spirit, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Madam Chair, even though it has been said, you  have already read it in some reports from the chairs of the committee  of jurisdiction as well as the committee that could have sequential  referral of this, that they approve adding some of the amendments we  are going to be talking about later into this package. I think the same  thing is actually having a hearing and allowing members of those  committees to have their will and say something.    The process is not to allow the chairman to determine what bills will  or will not be added--what bills will or will not be. It is to allow  the members of the committee to have that kind of input, and this  process is eliminating that kind of input.   Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock). He knows more about this issue than the rest of us on the  floor combined.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from  Maryland. He has got a good bill. It should be a suspension. We  wouldn't even ask for a vote for it. There is nothing wrong that.   Mr. Kilmer's H.R. 729 is a good, decent bill. What is so sad is the  Democrats have decided to take these two decent bills that should be  suspensions and hold them as hostage to tack a whole bunch of other  really crappy stuff on with them as well, and that is the sad part of  this.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern) so he can once again explain how there  are three good bills in this package and a whole lot of other bad ones.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Chair, one of the things that the other side has been talking  about is how we need a vision and need to plan for the future, which is  true. The only problem is that the stuff we have before us isn't it.  This is a collection of minor programs that already exist and changing  them in ways that sometimes make no difference but sometimes have some  negative counterpoints.   There is one bill that was just talked about here that if there is a  default on that bill, all of the sudden now, the Federal Government is  on the hook to pay for that. It was never that way before.   Those are minor changes that if we were handling these bills  separately, if they were actually being done in an appropriate way, we  could talk about those minor changes in there. But once you put them  all together in a package with a couple of really good things to lead  the way, everything kind of falls in place.   Let me give you another example. One of the issues that comes in the  folderol of bills that are underneath this is the Sea Grant Fellowship  Program, which is currently discretionary. This bill would make it  mandatory. Sounds kind of nice.   The program places fellows in the executive branch. We have no  problem with that whatsoever, but what this bill would do, one of the  things in the weeds of this concoction of bills that has been cobbled  together, is it would use taxpayer dollars to supply free staff for  Members of Congress. That concept is just plain wrong.  [[Page H9976]]    The underlying program is not bad. Reauthorizing is not bad. That one  change in there is wrong. If we were doing these bill-by-bill, talking  about them one-by-one instead of trying to add them all together in a  big package of nothing, if we were dealing with that, we could be  talking about those specific issues and making those kinds of  decisions.   That is the way legislation ought to be done. This is not the way  legislation ought to be done.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   What the gentleman from Louisiana was saying is exactly right.  Actually, he had an amendment that could have helped with that problem  that was not made in order by our crack Rules Committee. I am sure if  he would promise to shave next time he speaks, they probably would make  it in order the next time we have this bill.                                time  1530    Not only are there a lot of bills that are basically meaningless  because the authority is already there, there are a few situations  simply when the new additions to it do not make sense.   One of the speakers in here was talking about one of the coastal zone  management amendments to add Washington, D.C., to the coastal zone  management plan, which would be good except that, first of all,  Washington, D.C., is not a State, and, secondly, it is not even a  coastal State.  [[Page H9977]]    It would actually make more sense to have my hometown, because at  least we are on the Great Salt Lake and have brackish water that could  be included in part of this thing.   It also would make a problem of simply reducing the total amount of  funds that go to the 35 States that actually have their programs  already here. It is not a problem for Utah. We are not part of it. But  those States that have coasts, they will have their programs reduced  because of this.   More importantly, it provides jurisdictional problems in how the city  of Washington, D.C., would interface with the Federal Government.   Now, those are not insurmountable problems, but they should have been  worked out, and they could have been worked out if you are actually  dealing with these things in a logical, sequential way instead of  lumping them all together into some kind of overall program that  actually doesn't necessarily meet the guidelines of what we are trying  to accomplish.   But, as I said, there are three of these bills that are in here that  could easily have gone in suspension. We would have done it.   There is another bill in here that, had one amendment been made, it  would have easily solved the problem, and it should have been done.   But for the bulk of these bills--minor changes in here, but the bulk  of these bills can actually be done under current statutory authority.   As we had testimony from NOAA, on one of the bills, they simply said  the agency already provides financial and technical assistance through  existing programs. There was no reason to add that particular bill to  this list.   Another one that was on this list that tries to do the CZMA, under  their authority, States have discretion to use funding for many of the  purposes of the working waterfronts grant program that were proposed by  this particular bill. They can do it now. There is no additional  authority that is needed.   Then, another one of the bills that is part of this falderal of  legislation under one umbrella said that the coastal States already  have discretion to use funding to develop and implement adoption plans,  and they gave a specific example of how one of the States that does use  that, NOAA gave the example of how that flexibility already exists.   But we are saying over and over again, one of the problems we have  with this is that you have taken one really decent bill by Mr. Kilmer,  a couple of others that should have easily been in suspensions, and  have used them as a hostage to add up a whole bunch of other stuff to  it.   Then, if you look at some of the amendments that were made in order,  obviously, when you take other bills that have not had hearings, they  haven't gone through the process, we are going to try and now add them  on to this, well, why would anyone want to do that, except we are  giving the illusion of getting something done.   And this is the only game in town that is going through, so why not  try and put as many bills as you can? That way, somebody could stand up  and say, ``Look, we just passed 16 bills. Wouldn't it be nice if the  Senate picked them up?''   Well, that is not the way we are doing it. We are adding 16 bills.  Most of them have no Senate counterpart. Most of them will never be  done in the Senate. If the Senate actually deals with this issue at  all, they are going to separate it and divide it up and do it  piecemeal, which is the way we should have done it in the first  particular place.   If this package of bills is really a philosophy, a vision of the  future of what we are going to do to make either the air better or the  climate safer or water more drinkable, it doesn't happen in this bill.   These things are simply a retread of ideas that, in reality, the  authority they are trying to develop is actually already in existence.  They are doing it. Except that every once in awhile, in one of these  bills, you will add a little tweak here or a little tweak there that  basically is something that is wrong, that it should not be doing:   Creating a program to provide interns for our offices without having  it come out of our own budgets, that is not a great idea, but it is in  here;   Creating new areas for something that is not a State, that is not  even a coastal State, so they can get part of that money, that is not a  great idea, but it is part of it that is in here.   Those are the things that, if we did things per regular order, if we  actually tried to be logical about taking a bill and discussing it and  then coming up with a solution to some of the problems, we could easily  do that in a bipartisan way.   But we don't do that. Instead, we just lump everything together in  one package in an effort to say, ``Look, we are being productive.'' But  we are not solving a problem. We are not doing anything that is moving  the ball forward. All we are doing is checking a box, saying, yes, we  were here on this particular day, and giving the illusion of some kind  of activity.   What we really need is activity. What we really need is to get on  with things that are of significance that should have been done well  before now, like the NDAA and the trade treaty and our budget and the  backlog maintenance bill. All of those things should be done, but they  are not being scheduled.   And still we are coming up with a series of bills that don't make the  case; they are not ready for prime time.   This is a package that we will send over to the Senate, if indeed it  is passed in here, and it will be ignored or it will be stripped apart;  and we will be asking the Senate to do what we should have done in the  first place: taking these things in a logical, sequential way, trying  to solve some of the major problems that are there.   And reauthorizing something that is already in existence doesn't need  to actually be something we spend our time doing that particular thing.   So, actually, in the spirit of Christmas, you'll be sorry if you are  actually going to vote for this. Only if you spell ``you'll,'' Y-U-L-E,  and then it can be a pun.   Is the gentleman satisfied?   Madam Chair, this is fun.   This is not a solution. This is not a vision. This is not anything  that really moves us forward. This is something that should have and  could have been done in a much, much better way.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I first want to thank the Democrats for at least not  wasting our time by debating all of these amendments individually. But,  once again, within the pockets you will find some good things and some  not so good things that are part of what is going on here.   For example, there will be within that list some blanket waivers for  Federal cost-sharing requirements. It is not a good idea to do it.   There are some stand-alone bills that are in there that have no  regular order consideration in this House. It is also not a good  process to go through.   But if we are going to throw regular order out the window and address  20 amendments all at once that don't really have that significant of a  change or an impact, at least we are doing this in the most efficient  and effective way that we possibly could. It is not necessarily making  a bill, it is not really going anywhere better, but at least we are  getting stuff done so we can say we have the illusion of activity on  the floor.   Madam Chair, I urge rejection of the en bloc, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate especially the ability  of putting all these amendments into en bloc to help move this process  along. I am just looking at some of the issues that have been brought  up already, and I am looking at the list of the Federal grants and the  agencies that are already spending their money on these approaches.   If the issue is, obviously, you want more money spent on those  programs, that is not an authorization that we are doing here. That is  an appropriations issue. Go to the Appropriations Committee and talk  about how that fits into the overall budget.   This does not necessarily move us forward, but at least we are not  spending as much time as we would if we addressed each of these  individually.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I actually don't have great  pleasure in doing that because Mr. Brown is a vital member of our  committee, does a great job, and defends his State brilliantly. I  appreciate him doing that.   But, once again, the process we are doing is adding another new  taxpayer program that already has existing programs in effect, and is  actually a stand-alone bill that has not received a hearing, a markup,  or a CBO score, and adding that to this, because this is, once again,  the only train in town and we are not taking time to do these things  individually as we ought to.   But when it comes to oyster research, which is extremely important, I  recognize fully, as you see by the chart the total numbers in each of  these years, starting in fiscal year 2014, are how much had been given  to this particular program.   In 2018, it was $617 million in funds from all of the different  government agencies that actually participate. That includes  Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, and EPA  for watershed restoration.   NOAA does have a Chesapeake Bay office. They provide research. They  provide grants to both Maryland and Virginia. Last year, they also  provided a grant to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to add these programs  in there.   What we are trying to say here is, it is already being done.   Now, if this is a problem of not enough money going into there, as  some of the other speakers have said, well, that is not an issue of  authorization. The authorization authority exists. That is a question  of how much we are actually appropriating, which is an entirely  different issue, which you should go to the Appropriations Committee to  see if you actually want that number higher.   But, actually, the Federal Government does do this, and they are  increasing with it. There is not a problem that needs authorization. If  you need more money, that is an appropriations issue. This,  unfortunately, is not about appropriations. This is about  authorization.   So I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland. I appreciate his  interest. I appreciate this issue. But it is already being done by  other agencies. There is no need for another entity to enter into this  particular market.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is, once again, where we have  the same situation that the issue and the problem of which the  gentleman from Florida speaks is real and it is there. The concept is  it is already also being addressed. These are the kinds of programs  that already exist to do exactly what the gentleman wishes to do.   Nonetheless, this amendment would authorize a duplicative program  that would cost $114 million if it were actually implemented. But just  because we pass the amendment doesn't mean the money is there to  implement the program.   So much of the opposition and so many of the complaints that we have  been hearing are that there is not enough money appropriated to do it.  The $114 million doesn't exist until there is an appropriation to  actually go about that concept.   Here is where the problem lies for all of these amendments that we  are going to be hearing for this entire process. The bill is the  Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, passed in  1998, which already provides the legal authority and the funding  level--not necessarily the appropriation but the legal, authorized  funding level--for algae bloom prevention and control.   In addition--in addition to these activities--and they are being  conducted by NOAA, USGS, NASA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and EPA--it  is the  [[Page H9996]]  concept we have been saying all along, this entire concept of this  package that we are bringing in here is stuff that is trying to  highlight another issue and another problem which may be, in this case,  a legitimate issue and problem, but fails to realize it is already  covered.   Mr. Chairman, you don't need a duplicative program to do what we are  already doing. If you want more money for it, that is another issue,  and that doesn't take place in these authorizations. That takes place  in appropriations. But we are already doing it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although, in all fairness, I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this adds a finding to it. It  doesn't have any cost. This is not a duplicative program because it is  a finding, so I support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, we, once again, are in the same  situation. This is not a bad idea, and it is not a bad concept. In  fact, it is such a good concept, we are already doing it.   So, if I quote NOAA in their testimony in our committee, the agency  currently provides financial and technical assistance to coastal  communities for the use of living shorelines through existing programs.  The program already has $300 million that is going in there, and it is  going through those areas, including the Interior, NOAA, Fish and  Wildlife, EPA, Science Foundation, United States Fish and Wildlife  Service, and the Department of Agriculture.   All of those are providing funds for this very thing, which means it  is happening. You don't need to add this language to have it happen,  Mr. Chairman, because it already is happening.   By adding the language, I guess, well, you get to add another line in  the code, and you can say you passed something. But the bottom line is  it still is an unnecessary amendment to an unnecessary bill because the  authority and the authorization is already there.   The only thing that might not be there is, once again, you don't  think it  [[Page H9997]]  is spending enough money, in which case that is an appropriations  issue, not an authorization issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would actually ask to claim the  time in opposition, though, once again, I am not really opposed to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is one of those elements  which, once again, the gentlewoman raises an issue that I think is  right, it is good, and it is appropriate; and the idea that we should  make sure these considerations take effect is an appropriate thing.   The concept, once again, but the problem is there is nothing that  prohibits that from being done, and, indeed, it is being done even as  we speak, but you want to reemphasize it.   Once again, we should be taking military consideration into  everything we are doing, not just this particular amendment. But it is  the right concept there. It is why I am not really opposed to this. It  is the right thing to do.   Actually, it is such a right thing to do, we should have been  spending our time doing the NDAA, which is much more successful and  much more important to the military. That should have been passed  months ago. That is how important this particular topic is.   I am not really opposed to it. It is, once again, redundant, and we  are already doing that. There is nothing that stops us from doing that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chair, let's just say this: In concept once  again, regardless of how one votes on this amendment, the issue is  still significant. The issue is still being covered. The issue is  already being done. There is a redundancy in some elements to it, but  it is a redundancy for a good cause.   Mr. Chair, I am not going to vote against it, but, once again, we are  doing it. We are doing it already, that is what we are doing with the  entire package that we are debating. We are doing it already.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
