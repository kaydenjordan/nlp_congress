 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for allowing me the  time.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2954, the Securing a Strong  Retirement Act. I am grateful for the bipartisan collaboration to  produce this legislation that makes commonsense improvements to our  Nation's retirement system.   There are far too many challenges today that prevent workers from  having access to secure retirement benefits and information to protect  their hard-earned savings.   I also appreciate the inclusion of the provisions of my legislation,  the Pension Risk Transfer Accountability Act, which requires the  Department of Labor to review existing rules on pension risk transfers.   A promise made should be a promise kept for all workers and retirees.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation to further  ensure that workers can retire with dignity, security, and peace of  mind.
