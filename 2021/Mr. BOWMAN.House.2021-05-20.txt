 Madam Speaker, the violence that is unfolding in  Palestine and Israel is tragic and urgent. I rise today to voice my  strong support for a swift cease-fire.   I have heard directly from my constituents in New York's 16th  Congressional District. Parents with children living in both Israel and  Palestine have written in, and their fear for their children's safety  is palpable.   Their voices are with me today and have made this situation personal.  This is the worst escalation of violence in the region in years.   I have continually called for President Biden to step in and rapidly  broker a cease-fire to deescalate the situation, end the occupation,  and finally find peace.   To that end, I will introduce a resolution calling for an immediate  cease-fire and diplomatic efforts to resume in earnest, which is a  resolution Senator Sanders has led in the Senate. We have to do more.  We must do more.                            ____________________
