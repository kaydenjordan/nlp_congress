 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res 397) solemnly reaffirming the  commitment of the United States to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization's principle of collective defense as enumerated in Article  5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 397         Whereas more than 250,000 Americans died in the Second       World War to liberate Europe from the scourge of genocidal       fascism;        Whereas in the wake of the cataclysm of the Second World       War, the United States, Canada, and European partners founded       the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Washington       in 1949;        Whereas the foundation of NATO is collective defense as       enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty which       states that, ``The Parties agree that an armed attack against       one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be       considered an attack against them all.'';        Whereas NATO is one of the most successful military       alliances in history, deterring the outbreak of another world       war, protecting the territorial integrity of its members, and       seeing the Cold War through to a peaceful conclusion;        Whereas Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty has only       been invoked once in history when alliance members came to       the aid of the United States following the terrorist attacks       of September 11, 2001;        Whereas NATO allies and partners, including Canada and       countries in Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, including       countries of the Western Balkans, and the former Soviet Union       have stood alongside the United States in joint operations in       the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere around       the globe;        Whereas NATO remains the foundation of United States       foreign policy of promoting a Europe that is whole, free, and       at peace;        Whereas at the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO leaders agreed       that each alliance member would spend at least two percent of       its nation's gross domestic product on defense by 2024;        Whereas multiple Presidents have reaffirmed the commitment       of the United States to the collective defense guarantees in       Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty; and        Whereas the Constitution of the United States grants       Congress the sole power to declare war: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) solemnly reaffirms the commitment of the United States       to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's principle of       collective defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North       Atlantic Treaty;        (2) strongly supports the decision at the NATO Wales Summit       in 2014 that each alliance member would spend at least two       percent of its nation's gross domestic product on defense by       2024;        (3) condemns any threat to the sovereignty, territorial       integrity, freedom and democracy of any NATO ally; and        (4) welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as the 29th member       of the NATO Alliance.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi.  I want to thank Leader McCarthy and Minority Whip Hoyer for their  leadership on this important resolution and, of course, Ranking Member  Engel, who has also been a strong supporter of the NATO alliance.   Mr. Speaker, in 1949, 12 free, democratic nations bound themselves  together in an unprecedented defense alliance, the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization. These founding members acted in the aftermath of  the Second World War to promote peace in Europe, to promote their  freedom, and to face the threats they saw emerging on the horizon. Now,  more than six decades later, this alliance has been the cornerstone of  transatlantic security, and it has attracted other freedom-loving  democratic nations to join its ranks.   Of course, article 5's principle of collective defense has been key  to the success of the alliance, and we will not forget how the United  States has benefited from that principle as NATO members unanimously  elected to come to our support after the terrorist attacks on September  11, 2001.   Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks,  nonconventional attacks by terrorist groups against our people, these  are threats that NATO's founders could not have anticipated, yet they  are the challenges that we must act now to address. We are stronger, no  question, when we act together.   Now, Moscow's strategic objective is to break apart the NATO alliance  to boost Russian geopolitical influence in Western Europe. In light of  this, it is even more important that NATO members meet the standard of  investing 2 percent of their GDP on defense. We appreciate the few who  already meet the minimum requirement: Estonia, Greece, Poland, and the  U.K. At the administration's urging, others have stepped up their game,  such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania, but others have further to go.   This resolution calls on NATO members to meet these commitments while  also reaffirming our commitment to NATO and to the article 5 provision  for collective defense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee  on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a coauthor of this  resolution, I also want to thank the other coauthors, including Steve  Cohen of Tennessee, who has been a leader on NATO issues.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say, for the advancement of our own  security, the promotion of our values, and  [[Page H5214]]  a strong statement of support for our friends and allies, I urge my  colleagues to support passage of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 351) condemning the violence and  persecution in Chechnya, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 351         Whereas, on April 1, 2017, the Russian newspaper Novaya       Gazeta reported that authorities in Chechnya, a republic of       the Russian Federation, had abducted, detained, and tortured       over 100 men due to their actual or suspected sexual       orientation;        Whereas multiple independent and first-hand accounts have       subsequently corroborated the Novaya Gazeta report, and       describe a campaign of persecution by Chechen officials       against men due to their actual or suspected sexual       orientation;        Whereas, as a result of this persecution, at least three       deaths have been reported and many individuals have been       forced to flee Chechnya;        Whereas Chechen officials have denied the existence of such       persecution, including through a statement by the spokesman       for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov that ``You cannot arrest or       repress people who don't exist in the republic.'';        Whereas the same spokesman for Ramzan Kadyrov has also       stated that ``If such people existed in Chechnya, law       enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own       relatives would have sent them to where they could never       return,'' and credible reports indicate that Chechen       authorities have encouraged families to carry out so-called       ``honor killings'' of relatives due to their actual or       suspected sexual orientation;        Whereas Chechnya is a constituent republic of the Russian       Federation and subject to its laws, and Ramzan Kadyrov was       installed as the leader of Chechnya by Russian President       Vladimir Putin;        Whereas Chechen authorities have a long history of       violating the fundamental human rights of their citizens,       including through extrajudicial executions, forced       disappearances, and torture of government critics;        Whereas Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed reports       of persecution in Chechnya and termed them ``phantom       complaints'';        Whereas Russia's Human Rights Ombudsman, Tatyana       Moskalkova, has also claimed that such reports should not be       believed because formal complaints have not been registered       with the appropriate authorities;        Whereas the Russian Federation is a participating State of       the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and a       signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and       thus has agreed to guarantee the fundamental human rights of       all of its citizens;        Whereas, on April 7, 2017, the United States Department of       State issued a statement saying ``We categorically condemn       the persecution of individuals based on their sexual       orientation'' and urging the Government of the Russian       Federation to take steps to ensure the release of all those       wrongfully detained in Chechnya, and to conduct a credible       investigation of the reports; and        Whereas, on April 17, 2017, United States Ambassador to the       United Nations Nikki Haley issued a statement saying       ``Chechen authorities must immediately investigate these       allegations, hold anyone involved accountable, and take steps       to prevent future abuses. We are against all forms of       discrimination, including against people based on sexual       orientation. When left unchecked, discrimination and human       rights abuses can lead to destabilization and conflict.'':       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the violence and persecution in Chechnya and       calls on Chechen officials to immediately cease the       abduction, detention, and torture of individuals on the basis       of their actual or suspected sexual orientation, and hold       accountable all those involved in perpetrating such abuses;        (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       protect the human rights of all its citizens, condemn the       violence and persecution, investigate these crimes in       Chechnya, and hold accountable all those involved in       perpetrating such abuses;        (3) calls on the United States Government to continue to       condemn the violence and persecution in Chechnya, demand the       release of individuals wrongfully detained, and identify       those individuals whose involvement in this violence       qualifies for the imposition of sanctions under the Sergei       Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law       112-208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note) or the Global Magnitsky Human       Rights Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328); and        (4) affirms that the rights to freedom of assembly,       association, and expression and freedom from extrajudicial       detention and violence are universal human rights that apply       to all persons, and that countries that fail to respect these       rights jeopardize the security and prosperity of all their       citizens.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and  [[Page H5215]]  include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the ruler of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, rules a  dictatorship of medieval brutality. Those who challenge or simply  displease him often disappear in that country, or they are murdered  outright.   His latest campaign of persecution is aimed at gay men and women, and  those perceived to be gay, who have been abducted, tortured, and even  killed, with many others that are forced to flee the country. When the  Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reported these atrocities, his  spokesmen dismissed the accusations, saying that such people ``don't  even exist in the republic,'' and then threatened the journalists who  brought the story to light.   Caught unaware by the unexpected publicity, Chechen authorities have  choked off independent sources of information. We do not know the exact  status of this campaign or its many victims, but there is no doubt that  the situation there for sexual minorities in general has long been, and  remains, oppressive.   Disturbing reports indicate that Kadyrov has now turned his focus  from abducting and torturing gay men and women to pressuring their  families to murder them through so-called honor killings of these men  and women. This is despicable.   Vladimir Putin deserves some of the blame here. Chechnya is a  constituent republic of the Russian Federation, of which he is the  President. As such, he has a sworn responsibility to ensure that the  Russian Constitution is fully implemented, which, at least on paper,  professes to guarantee basic rights for all citizens. Russia is also a  signatory to many international agreements that formally commit it to  protecting a broad array of human rights.   Yet the Russian Government's response has been largely dismissive, if  not two-faced. Kremlin spokesmen have called the reports phantom  complaints, yet also recommended that victims report grievances to the  Chechen authorities accused of carrying out the attacks. And, of  course, there has been no criticism of Kadyrov in the Russian state- controlled media--barely even a mention of the issue.   That is why this resolution is of such importance. By shining a light  on these crimes in this dark corner, we seek to give hope to those who  otherwise may have none at all. And we say unequivocally, to Kadyrov,  and to Putin, that these atrocities are in plain view, and that their  cowardly and evasive responses are not fooling anyone.   I want to thank Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen, the author of this  resolution, and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership on this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and, of course, the author of this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this bill, I, again, thank  Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen. I thank Ranking Member Engel, as well  as Representatives Darrell Issa, David Cicilline, Chris Smith, and  Gerry Connolly for their important work on this resolution.   The abduction, torture, and targeted killings that we are seeing in  Chechnya are an affront to the core universal values that all nation- states must strive to protect. The U.S. has a long history of speaking  out on behalf of persecuted minorities, and that is what we are doing  here today.   We cannot end injustice everywhere, but we can expose it. We can  bring it to the world's attention and, in so doing, give hope to its  innocent victims.   I ask all Members to speak clearly and to speak unanimously in  condemning this violence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
