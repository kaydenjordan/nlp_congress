 Mr. Speaker, it was a year ago this very day that  Republicans in this House voted to eliminate healthcare for millions of  Americans, something we knew at that point, if it went through, would  increase premiums on millions of other Americans that still had  coverage. And after that vote, they all boarded a bus and went over to  the White House for a big celebration.   Thankfully, that bill never became law, because had it become law,  people would not have been protected with health insurance if they had  a preexisting condition. There would have been a terrible age tax  imposed on people ages 50-64. It would have been a massive step in the  wrong direction.   Despite the fact that that legislation did not become law, we are  still seeing premium increases because of the undermining of the law of  the land. The Affordable Care Act has been undermined by the Trump  administration and by action by this Congress, and because of that, we  are seeing premium increases again.   Forever, we heard from the other side criticisms of premium increases  that were more in line with inflation in healthcare. Now, in Michigan,  we see a 28-percent increase under this administration. Where is the  outrage?   We ought to work together to fix the problem. The Affordable Care Act  is not perfect. I am the first to admit it. Let's stop undermining the  law and make it work.                            ____________________
