 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the  National Quantum Initiative Act.   H.R. 6227 coordinates a Federal program to accelerate quantum  research and development for the economic and national security of the  United States.   Quantum technology is a field positioned to fundamentally change the  way we move and process data. Theoretically, quantum computing could  allow for the solutions to exponentially large problems, things that  cannot be accomplished by even the fastest supercomputers today.   It could allow us, Mr. Speaker, to visualize the structures of  complex chemicals and materials, to model highly detailed flows of  potential mass evacuations with precise accuracy--with hurricanes  abounding today, that is very, very important for us--and to quantify  subatomic interactions on the cutting edge of nuclear research.   Quantum computing may also have profound implications for  cybersecurity technology. And the gentlewoman from Texas alluded to  this: Should China and Russia beat us to achieving quantum encryption,  our current security encryption measures would be rendered obsolete.  You heard Chairman Smith, in his remarks, say that we could possibly  decode their encryptions in a matter of seconds, if not minutes.   It is absolutely imperative, Mr. Speaker, that the U.S. maintain its  leadership in this field. In order to achieve this kind of  revolutionary improvement in technology, we need foundational knowledge  in the advanced computing and materials science required to construct  those quantum systems.    The Department of Energy, the DOE, Office of Science is the leading  Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and robust  quantum technology research. At Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, the  National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC, allows  scientists to run simulations of quantum architectures.   At Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Nanoscale Materials,  researchers study atomic-scale materials in order to engineer the  characteristics of quantum information systems; and at Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory, scientists are applying their experience in  high-energy physics to the study of quantum materials.   Earlier this year, I was privileged to invite several of my  colleagues to join me on a visit to Argonne and Fermi labs, and we had  the privilege of speaking with those very scientists conducting this  groundbreaking research. It really is breathtaking and really is  ground-shattering, if you ask me, in what it is going to do for  science.   Support for basic research in computer science and for computational  partnerships between industry, academia, and the national labs is  absolutely necessary to develop the technology needed for future  commercial quantum systems. For these reasons, I encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6227.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy  Research and Innovation Act.   H.R. 589 provides policy direction to the Department of Energy on  basic science research and coordination, and implements important  reforms to DOE national laboratory management that will modernize the  research pipeline.   This legislation gives Congress the opportunity to enact energy  research and development policy that prioritizes critical programs at  the Department of Energy. From advanced scientific computing to nuclear  physics to fusion energy science, focusing on basic research at our  national labs provides the best opportunity for U.S. economic growth  and technology innovation.   Significant investments, Mr. Speaker, in basic science research by  foreign countries like China, as has been alluded to, threatens  America's global standing as the leader in scientific knowledge. To  maintain our competitive advantage as a world leader in science, we  must continue to support the research and research infrastructure that  will lead to the next generation of energy technologies.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Johnson and many of my Science Committee colleagues for cosponsoring  this very important legislation. I am grateful for the opportunity to  work with members of this committee to guide research that will help  America compete around the world and be the leader around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  589.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 97) to enable civilian research and development of  advanced nuclear energy technologies by private and public  institutions, to expand theoretical and practical knowledge of nuclear  physics, chemistry, and materials science, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 97         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of S. 97, the Nuclear Energy  Innovation Capabilities Act. I want to thank Senator Crapo, Senator  Whitehouse, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Booker,  [[Page H8238]]  as well as Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith for cosponsoring  this important legislation, and for their years of leadership in  advocating for nuclear energy research and development.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to work alongside my  Senate counterparts to prioritize fundamental research that will  support nuclear innovation and keep America safe, independent, and most  importantly, globally competitive.   I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee who have worked alongside of me with advancing  this legislation.   The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I introduced in  the 114th Congress and the 115th Congress, provides updated statutory  direction to the Department of Energy's nuclear research activities to  ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources  are not wasted.   Mr. Speaker, this bill lays out a clear set of parameters and a  definite timeline for DOE to complete an advanced research reactor  facility, which is a crucial part of ensuring innovative materials and  nuclear fuels R&D can take place right here in the United States  instead of overseas.   While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy  research must be validated through direct experimentation in the lab.  This type of research requires access to a source of fast neutrons, and  today, these are only available for civilian research in Russia.   The versatile neutron source authorized in this bill will provide the  United States with this vital capability. S. 97 also directs DOE to  partner with industry to construct and operate reactor prototypes at  DOE national labs.   Mr. Speaker, our national labs provide a very unique environment that  safely allows for creative testing and development for advanced nuclear  technology without a burdensome regulatory process that can slow  progress to a crawl. In order to maintain our nuclear capabilities, the  United States must continue developing cutting-edge technology right  here at home.   Without the direction provided in this bill, Mr. Speaker, we will  continue to rely on foreign research. We will fall further and further  behind. We will lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear  technology and be left importing next-generation reactor designs from  overseas. This is unacceptable.   S. 97 will maintain America's ability to influence security and  proliferation standards around the world as more developing nations  look to nuclear energy to grow their economies.   The language in this bill is the product of many Science, Space, and  Technology Committee engagements with relevant stakeholders and nuclear  research and development.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress this language passed the House three times  as a standalone bill, with the House amendment to S. 2012 and in the  NDAA, each with overwhelming bipartisan support.   This language also has a history of strong support in the Senate. It  passed as an amendment in the Senate during the 114th Congress and  again as a standalone bill this Congress.   S. 97 is vital to ensure that this important research and development  is carried out. We cannot afford to miss the economic opportunity  provided by next-generation nuclear technology.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting S.  97, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the great  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   S. 97 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in nuclear research  and development. By harnessing the expertise and unique capabilities of  our Nation's national labs, universities, and entrepreneurs, American  industry can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced  nuclear technology for the next generation.   I especially thank my colleagues in the Senate and on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee who have worked hard to get this  legislation passed: Senators Crapo, Whitehouse, Murkowski, and Booker,  and, of course, Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith, as well as  my other colleagues. I also thank the dozens of researchers and  stakeholders who provided critical feedback over the past several years  as we have been developing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
