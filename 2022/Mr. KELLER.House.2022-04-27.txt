 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Congressional Western  Caucus, we were hosted by Congressmen August Pfluger and Jodey  Arrington recently in west Texas. We went there to explore, as they say  it, food, fiber, and fuel.   I am going to talk a little bit about the fuel part of that trip and  how west Texas is poised to really contribute to America's energy  dominance. Just like northeastern Pennsylvania, west Texas' energy is  world class. We toured oil and gas drilling sites on the Permian Basin  and heard from producers about some of the cutting-edge solutions they  are implementing to reduce carbon emissions and get American energy to  market more cleanly and efficiently.   From Midland, Texas, to Montrose, Pennsylvania, and much of the land  in between, America is blessed with an abundance of natural resources.  American energy--oil and natural gas--is right beneath our feet, ready  to power our Nation and the world.   Instead of embracing this fact, President Biden has thrust our Nation  into an energy crisis by tying the hands of America's energy producers.  This administration has made it very clear where it stands on the  future of American energy.   Make no mistake: American oil and natural gas is the key to lowering  prices at the pump, stopping inflation, and building a stronger  workforce. It all starts with harnessing American energy, from west  Texas to northeast Pennsylvania, but that is only possible if this  administration gets out of the way and allows American producers to  take the lead.
