 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Kenneth Burkett, a Jefferson County resident, for  receiving the Crabtree Award from the Society for American Archaeology.   This award is given annually to an outstanding avocational  archaeologist in remembrance of Don Crabtree. Mr. Crabtree brought  experimental archaeology to prominence.   Recipients of the Crabtree Award are archaeologists who have  contributed to advance the understanding of local, regional, and  national archaeology  [[Page H1316]]  through excavation, research, publication, site preservation, or  collections preservation, all in collaboration with the professional  community or public outreach.   This award is well deserved for Kenneth, as he has spent his career  conducting archaeological research and excavations in western  Pennsylvania, focusing on the lifeways of prehistoric Native Americans  who once lived in the Redbank Creek watershed.   Kenneth is currently the executive director of the Jefferson County  History Center as well as a field associate with the Carnegie Museum of  Natural History. He spends time working closely with the Society for  Pennsylvania Archaeology 29th Chapter, located in North Fork.   Kenneth has a true passion for bringing our history to life and  sharing the artifacts of the people who walked this Earth before us.   Once again, I want to congratulate Kenneth on this well-deserved  accomplishment.                            ____________________
