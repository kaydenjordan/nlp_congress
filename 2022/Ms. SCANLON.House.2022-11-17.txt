 Madam Speaker, I rise today during National Survivors of  Homicide Victims Awareness Month, a time when the pain and grief of  loss should be honored with action, to read the words and the plea of a  heartbroken mother and a Pennsylvania 5 constituent, Molly Collington,  who lost her son, Sam, to gun violence a year ago on November 28, 2021.   By all accounts, Sam Collington was a remarkable young man who left  an outsized impact on our community.   His mother, Molly, shared her story with me earlier this fall when I  met with her and her colleagues at Delaware County's Moms Demand Action  chapter. I was deeply moved by her advocacy in the face of unimaginable  loss and grief, and I am sharing her words with her permission now.   ``My name is Molly Collington. I am Sam Collington's brokenhearted  mother.   ``Sam was the best son any mother could ever ask for. He was kind,  smart, reliable, and without a doubt, one of the funniest people to  ever walk this Earth.   ``Sam was murdered on November 28, 2021. The day began with Sam  loading up his father's car with clean laundry, some leftover turkey,  and supplies to carry him through the rest of the semester.   ``He was returning to his apartment at Temple University after the  Thanksgiving weekend. He planned to drop the items off at his  apartment, then return home to watch HBO with me, sleep in his own bed,  and then take the train back to school Monday morning. That did not  happen.   ``Because on his street, near his apartment, was a career criminal  with an illegal gun waiting to steal the car of the next person that  drove down the street. The next person was my Eagle Scout son, Sam. Sam  was shot four times and died less than 30 minutes later at Temple  Hospital.   ``Sam was so knowledgeable about our country and all its history. He  knew every single President and could talk for hours about politics. So  it was no surprise when he told his father and I that he wanted to  study political science at Temple University after high school. His  fervor for politics and government started very young. He proudly  served as his high school's president for his junior and senior year.   ``During his time at Temple, he served as the president of the  Political Science Society, never missing an opportunity to make each  day count.   ``He planned to attend law school and study constitutional law. He  was an activist.   ``He campaigned for local politicians and interned at city hall where  he worked with elections. He was responsible for getting hundreds of  people  [[Page H8549]]  registered to vote, on and off campus. He was a poll watcher.   ``He even went on a `Bernie Journey' where he rode with fellow Temple  students on a schoolbus to North and South Carolina to campaign for his  favorite politician, Bernie Sanders.   ``Sam truly believed in the `not me, us' mantra, which is why he was  so outspoken in his love of politics and striving for a better world.   ``Sam had a larger-than-life personality. As one of his professors  pointed out: `It is impossible to be involved in the Political Science  Department and not know Sam Collington.'   ``He became known on campus as `Poly-Sci Sam.'   ``To lose a child is the greatest pain any parent can ever  experience. Every day, my heart breaks all over again. To lose a child  like Sam, knowing that he was destined for something big, is absolutely  soul-crushing. How his father, sister, and I are still standing seems  impossible to believe. He made us better people just by knowing him. We  are destroyed without him, his cheerfulness, his wit, and his  intelligence.   ``One of the hardest parts is knowing my son's murder was  preventable. Our children should be able to go to school safely. We  should not have to worry about making sure they know where the closest  exits are at the movie theaters, supermarkets, concerts, and churches.   ``I implore our elected officials to do more to keep guns out of the  wrong hands.   ``We must do better. We have to do better. We are failing our  children.   ``They say time heals all wounds, but I can tell you without any  doubt whatsoever, not this one.''                            ____________________
