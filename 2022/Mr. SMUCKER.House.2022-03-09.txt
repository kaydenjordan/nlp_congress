 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start my comments by saying that I  really do believe that there is no daylight between our parties on our  commitment to cripple Putin's ability to wage war in Ukraine. We stand  with the people of Ukraine, Democrats and Republicans alike.   I want to thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady for putting  together a strong bill to stop financing Putin's aggression. This was a  bill that was bipartisan and bicameral that would have stopped  providing financial support to Russia and put an end to importing  Russian oil. Unfortunately, that bill that they worked so hard on is  not the bill that we are debating here tonight.   Now, I plan to vote in support of this bill because I believe it is  important that we stand with Ukraine. But I want to make it clear to  the White House and to Democratic leadership: You know that we could  have done better, yet for some reason, the White House intervened, and  I don't understand.   I would like someone to answer the question: Why are we running a  product that replaced another product that would have put an end to  favored-trade status for Russia and Belarus? Why are we voting on a  product that will not be taken up by the Senate?   We had a better deal.
