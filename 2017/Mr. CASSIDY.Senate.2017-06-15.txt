 Mr. President, one of the things we are debating right  now is, What is the future of the Affordable Care Act or, I should say,  healthcare in the United States? One thing we can all agree to is that  the individual market under the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as  it is commonly called--is not doing well.   I will put up this Facebook post from a constituent in Louisiana  named Brian. He wrote in to say:         My family plan is $1,700 a month. Me, my wife, and 2       children. The ACA has brought me to my knees.    He doesn't say this, but we know that, most likely, his family  deductible is $13,000.         I hope we can get something done. . . . The middle class is       dwindling away. Can everyone just come together and figure       this out?    So his family is putting out $20,000 a year for insurance. They most  likely have a $13,000 family deductible. They have two children, a  young family, $33,000 of out-of-pocket expenses before they would see  significant benefit from their policy. Clearly, we have a problem.   When he was campaigning, Candidate Trump recognized this, and he said  over and over that his contract with the voters was to maintain  coverage, lower premiums, address and care for those with preexisting  conditions, and to eliminate the ObamaCare mandates. This, if you will,  was his contract with the voters--a pretty good contract. I think it is  something both parties can get behind.   Candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump doubled down on this  just before taking the oath of office, saying: ``People covered under  the law''--meaning the law that he would support to replace the  Affordable Care Act--``can expect to have great healthcare. It will be  in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.''    Indeed, the President of the United States seemed, again, to renew  this commitment this past week at a lunch with 15 Senators at the White  House, once more saying how we have to have a law that lowers premiums  and cares for those with preexisting conditions.   That is the baseline. Some would argue, has President Trump committed  himself to some right that previously did not exist that all Americans  would have healthcare?   I am a physician, a doctor. I worked in a public hospital for the  uninsured for so long. I can tell you, Congress created a right to  healthcare when it passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor  Act. I think President Clinton was the one who signed it into law. This  said that anyone--whether they were a U.S. citizen or not--could come  to an emergency room and receive all the care they needed, and if they  could not pay, they would still receive care.   Whenever somebody says ``My gosh, folks don't have a right to  healthcare,'' I note that when I was in the emergency room at 2 o'clock  in the morning, as long as those emergency door rooms were open, there  were people coming through. They would have congestive heart failure,  COPD, diabetes out of control, gunshot wounds, or vomiting blood. They  could be schizophrenic or a drug overdose. As long as  [[Page S3549]]  that patient or those patients came through the door, we treated them,  and someone paid.   I would say that it is the fiscally conservative way that if Congress  is going to say ``My gosh, everybody has a right to healthcare,'' then  we should come up with a considered way to pay for it, as opposed to  forcing the hospital to shift the cost of this care to other sources-- principally, by the way, small businesses paying higher premiums for  their employees, higher rates to pay for the uninsured. The fiscally  conservative way is ``Let's address these needs.''   As a physician, I will also say that the best business practice ways  to address somebody with chronic health conditions is to actually  manage the disease. If you have a diabetic who doesn't have insurance,  she may come to the hospital once a month with diabetes out of control.  You have to start an IV and put her in the hospital, perhaps overnight,  sometimes in the hospital for longer. This can cost thousands of  dollars. Contrast this with having that patient with a primary care  physician so that you can manage her disease. Not only is her health  better, but you spend a lot less money.   In fact, the wisest corporations in our country now consider the  health of their employees as a cost center. What can we do to have the  best outcomes at the lowest price? This is the most fiscally  conservative way. I think that is the approach we should take as a  country.   This brings us to the next point. How do we achieve that which  President Trump suggested, which was that we would maintain coverage,  lower premiums, care for those with preexisting conditions, and  eliminate mandates in a way that we could achieve it? Some folks say  that you cannot achieve this. I disagree with this.   The way to achieve it is to embrace each of President Trump's goals.  Susan Collins and four other Senators and I have put forward a bill  called the Patient Freedom Act. In the Patient Freedom Act, the  approach we take is to first maintain the coverage President Trump  spoke of, but we do it by eliminating mandates. We give the States the  options of doing something called automatic enrollment. It means it is  easy to be enrolled.   On our income taxes, for example, Republicans have always said: We  want to make it easy to pay your taxes--not 16 pages of forms that you  have to fill out with a CPA and an attorney but, rather, something you  can do on one page. We need to make enrollment in insurance easy.   The second thing--if you can expand the enrollment, we can take from  what we know works, which is on Medicare. When someone turns 65, he or  she is automatically on Medicare. They don't have to fill out a bunch  of forms online. Rather, they are just on Medicare. They get a card.  Here is your Medicare card. You are in unless you don't want to be.   If you don't want to be, we make it easy to get out. You just call up  and say: I don't want to be on Medicare. And you are not. It turns out  that 99 percent of Americans like this simple approach, and they stay  on Medicare.   We could expand coverage and make it simple, still eliminating  mandates by giving States the option to say to their residents, you are  in unless you are out. We are going to make it simple.   If you are eligible for this credit, you would get the credit. And  unless you call us up and say that you don't want it, you would be  enrolled in an insurance program.   In this way, we care for those with preexisting conditions. How is  that the case? If you have a few sick people in the insurance pool,  then the only people whom you can spread that risk among are the few  and the sick in the pool. Every year they pay higher and higher  premiums.   On the other hand, if you can expand the risk pool to include all the  young ``healthies''--the folks who think themselves immortal, who on an  average year may only have $500 or $800 worth of healthcare expenses-- if you can incorporate all of them in your risk pool, then the expense  of the few and the sick is spread out over the many and the healthy.  Instead of premiums rising because of one person's illness, premiums  hardly budge because the cost of that care is spread over so many.   We call it a risk pool for a reason. If you take a cup of water and  you pour it in a large swimming pool, the level of that swimming pool  does not change because that big pool absorbs the water. If you take a  cup of water and you pour it in a smaller cup of water, it overflows.   We need to make it where it is the former situation--where we have a  big risk pool with lots of young, healthy people with whom we can share  that risk over the many and not the few. In this way, we can lower  premiums.   It was modeled that if we did automatic enrollment in my State, still  maintain the enrollment of the older and the sicker who are already in,  we would lower premiums by 20 percent. That is the power of giving the  States the option to make it simpler for people to be enrolled in their  insurance.   The conservative way to approach our healthcare reform is to  recognize that President Trump's contract with the voter on the  campaign trail is the pathway to achieving his goals. As we do that in  a fiscally conservative way, we recognize that we should not move this  cost of care off to small businesses. We should go ahead and pay for  it. It is fiscally conservative to manage these patients' illnesses, as  opposed to have them going to an emergency room every so often for  emergency room care.   Lastly, we have to say that if we embrace Republican ideas of making  it simpler to be in a plan, as opposed to more complicated, we are more  likely to have that risk pool that is inclusive of many who are  healthy, not just a few who are sick.   I look forward to replacing the Affordable Care Act--the un- Affordable Care Act as it has become--with something that embraces  conservative principles and fulfills President Trump's campaign  pledges.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
