 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I can't believe we are here today attempting to pass  such a blatantly discriminatory bill. Under the guise of fighting  fraud, Republicans are attempting to pass a bill that will put  additional barriers to care for all Americans--all this in exchange for  one Member's vote for TrumpCare, which guts healthcare for 23 million  Americans, and the Republicans barely passed that bill out of the  House.   This bill fails to recognize the diversity of American families;  instead, it forces a single approach for all those who need financial  help to get the care that they need.   I don't know if everyone on the other side of the aisle knows this,  but there are already measures in place to prevent advanced premium tax  credits from going to ineligible people. There is already a mechanism  in place for Treasury to reconcile tax credits, and any undocumented  individual found to have received a subsidy must repay them in full.   The other side will also try to make the argument that this measure  will help fight fraud in the healthcare system, that there is somehow  overwhelming amounts of evidence that immigrants are the main  perpetrators of fraud. Beneficiaries struggling to access care are not  the perpetrators of fraud. These are good people trying to do right by  their families and by their country.   Of course, my colleagues over there are going to cite a Senate  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report, written  by a Republican majority, that found, ``a half a million illegal  immigrants received $750 million in healthcare subsidies.''   Well, I have that report right here in my hand, and nowhere does it  say that 500,000 undocumented immigrants received millions of dollars  in healthcare subsidies, as Mr. Barletta's press release claims. What  the report says is 500,000 individuals, and not 500,000 undocumented  individuals or any other term that Republicans like to use to disparage  immigrants.                                time  1345    There is no evidence to suggest that immigrants without authorization  to be here would take the risk of signing on to a government website to  fraudulently get healthcare coverage.   So what are the unintended consequences of this bill?   I hate to break it to my colleagues, but the people most impacted are  U.S. citizens who were born abroad or naturalized, not undocumented  individuals.   This bill is yet another example that the Republican majority will do  anything to demonize even the smallest subsection of immigrants in  order to gut healthcare for Americans and get their billionaire buddies  a big, fat tax break. Whether that means sowing fear in communities by  raiding homes in order to hunt people down or denying access to care  for legal immigrants who are entitled to care, no excuse is too  ridiculous for Republicans to attack the immigrant community.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 226  organizations in opposition to H.R. 2581.                                                      June 12, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: As national, state, and local       organizations concerned about immigrant rights or access to       affordable health care, we are writing to strongly urge you       to VOTE NO on HR 2581, the ``Verify First'' Act. This bill is       an attack on people's ability to see a doctor and on       immigrants and people of color. It is not the ``common       sense'' taxpayer protection bill that its supporters would       have you believe.        HR 2581 is a dangerous bill that puts up roadblocks for       both citizens and immigrants to obtain timely, affordable       health insurance. It would strip away provisions that provide       for a person to obtain subsidies for enrollment in an       Affordable Care Act (or the contemplated American Health Care       Act) plan while they work with Department of Health and Human       Services to verify their U.S. citizenship or immigration       status. The people most impacted are U.S. citizens who were       born abroad or naturalized. The bill also affects many       immigrants, especially those newly arrived or certain victims       of domestic violence and trafficking survivors.        The fact is that when individuals are not able to       immediately verify their citizenship or immigration status on       an Affordable Care Act Marketplace, it begins an often months       long, strenuous process of sending in documents that must be       physically inspected. Health care assisters routinely say       these clients are the hardest cases they work on because the       process for verifying citizenship and immigration status is a       time-consuming exercise in dealing with inefficient       government processes.        Rather than protect American taxpayers, HR 2581 would strip       from American taxpayers important protections that are needed       to overcome deficiencies in federal government databases.       Immigrants who are not lawfully present are categorically       barred from enrollment in health insurance on the Affordable       Care Act marketplaces, and for the subsidies that make that       insurance affordable. Moreover, safeguards protecting       taxpayers are already built into the ACA; individuals whose       citizenship or immigration status cannot be verified already       are required to pay back all of their subsidies when they       file their taxes and ``reconcile'' their premium tax credits.        Supporters of this bill cite a sloppy Senate Homeland       Security and Government Affairs Committee report that arrived       at a made-up number of supposed ``fraud.'' It's just not       true. The committee assumed that every person who lost       coverage for failure to verify their citizenship and       immigration status was undocumented. In the experience of our       organizations and organizations we work with, this is false.       These reports describe the first year of the marketplaces,       and it is well documented that system outages and       understaffing, among other technical problems, contributed to       the federal Marketplace's failure to verify consumers' status       promptly. The Department of Health and Human Services       Inspector General reported in 2014 that a cause of the delay       in verification was the agency's lack of prioritization of       this issue.        Despite huge gains since then, problems still persist. The       Social Security database holding many citizens' information       may not reflect common changes, such as when a person marries       and changes their last name, or when someone naturalizes and       gains U.S. citizenship. People lose their coverage because       they receive notices in languages they cannot read.       Immigrants are required to submit documents multiple times,       or wait while the Department of Homeland Security finds paper       files, a result of deficiencies in their databases affecting       groups like asylum applicants and some survivors of domestic       violence. These are among the many issues consumers face.        Congress has already deprived undocumented immigrants from       the ability to buy coverage, even at full price, so they can       see a doctor when they are sick, but this bill would go a       step further to delay or put out of reach affordable health       insurance for many citizens and lawfully present immigrants.       Our organizations firmly believe that this would be       detrimental to the people we represent and to all of our       communities as a whole. We have seen that when health       insurance is unaffordable, people are effectively prevented       from obtaining access to the care they need to be healthy.        This bill is not just an attack on our health care system,       it is also an attack on immigrants and people of color, which       our organizations stand firmly against. In his statements       when introducing this bill, Rep. Lou Barletta focused the       bill as part of his effort to ``stop illegal immigration.''       Rep. Barletta has a long history of anti-immigrant rhetoric,       from trying to prevent immigrants from leasing a residence to       stating that they should be denied life-saving services in       hospital emergency rooms. This bill is simply a vehicle for       scapegoating immigrants and people of color and will keep       eligible people from accessing health care.        We the undersigned organizations urge you to vote NO on HR       2581 and the continued assault on immigrants and the health       of our communities.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the majority that  the IRS would be able to do their job if they didn't spend the last 8  years demonizing the IRS and cutting their budget year after year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Levin), my colleague on the Ways and Means  Committee.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that  under the ACA, there is also a verification process for subsidies. But  I would just raise the issue that for newborn children, most of whom  don't have a Social Security number when they are newborn--and this  includes children of our military members serving overseas--if they  have a severe health problem, then delaying verification, which can be  up to 6 weeks for them, can mean the difference between life and death.  And I am talking about a situation such as that experienced by Jimmy  Kimmel, if you take the time to see his response to what happened with  his newborn.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), also a member of the  Ways and Means Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), a colleague from the  Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased at this time to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), my colleague on  the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are calling this bill  and the two other healthcare bills on the floor this week ``fixes'' for  TrumpCare. But what exactly is it that you are fixing?   This bill does nothing to address the more than 23 million  individuals who will lose their coverage or the $800 billion cut to  Medicaid under TrumpCare. Nothing in this bill will do anything to fix  the waiver allowing insurers to discriminate against individuals with  preexisting conditions by jacking up their rates, and nothing in this  bill will do anything to roll back the massive tax cut that they are  handing out to the top 400 households in America.   Instead of addressing the real issues with our healthcare system, you  bring  [[Page H4882]]  a racist bill to the floor that you use to buy a vote, literally, for  your TrumpCare bill.    Mr. Speaker, I was addressing a racist piece of  legislation that was used to buy a vote for the TrumpCare bill. But the  problem is that this bill doesn't do anything that it says it does. It  is based on a blatantly partisan Senate report that doesn't even say  what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that it says.   It is baffling how many of my Republican colleagues believe that this  report that they keep citing actually said anything about undocumented  immigrants. Did you ``read'' this report in the same way that you  ``read'' the AHCA and all of its amendments?   If you actually read the report, you would know that it does not  state that these individuals were undocumented immigrants, but only  that they did not complete the verification process. The hurdles might  have been too big, it might have taken too much time or too much  effort, and they dropped out of the verification process without  completing it.   The report also doesn't say that hundreds of thousands of  undocumented immigrants enrolled and received premium credits. The  report states that ``as of September 30, 2015, CMS awarded  approximately $750 million in advance premium tax credits to  individuals enrolled through healthcare.gov who CMS later determined to  be ineligible. . . .''   It is funny that the daughter of Mexican American immigrants is able  to read and understand the distinctions made in this report better than  some of my native-born colleagues can.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by begging my Republican colleagues to  prove to me that this bill isn't about shutting out immigrants from  access to care: legal immigrants or children of those born overseas to  our military or newborn children or victims of domestic violence or  victims of human trafficking.   Prove to me that you care about the health and wellbeing of all  Americans, regardless of the color of their skin or their economic  circumstances.   I am actually in agreement with you that ineligible individuals  should not see a single penny of the subsidies provided by both the ACA  and the AHCA, but there are protections already in place where only  citizens and people lawfully present in the United States can enroll in  marketplace coverage and get subsidies to help them pay their premiums  and cost-sharing charges.   This bill doesn't fix anything. It just seeks to further demonize  immigrants as criminals and people with my last name out of the  healthcare system.   Instead of wasting our time on a bill that is in search of a problem  to solve, a problem that doesn't even exist, let's work together to  make sure that other Americans are not caught up in the unintended  consequences of this bill and aren't denied coverage when they are  actually eligible for those subsidies and that coverage.   Let's actually work on a better way for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am opposed to the bill.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill.   If adopted, the Verify First Act will proceed to final passage as  amended.   The Democratic motion to recommit simply amends the Verify First Act  to ensure that our most vulnerable--newborns and infants--do not  experience a delay in health coverage.   We know that the citizenship of newborns can't be verified  electronically because they don't have Social Security numbers yet when  they are born. In order to verify their child's status, parents have to  send a copy of their child's birth certificate, which can take anywhere  from 1 to 6 weeks to obtain, depending on the State, and that is the  best-case scenario if the parents throw a perfect game in documenting  and planning for the arrival of their newborn. Just like any perfect  game, a little luck is involved in that.   That luck includes having the Social Security Administration process  your child's Social Security number as soon as they receive it, that  the Administration doesn't make a mistake in the spelling of your  child's name, and that you have the financial resources and education  to know exactly what steps you need to take to ensure that your newborn  has coverage the moment they come out of your womb.   When most people are anticipating the birth of a child, that is not  what they are thinking about. The birth of a child is one of life's  most precious moments. The joy you feel when you hold your child for  the first time should be the only feeling going through your mind.  Filling the paperwork out to ensure that your child is covered  shouldn't even be something that you should have to worry about.   But the Verify First Act, as currently drafted, would give you  another thing to worry about and add an unnecessary barrier for  newborns to receive the care they need. God forbid if your child needs  extra care after they are born but doesn't have coverage because your  plan is waiting to verify your child's status.   A child's life should not hang in the balance because of paperwork  and red tape. For all the claims that Republicans are the pro-life  party, they sure know how to make life difficult for a newborn as soon  as they are out of the womb. They claim to protect the lives of the  unborn and crusade against lifesaving institutions such as Planned  Parenthood. But where are their morals and love of life after the child  is born? It somehow magically disappears, and they will throw every  obstacle up to ensure that newborns don't receive the care that they  need and that they are entitled to.   Whether it is through the unintended consequences of a poorly drafted  bill such as this one, or gutting the program that covers half the  births in the U.S., Republicans will do everything to gut access to  care or place obstacles in struggling people's paths. That's right, by  cutting over $800 billion out of Medicaid, Republicans are endangering  the health and welfare of all newborn children.   Earlier I asked my Republican colleagues to prove to me that they  care about the health and well-being of all Americans regardless of the  color of their skin or their economic circumstances. Well, I am asking  them now to prove to me that they care about the well-being of newborn  children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Democratic motion  to recommit, and let us write a bill that will actually help all U.S.  citizens get the coverage that they need and are entitled to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
