 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 60 other civil  rights organizations in support of the Women's Health Protection Act.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2021.             Support the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021         Dear Representative: The Leadership Conference on Civil and       Human Rights, and the 60 undersigned organizations dedicated       to protecting and advancing the civil rights, health, and       economic security of all persons in the United States write       in support of the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 (H.R.       3755). We urge all members to vote yes on the bill when it       reaches the floor.        By protecting abortion access from medically unnecessary       restrictions that obstruct the right of all persons to obtain       safe, legal abortion services, the Women's Health Protection       Act (WHPA) seeks to remedy and prevent the onslaught of       state-level abortion bans and restrictions that cause       significant and sometimes insurmountable challenges to       receiving abortion care. These challenges disproportionately       impact the ability of low-income women and women of color to       access health care, robs individuals of bodily autonomy, and       threatens the economic security of families and individuals,       many of whom are already struggling to get by.        This issue is one of grave urgency. Just this month, five       Supreme Court justices denied an emergency request to block       Texas S.B. 8, a radical six-week abortion ban. Immediate       Congressional action is imperative for the future of abortion       rights in the United States. We are deeply concerned about       the threat of copycat bills appearing in states across the       country.        Indeed, abortion rights and access have been steadily under       attack. Despite large public support for access to abortion,       state lawmakers enacted more than 90 restrictions on abortion       this year, including 11 bans--two of which are near-total       abortion bans. States have also continued to enact or       introduce legislation that restricts access to medication       abortion, imposes medically unnecessary restrictions on       abortion clinics, or singles out abortion providers for       burdensome  [[Page H5145]]       restrictions not applied to other healthcare providers.       Today, nearly 90 percent of American counties have no       abortion provider, forcing people to incur onerous costs to       travel long distances for care, or pushing care entirely out       of reach.        These laws are not only a threat to the constitutional       right to abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade, but they are a       threat to the economic security, health, and dignity of low-      income people, women of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and       others who--because of a history of structural inequality and       discrimination--already have difficulty accessing       reproductive healthcare services. Restrictions that force       patients to undergo unnecessary tests or procedures, force       providers to communicate confusing and medically inaccurate       information, or force individuals to make multiple clinic       visits drive up individual costs, which can delay abortion       access and aggravate economic and health disparities felt by       women of color, low-income people, immigrants, LGBTQ people,       and other marginalized or multi-marginalized groups.        Restrictive abortion laws that contribute to clinic       closures and abortion deserts also increase the cost of       obtaining abortion, and Black women are impacted by clinic       closures to a greater degree than other groups. Systemic       inequality brought on by past and present policies that       target and oppress Black people--including the legacy of       slavery, mass incarceration, segregation, voter suppression,       and exploitative financial practices, such as redlining--have       led to concentrated and intergenerational poverty within the       Black community. As a result, Black women have diminished       access to networks and resources to overcome financial       obstacles to accessing care. In the context of clinic       closures or abortion deserts, this can mean a de facto ban on       abortion. Black women are half as likely to be able to travel       25 to 50 miles for abortion care than White women, who tend       to have more financial resources, information, and social       networks that allow them to travel.        Restricting access to abortion also threatens to undermine       the ability of poorer people and people of color to achieve       economic security. People of color and women are       disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs, and women of       color continue to endure discriminatory wage gaps. Black       women, for example, are typically paid just 63 cents for       every dollar paid to a White man. American Indian and Native       Alaskan women are paid only 60 cents, Latina women are paid       only 55 cents, and some Asian American and Pacific Islander       women are paid as low as 50 cents for every dollar paid to a       White man. Restrictions on accessing abortion, in addition to       public funding bans, mean that low-income people and many       women of color have to choose between paying their rent,       purchasing food, or paying for other basic necessities, and       receiving abortion care.        Studies also show that women who are denied abortion care       face more economic hardship and risks to their health and       safety than women who sought and received abortions. Women       denied abortion care are more likely to experience poor       health outcomes, including maternal death, as compared to       women who received abortions, a trend that is particularly       concerning for Black women who are up to four times more       likely to experience pregnancy-related death than White       women. Women who are denied an abortion and forced to bear a       child are also four times more likely to fall into poverty.       Conversely, abortion access has been shown to increase       women's participation in the workforce, particularly for       Black women, and has led to gains in educational attainment.        Every person deserves to have the ability to make the       healthcare decisions that are right for them, and every       person must be able to make their own decisions about having       children, free from government interference and       discrimination. Laws that restrict access to abortion cause       the most harm to those who, because of structural racism and       existing inequities, already have limited access to       resources, are already struggling to achieve economic       security, and who already face sometimes life-threatening       health disparities. At the most basic level, restrictive       abortion laws are aimed at controlling who can exercise their       constitutional rights and who can claim agency over their       bodies. As such, these laws are an affront to human dignity       that perpetuate systems of oppression that prevent the full       enjoyment of civil and human rights. The Women's Health       Protection Act is an important step in ending these harmful       laws and promoting the health, economic security, and well-      being of those whom we have forced through law and policy to       live at the margins.

Madam Speaker, in 1970 I watched the New York State  Assembly pass one of the first State laws legalizing abortion. If you  had told me then that 51 years later, I would be standing on the House  floor still fighting for women to have the right to make their own  decisions about their own lives, their own health, and their own  families, I would have called you crazy.   We must pass this bill today to end this decades-long war on abortion  and women's underlying freedom to control their own lives. I urge all  my colleagues to stand up for freedom, stand up for abortion, stand up  for bodily integrity and vote ``yes'' on this bill.
