 Mr. President, on January 25, 2021, America lost  a great patriot CPT James ``Jim'' Ronald Putek, 75, of Alpharetta, GA.  Born in Chicago, IL, Jim was a decorated Army veteran having served in  the Vietnam war, where he received the following awards: the National  Defense Service Medal, the Bronze Star with one oakleaf Cluster, the  Air Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with one Silver and one Bronze  Service Star, the Army Aviator Badge, and the Republic of Vietnam  Campaign Medal.   Captain Putek's heroism will live forever. Following his retirement  from the Army, Jim continued his passion for aviation as a commercial  airline pilot for Piedmont Airlines and US Airways.   Captain Putek is survived by his wife Tricia Putek, his sister  Delores, his sister-in-law Mary, and his nieces and nephews Hank, Gwen,  Joanne, Janet, and Jon. He was preceded in death by his parents Walter  and Frances, and his brother Henry.   Jim Putek was a fine gentleman and a true hero, respected and revered  by everyone who met him. When Captain Putek passed, we not only lost a  good man, we lost a great American.                            ____________________
