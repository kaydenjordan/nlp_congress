 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am going speak in support of S. 3201, the Temporary Reauthorization  and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. It is  a critical reauthorization. It is imperative to maintaining our  Nation's efforts to fix the opioid epidemic.   In February of 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration used its  authority--not legislative authority, but administrative authority--to  place nonscheduled fentanyl-like substances temporarily into schedule I  for a period of 2 years. We are now up against that deadline, and it is  important that we do not let this authorization lapse, as fentanyl and  its analogues are still an imminent threat to Americans.                                time  1245    The Drug Enforcement Administration testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee in June 2019 that: The positive impacts in the 15  months since this administrative scheduling change were significant.  Prior to this action, DEA observed a rapid and continuing emergence of  new fentanyl-like substances each time it scheduled a fentanyl-like  substance into schedule I.   We really cannot return to that reality. Let me speak a little bit  about what that reality is. Someone who is buying what they think is  their standard fentanyl product from an illicit Chinese chemist and now  buys a fentanyl analogue because it may not be illegal, those  additional molecules change the potency of fentanyl so that some of  these analogues are significantly more potent than the base molecule.  In a country that has suffered with an unprecedented number of drug  overdose deaths, that is a significant issue.   This Friday marks the anniversary of the United States Customs and  Border Protection seizure of a record volume of fentanyl and  methamphetamine worth almost $4.5 million at the border. These drugs  were on their way to our American communities. They were on their way  to hurt Americans.   You know, it is not lost on me the irony that the USMCA was signed  today, a bill that could have been signed many, many months ago. Now we  are doing this bill as a hurry-up, as  [[Page H650]]  a suspension. It could have been done many months ago. Congress has  been distracted with other activities, and that is incorrect.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill, and I urge its passage.
