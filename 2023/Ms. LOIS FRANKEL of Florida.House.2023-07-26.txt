 Mr. Chair, well, my, my, my, here we go  again. The Republican attacks on access to legal abortion never end.  Today, the target is women veterans, women who left their loved ones,  trained hard, sometimes risked their lives to stand up for our freedom,  and now it is time to stand up for theirs.   All women should have the freedom to make their own personal decision  about when or whether to start or grow a family. This bill would  undermine the current Biden policy that allows VA medical centers to  provide an abortion when the life or the health of the pregnant veteran  is in danger.   Republicans are willing to force women to wait until they are on  death's door to receive the healthcare that they need. Really? This is  how we thank veterans for their service?   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
