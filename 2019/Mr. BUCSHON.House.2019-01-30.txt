 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of a  great Hoosier, William R. Carteaux, the President and CEO of the  Plastics Industry Association, and a dedicated supporter of the U.S.  plastics industry which employs nearly 1 million Americans.   Mr. Carteaux passed away on December 10, 2018, after bravely fighting  leukemia. Having worked with Bill, his passion for the U.S. plastics  industry, which employs more than 50,000 Hoosiers and more than 10,000  in my district alone, was unmatched.   Bill pushed the entire industry to focus on recycling and  sustainability, bringing together industry leaders and innovators to  find effective market-based solutions to our environmental challenges.   Bill was first diagnosed with leukemia in 2016, and he set out to  beat the disease for himself and others. He eventually chaired the  Washington area Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and raised hundreds of  thousands of dollars.   The U.S. plastics industry is stronger today because of Bill's  efforts, and he will be sorely missed.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Daniele, and his two  daughters, as we honor his legacy and impact here in the House today.                            ____________________
