 Madam Speaker, I rise today because not nearly  enough is being done by our social media companies to take down  terrorist content from their platforms.   It has been months now since the Christchurch massacre which was  streamed on Facebook because its artificial intelligence, or IA, was  not able to or capable of taking it down quickly enough. Now that video  has been uploaded and re-uploaded hundreds of thousands of times.   In fact, instead of preventing terrorist content from spreading on  their platform, as reported by the Associated Press, recently, Facebook  has been making videos and promoting terrorist content on its own  system.   For instance, an al-Qaida-linked terrorist group has an auto- generated Facebook that has nearly 4,500 likes. The case was profiled  in the AP story and served as yet another glaring example of Facebook's  inability to police itself.   But what is even more striking, is that before coming to speak on the  House floor today, I checked, and this profile is still up there. This  profile that the AP reported to Facebook is still up there. Facebook  does not care right now about our own safety. They are putting their  own profit before the safety or national security of this very country.   Madam Speaker, I push for aggressive action here. We need a strong  public-private partnership, and Facebook has got to come to its senses  today. It is so important.                            ____________________
