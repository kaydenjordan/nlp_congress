 Mr. President, first, let me comment that the Senator  from Ohio is right on target. I know that when we did the authorization  bills--we actually have language now that we put in to try to encourage  people while they are still in high school to find out what they want  to do with their lives.   One of the problems we have right now is, we have a great economy-- the best economy we have had in my lifetime--but the bad side of that  is, there is a lot of competition out there, and we want to make sure  that people are directed into areas where they really can enjoy life  and where the market  [[Page S1169]]  will work in their favor. We are very much concerned about that with  the two bills we have done so far that has new language in there to  encourage people to use pilot programs in high school to know what  direction they want to go with their lives.
