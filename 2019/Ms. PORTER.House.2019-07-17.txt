 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Georgia for her  leadership on this issue and for being here tonight to talk about those  defrauded students who are being hurt and suffering around this country  and whose voices are not being heard here in Congress.    I also rise to talk about the college affordability crisis in our  country.   Next week, freshmen in college and their families will be faced with  their first tuition bill. According to the National Center for  Education Statistics, the average cost per year is just over $19,000  for a public 4-year university and nearly $40,000 for a private  university. The price tag for postsecondary education is spiraling out  of control, and the cost of college is increasing at a rate almost  eight times faster than wages.   Today, nearly 43 million Americans--that is one in six adults--have  Federal student loan debt. The Federal student loan portfolio has risen  to over $1.5 trillion, more than doubling from just a decade ago.   Tomorrow's graduates will face an average debt of $30,000, a  crippling amount for any young person to shoulder, before they have  even entered the workforce. That amount of debt, that figure, increases  every single year, while students' ability to pay off this debt does  not.   Even with the most generous interest rate--4 percent for Federal  direct student loans--borrowers will owe over $300 a month on a  standard repayment timeline of 10 years, and they will pay $6,500 in  interest alone.   In 2017, Young Invincibles released a report on the financial decline  of millennials compared to baby boomers. Their findings are  unsurprising for those of us familiar with college debt.   Despite low unemployment and economic growth, young adults are  significantly worse off than those in the generation before them. And  for those students who are unable to complete their college degrees,  the forecast is even worse. This is where the real problem lies.  According to the Department of Education, only 56 percent of borrowers  who left before completing their degrees are able to lift themselves  out of that debt.   In 2012, in my book, ``Broke: How Debt Bankrupts the Middle Class,''  I wrote about the financial risks of attending college, especially for  those who are unable to complete their degrees.   It is true that the typical worker with a bachelor's degree earns 71  percent more than a worker with only a high school diploma. But those  caught in the middle between the high school degree and the bachelor's  degree are at the highest risk of financial instability.   While the overall level of education in our country has increased,  the largest group of people in bankruptcy remains those with some  college.   And let's be clear: Many of these students who are unable to complete  degrees are not uninterested in an education. They enrolled in college  and they wanted to earn that degree. And many would still love to  finish their degrees. But according to the Department of Education, the  majority of those who leave college do so because of job or financial  demands. In fact, fewer than 8 percent of student loan debtors in  bankruptcy reported that they left college because they did not want to  continue their education.   Many of these families and students face demands to care for family  members or are unable to continue to pay their tuition or meet their  living expenses.                                time  1930    And those who are most harmed are those who come from economically  disadvantaged backgrounds to begin with.   The power of Pell grants and other Federal funding streams has  dropped dramatically as the cost of a college education has  skyrocketed. And to make matters worse, this administration is rolling  back protections for students attending for-profit colleges where some  of the worst abuses have occurred.   I recently spoke with one of my constituents, a 30-year-old man named  Tom who lives in Irvine. Tom's parents didn't earn high school degrees.  Not only did he want to finish high school, he wanted to get a college  degree.   A few years after graduating from high school, after working multiple  jobs to make ends meet, Tom started searching for a program that would  help him pursue his passion for graphic design.   He found The Art Institute of California online and filled out an  interest form. A recruiter soon called him, and he was incredibly  excited to join the program and work toward a degree. He didn't realize  at that time that ``anyone who could find a way to pay'' would likely  be accepted.   Tom explained to me that the tools and code that they taught were  outdated and that his access to his instructors was nearly nonexistent.  He graduated with an associate's degree and with more than $50,000 in  debt.   But he graduated with none of the skills that he needed for success.  While working jobs completely unrelated to his field of study, Tom  worked to teach himself the skills he actually needed, and today he has  managed to become a senior designer for a digital marketing agency. But  his student loan debt is a constant weight on his shoulders.   He recently got married, and as he considers starting a family, he  finds himself wondering if he will be able to financially provide for  his children when he, himself, still owes tens of thousands of dollars.   I recently joined with my colleagues in introducing the Relief for  Defrauded Students Act of 2019, which would help borrowers who were  defrauded or misled by their colleges, as the Department of Education  Undersecretary Betsy DeVos has failed to follow through with promises  made to protect borrowers.   But this is not enough. As we have seen all too frequently, the  Department of Education and Secretary DeVos cannot be trusted to  safeguard the interests of students whom, by law, they are obligated to  protect. Because of that, I believe that we should require information  sharing between the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the  Department of Education and that this information sharing would help  make sure that the consumer agency's student loan ombudsman has the  data necessary to understand the challenges that borrowers are facing.   That is why I introduced the CFPB Student Loan Integrity and  Transparency Act. The bill does just what its name suggests. It  mandates that the Department of Education and student loan servicers  share information and cooperate with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's student loan education ombudsman. That ombudsman  [[Page H5985]]  is the number one Federal official tasked with advocating for students  struggling to repay Federal student loans.   The bill also requires that the ombudsman's office be fully staffed  at all times so that the office can conduct the level of oversight  necessary to protect student borrowers.   On the ninth anniversary of the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is time  that we take stock of the protections of that landmark legislation that  prevents another financial crisis. Many of these protections, the  administration and my Republican colleagues have chosen to strip away.  Even if piecemeal, we must reanimate those protections established  under Dodd-Frank or we will again face the kind of dire consequences  that fell on the shoulders of American families in 2008.   I wrote my book, ``Broke: How Debt Bankrupts the Middle Class,'' in  2012. That was 7 years ago. The college affordability crisis is not new  to this country, and it is not new to this Congress. The crisis has  been going on for years.   While students are unable to finish their educations because of the  financial burdens and lack of student supports, while thousands face  bankruptcy because of the high costs of college, Congress has done  nothing. In the 7 months that I have been here, Congress has done  nothing.   How much longer will we wait to address the student loan crisis?  Because the students who are buried in debt, many from degrees that  they were unable to finish because of financial pressure, cannot keep  waiting.   Every day that we do nothing, we are failing every single person in  this country who pursues a postsecondary education. We are stifling our  economy and actively preventing the most vulnerable people from  achieving economic stability and success. No one in Congress, Democrat  or Republican, should accept this. We are failing our Nation's  students.   As a mother of three young children, I refuse to stand by and let  this happen. That is why I have joined with my colleague,  Representative Jahana Hayes, to found the first-ever Congressional  College Affordability Caucus.   Before being elected to Congress, I was a university professor, and I  spent nearly two decades helping consumers who were facing bankruptcy.  The mission of the College Affordability Caucus is to convene a diverse  group of Congress Members to discuss the main drivers of the increasing  cost of higher education and the resulting accessibility barriers to  students who are seeking a postsecondary degree or credential.   The College Affordability Caucus will highlight solutions to the  student loan default crisis, ensure that adequate guardrails are in  place to protect every student from predatory actors, and reduce  barriers to college completion that subsequently heighten college debt  repayment problems for far too many students.   As we move forward to a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act,  I hope that the College Affordability Caucus can work with other  congressional leaders for whom this is a priority to make sure that we  are protecting our students and ensuring that everyone has access to a  high-quality, affordable education.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
