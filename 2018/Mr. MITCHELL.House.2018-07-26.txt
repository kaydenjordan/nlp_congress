 Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that, for too long, many  countries have taken advantage of our country's patience and open trade  practices. Our country must achieve fair trade.   I understand and support going after bad actors like China, who  engage in notoriously unfair trade practices and steal intellectual  property. It appears progress is being made with the European Union  with yesterday's announcement. While achieving this, we need to protect  our domestic industries and producers.   I have heard concerns from farmers and manufacturers back home in  Michigan who are being threatened by retaliatory tariffs from our  trading partners. Growth for American agriculture lies in export  markets. Domestic manufacturers often have complex supply chains, and  sometimes imported materials are their only option.   My constituents support holding unfair trading partners accountable.  They just ask for support and protection while we achieve fair trade  for all Americans.                            ____________________
