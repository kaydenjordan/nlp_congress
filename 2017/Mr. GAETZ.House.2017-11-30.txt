 Mr. Speaker, the Jerusalem Embassy Act, signed by  President Clinton, requires the American Embassy in Israel to be moved  to Jerusalem. But this law also allows the President to waive the act  every 90 days, which has happened ever since.   This Friday, President Trump must decide to sign another waiver or to  honor our friend and ally, Israel. I rise to call on President Trump to  move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.   Jerusalem is the eternal, undivided capital of Israel, yet our  Embassy is in Tel Aviv. This is disrespectful, dismissive, and wrong.  It sends the message that Israel cannot designate its own capital city.   Some claim that moving the Embassy threatens peace between Israel and  Palestinians. But the Palestinian Authority does far more to jeopardize  peace than the location of our Embassy. They name schools after  terrorists and Nazis, teach children that the murder of Jews is noble,  and they pay the salaries of terrorists.   Moving our Embassy will tell the Palestinian Authority that their  days of denying Israel's existence are over, and that they must become  a partner in peace.   Mr. Speaker, the time is now. It is time to honor our promise to  Israel and to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem.                            ____________________
