 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate  the passage of the Donna Doss Memorial Act.   In February 2019, Border Patrol agent Donna Doss was struck and  killed by a vehicle while assisting a State trooper. Donna served more  than 15 years in Border Patrol and held several leadership roles within  the agency.   Donna was survived by her husband, two sons, parents, brother, and  sister.   The House voted yesterday to officially rename the Rocksprings Border  [[Page H4015]]  Patrol Station the Donna M. Doss Border Patrol Station. This effort has  been underway in Congress since 2020, and I am glad to see it has  finally gotten over the finish line.   Our men and women in green put their lives on the line every single  day to protect our country, and Americans everywhere are grateful.                        Congratulating Gregg Popovich     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Gregg Popovich, head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, on becoming the  winningest head coach in the history of the National Basketball  Association.   On March 11, 2020, Pop earned his record-setting 1,336th win as head  coach of the San Antonio Spurs when he defeated the Utah Jazz 104-102.   Pop has led the Spurs for over 26 seasons. Pop has won five NBA  championships and was named head coach of the year three separate  times.   I am honored to introduce my House resolution to congratulate Coach  Popovich.                            ____________________
