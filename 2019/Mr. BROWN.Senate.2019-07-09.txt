 Madam President, I both concur and applaud the senior  Senator from Washington State for her comments. We saw Senator Manchin  here. I know Senator Kaine was here. Senator Murphy was here. Senator  Blumenthal was here. I know there are probably a dozen others, all of  whom know people and have talked to people, who get out and, as Lincoln  said, listen to people and get their public opinion baths.   They meet people like Susan Halpern from Columbus, whom I will talk  about in a few minutes. They talk to them. They meet. They see that  what we do here actually matters to people's lives.   They can play games with the Affordable Care Act. They have been  doing that for a decade now, literally almost a decade, putting  people's healthcare at risk, scaring people, and alarming people,  trying to take their healthcare away. These are real people, as these  pictures show and as these stories show.   Let me back up for a minute. A Federal judge is hearing arguments in  a case that would literally yank health coverage away from millions of  Americans.   I know what that means in my State. There are 900,000 people in Ohio  who have insurance today because of the Affordable Care Act. There are  100,000 Ohio seniors who have gotten major savings on their  prescription drugs through the Affordable Care Act. One million Ohio  seniors have had osteoporosis screenings, diabetes screenings,  physicals with no copay and no deductible, and preventive care so they  don't get sick, saving the healthcare system money, saving taxpayers'  dollars, and making their lives better. Yet my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, all of whom have good insurance paid for by  taxpayers, want to take it away from them.   Almost any day you could look down the hall--you can open this door  and walk down the hall, look down the hall, and you will see the  healthcare lobbyists, the drug company lobbyists, the tobacco  lobbyists, and the gun lobbyists. You will see one after another going  to the Republican leader's office, Senator McConnell. Every one of  those lobbyists causes us to spend more dollars on health insurance.  The health insurance lobby, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the  alcohol lobby, the spirits lobby coming out of Kentucky--all of them  cost taxpayers more because it means people's health gets worse because  they don't stand up to these interest groups.   We know what is happening in Texas. A partisan judge, an absolutely  partisan hack of a judge, ruled in December to strike down the Ohio  healthcare law. I know Justice Roberts said we don't talk about Obama  judges or Bush judges or Clinton judges or Trump judges. Yes, that is  what they say, and that is what Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts  says, but we know what has happened here. We know how Senator McConnell  is looking for the most extreme and young judges possible to put on the  court to go after labor rights, to go after voting rights, to go after  healthcare, costing our citizens their health and costing citizens  billions of dollars.   We know the President wants to get rid of the entire Affordable Care  Act. If President Trump gets his way, if the court decides to wipe it  off the books, to take away the entire healthcare law, here is what  happens: tax credits to help you afford your health insurance--gone;  protections for preexisting conditions--gone.   Right now, 5 million Ohioans have a preexisting condition. Most of  the rest of us will have a preexisting condition at some time in our  lives. It is called aging, when people are more likely to develop  illnesses and get sick.   So consumer protections built in by Obama, built in by the Affordable  Care Act so insurance companies can't deny you coverage, and they can't  say: ``Sorry, we are not going to insure you'' or ``You already have  insurance''--and they will take the insurance away if you just happen  to get too sick and you cost the private insurance companies too much  money--gone. Republicans in this body and President Trump want to take  those protections away.   The ability to stay on your parents' health insurance until you are  26--gone. We know what that has meant to so many families. If my  colleagues would leave this building, leave their foreign travel, leave  their nice homes that most of us have in our States and get out and  listen to people, they will hear people say: Well, this is really  important to my 26-year-old sister or my 26-year-old daughter or my 24- year-old son.   Ohio's entire Medicaid expansion that Republican Governor Kasich  did--  [[Page S4721]]  gone. Limits on how much you pay out-of-pocket each year--gone. Many  more affordable prescription drugs for seniors through closing the  doughnut hole under the Affordable Care Act, if they get their way-- gone.   Free preventive services, like mammograms and bone density screenings  for Medicare beneficiaries--millions of them in my State and tens of  millions of them in the country--gone. The list goes on.   There are 5 million Ohioans under 65 who have preexisting conditions.  That is half the population of our State.   I am not being an alarmist. We know this is what so many of you who  were in the House earlier voted on time and again to try to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. You had no replacement. You said you did, but  there was no replacement for the Affordable Care Act. It was the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, taking away all of these benefits that tens  and tens of million Americans benefit from.   These Ohioans have been able to rest a little easier knowing they  can't be turned down for healthcare coverage or have their rates  skyrocket because a child has asthma, because a husband has diabetes,  or because a wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, but this case  intentionally puts all of that at risk.   President Trump has thrown the whole power and all of the attorneys-- the battery of lawyers--in the Justice Department into this case to try  to take the away the Affordable Care Act. That is what he promised in  his campaign; that is what all these Republican Members of the Senate  promised; and that is what all the Republican Members of the House  promised. Do you know what? A lot of them lost last year because they  want to take their insurance away. They are not doing it through  Congress because that might be politically risky. They don't want to do  that. They are trying to do it through the court system and then blame  who knows what for this.   In Columbus, I met Susan Halpern. Ms. Halpern is a cancer survivor.  She is pictured here. She told me this:         As a breast cancer survivor and self-employed small       business owner in Ohio--    Creating jobs--         I depend on the ACA for my healthcare. I am aware that       without the ACA, I would not be able to purchase health       insurance for any price. Even though my cancer has been in       complete remission for 12 years, I would still be       uninsurable.    These stories from Michigan that Senator Stabenow tells, from  Washington State that Senator Murray just told, that Senator Kaine  told, that Senator Murphy has told, and that Senator Blumenthal has  told go on and on. These are all cases where people have insurance, and  a bunch of people in this body--all of whom get insurance paid for by  taxpayers--are trying to take it away from them. All of these benefits  are gone, thanks to the lobbyists lining up in Senator McConnell's  office from the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the insurance lobby, the  spirits lobby, and all the rest.   Last week, in Cleveland, I met Maya Brown-Zimmerman, who pointed out  to me that I had met her many years before when she was a student in  high school. She went to high school with my daughter. I met her at a  school event once. She has a rare genetic disorder that one of her four  children also inherited. Here is what she said:         I cried the day the ACA was passed because it meant a       safety net for my family. No lifetime caps on medical       coverage, and the guarantee of being able to get health       insurance even if something were to happen to my husband's       job.    She went on:         Whether or not my family loses these protections literally       keeps me awake at night.    Think about that. Think about the selfishness of my Republican  colleagues, of President Trump, and of the people in this  administration--all the Justice Department lawyers and all these  judges. Think about their selfishness. They have a political agenda,  and they are keeping Ms. Brown-Zimmerman awake at night because she  worries about her insurance. Think about the selfishness. Think about  the morality of that.   She said:         I want our elected officials to remember we can't predict       when we will need to access the healthcare system and so       access to healthcare is an issue that is going to affect us       all.    There are not too many people who are not able to sleep in this body.  There were not too many people who were not able to sleep in the House  as they were all voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That doesn't  seem to cross their mind, but it crosses the minds of millions of  people in Detroit, in Ann Harbor, in Cleveland, and in Mansfield.   Today, tomorrow, and the day after, 14 Ohioans will die of an  overdose. Medicaid is the No. 1 tool we have to get people into  treatment. Ohio is in the throes of an addiction crisis, like much of  the rest of the country but only worse in many cases. We know Medicaid  expansion has been a lifeline to so many Ohioans.   Sometime ago, I was at Albert House in Cincinnati, one of the best  addiction treatment centers in the country. I sat with a man and his  daughter. He put his hand gently on his daughter's arm. He looked at  me, and he said: ``Senator, my daughter would be dead if it were not  for Medicaid.'' He said: ``My daughter would be dead if it were not for  Medicaid.''   Yet Federal judges--Trump-appointed judges and Bush-appointed  judges--and Republican Senators, all of whom get health insurance from  the Federal Government, from taxpayers, are apparently willing to have  that on their conscience. They are willing to work to repeal the  Affordable Care Act with no real replacement. That matters in the life  of Ms. Halpern. That matters in the life of Ms. Brown-Zimmerman, whom I  just talked about. That matters in the life of the gentleman in  Cincinnati who talked to me about his daughter.   The President wants to make it harder for Ohioans to get that care. I  don't know how Members of this Congress and this President--all with  good insurance that is paid for by taxpayers--can support dismantling  this lifeline that so many Americans rely on.   I yield the floor.
