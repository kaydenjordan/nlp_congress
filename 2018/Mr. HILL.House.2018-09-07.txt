 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue to speak out against  the atrocities being committed in Syria by the brutal dictator, Assad,  and his evil collaborators and coconspirators, Russia and Iran.   I commend President Trump for taking a stand against the reckless  attack on Idlib province and the tens of thousands who could be killed.   I am proud of the work that Arkansans are doing in Syria,  particularly in Idlib province, on behalf of the Syrian people. Through  the work of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, led by a Syrian American,  an Arkansan, Mouaz Moustafa, Arkansans are directly supporting the  reopening of a kindergarten and women's center in Idlib province.   I am especially concerned about the tragic consequences and loss of  life that an assault, particularly a chemical weapons assault, on Idlib  will have on this vital kindergarten and work for women there.   I stand in support of the President's recent message but call on him  to strengthen his resolve against Assad's brutal actions and to  continue to support the innocent Syrian people.                            ____________________
