 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have many times  in the last several years--and I know I am not alone in this--to talk  about, unfortunately, yet another mass shooting. This one occurred in  my home State--in Allegheny County, PA, in the southwestern corner of  our State, in the city of Pittsburgh, in a community known as Squirrel  Hill.   I come here to do a couple of things--to honor the victims of this  mass shooting and the individuals who were injured, of course; to offer  condolences to the grieving families again; to express gratitude for  the law enforcement and medical professionals who responded to the  scene; and, of course, to stand with the community in the face of hate  and terror.   On this occasion, this deadly mass shooting occurred in one  community, but it also occurred in a house of worship. It resulted in  the deaths of 11 innocent Pennsylvanians. It left six people injured,  including four law enforcement officers who were responding to the  scene. It was a targeted, hateful attack on the Jewish community within  the Squirrel Hill community in the city of Pittsburgh. It was an act of  violence that we must work to ensure never happens again.   It was just a couple of weeks ago, long before election day, on  Saturday, October 27, that three congregations--the Tree of Life, the  Dor Hadash, and the New Light--were engaged in Shabbat morning services  at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, which  is a residential part of the city of Pittsburgh. As these worshippers  were engaged in services, what played out was the most deadly act of  violence against the Jewish community in American history. These  congregants were targeted for one reason--because of their religious  beliefs, because they happened to be Jewish. Their lives were changed  forever by one hateful act of terror, as were the lives of those who  were injured.   So our deepest condolences are with the 11 families of the victims of  this attack. Here are the names of the 11: Joyce Fienberg, Richard  Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal and his  brother David Rosenthal, Bernice and Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Melvin  Wax, and Irving Younger. May their memories be blessings to their  families and community. It is difficult to even begin to adequately  express the hurt that this community has endured, the horror that these  families have endured, and the hurt that is still part of this  community.   Maybe one of the best ways to convey not just our condolences and our  sympathy but also our solidarity with those who faced that horror and  that danger and that hate is to talk about what those folks did in that  dark, dark hour. It literally was about an hour, maybe a little more  than that, on that Saturday morning.   We, of course, at this time--and so many have since that date--pay  tribute to those in law enforcement who confronted the murderer with  uncommon valor. We pay tribute, as well, to the emergency service  professionals--nurses and doctors and others--who ministered to those  who were wounded and tried their best to minister to those who were  dying.   All of these individuals--and it is impossible to name all of them  whether they are in law enforcement or are medical professionals or are  emergency personnel--were, at that moment, as they always are, servants  in the most profound meaning of the word. These were servants who came  forward to help in that darkness. They came forward to save and to  comfort. As the great hymn ``The Servant Song'' tells us, these were  servants who were holding the light for these individuals in the  nighttime of their fear. That is what that song, ``The Servant Song,''  reminds us of.   So, when a gunman with very powerful weapons was shooting directly at  individuals--targeting them--in a house of worship, where there was no  protection at all for those who were victims and for those who were  targets but who survived and had to wait what must have seemed like an  eternity for  [[Page S7031]]  help because the gunman was in control of that scene for a period of  time, they were in that nighttime of their fear. Those servants came  forward to bring some light to that darkness, to bring light to that  nighttime of their fear.   People all over the world have marveled at the strength, the resolve,  and the love of the people of Pittsburgh--a community, as they have  said so many times since, that is stronger than hate and, I would  argue, that is stronger than ever.   We are thinking about those families. We are thinking about those who  gave so much in that hour of tragedy and horror and death and darkness.  We also have to do more than that. Commendation and sympathy and  condolences and solidarity and being determined to try to prevent this  from ever happening again is all important, but we have to do more. We  have to also act--maybe it is better to say ``take action''--to enact  commonsense policies, laws, and other policies that will at least  reduce the likelihood that these acts of violence will, in fact,  continue to occur.   This problem of mass shootings is a uniquely American problem that  has to be solved by the American people, of course, through their  elected representatives at every level of government but, maybe most  especially, by those who are here in the U.S. Senate and in the other  body, the House of Representatives, in working with the executive  branch. I believe we have to take action. No single law and no series  of measures, even if they were to be enacted into law, will remove the  possibility that these mass shootings and other examples of horrific  gun violence will suddenly vanish from the Earth and never happen  again. Yet there are steps we can take that will, for sure, reduce the  likelihood.   The point I have made all along is that we have to take enough  action, even a series of actions, that might prevent one fewer of these  incidents in which kids are killed in school, as we saw 6 years ago in  Newtown, CT, at Sandy Hook Elementary School, or one less example of  people being gunned down in a nightclub or in another school in Florida  or now in a synagogue in Pittsburgh.   What do we need to do?   We could start with measures that have broad-based support. Some of  them are supported by 80 to 90 percent of the American people. We could  require universal background checks. I think that that is about a 90- to-10 issue, maybe. We could ban military-style assault weapons. There  are millions of them on our streets already. There are weapons of war  on our streets and in our communities. We could also limit high- capacity magazines that allow hundreds of rounds to be fired in just a  matter of seconds or minutes. We must keep guns out of the hands of  dangerous people--suspected terrorists and individuals convicted of  hate crimes, stalking, domestic violence, and dating violence.   These policies can't prevent every act of violence or replace what  has been lost at the Tree of Life Synagogue or in communities across  the Nation, the most recent, of course, being in California, but we can  take action. I don't think it is in the best interest of the American  people to surrender to this problem, to surrender to this uniquely  American problem, and just throw up our hands and say that there is  nothing we can do, as some might say, about mass shootings or that  there is nothing we can do, some might argue, to prevent losing over  30,000 lives a year to gun violence. I think we can take action. I  think we can do more. At a minimum, we have to try. All of the measures  I have mentioned--you could add more, like plugging the loophole which  says that if you are too dangerous to get on an airplane because you  happen to be a terrorist or we have a reasonable suspicion, a well- grounded suspicion, that you are a terrorist and you can't get on an  airplane, why would that same individual be allowed to have a weapon?  It doesn't make a lot of sense. We have some work to do, as legislators  and as Americans, to try to reduce the likelihood that these attacks  will continue.    None of the measures that I have outlined here today--and we could  add more to the list--are in any way inconsistent with the Second  Amendment or in any way would undermine the right of a law-abiding  American to purchase a firearm and to use a firearm for self-protection  or for hunting or whatever else.   We have to take action at long last. It has been too long. There have  been too many tragedies, too many lives lost, and the response by  Congress for years now--you could even say for even decades--has been  to throw up their hands and say: There is nothing we can do. I don't  believe that about America--that the most powerful Nation in the world  can do nothing on this issue. We need to do more.   We need to debate it on this floor again, but do something we haven't  done in a substantial way in at least 6 years, and that is to have  votes on this floor that deal with this issue.   We have to solve a lot of problems in the weeks that remain in this  Congress and in the new Congress, but one of them is this: to begin to  solve this problem from which only America has suffered. It is  difficult, it is contentious, and it is certainly not a problem that  has an easy solution, but to do nothing, which is basically what  Congress has done for far too long, is not in the best interest of the  American people. I would argue it is inconsistent with our values, and  it is inconsistent with who we are.   As we express condolences for those who have loved and lost--those  families who have suffered either the loss of a loved one or are still  suffering because a loved one is injured, the law enforcement who were  injured in this incident--and as we commend and salute the good work of  law enforcement, the good work of medical service professionals--those  professionals who are on our streets every day, saving people--as we do  all of that and offer those words of sympathy and condolences and  commendation, let us also be determined as a people to begin to reduce  the likelihood that we are going to be the only country in the world  that continually suffers and endures mass shooting after mass shooting,  losing lives all throughout these many years and just in the last  couple of months.   I think that is a challenge, but, also, solving that problem is a  mission worthy of a great country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to remember Joyce Fienberg.  Joyce was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at the Tree of  Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   Joyce Fienberg spent 25 years at the University of Pittsburgh's  Learning Research Center, where she focused on child development. She  connected with the people she worked with and mentored graduate  students. As her colleagues recalled, she was affectionately known as  ``mom to all of us.''   Throughout her life, Joyce wanted to be where she was needed and  where she could help. After her retirement, she became more involved in  the Tree of Life Synagogue, and it became an outlet for her altruism.  According to her son, she was a faithful attendee, a minyonaire, the  nickname given to those members who attend the prayer quorum daily.   Joyce Fienberg may no longer be with us, but her kindness and her  spirit will be remembered by those she knew and whose lives she  touched.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember Dr. Richard  Gottfried. Richard was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at  the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   Richard Gottfried lived a full life and, in doing so, made this world  a better place. Richard and his wife, Dr. Peg Durachko, both dentists,  volunteered at the Catholic Charities free dental clinic, helping to  ensure access to this vital care for all. Many of the people they  helped were immigrants and refugees who had never been to a dentist.  Richard, a member of the New Light Congregation, which shared space at  Tree of Life, and Peg, a member of St. Athanasius Catholic Church, also  helped to counsel couples preparing for marriage, wanting to aid and  serve wherever they could.   Richard Gottfried lived his life trying to affect positive change  and, through that commitment and dedication, had a direct, positive  impact on many lives, a legacy that will endure for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember Rose Mallinger.  Rose was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at the Tree of  Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   Maya Angelou once said, ``My mission in life is not merely to  survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some  compassion, some humor, and some style.'' By all accounts, Rose  Mallinger lived that life. Ninety-seven when she died last month,  everyone described Rose as full of life and destined to live to be at  least 100 years old. The Tree of Life was the center of her days, and  she had been a member of the congregation for over 60 years.   Rose Mallinger was an inspiration to all who met her, and that grace,  that vivaciousness of spirit, will live on in the lives she touched.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Jerry  Rabinowitz. Jerry was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at  the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   General George Patton once said, ``It is foolish and wrong to mourn  the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived.''  Today we thank God for the life of Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz. When gunfire  erupted, Dr. Rabinowitz was in a different location, but ran toward the  gunfire, knowing there would be people who needed his care. That  altruistic impulse cost Dr. Rabinowitz his life, but anyone who knew  Dr. Rabinowitz has said he would have done nothing less.   A family physician, Dr. Rabinowitz was guided by a moral compass that  never faltered and an inner light that never went out. He embraced AIDS  patients in the early years of the epidemic when other doctors shunned  them. He made house calls to check in on patients; he believed in  treating the whole person. He did not just care for individuals, but  for entire families. Three and four generations of families became  patients of Dr. Rabinowitz. He also served as president of Dor Hadash,  one of the congregations that met at the Tree of Life synagogue.   Dr. Rabinowitz's life ended tragically and far too soon, but the  world is a better place for the years Dr. Rabinowitz was in it. His  light lives on in all the patients he cared for and all the people he  touched, and today we do indeed thank God for the life of Dr. Jerry  Rabinowitz.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Cecil Rosenthal  and David Rosenthal. Cecil and David, who were brothers, were 2 of the  11 people who were violently killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in  Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   John-Jacques Rousseau once said, ``The person who has lived the most  is not the one with the most years but the one with the richest  experiences.'' By that standard, Cecil and David Rosenthal lived more  than almost anyone to grace this earth. They were inseparable from each  other and from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Born with intellectual  disabilities, they lived together in a community home run by ACHEIVA,  an organization that assists people with disabilities, and were beloved  throughout their community. Their strengths complemented each other,  and they looked out for each other.   Cecil, the more outgoing of the brothers, was known as the unofficial  mayor of Squirrel Hill. He was a greeter at the Tree of Life Synagogue  and active in the Best Buddies program that pairs college students with  people with disabilities. David was more reserved, yet delighted  everyone with his keen sense of humor. It was fitting that he became a  custodian, as he had a passion for keeping things clean and  [[Page S7044]]  a passion for law enforcement. Both have been made honorary Pittsburgh  firefighters in honor of their contributions to the community.   David Rosenthal and Cecil Rosenthal embraced life and, in turn, were  embraced by it. They never let any limitations hinder them, which is  how and why they touched countless lives. Robert F. Kennedy once talked  about how, through our actions, we send out ripples of hope and that  those ripples come together and make a larger collective difference.  Every person who knew Cecil and David are a ripple of hope and through  each of these ripples, their love of life, their contributions to their  community, and their life of inclusion will live on and continue to  positively impact the Squirrel Hill community, the city of Pittsburgh,  and beyond.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Bernice and Sylvan  Simon. Bernice and Sylvan were 2 of the 11 people who were violently  killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill  neighborhood.   Bernice and Sylvan Simon were devoted to each other and did  everything together. Longtime members of the Tree of Life congregation,  their life together began when they were married there in 1956 and it  ended there over 60 years later, but those intervening years were years  of joy, service, family, and love. That love and devotion served as an  inspiration to their children and grandchildren, who hope that it will  now serve as an example for all of us.   Today let us remember the great love Bernice and Sylvan Simon shared  and carry it forth in our own lives and for the rest of our days.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7044, November 15, 2018, in the first column, the  following appears: REMEMBERING BERNICE AND SYLVAN SIMON   Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Bernice and Sylvan Simon.

Dan  was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at the Tree of Life  Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   When Fred Rogers, better known as Mister Rogers, told children to  ``look for the helpers,'' he could have been talking about Dan Stein.  Whenever and wherever he was needed, for a task big or small, Dan was  happy to lend a hand. A longtime member of the New Light Congregation  and, for a time, its president, Dan was a fixture at Saturday services.  Judaism played a significant role in his life, and he was copresident  of the area's Hadassah chapter.   We would all do well to remember Dan Stein's never failing desire to  help his friends and neighbors and look for opportunities in our own  lives to do more each day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember Melvin Wax. Melvin  was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at the Tree of Life  Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   Mel Wax approached his life and his days with a kind heart and a  generous spirit. Mel was a regular at services and known for arriving  early. He knew all the roles and would always step up when needed. The  morning he died, he was leading services at New Light, one of the three  congregations that met at the Tree of Life Synagogue.   Mel Wax served in the Korean war, and though he talked about how hard  it was, he would immediately add that he would do it again so someone  else would not have to. Such was the selfless devotion of Mel Wax to  his fellow man and his sense of duty.   John McCain said, ``Every day, people serve their neighbors and our  nation in many different ways . . . It is in this spirit of dedication  to others and to our country that I believe service should be broadly  and deeply encouraged.'' Mel Wax lived a life of service to his friends  and neighbors. As we go about our days, let us strive to live up to his  example.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember Irving Younger.  Irving was 1 of the 11 people who was violently killed at the Tree of  Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.   Irving Younger was a kind soul who was simply happy to help and do  whatever was needed. He was always present to greet arrivals at the  synagogue and would lend his prayer book if a new congregant at Tree of  Life needed it. He had an innate ability to know what was needed and  how to help.   Irving Younger's life was rooted in his faith and his family. He  would always arrive early for services and stay late, and his visits to  his family in California brought him great joy.   Ralph Emerson once said, ``You cannot do a kindness too soon because  you never know when it will be too late.'' Irving Younger never failed  to do a kindness and that devotion will be remembered by all he  touched.                            ____________________
