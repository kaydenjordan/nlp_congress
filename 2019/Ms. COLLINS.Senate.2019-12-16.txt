 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, there is a great deal of activity going  on as we seek to conclude the negotiations on so many important issues.  However, I don't want us to lose sight of the expiration of the  authorization of the Older Americans Act--a very important law that  makes a big difference for many of our seniors all across our country-- so I rise today to introduce a reauthorization of that important law  called the Modernization of the Older Americans  [[Page S7054]]  Act. I am pleased to sponsor this reauthorization with Senator Bob  Casey, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Special Committee  on Aging, of which I am the chair.   Since 1965, the Older Americans Act has ensured that seniors receive  the support they need to grow older independently and with dignity. The  OAA programs provide nutritious food, transportation, assistance to  caregivers, and in-home services for older adults. Our investments  foster a sense of community for older adults and save taxpayers money  by reducing hospitalizations and the need for long-term residential  care.   I know the Presiding Officer would agree that most seniors would  prefer to remain in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own  homes if they possibly can. It is the programs of the Older Americans  Act that help to make that possible.   As our population grows older, the demand for Older American Act  services has grown as well. For example, Meals on Wheels--perhaps the  best known of all the OAA programs--provided seniors with 358 million  meals last year. In many States, the need is soaring. In Maine, which  is the oldest State by median age in the country, there is a waiting  list of 400 to 1,500 seniors, depending on the time of the year and the  location within our State.   This reauthorization helps to ensure that more seniors in need of  nutritious food can be served. At $11 a day, a meal is far cheaper than  a $2,400 average cost of a daily hospital stay. Let me give an example  of what I mean by that. Using Older Americans Act dollars, the Southern  Maine Agency on Aging conducted a pilot study that provided seniors  discharged from hospitals with 4 weeks' worth of prepared meals. The  results were astounding. Hospital readmissions were reduced by 38  percent--a 387-percent return on investment. If you scaled that  nationwide, the savings would be an astronomical $51 billion annually-- just ensuring that a senior who is discharged from the hospital has 4  weeks' worth of prepared meals available to him or her.   We have also included several provisions in the reauthorization to  combat social isolation, which can have devastating health effects. In  fact, estimates are that prolonged isolation and loneliness have an  impact on health that is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.  Just think of that.   My State is already on the forefront of combating this epidemic of  isolation. Using Older Americans Act funding, the Maine Eastern Area  Agency on Aging has partnered with the University of Maine to implement  Project Generations, which brings student volunteers into the homes of  local seniors for visits. Our reauthorization includes an increased  focus on the detrimental effects of social isolation and would provide  States with more resources to develop programs like Project  Generations. What a wonderful program this is. It not only gives some  company that an older American might not have, but also it is great for  those students to have the interaction with our seniors. It truly is a  win-win program.   Flexibility and innovation have always been at the heart of the Older  Americans Act. What may be needed in the Presiding Officer's home State  may be different from what is needed in the State of Maine. Our  reauthorization would help communities continue to find creative  solutions to meet the needs of our seniors. For example, the Southern  Maine Agency on Aging restructured its congregate meals program by  hosting meals in multigenerational settings, such as hospital and  college cafeterias and small local restaurants. Since then, the program  has grown by 55 percent and boosted the local economy by increasing the  number of diners from rural areas by 61 percent in the first 5 years.   It is much more interesting for our seniors to go out to a local  restaurant for a congregate meal than in some cases going to a senior  center. It may be more interesting for them to go to a college  cafeteria and have that interaction with younger people. Whatever  works, that is the answer. In some areas, it may work to do a college  or hospital cafeteria; in another, it is a senior center; and in still  others, it may be the local diner that is providing the meal.   The core of the Older Americans Act is protecting the most vulnerable  of our older Americans. One critical program is the Long-Term Care  Ombudsman Program. This provides advocacy for residents in long-term  care facilities, assisting with discharge and also protecting their  rights.   There was a disturbing story in one of the weekend newspapers in  Maine about a nursing home that was not living up to the quality  standards that we need, and that is where the ombudsman program can be  absolutely critical because a lot of times, the relatives of residents  are very cautious about complaining. They are fearful that their loved  one may have nowhere else to go. So the ombudsman program is an  important quality control program.   At an Aging Committee hearing this May, the executive director of  Maine's Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, Brenda Gallant, shared the  story of a 94-year-old woman whom she was able to help transition from  a nursing home back to her own home after recovering from a fractured  hip. Brenda connected the woman with the resources and the technologies  to make the transition a smooth one and to help her live successfully  back in her own home, just where she wanted to be.   The Older Americans Act is a shining example of a Federal policy that  works. Every dollar invested into the Older Americans Act generates $3  by helping seniors stay at home through highly effective and lower cost  community-based services.   I thank the dozens of stakeholders we have worked with over the past  several months. We have gotten lots of input in preparing this  reauthorization, including from the Leadership Council of Aging  Organizations, AARP, the National Association of Area Agencies on  Aging, Advancing States, the National Alliance for Caregiving, Meals on  Wheels America, and the Alzheimer's Association.   I ask unanimous consent to print these many letters of support in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                            AARP,                                                  December 16, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Senators Collins and Casey: On behalf of our nearly 38       million members and all older Americans nationwide, AARP is       pleased to support the Modernization of the Older Americans       Act Amendments, legislation to reauthorize the Older       Americans Act (OAA). We appreciate your leadership and the       bipartisan work of Senate Committee on Health, Education,       Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking       Member Patty Murray in developing this legislation, and       encourage prompt reauthorization of OAA.        The Older Americans Act has a powerful legacy. Since 1965       it has provided older Americans with the support they need to       live at home with independence and dignity. In 2017 alone,       OAA programs provided services for over 11 million older       adults. Those services include home care, congregate and       home-delivered meals, case management, family caregiver       support, transportation, adult day care, legal services,       elder abuse prevention, and job training and employment       opportunities for low-income older adults. OAA programs serve       the needs of older Americans while deferring or eliminating       the need for costly institutionalization.        The Modernization of the Older Americans Act Amendments       builds on this legacy. The legislation further strengthens       the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) by       helping to make sure that more caregivers can get their needs       assessed when they turn to the program for support, extends       the RAISE Family Caregivers Act, and increases funding levels       to support the needs of the growing older population. This       legislation, which will promote greater responsiveness to the       needs of older Americans and their caregivers, comes at a       critical time. From 2019 to 2030 we expect to see the 80+       population grow by 54 percent. This age group is among the       most likely to need help living independently in their homes       and communities .        Again, thank you for your bipartisan leadership in       advancing this important legislation. We urge prompt       reauthorization so that our loved ones can continue to turn       to these services for their health and economic security as       they age. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                 Megan O'Reilly,         Vice President, Federal Health & Family Government Affairs.  [[Page S7055]]                                          ____                              National Alliance for Caregiving,                                                  November 15, 2019.      Re Senator Collins ``Modernization of the Older Americans Act           Amendments'' bill in the 116th Congress.       Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman,      Special Committee on Aging.        On behalf of the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC), we       are happy to support Senator Collins ``Modernization of the       Older Americans Act Amendments'' bill. Thank you for the       opportunity to participate in the reauthorization process for       the Older Americans Act. This law is one of the most       underrecognized supports for family caregivers of adults, and       your leadership in the goal to strengthen families and the       dignity and independence of aging adults is critical to the       communities we serve.        We were excited to have the opportunity to come and meet       with your staff and to explore ways that family caregiving       could be supported with this reauthorization. Your leadership       and commitment to families is evident in the latest draft of       the bill and we appreciate the opportunity to provide our       input, as follows:        1. NAC recommended that the bill increase the authorized       funding level for the National Family Caregiver Support       Program (Title IIIE) from the current appropriated level of       $181.2 million to $360 million. We recognize that OAA funding       has not kept pace with inflation and the growing demands       placed on families as the population ages. We remain hopeful       that you will be able to support our request.        2. NAC recommended that the bill direct the Assistant       Secretary (in Title II) to award a grant to or enter into a       cooperative agreement with a public or private nonprofit       entity to establish and operate a National Resource Center on       Family Caregiving. Although the draft bill does not       specifically direct the creation of the Resource Center,       Section 215 of the Modernization of the Older Americans Act       includes language pertaining to ``(i) Activities of National       Significance, which offers a potential for the creation of a       Resource Center. We suggest the following modification to       strengthen that section:         (i) Activities of National Significance.--The Assistant       Secretary [may] shall award funds authorized under this       section to one or more public or private nonprofit entities       with appropriate caregiving expertise for conducting       activities of national significance that--        (1[2]) include, with respect to such programs, program       evaluation, training, technical assistance, materials,       dissemination, and research; and        ([1]2) promote quality and continuous improvement in the       support provided to family caregivers and older relative       caregivers through programs carried out under this section       and section 631.         3. We recommended extending the RAISE Family Caregivers Act       of 2017, and we appreciate the current draft bill which would       extend the act for five years.        4. Section 215 of the current draft bill about the National       Family Caregiver Support Program addresses our recommendation       to increase the use of standardized family caregiver       assessment tools. The inclusion of a clear definition for       caregiver assessment, identifying and disseminating best       practices, and calling for a report on the status of       caregiver assessment are excellent proposals to successfully       expand assessment tools and access to services for family       caregivers.        5. NAC's fifth recommendation was to direct the Assistant       Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to       implement recommendation 1-g from the National Academies of       Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's ``Families Caring for       and Aging America'' report: ``Launch a multi-agency research       program sufficiently robust to evaluate caregiver       interventions in real-world health care and community       settings, across diverse conditions and populations, and with       respect to a broad array of outcomes.'' Noting that this is       not in the current draft, we would offer our expertise and be       happy to participate in further conversation about how such a       research program might be created.        Again, thank you and we look forward to a successful       reauthorization this year.            Kind regards,      C. Grace Whiting, J.D,        President, CEO.      Michael R. Wittke, B.S.W., M.P.A.,        Senior Director, Public Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                           West Health Institute,                                                   December 2, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Gary and Mary West       Health Institute (WHI), I am writing to thank you and your       staff for your tireless efforts to reauthorize the Older       Americans Act (OAA). Originally enacted in 1965, the OAA       supports a range of vital home- and community-based programs,       such as Meals on Wheels and other nutritional support; in-      home, transportation and legal services; and elder abuse       prevention and caregiver support. Protecting seniors' access       to these services is critical in light of the growing       population of U.S. seniors, which is projected to reach 56       million in 2020 and more than 73 million by 2030. We urge       your colleagues to support reauthorization of this critical       legislation before the end of the year.        Based in San Diego, WHI is an applied medical research       organization and part of nonprofit and nonpartisan West       Health, which also includes the Gary and Mary West Foundation       and the Gary and Mary West Health Policy Center. Our       organizations work together toward a shared mission dedicated       to lowering the cost of healthcare to enable seniors to       successfully age in place with access to high-quality,       affordable health and support services that preserve and       protect their dignity, quality of life and independence.        One of West Health's flagship programs is the Gary and Mary       West Senior Wellness Center in downtown San Diego. At the       Senior Wellness Center, which is operated by the nonprofit       Serving Seniors, low-income seniors receive coordinated care       and social support services--all under one roof. Since it       opened in 2010, the Center has served over 1.7 million       nutritious meals and has provided more than 10,000 seniors       with services they need from the Center's 30 collaborative       partners, including the Gary and Mary West Senior Dental       Center--a separate, onsite nonprofit dental clinic providing       affordable oral care to low-income seniors.        In recent years, West Health has focused on shining a light       on one of the greatest threats to successful aging: senior       malnutrition. Malnutrition disproportionally affects seniors.       One out of two seniors are at risk, and disease-associated       malnutrition in seniors is estimated to cost $51.3 billion       annually. With our nation's rapidly growing senior       population, the impact of malnutrition will be even greater       if action is not taken now. Thank you for adding malnutrition       to routine health screenings in your draft legislation as       well as H.R. 4334.        We fully appreciate the value of OAA funded programs in       enriching seniors' lives and urge Congress to reauthorize the       OAA this year at the highest possible authorization levels.       On behalf of the seniors we serve, thank you for your       advocacy and leadership.            Sincerely,                                                    Shelley Lyford,      President and Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____           National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services             Programs,                                 Washington, DC, November 16, 2019.               NANASP Older Americans Act Draft Bill Comments       To the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP)           Committee Majority:         Thank you for providing an opportunity to share comments on       the draft bill you released for the 2019 Older Americans Act       reauthorization.        NANASP is pleased that Sen. Collins' Older Americans Act       proposal includes:        Increased authorizations for funding levels. The bill       includes continued increases over the next seven federal       fiscal years (FY) for Older Americans Act programs, including       an increase of over $473 million total for Older Americans       Act nutrition programs by FY 2026--increases that are sorely       needed for programs that are stretched thin by growing       demand.        An increased focus on malnutrition. The bill includes new       provisions for malnutrition screening and adds reduction of       malnutrition to the purposes of the nutrition program. Since       more than one in two older adults is at risk for       malnutrition, which increases their risk of disease and       death, it is vital to detect this condition early.        Simpler transfer authority between congregate and home-      delivered meals programs. The bill includes language       instructing states to ensure that the transfer process for       nutrition programs is simplified and clarified, maximizing       efficiency and minimizing paperwork and confusion.        Creation of a nutrition program impact study. This study       would assess how to measure and evaluate the discrepancy       between available nutrition services and the demand for such       services, which would ultimately lead to data to strengthen       the case for much-needed future funding increases for       nutrition programs.        Inclusion of culturally considerate and medically tailored       meals in nutrition programs' offerings to the maximum extent       practicable. As the older population becomes more diverse, it       is important to take newly diverse preferences into       consideration when providing meals. Medically tailored meals       have also been shown to reduce disease burden in older adults       and are important to consider offering as well.        An increased focus on social isolation. Through the first-      time inclusion of social isolation screening, further       coordination of services to address this issue, and creation       of an advisory council on social isolation, Older Americans       Act programs and services can even more effectively address       the needs of socially isolated older adults.        Strengthened family caregiver provisions. Caregivers,       including older relative caregivers, need support, and this       bill would increase the use of caregiver assessments to       analyze their needs as well as allow individual states to       determine spending needs for older relative caregivers.

Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.        Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of the Alzheimer's       Association and the Alzheimer's Impact Movement (AIM),       including our nationwide network of advocates, thank you for       your continued leadership on issues and legislation important       to Americans living with Alzheimer's and other dementias, and       their caregivers. In addition, thank you for working in a       bipartisan manner to reauthorize this important program,       including the hearing held by the Senate Special Committee on       Aging. We are proud to support this draft of the Older       Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization and are pleased to       highlight several provisions that are critical to persons       living with dementia, families, and their caregivers.        We strongly support the inclusion in the draft of language       codifying existing authority to provide services to       individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease       under the National Family Caregiver Support Program and the       Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. We are very appreciative       for the inclusion of these key elements of the Younger-Onset       Alzheimer's Disease Act (S. 901/H.R. 1903).        There are approximately 5.8 million Americans living with       Alzheimer's disease. The vast majority of those individuals       are over the age of 65, however, approximately 200,000       Americans are under the age of 65 living with younger-onset       Alzheimer's disease. Individuals living with younger-onset       face unique challenges when it comes to family, work, and       finances. They may be parenting young children at home, or       still be working as the primary income provider for their       families. Due to their young age, they may have more trouble       receiving an accurate diagnosis, and even family and friends       might question their diagnosis. The stigma associated with       younger-onset Alzheimer's can have a significant impact on       their well-being and quality of life.        Since 97 percent of all people living with Alzheimer's are       age 65 or older, current Alzheimer's support infrastructure       focuses exclusively on seniors. As a result, few supportive       services are available to those with younger-onset. With       other diseases--like heart disease, diabetes, and even       cancer--many people living with them are middle-aged and       there is a large support structure available to them. Those       same support structures are not available for the individuals       living with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. The services       provided under the OAA are particularly helpful for       individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease and       related dementias who need assistance with activities of       daily living.        The Younger-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act is consistent       with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The       Advisory Council on Alzheimers Research. Care. and Services.       which is responsible for updating and implementing the Plan,       has noted that persons living with younger-onset Alzheimer's       face unique challenges in accessing care. In the 2017       National Plan, the Advisory Council recommended that Congress       amend the OAA to allow additional services to be provided to       younger adults living with dementia.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM also deeply appreciate       the bill's extension of the authorization for the RAISE       Family Caregivers Act from 3 years to 8 years. We have been       strong advocates for the RAISE Family Caregivers Act since it       was introduced in Congress. There has been a delay in the       implementation of the Act and the decision to extend the       authorization allows the Department of Health and Human       Services to better develop a national strategy for education       and training, long-term services and supports, and financial       stability and security for caregivers.        For millions of Americans caring for individuals with       Alzheimer's and other dementias the emotional, physical, and       financial costs can be overwhelming. Caregivers of people       with dementia report higher levels of stress, depression, and       worse health outcomes than those providing care to       individuals without dementia. As a result, Alzheimer's       caregivers incurred $11.8 billion in additional health costs       last year. We appreciate the bill prioritizing this important       program.        We also applaud the bill's strengthening of caregiver       assessments. In 2018, more than 16 million unpaid caregivers       provided 18.5 billion hours of care valued at nearly $234       billion and face the challenges noted above. Eighty-three       percent of the help provided to older adults in the United       States comes from family members, friends, or other unpaid       caregivers. Nearly half of all caregivers who provide help to       older adults do so for someone living with Alzheimer's or       another dementia. Alzheimer's takes a devastating toll on       caregivers. Compared with caregivers of people without       dementia, twice as many caregivers of those with dementia       indicate substantial emotional, financial, and physical       difficulties. Of the total lifetime cost of caring for       someone with dementia, 70 percent is borne by families--      either through out-of-pocket health and long-term care       expenses or from the value of unpaid care.        These dedicated caregivers would greatly benefit from       increased resources, training, and support to help them       navigate the strain of caregiving and improve their health       and quality of life. The proposed changes would provide these       caregivers with much-needed resources through the National       Family Caregiver Support Program, increase the use of       caregiver assessments, and identify best practices relating       to the programs. These important actions will enhance support       for caregivers through skills building, increased resources       and information, respite care, counseling, and other helpful       benefits.        Finally, the Association and AIM appreciate your commitment       to supporting individuals facing social isolation with the       inclusion of a report on social isolation. Social isolation       is an issue within the aging community as a whole, and       particularly in the Alzheimer's and related dementias       community. Studies have found that support groups can       decrease social isolation and increase social support,       ability to accept the diagnosis, cope with symptoms, improve       quality of life, and enhance family communication       (Alzheimer's Association Dementia Care Practice       Recommendations, 2018). Support programs offered through the       National Family Caregiver Support Program can work to       decrease social isolation. We appreciate the bill's inclusion       of a study on the effectiveness of these programs.        Again, thank you for your leadership in ensuring OAA's       reauthorization, which will improve the quality of care for       people living with Alzheimer's. If you have any questions,       please contact Rachel Conant, Vice President of Federal       Affairs.            Sincerely,                                                    Robert Egge,                                        Chief Public Policy Officer,      Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                                  November 25, 2019.      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate.      Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,      U.S. Senate.      Chairman Lamar Alexander,      HELP Committee, U.S. Senate.      Ranking Member Patty Murray,      HELP Committee, U.S. Senate.        Dear Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Alexander       and Ranking Member Murray: The Jewish Federations of North       America (JFNA) is proud to endorse the Modernization of the       Older Americans Act Amendments. JFNA represents 146 local       Jewish Federations, 300 Network communities, and thousands of       affiliated social service agencies across the continent. Our       movement protects and enhances the well-being of Jews       worldwide through the values of tikkun olam (repairing the       world), tzedakah (charity and social justice) and torah       (Jewish learning). Jewish social services provide support for       more than one million vulnerable individuals each year,       Jewish and non-Jewish alike, including approximately 100,000       older adults.        For more than 50 years, the Older Americans Act (OAA) has       been essential in developing, coordinating, and delivering       home and community-based services that help older adults age       with independence and dignity in their homes and communities.       Without these crucial services, many individuals served by       OAA-funded programs in our network are at significant risk of       hunger, isolation, and losing their ability to live with       health and independence.        The Jewish community is disproportionately older than the       general population in this country with approximately 28% of       American Jews already over the age of 65, and the fastest       growing demographic in the Jewish community is those over the       age of 85. Jewish family service agencies, Jewish vocational       service agencies and Jewish community centers are a key       component of the country's Aging Services Network and, in a       classic public-private partnership, provide many services       funded through the OAA, including case management,       transportation, congregate and home-delivered meals, adult       day care, elder abuse prevention and intervention, family       caregiver support, home care, legal conservatorship, and       support groups.        This year's reauthorization process produced the       Modernization of the Older Americans Act Amendments in the       Senate, a bill that, if enacted, will significantly move the       ball forward in how our country and its Aging Services       Network treat and care for seniors. The very first       substantive provision of the bill (after the authorization of       appropriations) incorporates ``person-centered, trauma-      informed care'' (``PCTI'') as a new objective of the Older       Americans Act. This principle, which is subsequently defined       in the bill, represents a new trend in service delivery that       will positively impact both clients and agencies. It       incorporates a holistic approach to service provision that       promotes the dignity, strength, and empowerment of trauma       victims by referencing knowledge about the role of trauma in       trauma victims' lives. The inclusion of the PCTI approach in       this bill is indicative of the forward and necessary progress       embedded in the Modernization of the Older Americans Act       Amendments.        The Modernization of the Older Americans Act Amendments       authorizes a technical assistance center to serve older       adults experiencing the long-term and adverse consequences of       trauma. This includes but is not limited to Holocaust       survivors. Holocaust  [[Page S7057]]       survivors are specifically mentioned for the first time       within the Older Americans Act in the context of providing       additional outreach to older individuals ``including       Holocaust survivors'' who are at risk of institutional       placement. The bill also emphasizes cultural considerations       in the provision of congregate and home-delivered meals.        This Older American Act reauthorization incorporates new       support for age-friendly communities, a major new focus on       social isolation in older adults, an updating of, recognition       and support for multigenerational families, and assistance to       family caregivers with an extension of the RAISE Family       Caregivers Act. Each of these provisions and many others       contained in the bill will serve our nation well. JFNA also       is pleased with the lengthy reauthorization period and       relatively robust funding increases for the Older Americans       Act, which help safeguard support and removes uncertainty for        Collectively, this reauthorization vehicle that is very       worthy of support and JFNA looks forward to its enactment.            Sincerely,      Stephan O, Kline,          Interim Director of the Washington Office and Associate             Vice President, Public Policy The Jewish Federations of             North America.                                   ____                                                 Advancing States,                                                   December 9, 2019.      Majority Leader McConnell,      U.S. Senate.      Minority Leader Schumer,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       On behalf of ADvancing States, I am writing you in support of       efforts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA).       ADvancing States is a nonpartisan association of state       government agencies that represents the nation's 56 state and       territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. We work to       support visionary state leadership, the advancement of state       systems innovation, and the development of national policies       that support home and community-based services for older       adults and persons with disabilities. Our members administer       a wide range of services and supports for older adults and       people with disabilities, including overseeing OAA programs       and services in every state. Together with our members, we       work to design, improve, and sustain state systems delivering       long-term services and supports for people who are older or       have a disability and for their caregivers.        We are writing to you to strongly encourage the U.S. Senate       to pass a bill to reauthorize the OAA as soon as possible.       Authorization for critical OAA programs, such as       homedelivered meals and caregiver supports, expired September       30, 2019. We know that members of the Health, Education,       Labor, and Pensions committee have been working diligently to       craft a bill to reauthorize the OAA. We appreciate these       bipartisan efforts and strongly encourage the U.S. Senate to       pass a bill to reauthorize the OAA as soon as possible.        If you have any questions regarding this letter, please       feel free to contact Damon Terzaghi or Adam Mosey.            Sincerely,                                                    Martha Roherty,                                                Executive Director.     I urge my colleagues to take a look at this bipartisan  bill.   We are overdue to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. This is our  opportunity not only to reauthorize it but to make it even better and  more responsive to the needs of America's older Americans.   Thank you very much.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 3058. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to  establish fair and consistent eligibility requirements for graduate  medical schools operating outside the United States and Canada; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
