 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  September as Sickle Cell Awareness Month and to call for more research  on the sickle cell trait.   Today, I am introducing a resolution calling for more sickle-cell  trained research and public education and awareness on the disease.   Mr. Speaker, sickle cell disease is America's most commonly inherited  blood disorder and affects about 100,000 Americans. More than 3 million  Americans, including 1 in 12 African Americans and 1 in 100 Latinos  carry the sickle cell trait, which can lead to sickle cell disease.   For example, one is tested at birth to determine whether they have  the sickle cell trait, and that is it. Later in life, there are certain  tests, such as the A1C test, which some are often given to determine  diabetes. Well, if you have the sickle cell trait, you could get a  false positive from this test.   So it is very important that we figure out a way in terms of  awareness, education, and to dedicate our resources to making sure that  there are strategies to provide the information for adults so that they  know that they have the sickle cell trait. Right now, millions of  people have it and they don't know it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  resolution.                            ____________________
