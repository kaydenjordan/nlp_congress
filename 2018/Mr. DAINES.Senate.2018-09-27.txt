 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Mark Biel of Flathead County, natural resources program  manager at Glacier National Park, for his outstanding work bringing new  programs and research to the Crown of the Continent.   Growing up hiking and camping, Mark fostered a love of the outdoors,  particularly national parks and public lands. He has had a long and  distinguished career with the National Park Service and served at  multiple national parks across the West. Mark has been at Glacier  National Park for the last 8 years, where he has been recognized for  his research on mountain goats and helped the park achieve designation  as an International Transboundary Dark Sky Park.   He has also pioneered a wildlife shepherding program with his dog  Gracie. Gracie, known as the bark ranger, has been trained to move  bighorn sheep and mountain goats out of areas of high visitor traffic,  such as visitor centers and parking lots. The program has helped make  the park safer for both humans and animals while also providing an  excellent tool for educating park visitors on the importance of  avoiding human-wildlife conflicts.   Earlier this month, in recognition of his work at Glacier, Mark won  the National Park Service Director's Award for Professional Excellence  in Natural Resource Stewardship. He was selected over six other  nominees, one from each National Park Service region.   I congratulate Mark on such a tremendous achievement and thank him  for his dedicated service to Glacier National Park and our entire  National Park System.                            ____________________
