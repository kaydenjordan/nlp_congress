 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Kent Fountain for being elected the National Cotton Council chairman  for 2020.   Mr. Fountain is an excellent choice for this important role and knows  the cotton industry inside and out.   He is the president and CEO of Southeastern Gin and Peanut and has  won numerous awards, including Southeastern Ginner of the Year in 2001  and the Horace Hayden National Ginner of the Year in 2016.   Additionally, Mr. Fountain works as the director of Cotton Council  International, which promotes American cotton abroad.   With cotton being so critical to Georgia's economy, I am proud that  we have someone from our State with so much expertise leading the  national cotton industry.   Kent, congratulations on your election. Keep up the good work.                            ____________________
