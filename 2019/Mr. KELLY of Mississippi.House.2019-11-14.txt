 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  former speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives, the  Honorable Billy McCoy, who is pictured here.   Former Mississippi Speaker Billy McCoy passed away on November 12  after an incredible, lifelong career of public service.   Billy was directly responsible for revolutionizing the economy of  Mississippi and bringing thousands of jobs to our great State. As  speaker, Speaker McCoy championed the 1987 infrastructure plan that  created four-lane highways throughout Mississippi. The four-lane  highways brought industries and added more than 1,300 miles of highways  to the State.   Billy was also dedicated to improving public education in Mississippi  and giving every child a chance for success. His influence on the lives  of numerous Mississippians will not be forgotten, but his honorable  demeanor and commitment will be greatly missed.   I just think back to being at Jacinto, an ancient courthouse that  predates the Civil War in Mississippi near Rienzi, where Speaker McCoy  was from. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, when you got  ready to run, you had better go pay homage to the great Speaker Billy  McCoy, who did so much for Mississippi.   And I can still see him sitting on the front lawn in front of the  trailer with the hay bales on it, where I would speak for my first  political speech, and seeing Speaker McCoy out there, knowing that I  would have gone by and gotten advice from him, even though we were on  opposite political parties.   May Mr. Speaker rest in peace.                       Recognizing Judge Sadie Holland     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Judge Sadie Holland, another icon in history. And thank goodness she is  still here with us. She is just retiring.   She is retiring from Lee County Justice Court as a judge, after 16  years of service in that capacity. She also has a history of being Lee  County's first female justice court judge. She served, before that, as  the Tupelo court administrator and mayor of Nettleton, a small  community in Lee County.   Judge Holland's influence in the community has been so significant,  Lee County proclaimed November 3 as Sadie Holland Day.    I also have to mention that one of her sons is retiring as a State  representative of over 36 years, who I will recognize next, and her  other is a supervisor in her home county of Lee County.   The Hollands are icons in Lee County, and I thank Judge Sadie Holland  for her service.                Recognizing State Representative Steve Holland     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize  soon-to-be former--he is about to retire from the Mississippi House of  Representatives--Representative Steve Holland.   Steve has served in the House of Representatives in the Mississippi  legislature for 36 years. He was also a desk mate, I think, of former  Speaker McCoy, and they were good friends.   Steve has represented the 16th District of Mississippi proudly, as he  has represented all of the people of his district. He is a true  Mississippian who prioritized legislation that would create a brighter  future for Mississippi.   And, if you have never met Steve Holland, he is a character who is  not large enough for this body to contain. What a gentleman. Always for  the State of Mississippi and a true Mississippian at heart, but always  with a quip and quick humor. He was always willing to never take  himself too seriously, although all the matters that he achieved were  very serious.   Steve Holland is an icon in Mississippi politics. I look forward to  working with Steve in his retirement and thank him for his service.                             Impeachment Process     Mr. Speaker, I just want to talk a little  bit about this impeachment process, or whatever you want to call it  that we have going on.   The American people deserve the facts--and just the facts--not  supposition from witnesses who have second- and third- and fourth- and  fifth-hand information.   They have a right to not have lawyers and alleged whistleblowers, who  the lawyer has--the coup started in 2017 as soon as our President took  office, or impeachment next.   Mr. Speaker, the people of America deserve the facts. They don't  deserve secret proceedings, leaks, misinformation, and disinformation.   And I just want to make a small point. A whistleblower is not  afforded anonymity by the statute. They are afforded the protection  from firing or retaliation, not anonymity. It is not a hotline or an  anonymous tip line.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the misinformation and disinformation stop.  Just the facts.                            ____________________
