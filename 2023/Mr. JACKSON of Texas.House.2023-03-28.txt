 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, a  commonsense piece of legislation that will provide the American people  the relief they need from Biden's war on American energy.   As someone who grew up in the West Texas oilfields, I know firsthand  how vital energy production is to our national security, and I know  that energy security is national security.   Under President Trump's leadership, America reached energy  independence. Gas prices were low, the economy was thriving, and the  world saw America as not only an energy leader but also as an economic  and military force that must be taken seriously.   However, the Biden administration has taken a drastically different  approach. In the first few weeks in office, Biden waged war on American  energy. Biden's assault on America's energy independence has eliminated  thousands of American jobs, raised the cost of domestic energy, and  left the United States dangerously dependent on foreign energy sources.   Americans are struggling to pay their utility bills and gas prices  are at record highs, yet this administration continues to do nothing  but make matters worse.   This legislation will not only alleviate burdensome energy costs for  my constituents in Texas 13 but will do so for all Americans.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation.
