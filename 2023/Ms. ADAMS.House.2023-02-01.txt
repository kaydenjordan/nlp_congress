 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the first day of  Black History Month and to honor the  [[Page H582]]  Greensboro Four for exemplifying this year's Black History Month theme:  Black Resistance.   Black history is American history, but it is important to remember  that this isn't ancient history. The Greensboro Four, also known as the  A&T Four, sparked the sit-in movement in 1960, just 63 years ago today.   Think about that. Only six decades ago, during my lifetime, Black  Americans in the South were forced to use different water fountains,  eat at separate lunch counters, go to different bathrooms, and, most of  all, suffer the indignity of second-class citizenship.   That is why on February 1, 1960, four courageous Black students from  North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, my alma mater, Ezell  Blair, Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil, sat  down at a Whites-only lunch counter and asked to be served. In doing  so, the Greensboro Four changed the United States forever.   The sit-in movement spread to cities across the South where Black  resistance against segregation, discrimination, and Jim Crow eventually  led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed segregation in  public accommodations.   It is with great pride today that I recognize the A&T Four and every  American who joined the sit-in movement to protest the racism of the  Jim Crow South and eventually changed public policy.   These protests against injustice led to civil rights and voting  rights for Black Americans, as well as equal protection under the law.   Whether it was at that Woolworth's counter or on a bus in Montgomery  or in a jail cell in Birmingham or a bridge in Selma, Alabama, or on  the steps of the Lincoln Memorial or a Baptist Church in Atlanta or in  a St. Louis, Missouri, courthouse before the Civil War or at a slave  rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in the antebellum South,  Black resistance has nourished and slowly but surely worked to perfect  American democracy.   We, as a Nation, have a responsibility to learn from our past and  work diligently to carry on the legacy of these four men and all of our  ancestors in the movement by ensuring equal rights for all of the  people and protecting the civil rights we all fought so hard to win.   Black history is more important than ever. If it wasn't so important,  they wouldn't try to stop us from teaching it. Last month, Florida  schools announced they would not teach an advanced placement course in  African-American history. The State of Florida's letter to the college  board claimed the course ``lacks educational value.'' I disagree.   We can't afford to remove critical thinking from our curriculum. Our  students won't understand American history without understanding  African-American history.   Those who don't understand history, Mr. Speaker, are doomed to repeat  it. That is why this February, all Americans must recommit to teaching  Black history in our homes, our schools, our churches, on TV, on  Twitter, and, yes, even in the Halls of Congress.   We must be unified and unafraid to say ``Black'' and to teach our  history and heritage. Because if we don't remember the Greensboro Four,  Rosa Parks, Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Hattie  McDaniel, Frederick Douglass, Harriet and Dred Scott, Nat Turner,  Harriet Tubman, and countless others, someday, somewhere, someone will  have to endure what they endured to win, yet again, the rights and the  respect they fought for. That is why for me, every month, Mr. Speaker,  is Black History Month.                            ____________________
