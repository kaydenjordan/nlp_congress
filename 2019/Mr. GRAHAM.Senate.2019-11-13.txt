 Mr. President, No. 1, there is nobody I admire more on  foreign policy than Senator Menendez. He has been a champion of this  cause. My objection will not be to sugarcoat history, nor to rewrite  it. I just met with President Erdogan and President Trump about the S- 400 purchase and about the problems we face in Syria from the military  incursion by Turkey, and I do hope Turkey and Armenia can come together  and deal with this problem. But given where we are in Syria and some  hope that maybe we can resolve things, I object, not because of the  past but because of the future.
