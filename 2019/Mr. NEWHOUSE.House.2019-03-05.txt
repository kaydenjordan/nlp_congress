 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Karen  Miller from Richland, Washington, on her retirement and to honor her 20  years of service to the ratepayers of the Benton Public Utility  District in Washington State's Fourth Congressional District.   Karen has been a tireless advocate for the Tri-Cities community and  for the reliable, affordable power generated by central Washington's  hydroelectric dams. She has been at the forefront of the community's  efforts to ``Save Our Dams,'' spearheading rallies and events like  RiverFest, to celebrate the countless benefits of the Columbia and the  Snake River dams.   While I know the team at Benton PUD will sorely miss Karen's  enthusiasm and friendship, I am confident her service to the community  will continue.   I wish Karen and her husband, Ken, the best as they spend more time  enjoying golfing, traveling Europe, and enjoying time with their  beloved grandchildren.   Congratulations, Karen.                            ____________________
