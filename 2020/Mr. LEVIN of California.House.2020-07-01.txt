 Madam Speaker, today, the House of  Representatives took a significant step forward for the American people  by passing the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion legislative package  to invest in America's infrastructure and create jobs. I am proud to  support this legislation.   Among other things, this package will help combat the climate crisis  and grow clean energy jobs. It includes my Public Land Renewable Energy  Development Act, which facilitates renewable energy development on  public lands and sets a goal to develop 25 gigawatts of renewable  energy generation on our public lands by 2025.   I also worked to ensure that the package includes local priorities  like my Desalination Development Act, which will provide Federal  funding for desalination projects like those in my district.   Finally, the Moving Forward Act includes my amendment to authorize  nearly $3.4 billion to construct, maintain, and renovate Department of  Veterans Affairs capital infrastructure. The amendment also prioritizes  service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses to complete many of  these projects.   Ultimately, the Moving Forward Act puts our country on the path to a  more sustainable future, and I urge the Senate to take it up  immediately.                            ____________________
