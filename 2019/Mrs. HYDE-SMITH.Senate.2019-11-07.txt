 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Dr. W.  Mark Donald, who has been elected as speaker of the House of Delegates  for the American Dental Association, where he will serve a 3-year term.  Dr. Donald has long been a leader in the dental community in  Mississippi, and I look forward to seeing his success in this position  with the American Dental Association, ADA.   A native of Louisville, MS, Dr. Donald graduated from the University  of Mississippi School of Dentistry in 1988. Following graduation, he  completed his general practice residency program with the VA Medic  Center and the University of Mississippi School of Dentistry in  Jackson, MS. In 1990, Dr. Donald opened his general dentistry practice  in Louisville, MS. For three decades, Dr. Donald has been very active  in the dental community in Mississippi. He has served as speaker,  president, and as an ADA delegate for the Mississippi Dental  Association. In addition, he served as speaker and president of the  Academy of General Dentistry and as president of the Academy of General  Dentistry Foundation. His other experience includes serving as a member  of the ADA Council on Dental Practice in 2018; as chair, vice chair,  secretary/treasurer, and parliamentarian of the ADA 5th District; and  as Mississippi Mission of Mercy Project chair in 2011, 2013, and 2019.  Since 2015, Dr. Donald has taught the next generation of Mississippi  dentists as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Mississippi  School of Dentistry. In 2017, Governor Phil Bryant appointed Dr. Donald  to serve on the Mississippi Board of Dental Examiners, where he still  currently serves.   Dr. Donald's contributions, dedicated service, and commitment to  excellence have made a difference for dentists and dental patients  across my State. In his new role serving as speaker of the House of  Delegates for the American Dental Association, I believe he will  continue to commit himself to bettering the dental profession and  improving the lives of patients across the nation.   Mr. President, Mississippi is extremely proud to have Dr. Mark Donald  serving as speaker of the House of Delegates for the American Dental  Association. He has my appreciation and gratitude for all he has done  for the great state of Mississippi. I wish Dr. Donald, and his family,  all the best in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
