 Mr. President, I had the privilege to listen to my  colleague from California's oration and the privilege to hear many of  the things spoken, both by the President and by colleagues here in the  Senate, as regards to the voting rights bill that is here before us  today. I want to start off with the President's comments because I  think it frames the debate, if you will, in terms of how it is being  framed to the American people.   The President considers Georgia's new law as Jim Crow. That is a  manipulative statement. It is a cynical statement. It tries to make  people think that 2022 is the same as 1965, which is laced with  incredible irony, as our country has seen an African-American  President, an African-American Vice President, and Lieutenant Governors  of Virginia and Kentucky who are African American. Then, to brag of my  own State, as long as things are being seen through certain prisms, we  have Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, who is ethnically from India, who was  our Governor, and the first Vietnamese American elected to the U.S.  Congress. In fact, Louisiana has had a White elected mayor of  predominantly African-American New Orleans and a Black elected mayor of  predominantly White Baton Rouge. But no, this statement is somehow  manipulating people to think that we are back in Bull Connor days.    Well, if this is Jim Crow, then States like Delaware must be Jim Crow  2.0. Why is there not an outcry against Delaware?   I will point out that Georgia has more permissive voting laws than  Delaware, more early voting days than Delaware, no-excuse absentee  voting, which, by the way, the voters of New York recently rejected.  Georgia now makes ballot drop boxes permanent, which was not the case  before the pandemic. Much has been made about restricting the number of  drop boxes. I have been told that the one county pointed to is actually  a ruby red Republican county in which they dropped down to one.   If this is being done for partisan advantage, my gosh, they are not  doing a very good job of partisan maneuvering, but I would argue that  this bill is a wonderful example of partisan maneuvering.   What does it do? It is a Federal takeover of elections.   This innovation that the previous speaker, my colleague from  California, was speaking of now has to run the gamut of a Federal  official who says yea or who says nay.   It funnels tax dollars to fund political campaigns no matter how  fringe that person's perspective might be, who no self-respecting donor  would give money to online or in person, but because of this law, my  gosh, they have got a chance.   It bans commonsense voter ID laws. Now, there is this kind of myth  being promulgated that States are putting up these onerous laws that  cannot be complied with. Courts reject those laws. Courts do not allow  a State to use a mandated picture ID, issued by the State, as an ID,  and to say so is manipulative. It is manipulative in the worst way.  Courts decide the threshold, and courts decide what is reasonable and  is unreasonable, and to suggest otherwise one more time is an attempt  to manipulate people into thinking that 2022 is 1965, with all of the  implications thereof and all of the harm that does to our body politic.  Shame.   It also allows unlimited ballot harvesting--and, I think, California  might be the only State to have it in place--where you go to a homeless  shelter and have people sign up who might be addicted, mentally ill,  brain damaged and have them sign for a certain candidate. Now, you can  imagine a well-paid activist--because this bill allows activists to be  paid--might discard those ballots which are not for her candidate and  keep only those for their own candidate. This bill requires that all 50  States have it; whereas, in North Carolina, they actually booted a  candidate because he used ballot harvesting.   It also prohibits States from cleaning up their voter rolls. Now,  somehow, this is now wrong. I actually come from Louisiana, a State hit  by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After 2005, it was a tragedy for my  State, but we had tens of thousands of people who moved to other  States. Now, at some point, they registered to vote in Atlanta or in  Houston or in Dallas, and our secretary of state went back and said:  Hmm, you are on a voter roll in Louisiana, and you are on a voter roll  in Georgia. It appears that you are now paying taxes in Georgia. We are  going to drop you from our rolls.   Is anything wrong with that? Is anything wrong with pointing out that  somebody is registered to vote in two different States and then saying,  ``You are paying taxes there, so we are going to remove you from our  rolls here''?   Lastly, I will say this: It puts Democrats in charge of the FEC, a  neutral organization enforcing voter laws. I can imagine, as soon as  Republicans take charge again, we are going to do the same thing back  to the other side. We are going to attempt to manipulate voting laws to  our advantage, and it is not above either party to do that. So--I hate  to use this word, but to sanctimoniously declare that this bill is the  end of history; that partisanship is behind us; that, by golly, these  laws are going to be put in place, and forever after, we are going to  live harmoniously, is to not understand Washington, DC, where every  edge is sought, and whenever it is sought, it is exploited to keep your  particular party in power.    I say this as a Republican: I don't trust my party any more than I  trust their party. I trust the States and the courts to oversee them,  but this bill usurps that responsibility.   Now, you can say that maybe this power grab is merely in place to  distract from real issues, and there is something to be said to that.  We are debating this--whether or not to require all 50 States to allow  ballot harvesting--when we have the highest rate of inflation than we  have had in over 40 years; when Russians are about to invade Ukraine,  apparently; when there are people pouring across our southern border  and there is a looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the COVID  response is kind of being caught up with, not being preemptively  addressed, and we are discussing this.                                  Filibuster    Mr. President, let me mention one more thing--the filibuster.   I was in an interview today about the surprise medical billing bill.  My colleague from New Hampshire, who I think was in the Chamber  earlier, helped to put that together. Multiple  [[Page S297]]  colleagues ended up coming together on that. It took us 2 to 3 years to  get it done, the surprise medical billing. As of January 1 of this  year, if you get a surprise medical bill, there is a 1-800 number to  call, and you get help.   Why did it take us 2 years? We had to listen to stakeholders. We had  to get legislation that works for all. We had to go to this Republican,  that Democrat, this committee in the Senate, that committee in the  House; working with a broad coalition; even maybe, at the end, it  slipping away; but we managed to pull it together, and we passed  surprise medical billing, and it was better because of that process.   Now, that is in contrast to a bill in which a majority of Democrats  in the House and the Senate, with the President, can force through  without any input from Republicans, from the 50 percent of the United  States that voted for the other side. Well, let's guess whose advantage  that bill is going to be for. It doesn't take much to imagine.   What Mitt Romney said on the Sunday morning show--did the White House  ever call you about this voting bill? Mitt Romney said: Never called  me. That made it clear there was no effort to make this bipartisan.   We are going to break this 200-year-old filibuster that requires us  to come together to find common ground--that gives us bills that are  stronger because of it--because of a desire for partisan advantage and  knowing that once we break it and Republicans take it back, we are  going to use it the same way. This is wrong. This is wrong for our  country. It is wrong for our institution. I suppose that is why 16 of  my Democratic colleagues signed a letter last year--when, by the way,  Republicans were in control--saying that we should preserve the  filibuster.   It was recently stated that there is a disease of division infecting  our country. That is true. And blowing up the filibuster removes one of  the last things that make us come together. That is wrong, and that  will be tragic, however--however--it is framed.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to the following member of my staff: John  Wright Picard, an intern.
