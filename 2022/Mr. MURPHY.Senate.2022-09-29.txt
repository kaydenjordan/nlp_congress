 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 100th  anniversary of UNICO National, founded in Waterbury, CT, by Dr. Anthony  P. Vastola and 15 other proud Italian-Americans. UNICO began as a small  service organization, helping people in the greater Waterbury area gain  access to higher education through scholarships, promoting Italian  heritage, and contributing to charities throughout the State.   In the century since its inception, UNICO has grown into the largest  Italian-American service organization in the United States. UNICO  started as a way to combat anti-Italian prejudice and discrimination,  showing non-Italian Americans that their culture was founded in  philanthropy, civic engagement, and charity. As our Nation's Italian- American population grew, so, too, did the membership of UNICO and its  spirit of generosity.   While UNICO was founded in Connecticut, its reach stretches far past  our State's borders. When an earthquake ravaged parts of Italy, UNICO  members raised thousands of dollars to build shelters for those  affected. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, UNICO once again  rose to the occasion by supporting victims' relief funds and  restaurants around Ground Zero. By funding research to help find cures  for diseases like Cooley's anemia and cancer and giving to institutions  like the University of Connecticut and Seton Hall University, UNICO  ensures that future generation will also benefit from its members'  selflessness. The endowed chairs of modern Italian history and Italian  studies at these schools, help teach students about Italian heritage,  and work to advance UNICO's mission of eliminating discrimination.   The impact this organization has had on communities is immeasurable.  For 100 years, UNICO has been a model of service towards others. I am  proud and grateful for its work and its deep roots in Waterbury. I  can't wait to see what more the members of UNICO accomplish as they  continue their pursuit to make our world a better place.                            ____________________
