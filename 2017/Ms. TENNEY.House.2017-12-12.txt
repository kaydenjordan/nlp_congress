The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Financial Services.   After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further  amendment printed in part B of House Report 115-443, if offered by the  Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read and  shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report  equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney)  and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will  control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 years, the community financial  institution industry has undergone a dramatic transformation. Since  2006, more than 1,500 banks have failed, been acquired, or merged, due  to economic factors and the overwhelmingly expensive regulation brought  forth by the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.   During this same period, there has been a drought in de novo banks.  In fact, only five new banks charters and 16 new credit union charters  have been granted.  [[Page H9800]]    Today, for the first time in over 125 years, there are fewer than  6,000 banks and, roughly, 6,000 credit unions serving all consumers in  the United States. This is proof that the community financial  institutions need smart, commonsense regulatory relief so they can  properly serve local communities by assisting with small business  startups and consumer credit.   My bill, H.R. 3971, the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act,  would alleviate harmful burdens on small institutions across the Nation  while saving money for low-income borrowers. This bipartisan measure  would exempt small community-based institutions from mandatory escrow  requirements.   My bill will also provide relief from new regulations that have  nearly doubled the cost of servicing loans, specifically to low-income  borrowers. I know that certain institutions will wish to continue to  provide the same escrow services to their consumers, and they are  welcome to do that.   By offering these real changes, smaller institutions--like the GOP  Federal Credit Union, for example, in my district--can once again focus  their full attention on relationship lending in the community without  worry of government overregulation.   Once again, the current law mandates that all institutions follow  escrow requirements, which raises the cost of credit for those  borrowers who can least afford it, while harming small local  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I specifically thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman) for working with me on this bill, and I appreciate his support  throughout the process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of  the Financial Services Committee, control the remainder of the time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3971.   Contrary to what is implied by its title, H.R. 3971 would not provide  regulatory relief to community banks. Instead, this bill would allow a  large number of mortgage services to drop important consumer  protections and set the stage for a return of the harmful practices of  the subprime meltdown and the worst financial crisis since the Great  Depression.   Dodd-Frank tasked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with  implementing mortgage rules under the Truth in Lending Act that would  restrict the types of practices that led to the financial crisis. This  bill would harm consumers by raising the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's exemption threshold on escrow accounts requirements for higher  priced mortgage loans. Mortgages are classified as higher priced if the  annual percentage rate--or APR--exceeds the average prime offer rate by  1.5 percent, and higher priced mortgage loans often reflect riskier or  subprime borrowers.   Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau issued escrow rules that require borrowers with higher priced  mortgage loans to escrow their homeowners insurance, property taxes,  and private mortgage insurance for at least the first 5 years of their  mortgage.   Escrow accounts are an important consumer protection mechanism,  especially for higher risk borrowers, because they ensure that  homeowners have funds for these expenses, thereby reducing mortgage  default or loss of the property. In fact, before the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau issued its final rule on escrow requirements in 2013,  a Federal Reserve study from 2011 found that consumers with higher  priced mortgages that did not have an escrow account in the first year  after the consummation of their mortgage had higher instances of  default.   Escrow accounts also keep homeowners from being blindsided by  additional costs at the end of each year and provide a more accurate  monthly cost estimate for homeownership when the loan is originated.  That is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rules  are designed to ensure that homeowners understand and can meet the full  cost of homeownership.    Even though escrow accounts are particularly important for these  higher priced loans, they are certainly not unique. In fact, most  homeowners escrow these funds. Loans insured by the Federal Housing  Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture must have  borrower escrow accounts, and conventional mortgages with a loan-to- value ratio of 80 percent or higher require them as well.   I have not heard a single convincing argument as to what is so  burdensome about banks with $25 billion in assets ensuring that their  borrowers have enough money set aside every month to pay their taxes  and insurance.   Furthermore, banks with less than $2 billion in assets that serve  rural or underserved areas are already exempt from the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau's escrow requirements, which reflects the  Bureau's commitment to balanced and tailored regulations. This bill  would make a dramatic leap from the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's targeted relief and exempt banks up to $25 billion in assets,  or over 98 percent of banks, from the escrow requirement. They would  get this exemption regardless of whether they are serving underserved  borrowers and without any evidence that this large exemption would  increase access to credit for those who need it.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also addressed the fact that  large servicers, especially servicers that serviced loans they did not  own for an extended period of time, often did not adequately  communicate with customers or appropriately track paperwork. During the  crisis, this contributed to millions of unnecessary foreclosures and,  later on, several billion-dollar settlements for abusive and fraudulent  business practices.   In its rule, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also provides  other flexibilities through exemptions to the Real Estate Settlement  Procedures Act loan servicing and escrow account administration  requirements to only small bank servicers, if they and their affiliates  own the loans they service, and service no more than 5,000 loans each  year. H.R. 3971 would increase this exemption by 500 percent, from  5,000 loans a year to 30,000 loans, allowing significantly larger bank  servicers to avoid these important consumer safeguards, and only  requiring the lenders to hold the loans in portfolio for 3 years.                                time  1230    So let's be clear, homeowners do not get to choose their own mortgage  servicer, and the least we can do is ensure that they are adequately  protected after they sign on the dotted line.   As we saw leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, servicers often  choose profits over people, and that is why we need the Consumer Bureau  to look out for the needs of consumers. The Consumer Bureau has  continued to do its job in spite of the unrelenting Republican campaign  to slow it down or eliminate it completely.   Simply put, H.R. 3971 would enable larger servicers, whose incentives  are not aligned with the owners of the loans or the borrowers, to be  able to revive the abusive practices involved with predatory lending  that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. This is the second time  in less than 2 weeks that I have come before you to discuss a bill that  would erode vital consumer protections under the Truth in Lending Act  for borrowers with high-priced mortgage loans.   I cannot support legislation that would keep consumers looking at  high-cost mortgages from the vital protections and scrutiny they  deserve. For all these reasons, I oppose H.R. 3971.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentlewoman from New  York is recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling, and I thank the  gentleman from California for his amendment and work on this bill.   I think this amendment is acceptable, and adopting it will still  allow the bill to provide some regulatory relief to our small community  banks and credit unions, and it will also assist in helping our low- income borrowers in districts like mine, NY-22, where we have lost so  many community banks. I think that this will help encourage lending and  allow small community banks to again lend to people who are in lower  income levels.   I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment, and I thank the  gentleman again from California (Mr. Sherman), for his hard work on the  bill and for this bipartisan effort.   I yield back the balance of my time.
