 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule  governing House consideration of H.R. 1628, the ``American Health Care  Act of 2017,'' better known as ``Trumpcare.''   I oppose the rule, and the underlying legislation, for the following  reasons:   1. The rule under consideration is brought pursuant to ``martial  law'' rule passed yesterday which suspends the normal House procedure  and allows for same day consideration, debate, and vote of legislation  that will adversely affect the lives of everyone in America except for  the top 1 percent;   2. The underlying bill is less than 2 weeks old and has not had a  single hearing in any of the Committees of jurisdiction; and   3. The underlying bill does not reflect the input of nearly half the  Members of this body because the legislation was drafted in secret,  marked up in a single overnight session, and brought to the floor  without incorporating a single amendment or idea proposed by the  minority.   Mr. Speaker, none of us here has had a meaningful opportunity to  review the bill, ``Trumpcare 2.0'' we are being asked to vote on.   This bill has undergone significant revision from the one marked up  just last week by the Budget Committee of which I am a member.   Trumpcare 2.0 no doubt contains many sweeteners and olive branches  granted by the Administration and House Republican leaders in backroom  deals in a last ditch effort to secure the necessary votes of  Republican members to take away health care from 24 million Americans,  many of whom are among the most vulnerable persons in society.   None of these changes to the bill before us has been scored by the  Congressional Budget Office so we do not know exactly how many more  millions of Americans will be hurt.   But what is unlikely to change is that 14 million Americans will lose  Medicaid coverage and more than 52 million persons will be uninsured by  2026 under this Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the  ``Trumpcare'' converts Medicaid to a per-capita cap that is not  guaranteed to keep pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   In short, Trumpcare represents a clear and present danger to the  financial and health security of American families, and to the very  stability of our nation's health care system overall.   We should follow regular order in the consideration of all  legislation, but especially in a matter with great importance to the  American people that could impact nearly 300 million people.   For these reasons, I believe the House should reject this rule and  the underlying bill.   Instead of trying to enact the largest transfer of wealth from the  bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent in history, House Republicans  should work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act which  has and continues to make life-affirming differences for the better in  the lives of more than 300 million Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman of  the Budget Committee for his leadership.   Our mothers and our doctors have warned us about poison pills. Well,  let me say that, this morning, the Republicans are giving to the  American people a poison meal that would affect my friend, the senior  citizen, with $175 billion being taken away from Medicare; a poison  meal that will affect a young child who is being seen by a doctor.   The Children's Hospital Association, including the Texas Children's  Hospital, has said to vote ``no'' on this bill because 30 million  children will have no health insurance.   This will impact working families making $31,000 a year. They will  have to pay $4,000 more out of pocket. In 2026, under pay more for  less, $52 million Americans will be uninsured.   This poison meal is getting worse and worse.   Then, in the dark of night, what did they do?   They took away hospitalization. They took away pregnancy, maternity,  and newborn care. They took away mental health and substance abuse  care.   Those States that are experiencing the opioid abuse and epidemic,  what are they going to do?   They have threatened community health centers. They are closing rural  hospitals.   What is this disaster of TrumpCare?   It is injuring my good friend who is sitting there in the hospital  room. It is injuring Anna Nunez. It is injuring small businesses who  say that they can live better under the Affordable Care Act, and the  youngster that is a junior in college who said she would not be alive  had it not been for the Affordable Care Act.   More than half of the American people--and it is growing--are against  this bill done in the dark of night. It is the poison meal that is  keeping those who need health insurance away from health insurance.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Don't feed the American people a  poison meal.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee and the  representative of a congressional district that has benefited  enormously from the Affordable Care Act, I rise in strong and  unyielding opposition to H.R. 1628, the so-called ``American Health  Care Act,'' which more accurately should be called ``Trumpcare, the Pay  More For Less Act.''   Seven years ago yesterday, March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama  signed into law the landmark Affordable Care Act passed by the  Democratic controlled 111th Congress.   Seven years later, the verdict is in on the Affordable Care Act; the  American people have judged it a success and are adamantly opposed to  any effort to repeal a law that has brought to more than 20 million  Americans the peace of mind and security that comes with  [[Page H2412]]  knowing they have access to affordable, high quality health care.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.1 of Americans  lacked health insurance; today nearly nine of ten (89.1%) are insured,  which is the highest rate since Gallup began tracking insurance  coverage in 2008.   Because of the Affordable Healthcare Act:   1. insurance companies are banned from discriminating against anyone,  including 17 million children, with a preexisting condition, or  charging higher rates based on gender or health status;   2. 6.6 million young-adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents'  health insurance plans;   3. 100 million Americans no longer have annual or life-time limits on  healthcare coverage;   4. 6.3 million seniors in the ``donut hole'' have saved $6.1 billion  on their prescription drugs;   5. 3.2 million seniors now get free annual wellness visits under  Medicare, and   6. 360,000 Small Businesses are using the Health Care Tax Credit to  help them provide health insurance to their workers;   7. Pregnancy is no longer a pre-existing condition and women can no  longer be charged a higher rate just because they are women.   We are becoming a nation of equals when it comes to access to  affordable healthcare insurance.   The President and congressional Republicans call this enviable record  of success a ``disaster.''   The American people do not agree and that is why they reject  overwhelmingly (56%-17%) this Republican attempt to repeal the  Affordable Care Act according to the latest Quinnipiac poll.   Americans know a disaster when they see one and they see one in the  making: it is called ``Trumpcare,'' masquerading as the ``American  Health Care Act,'' which will force Americans to ``pay more for less.''   And they are right to be alarmed at what they see.   This ``Pay-More-For-Less'' bill is a massive $900 billion tax cut for  the wealthy, paid for on the backs of America's seniors, the  vulnerable, the poor, and working class households.   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill ever tried to give so much to the rich while  taking so much from the poor and working class.   Trumpcare represents the largest transfer of wealth from the bottom  99% to the top 1% in American history.   This callous Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich,  and pays for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people,  leaving 52 million uninsured, and raising costs for the poor and middle  class.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade without demanding in  return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name drugs.   To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that ``never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.''   The Pay-More-For-Less plan destroys the Medicaid program under the  cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.   CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by  2026 under the Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the bill  converts Medicaid to a per-capita cap that is not guaranteed to keep  pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid  spending in 2026.   These steep cuts will force states to drop people from Medicaid  entirely or ration care for those who most need access to comprehensive  coverage.   The Pay-More-For-Less plan undermines the health care safety net for  vulnerable populations.   Currently, Medicaid provides coverage to more than 70 million  Americans, including children, pregnant women, seniors in Medicare,  people who are too disabled to work, and parents struggling to get by  on poverty-level wages.   In addition to doctor and hospital visits, Medicaid covers long-term  services like nursing homes and home and community-based services that  allow people with chronic health conditions and disabilities to live  independently.   To date, 31 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid eligibility to  low-income adults, which, when combined with the ACA's other coverage  provisions, has helped to reduce the nation's uninsured rate to the  lowest in history.   Trumpcare throws 24 million Americans off their health insurance by  2026 according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Low-income people will be hit especially hard because 14 million  people will lose access to Medicaid by 2026 according to CBO.   Trumpcare massively shifts who gets insured in the nongroup market.   According to CBO, ``fewer lower-income people would obtain coverage  through the nongroup market under the legislation than current law,''  and, ``a larger share of enrollees in the nongroup market would be  younger people and a smaller share would be older people.''   The projected 10% reduction in premiums is not the result of better  care or efficiency--it is in large part the result of higher-cost and  older people being pushed out of a market that is also selling plans  that provide less financial protection.   People with low incomes suffer the greatest losses in coverage.   CBO projects the uninsured rate for people in their 30s and 40s with  incomes below 200% of poverty will reach 38% in 2026 under this bill,  nearly twice the rate projected under current law.   Among people aged 50-64, CBO projects 30% of those with incomes below  200% of poverty will be uninsured in 2026.   Under current law, CBO projects the uninsured rate would only be 12  percent.   Being uninsured is not about ``freedom.''   Speaker Ryan has argued that people will happily forgo insurance  coverage because this bill gives them that ``freedom.''   The argument makes as much sense as the foolish claim that slaves  came to America as ``immigrants'' seeking a better life.   The freedom to be uninsured is no freedom at all to people in their  50s and 60s with modest incomes who simply cannot afford to pay  thousands of dollars toward premiums.   They do not really have a choice.   The claim of our Republican friends that Trumpcare provides more  freedom to all Americans calls to mind the words of Anatole France:   ``The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the  poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread  from the market.''   Trumpcare raises costs for Americans nearing retirement, essentially  imposing an ``Age Tax.''   The bill allows insurance companies to charge older enrollees higher  premiums than allowed under current law, while reducing the size of  premium tax credits provided.   Again, these changes hit low-income older persons the hardest.   A 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 buying coverage in the  individual market will pay $12,900 more toward their premiums in 2026,  on average.   Trumpcare raises costs for individuals and families with modest  incomes, particularly older Americans.   A recent analysis found that in 2020, individuals with incomes of  about $31,000 would pay on average $4,000 more out of pocket for health  care--which is like getting a 13% pay cut.   And the older you are, the worse it gets.   An analysis by the Urban Institute estimates that for Americans in  their 50s and 60s, the tax credits alone would only be sufficient to  buy plans with major holes in them, such as a $30,000 deductible for  family coverage and no coverage at all of brand-name drugs or many  therapy services.   Another reason I oppose the Trumpcare bill before us is because its  draconian cuts in Medicaid funding and phase-out of Medicaid expansion  put community health centers at risk.   Community health centers are consumer-driven and patient-centered  organizations that serve as a comprehensive and cost effective primary  health care option for America's most underserved communities.   Community health centers serve as the health care home for more than  25 million patients in nearly 10,000 communities across the country.   Across the country, 550 new clinics have opened to receive 5 million  new patients since 2009.   Community health centers serve everyone regardless of ability to pay  or insurance status:   1. 71% of health center patients have incomes at or below 100% of  poverty and 92% have incomes less than 200% of poverty;   2. 49% of health center patients are on Medicaid; and   3. 24% are uninsured;   4. Community health centers annually serve on average 1.2 million  homeless patients and more than 300,000 veterans.   Community health centers reduce health care costs and produce  savings--on average, health centers save 24% per Medicaid patient when  compared to other providers.   Community health centers integrate critical medical and social  services such as oral health, mental health, substance abuse, case  management, and translation, under one roof.  [[Page H2413]]    Community health centers employ nearly 190,000 people and generate  over $45 billion in total economic activity in some of the nation's  most distressed communities.   Community health centers serve on the front lines of public health  crises such as the Zika virus and the opioid epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, community health centers are on the front lines of every  major health crisis our country faces, from providing access to care  (and employment) to veterans to addressing the opioid epidemic to  responding to public health threats like the Zika virus.   We should be providing more support and funding to community health  centers, not making it more difficult for them to serve the communities  that desperately need them by slashing Medicaid funding.   Trumpcare Republican plan leaves rural Americans worse off.   Mr. Speaker, health insurance has historically been more expensive in  rural areas because services cost more and it is hard to have a stable  individual market with a small population.   Under the Affordable Care Act, premium subsidies are tied to local  costs, which helps keeps premium costs down.   But they are not under the Republican plan.   So, under the Republican plan residents in rural areas, who tend to  be older and poorer, will pay much more and get much less health  insurance.   At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, the powerful and compelling  reasons to reject Trumpcare lies in the real world experiences of the  American people.   Let me briefly share with you the positive, life affirming difference  made by the Affordable Care Act in the lives of just three of the  millions of Americans it has helped.   Joan Fanwick: ``If Obamacare is repealed, I don't know if I'll live  to see the next President''   ``After nearly a decade of mysterious health scares, I was diagnosed  with an autoimmune disorder called Sjogren's Syndrome last year, when I  was a junior at Temple University.   ``It's a chronic illness with no known cause or cure, and without  close medical surveillance and care, it can lead to life-threatening  complications (like the blood infections I frequently experience).   ``For me, having this disorder means waking up every morning and  taking 10 different medications.   ``It also means a nurse visiting my apartment every Saturday to  insert a needle into the port in my chest, so I can give myself IV  fluids throughout the week.   ``Without insurance, my medical expenses would cost me about $1,000  per week--more than $50,000 per year. And that doesn't even include  hospitalizations.   ``My medical bills aren't cheap under Obamacare, but I can afford  them.   ``Under Obamacare, insurance companies aren't allowed to cut you off  when your costs climb so right now, the most I personally have to pay  out of pocket is $1,000 per year.''   Brian Norgaard: ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer  who Obamacare has helped tremendously.''   Brian Norgaard, a Dallas, Texas resident, called my office to express  his opposition to Trumpcare and to offer share how the Affordable Care  Act has helped small business owners like himself:   ``I am a small business owner and leadership trainer who Obamacare  has helped tremendously.   ``My wife and I both own small businesses in the Dallas, Texas area  and as a result of the huge savings we received after paying lower  [healthcare] premiums under Obamacare, we were able to reinvest those  saving into both of our businesses and the community.   ``And the healthcare we received was quality, at that.''   Ashley Walton: ``For cancer survivors, we literally live and die by  insurance''   Ashley Walton was 25 when a mole on her back turned out to be  melanoma.   She had it removed, but three years later she discovered a lump in  her abdomen.   She was then unemployed and uninsured, and so she put off going to a  doctor.   She tried to buy health insurance. Every company rejected her.   Ashley eventually became eligible for California's Medicaid program,  which had been expanded under the Affordable Care Act.   The 32-year-old Oakland resident credits her survival to the ACA.   Without it, ``I would likely be dead, and my family would likely be  bankrupt from trying to save me.''   Before any of our Republican colleagues supporting this bill cast  their vote, I urge them to reflect on the testimony of Joan, Brian, and  Ashley, and to on this question posed by a constituent to Sen. Cotton  of Arkansas at a recent town hall:   ``I've got a husband dying and we can't afford--let me tell you  something.   ``If you can get us better coverage than this [Obamacare], go for it.   ``Let me tell you what we have, plus a lot of benefits that we need.   ``We have $29 per month for my husband. Can you beat that? Can you?   With all the congestive heart failures, and open heart surgeries,  we're trying. $29 per month. And he's a hard worker.   $39 for me.''   I urge all Members to reject Trumpcare, one of the most monstrously  cruel and morally bankrupt legislative proposals ever to be considered  in this chamber.   To paraphrase a famous former reality television personality,  ``believe me, Trumpcare is a disaster.''   We should reject it and keep instead ``something terrific'' and that  is the Affordable Care Act, regarded lovingly by millions of Americans  as ``Obamacare.''                                                     March 24, 2017.      Re Changes to the Affordable Healthcare Act.       The President of the United States of America,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Greetings Mr. President: Today is a very crucial and       important day for the residents of the City of Houston's       District D, where I serve as the elected City Council Member,       which also falls under Congressional Districts 18 and 7. As a       local elected official whose mother is on a fixed income,       this will not only impact her but many other senior citizens       who I represent.        In the news, we see how the Affordable Healthcare Act is       proposed to be changed. Under the new revisions to the       healthcare bill, which is called The American Health Care       Act, about $337 Billion will be cut from the current plan       over a 10 year period causing 24 million Americans, including       Democrats, Republicans, Independents, poor and the middle       class, to lose their healthcare. This proposed health care       bill is receiving criticism from the health care providers,       some conservatives and a united Democratic Party. The       Congressional Budget Office even showed how this current       proposed plan will negatively impact everyone. What is most       concerning to me in regards to this program is the impact       that it will have on our senior citizens.        52% of my District is made up of Senior Citizens who are on       fixed incomes. These senior's will have to pay more for their       health care under this proposed American Health Care Act. In       no way is this acceptable. I am an advocate for my seniors       and I refuse to quietly sit back while this is being       considered.        I have encouraged everyone to reach out to their Members of       Congress to let them know that this isn't something that we       stand for and to work on their behalf to vote this item down       today.            Sincerely,                                                 Dwight Boykins,                                               Houston City Counsel,                                                        District D.
