 Madam President, I rise today to highlight the incredible  opportunity before us to build on the strong foundation laid in the  bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act through the Build  Back Better budget.   The bipartisan infrastructure bill will make historic investments  that will help create good-paying American jobs, upgrade our roads and  our bridges, improve access to high-speed internet, and so much more.   With the Build Back Better budget, we have the opportunity to go  beyond these initial, long overdue investments and take strong action  to help secure our future for generations to come. This budget will  provide crucial tax cuts to hard-working American families and tackle  some of the toughest challenges they are facing, like the cost of  childcare, prescription drugs, and the lack of family leave that is  paid.   This budget will create good-paying American jobs by incentivizing  the development of new clean power sources that simply cannot be  outsourced. We will finally confront the very serious and very real  threat posed to our economic and national security by climate change.   As chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee, I am working to ensure that the budget resolution makes  critical payments to electrify the Federal Government's vehicle fleet,  including the U.S. Postal Service's delivery vehicles. Not only will  this set us on a path to a more sustainable future; it helps grow  America's domestic manufacturing sector. Thanks to these investments,  American workers and companies will have greater opportunity to build  and assemble the battery cells, electric drive trains, and other auto  parts right here in the United States.   In addition to creating great jobs, we will strengthen our domestic  supply chains, reduce our dependence on foreign producers, and lead the  world in advancing clean electric vehicle technologies.   This is especially an important investment at a time when we are  seeing the effects of climate change ravage communities all across our  country. From devastating wildfires out West to severe flooding in  Michigan and across the Midwest, to destructive hurricanes along the  gulf and east coast, we simply cannot wait any longer to address the  impacts of climate change.   Just today, the United Nations climate panel released a landmark  report on climate change, calling it a ``code red'' situation for the  survival of our planet.   This budget will help limit further harmful pollution from greenhouse  gases and fossil fuels that are contributing to this worldwide crisis  by making important down payments on clean energy.   While we invest in transformative technology to help secure our  future, we also need to deal with the natural disasters that  communities are facing right now. We must protect American families and  businesses from the consequences of increasingly severe storms, floods,  and fires by making important investments in disaster mitigation  efforts   We must help communities reduce the impact of severe disasters by  addressing rising water levels, improving flood prevention and storm  water management efforts, and strengthening wildfire mitigation  efforts. These climate-change driven threats are destroying homes,  small businesses, and communities in every corner of the United States,  and this budget will ensure that we take swift action and better secure  our future and limit further destruction.   Finally, this budget will also make historic investments to tackle  one of the fastest growing threats to our national security-- cyberattacks from foreign adversaries and criminal organizations. We  must secure critical infrastructure, support State and local  governments in their efforts to increase cyber security, and overhaul  outdated and insecure Federal networks.   Over the past year, we have seen time and time again how vulnerable  information networks can be. Attacks on everything from K-12 schools  and small businesses to major oil pipelines and Agencies across the  Federal Government have played out on the front page of newspapers  across our country. Whether we are talking about our critical  infrastructure or our Federal Government, we simply cannot wait any  longer to fix these serious problems.   Targeted investments in new information technology will not only  improve our cybersecurity defenses but will also help increase  efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and save taxpayer dollars.   Cybersecurity investments will help defend our information networks  against further intrusions and breaches, protect our national security,  prevent Americans' personal information from being stolen, and help  reduce attacks that could threaten our very way of life.   These are just a few of the critical down payments we will be making  with the Build Back Better budget. Now is the time to take on some of  the biggest challenges that are facing American families. Whether it is  working to lower costs, improving access to healthcare, or ensuring our  communities can weather the next major storm or major cyberattack, the  Build Back Better budget will help ensure that we are securing the  future that we want for future generations of Americans.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory  and legacy of a trailblazer, the Honorable Isidore B. Torres, one of  the first Hispanic judges in the State of Michigan and a prominent  figure within the Michigan Latino community, who passed earlier this  year.   Born in 1947 in Texas to Chicano migrant workers, Judge Torres began  his life traveling between Texas and Michigan, following whatever work  was available, until later in his childhood when his parents settled in  Bay City, MI, so their children could receive an education. Once  settled, Judge Torres and his siblings were still expected to  contribute to the family's well-being and would come home from school  to help their mother work in sugar beet fields outside of Bay City.   Upon graduation from Bay City Central High School in 1966, a guidance  counselor advised Judge Torres not to pursue a legal education and  instead suggested other careers, particularly those that were attached  to Hispanic stereotypes and influenced by prejudice. Ignoring other's  doubts and racial biases, Judge Torres graduated with his bachelor's  degree in criminal justice from Michigan State University in 1973 and  later earned his law degree from Wayne State University in 1976.   Beginning his career with Neighborhood Legal Services in Detroit, in  1978, Judge Torres was hired by the city of Detroit as senior assistant  corporation counsel and later cofounded the law firm of Torres &  Horvath. In 1983, he was appointed by Governor Blanchard to the 36th  District Court, where he became the first Hispanic magistrate and later  judge in the Wayne County court system.  [[Page S6109]]    Eventually, Judge Torres rose to the Wayne County Circuit Court and  handled first criminal and then civil cases until he retired in 2010.  He was also appointed to serve on numerous commissions including the  Michigan Supreme Court Racial/Ethnic Task Force, Michigan Sentencing  Guidelines Commission and State Bar of Michigan Open Justice  Commission.   Throughout his successful career and during his well-earned  retirement, Judge Torres remained humble and spent a large amount of  time within the community helping people navigate whatever legal  troubles they had. He stayed strongly tied to and felt passionately  about his Chicano roots and never lost sight of what was most important  to him: working to ensure equal access to justice for all.   I ask you and my fellow colleagues to join me in celebrating the life  of the Honorable Isidore B. Torres. As we remember Judge Torres' life,  I hope his family--including spouse Goharik Karian Torres, children  Felipe Torres, Laura Torres, Marissa Savitskie, and five  grandchildren--finds comfort in the precious moments and memories they  shared with him, in the lessons he taught them, and in the love he  showed them.                            ____________________
