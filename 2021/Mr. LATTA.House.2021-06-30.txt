 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my disappointment and opposition  to the INVEST in America Act and the amendment process.   The majority has missed the mark with this so-called infrastructure  bill that doesn't even allow States to build new roads or bridges.   How are my constituents in rural Van Wert County going to get to  school, work, doctor's appointments, or the grocery store without roads  to drive on?   Rural America is not considered in this bill, and it does not  increase safety on our roads.   I filed my legislation, the SELF DRIVE Act, as an amendment to create  a Federal safety framework for autonomous vehicles, but it was not made  in order. My amendment would have supported the safe testing and  deployment of self-driving cars. This technology will save lives on  roads, improve mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities,  and keep innovation and jobs in America.   Ironically enough, an amendment expressing the sense of the House to  develop this type of Federal framework was made in order. Yet the  bipartisan solution--the actual framework to improve roadway safety-- will not be considered on the floor today.   I am disappointed this House is not prioritizing safety and American  leadership by supporting self-driving vehicles. I remain at the table  to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to enact legislation  establishing a national AV framework.
