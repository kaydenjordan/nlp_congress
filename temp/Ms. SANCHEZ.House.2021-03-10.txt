 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the American Rescue  Plan, and I want to thank Chairman Neal for his work to ensure that  this package keeps our promises.   This rescue plan is transformative. It is the biggest investment in  American families in a generation.   It puts shots in arms, money in pockets, children back to school, and  people in jobs.   It invests in research, development, and production to get vaccines  out to all Americans.   It helps keep people in their homes and apartments.   It puts food on the tables of families who are experiencing hunger.   It supports 27 million children with an expanded child tax credit.   It helps more than 17 million workers through the earned income tax  credit.   It lowers healthcare costs and helps families keep their health  coverage  [[Page H1277]]  through a provision in the bill that I coauthored with Congresswoman  McBath.   A vote for this bill is a vote for investing in the dignity of  America's families. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this relief  package.                                time  1245
