 Madam Speaker, this bill smacks of President  Barack Obama's transgender bathroom policy several years back. I  remember that, how ridiculous that was.   It was reported in Texas a young girl went into a bathroom in a  package store, was followed by a male who said he self-identified as a  female that day. More about her in a minute.   This is not an Equality Act. This is going to erode religious  freedom. This expressly exempts RFRA from being a defense if someone  has a sincerely religiously held belief.   The comment was made earlier that we are using God as an excuse. I  hardly think so. The Founders of the Constitution knew exactly what  they were doing when they provided for those protections.   If the Equality Act is passed, individuals with religious views will  be disfavored by this bill and it will not have RFRA as a tool to  defend against a violation of their religious freedom.   H.R. 5 will politicize the medical profession to the detriment of the  practitioners and the patients. It is unbelievable.    The girl that was followed into the bathroom by  the gentleman who said he self-identified as a female that day, turns  out that that man's teeth were knocked out by the girl's father who  self-identified as the tooth fairy.
