 Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from  Oregon.   I want to put this in perspective. I don't think there is a person  more bipartisan than I am. I don't think there is a person who has  signed more bills in a bipartisan way with my Republican friends than I  have--who has voted on more Republican bills or more Republican  amendments than I have as a Democrat.   I am really so frustrated. I thought that we could make this place  work. That was my purpose in being here. I truly have done everything I  possibly could. I reached out. The White House was kind enough to reach  out to me. I sat down and I talked to all of the people who are in  charge of writing this legislation from the White House. I sat down  with my colleagues. I gave them some suggestions and ideas. We brought  people together, thinking we could find a bipartisan way.   I will tell you, as I see it unfold tonight, this has been designed  not to have even me, as one Democrat, on the bill, and I want to be. I  want to be part of a reform for the first time in 30 years. I look back  at Ronald Reagan. He was a hero to all of us. He had 97 votes; 97  Senators voted for the legislation that he crafted. There were  adjustments--a give-and-take. But every time, I would think, well, if I  have some ideas, shouldn't you at least listen to me; listen to what we  think?   Two days ago, we did a press conference. I invited all of my  colleagues. I thought: Well, I and Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota  and Senator Donnelly from Indiana--I knew the three of us would show  up. I had 14 other colleagues who were craving to be involved; they  wanted to be involved. I saw my good friend, Bob Corker, Senator Corker  from Tennessee. I asked him: Can we have a few more days to look at  this? That was denied.   I don't know what it is going to take. Maybe we have hit the  proverbial wall. This is the first time I know of, in the history of  the United States of America, that we have ever done this type of major  reform without having a bipartisan objective for it. There is not one  bipartisan vote on this piece of legislation, and I am looking; I have  been looking and trying.   People have called me today from my home, asking: What have you seen?  Do you like something? I said: I haven't seen that much. I am still  trying to find the bill. I promised them: I will see something before I  vote on it. I won't be able to read it, but I am going to see it. I  want to see something.   I would love for us to take the time to sit down and work on this and  see it. I think you would be surprised. I think not only could we get  to 60, we could get above 60 votes on this, and that is what it should  be.   In 2010, I thought my Democratic colleagues who voted for the  Affordable Care Act with not one Republican on it were wrong. I thought  that was wrong. I understand from the history--I wasn't here; I was a  Governor at that time--  [[Page S7683]]  that at least they tried. They went through the markups. They went  through the hearings. They had an awful lot of input. I understand  that.   Still, I don't think any major legislation that affects every  American should go through without a bipartisan buy-in, without  bipartisan votes, without bipartisan support. If this is designed to be  a political ploy--to basically have one side, and one side only, not  wanting one Democratic vote--this will fail, and it is a shame for our  country and for my colleagues.   I have made it a point that what I thought was broken in this place-- I have never, ever campaigned against a sitting colleague. I have never  campaigned against a fellow Republican. I have never made a phone call  against a fellow Republican. I have never raised money to be spent to  try to defeat a fellow Republican, my friends, because I don't think I  could face them if I am trying to defeat them and then ask them to work  with me. I have never done that nor will I ever do that. That is not my  purpose for being here.   All I have asked for is to have the chance to work with my  colleagues. That is all I have wanted to do. I want to be part of this.  I ask, if there is any way possible, slow this down to allow me to be  involved. I would appreciate that.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:        The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. MANCHIN] moves to       commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee;        (2) make the reductions to individual tax rates for middle       class and working people permanent;        (3) would maintain at existing levels--        (A) the medical expense deduction;        (B) the student loan interest deduction;        (C) retirement savings incentives;        (D) homeownership incentives; and        (E) the historic tax credit;        (4) provide small businesses with permanent maximum tax       relief; and        (5) fully offset the changes described in paragraphs (2)       through (4) by setting the corporate tax rate at 25 percent.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Heitkamp for her  support of this motion.   Our motion would simply send this legislation back to the Senate  Finance Committee with instructions to change provisions important to  West Virginians.   First, it would call for the reductions on individual tax rates for  middle-class and working people to be made permanent. Currently,  individuals receive temporary relief, while corporate changes are made  permanent--a gimmick that provides uncertainty for West Virginia  taxpayers and North Dakotans.   Next, it directs the committee to maintain important priorities, such  as the medical expense deduction, student loan interest deduction,  retirement savings incentives, homeownership incentives, and the  historic tax credit.   It is important that we provide this permanent relief to American  taxpayers who are slated to see higher taxes as rates go up in the  later years of this bill. In my State alone, 79 percent of West  Virginians make under $75,000 and will see their taxes spike as their  tax relief expires.   Finally, the amendment calls for small businesses to receive much  needed relief and for the corporate tax rate to be set at 25 percent.  In my State, 95.6 percent of businesses are small businesses and employ  over 50 percent of West Virginians.   I urge my colleagues to support sending this bill back to committee  and to work in a bipartisan way to pass a fiscally responsible tax  reform bill that positions this country to thrive for future  generations.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.    If I could just say--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.    If I could just say--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.    I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, a 33-percent decrease from 35 percent to  25 percent is quite substantial. I have not had a corporation yet, if  you have spoken to any of them, that wouldn't be tickled to death with  25 percent. That basically sustains that we can help more people. I  think it would be great for the economy of the United States of  America, and I ask everyone to consider that. It is a most reasonable  request.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Manchin  motion to commit.
