 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 43,  which authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater  Washington Soap Box Derby.   The All-American Soap Box Derby, which first began in 1934, is the  contest of the year in Ohio's 13th Congressional District, the  Birthplace of Champions.   Through ingenuity, teamwork, and determination, more than 350  qualifiers from across the globe make their way to the Derby Downs  track in Akron, Ohio, for the Soap Box Derby World Championship,  supported by more than 1,000 volunteers and 10,000 spectators every  year.   The Soap Box Derby supports education and leadership development for  youth across the 13th District and the Nation. The competition empowers  young people, who build their own gravity-powered and STEAM-driven  cars, to learn about the value of STEM and prepare them to succeed in  the future.   Again, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and so glad to see  such an important event to our community in the Nation's Capital. I  look forward to welcoming everyone to Ohio's 13th District for the  world championship in July. Best of luck to all the competitors.                            ____________________
