 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the Muslim ban  enacted under the previous administration is a stain on our country and  our Nation's history. As we work to rebuild a humane and just  immigration system, we must start by outlawing any type of this State- sanctioned religious bigotry. We do that today by passing the NO BAN  Act.   This bill strengthens the Immigration and Nationality Act by banning  discrimination on the basis of religion. Importantly, it will prevent  any future President from enacting something like the Muslim ban in the  future by placing appropriate checks and balances on the President's  authority in this area.   Discrimination based on religion is not who we are as a nation.  Today, we can take the first step towards a more just and humane  immigration system, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting  ``yes'' on the NO BAN Act.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform.
