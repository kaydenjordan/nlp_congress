 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life  of Jack Campbell, former commander of the Indian Trail VFW Post 2423.  Sadly, Jack passed away March 10, 2020.   At 19 years old and weighing 100 pounds, Jack was too light to be  drafted, but ``things changed,'' in his words, and soon he was in  Vietnam.   Jack's service to his country did not end abroad. Upon returning, he  became  [[Page H1666]]  commander of VFW Post 2423, captain of the Honor Guard, and District 13  commander for VFW North Carolina.   Jack was a patriot who valued service, the national anthem, and the  American flag.   Citizens of Indian Trail have lost a pillar of the community.   May we all look to Mr. Campbell's example: a life well lived,  dedicated to our country and everything for which it stands.   Jo and I send our thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones.                            ____________________
