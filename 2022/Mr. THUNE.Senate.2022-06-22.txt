 Mr. President, I just want to echo what was said by my  colleague from Alaska because what we are now hearing from the  administration are ideas that they think will help ease the pressure on  gas prices in this country, but they are all gimmicky. I mean, it is  all rebates--gas card rebates or doing away with the gas tax  temporarily until September, like that is going to do anything  meaningful long term to address this supply-demand crisis that the  Senator from Alaska just alluded to.   I have to say that this administration, from the time they came into  office, has demonstrated an open hostility to oil and gas production in  this country--energy production, more generally.   The Senator from Alaska was talking about the oil pipeline. We have  one in South Dakota--that was going to run through South Dakota--the  Keystone XL Pipeline, which was killed the first day in office by the  Biden administration and, again, sent signals to those who produce  energy in this country that we are not interested in what you have to  offer. We want to move in a different direction. And that different  direction, of course, is electric vehicles, which I am not against.  Everybody might want an electric vehicle. It is a free country. But the  fact of the matter is, we will be dependent upon liquid fuels in the  foreseeable future. Since that is the case, we ought to produce it  right here in Alaska. We have vast resources.   It is an issue, fundamentally, of supply and demand. As the Senator  of Alaska pointed out, you look at Alaska, now we are talking about  getting oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from countries, other  places around the world--in some cases run by dictators--instead of  producing it right here in the United States of America. That is just  tragic. It is just tragic, and the American people are paying the price  for it.   Why? Because in places like Alaska where we have abundant resources,  they shut it down. They shut down  [[Page S3051]]  Federal lands. They started denying permits to drill, and they killed  the infrastructure that supports, in many cases, energy production in  this country.   A pipeline, for example, is not only the most efficient, but the  safest way to transport liquid fuels in this country. We need liquid  fuels. We know that. It is a fact, and we have the supply--abundant  supply is right here in the United States. All we have to do is simply  access that. Instead, we are talking about gimmicks like rebates, gas  card rebates or temporary suspension of the fuel tax in this country  which, by the way, would rob the Highway Trust Fund of the resources  that we need to build out the infrastructure in this country and to  maintain it.   There are just so many reasons and on so many levels why these are  bad ideas--so bad, in fact, that Speaker Pelosi in the House of  Representatives has previously referred to this kind of idea that the  administration is now proposing as a gimmick and something that isn't  going to provide long-term relief.   It is fundamentally an issue of supply and demand, and all we simply  have to do is turn it on. We have to get the energy producers in this  country off the sidelines, back into the game, producing oil and gas in  America in a way that will meet Americans' daily needs when they fill  up their cars and trucks with gasoline at the pump, which right now  they are being punished unnecessarily by an economy where we have  constantly rising gas prices. The average price is around $5  nationwide, literally a doubling of the gas price since this President  took office. There is a direct correlation--direct correlation--connect  the dots--to policy decisions this administration has made, which they  are now realizing and trying to come up with these gimmicky ideas to  try to deal with an issue that fundamentally could be fixed simply by  sending the right signals and encouraging and incentivizing the type of  energy production in this country that we ought to be encouraging.   And the energy producers in this country are up to it. They will meet  the demand if we simply give them the opportunity. That is what needs  to change. That is what this administration needs to be focused on, not  on shutting down gas and oil and energy production here in the United  States.                              Pro-Life Movement    Mr. President, the Dobbs case will be decided by the Supreme Court in  a matter of days now. I pray that it will be decided in favor of life  and that Roe v. Wade, a case that even pro-abortion constitutional  scholars criticized, will be overturned.   But however Dobbs is decided, the work of the pro-life movement will  continue. That work, of course, includes advocacy--attempts to change  laws that ensure that human rights of unborn human beings are  protected.   But perhaps most of all, it includes the daily work of providing help  to moms in need. Helping moms and their babies are central to the pro- life movement. Pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life  organizations provide a variety of resources to help women in  challenging circumstances. They provide supplies for moms and their  babies. They offer prenatal and parenting classes. They assist moms  with housing. They help them connect with State and local resources,  and they provide friendship and support and a listening ear to mom  going through a difficult time.   They provide agency referrals for mothers who choose to make an  adoption plan for their babies. They provide places for moms and their  babies to live while they complete their education or get back on their  feet.   During the current formula crisis, pregnancy resource centers have  helped moms struggling to find what they need to feed their babies by  providing them with free formula.   You would think that helping out moms would be pretty  uncontroversial. You would think that everyone, including individuals  who are pro-abortion, could get behind helping a struggling mom find  housing or access to prenatal care. But apparently the pro-abortion  movement finds providing material help to moms in need and letting them  know they have alternatives to abortion somehow to be pretty  threatening.   Pregnancy resource centers have frequently been a target of pro- abortion politicians in the pro-abortion movement, which have sought to  undermine their work. But things have gotten very serious in recent  weeks. Since a draft of a possible opinion in the Dobbs case was leaked  in May, pro-abortion extremists have conducted a campaign of vandalism  and violence against pregnancy resource centers and churches. Just a  few blocks away from here, one pregnancy resource center was egged and  graffitied and had its door covered in red paint. A number of others  have faced similar vandalism, and multiple pregnancy resource centers  have been the victim of arson.   A group claiming responsibility for a number of the attacks, Jane's  Revenge, released a chilling letter last week in which it declared  ``open season'' on pregnancy centers and stated:         We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against       oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and       those measures may not come in the form of something so       easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.    Well, perhaps it is not entirely shocking that some members of the  extreme abortion movement have responded to the possibility of Roe  being overturned with vandalism, arson, and threats of further attacks.   This wave of violence is deeply troubling, and these attacks need to  be taken seriously. I hope Attorney General Garland is developing a  strategy to confront this wave of vandalism and violence and to prevent  future and more serious attacks.   Earlier this month, I joined a number of my Republican colleagues in  sending a letter to the Attorney General asking about his plans for  dealing with these attacks and preventing future ones. I am  disappointed that we have yet to receive a reply to our letter. And the  President--not merely his spokesperson but the President himself-- should be out there strongly condemning these attacks and letting  everyone know that violent responses to the Dobbs decision will not be  tolerated.   After one pregnancy resource center was vandalized, its director  said:         We are not going to let intimidation change what we are       doing. It failed. It was pretty unanimous from the volunteers       and staff here that this is not going to change how we will       do business here one bit at all.    I know that attitude is reflected at other pregnancy resource  centers, and I know that, despite threats of violence, the work of  helping moms and their babies will continue.   The work of the pro-life movement represents the best of our American  tradition: providing a voice to the voiceless, standing up for the  human rights of those who have been denied them, and providing a  helping hand to neighbors in need. I am grateful to all the pro-life  Americans standing up for the human rights of unborn human beings and  helping moms and their babies get the resources they need, and win or  lose at the Supreme Court, I know that work will continue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, June 2022 marks the 85th annual Dairy  Month, and today I wish to recognize the hard work of South Dakota's  dairy industry.   Our dairy producers and processors work tirelessly to provide high- quality, safe, and nutritious products for people around the world. The  2020-2025 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlights that dairy  consumption is a critical part of a healthy, balanced diet and is the  leading source of calcium and vitamin D, critical components of bone  strength and heart health.   In 2021, the U.S. dairy industry contributed approximately $753  billion to the U.S. economy, and it supports 3.3 million jobs. South  Dakota's dairy industry is experiencing exciting growth, as seen by the  doubling of milk production between 2000 and 2020. In 2019, South  Dakota produced more than $563 million in milk and dairy products.  South Dakota is home to more than 170 dairy farms and nearly a dozen  processing facilities that support more than 6,000 jobs in our State.  Each dairy cow brings an estimated $26,000 of economic impact to  communities every year.   Our Nation's producers are also leading the way in sustainability and  efficiency. Between 2007 and 2017, they decreased their carbon  footprint by 19 percent. The industry has also successfully lowered the  water input in a gallon of milk by 30 percent. These increased  efficiencies are a window into the incredible innovation of the  agriculture industry as producers continue working to feed to the  world.   I commend the hard work and dedication of our State's dairy farmers  and processors and all that they do to continue to supply the world  with nutritious dairy products. I wish the dairy industry continued  prosperity in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize John Abdallah, an  intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several weeks.
