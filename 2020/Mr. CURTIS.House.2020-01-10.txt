 Mr. Speaker, my family tree on both sides is full of  prominent women who served in elected office. The most notable of these  is my wife's great-grandmother, Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon, a pioneer in  both government and heritage.   123 years ago, she was sworn into the Utah State Senate, becoming the  first woman in the country to hold that office. My wife is quick to  remind me that she won that office by defeating her husband.   Utah is home to some of the most capable and influential female  leaders in the Nation, and I am fortunate to have these impressive  women help advise me on all issues, and specifically those that impact  Utah women.   Because of the initiative of Martha Hughes Cannon, thousands of women  have followed in her footsteps and served in State legislatures and as  local and national leaders.   I am excited and proud to introduce a resolution dedicating January  11, 2020, as National Martha Hughes Cannon Day and honor the path that  she paved for the many women who serve today.                            ____________________
