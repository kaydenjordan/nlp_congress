 Madam Speaker, it is obvious that the administration  doesn't care about the welfare of immigrant children being separated  from their parents, but they should at least care about what kind of  long-term impact they will have on all children, those currently living  in the United States, documented or not, U.S. citizens or not.   We act like kids, all kids, don't know what is going on, but they do.  They might not watch CNN, MSNBC, or FOX, but they talk to their  classmates, siblings, teachers, and caregivers. They are hearing that  kids are being torn away from their parents. We have to ask ourselves:  What are they thinking? What goes through their minds? Are the young  ones thinking that they can be next?   I am not exaggerating because shortly after the election of Donald  Trump, my nephew cried because he thought if my sister left the  country--because she is a resident and not a U.S. citizen--that she  would not be able to return. So we know that these kids are paying  attention. Yes, we might not know for certain what they are all  thinking, but what we do know is that this policy must end now.    This must stop for the immigrant children and for all our children so  that they feel secure and safe where it is natural, where they feel  loved, and that is with their parents.
