 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 562 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 562         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 585) to       provide greater whistleblower protections for Federal       employees, increased awareness of Federal whistleblower       protections, and increased accountability and required       discipline for Federal supervisors who retaliate against       whistleblowers, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on House Resolution 562, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule  forward on behalf of the Rules Committee.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee heard testimony from our colleagues,  Congressman Paul Mitchell, Oversight and Government Reform Committee  Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, and Congresswoman Ann Kuster.  [[Page H7931]]    This rule provides for the consideration of S. 585, the Dr. Chris  Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act. The rule provides for 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the  ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and  provides for a motion to recommit.   S. 585 was authored by Senator Johnson in the Senate, and the House  companion was introduced by my friend, Congressman Sean Duffy. I want  to thank my colleagues from Wisconsin for their leadership on this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses a problem that is, unfortunately,  far too common. When Federal employees blow the whistle on questionable  practices, they face risk of retaliation and intimidation from their  own employers, even though the current Federal law is supposed to  protect them. In fact, the underlying legislation provided for by this  rule is named after an individual who ultimately took his own life  after he became the victim of retaliation related to his  whistleblowing.   Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a Department of Veterans Affairs doctor who  raised concerns that the VA might be overmedicating patients. A later  VA investigation found that Dr. Kirkpatrick's concerns were warranted,  but it was too late. Dr. Kirkpatrick had already suffered retribution  from within the VA and was eventually dismissed from the agency. On the  day of his termination, Dr. Kirkpatrick took his own life.   Dr. Kirkpatrick's story is a tragedy, one that none of us ever wants  to see repeated.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has become a de facto poster child  for hostility toward whistleblowers. In fact, according to the Office  of Special Counsel--the agency tasked with investigation and redressing  whistleblower retaliation--the OSC has seen a sharp increase in the  number of whistleblower cases from VA employees.   OSC Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner went on to say that: `` . . . it  is clear that the workplace culture in many VA facilities is hostile to  whistleblowers and actively discourages them from coming forward with  what is often critical information.''   This disturbing trend may be most visible at the VA, but the problem  of backlash against whistleblowers persists across the Federal  Government.   Let me make something clear. There are good actors and bad actors  within each agency. There are good actors who shine light on the  legitimate concerns in order to help their colleagues and the American  people. There are also good actors who listen to those concerns and  address them with integrity, and treat whistleblowers with respect.   Unfortunately, there are also bad actors. These are the ones that  this legislation seeks to address, and the problem they create is the  one that the underlying bill works to solve.   The underlying legislation provides for better training for Federal  employees so that they understand Federal whistleblower protections. It  also sets minimum disciplinary standards across all agencies for  retaliation against whistleblowers while increasing protections for  people who have the courage to speak up when they discover a problem.   The bill specifically requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  determine a plan to restrict unauthorized employee access to medical  files, which--and it disturbs me to say this--has been used as a method  of retaliation against whistleblowers.   This legislation would make much-needed changes to ensure that those  who come forward with information necessary to maintain and increase  accountability within our government do not suffer backlash as well.   Importantly, the bill also helps these individuals to know their  rights and what protections and recourse are available to them.   It is unfortunate that we need this legislation, but evidence has  indicated that we do. The underlying legislation puts bullies who have  made their nest in government agencies on notice that their behavior  won't stand. It defends brave whistleblowers and puts the bad actor  Federal employees on notice: hostile work environments that target  whistleblowers are on the bureaucracy's endangered species list.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act also builds on  the work the current administration is doing to address retribution  levied against whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Importantly, I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who agree  that we need to address this problem and that the time to do so is now.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act passed the  Senate by unanimous consent on May 25, 2017. We need to continue their  good work here today.   On behalf of the whistleblowers who have risked their careers and  safety to right wrongs in our government, we need to support this  strong and timely legislation. Calling for attention and action to  address improper behavior within the United States Government should  not be considered a risky undertaking.    Many Federal employees work day in and day out on behalf of the  American people, yet some feel threatened when they try in earnest to  make things better.   We need to continue the Senate's work on behalf of these individuals  and the Americans that they serve. Everyone deserves a government that  is accountable for its own decisions and for the actions of its agents.   Today we have a chance to make strides towards a more accountable  government. We have the opportunity to address the most pressing  problems facing whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs  and across the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's concern, especially for the  piece of legislation that is before us. I think it is a step forward  and things that we should be doing and things that are the oversight  role of this Congress, especially when we are dealing with the issue of  whistleblowers and the value that they bring, and also the culture that  seems to have pervaded.   I so appreciate the gentlewoman from Alabama and her stories. We, in  Georgia, have had similar issues. We had that in the Augusta medical  center. We also had it in others.    I think the issue here today, though, and I want to be very clear,  Mr. Speaker, many times when we come to the floor, there is this  discussion and it gets circulated that we are actually against all  Federal employees, or that every Federal employee is bad, and that none  of the Federal employees are worth their payment or whatever. That is  just not true. The work of the vast majority of the VA employees, the  workers of the vast majority of the agencies, although we may have  philosophical differences on how big some of our agencies should be or  if they should be in the role of Federal Government, at the end of the  day, the value and the worth of the Federal employee is never  questioned, at least by this Member.   But when we find bad actors, when we find bad policies, when we find  bad procedures, when we find things that inherently are wrong and they  are kept wrong, as the gentlewoman from Alabama so well pointed out,  that when the culture becomes protecting the bad and punishing the  good, then we have an issue that has developed far beyond the scope of  what it should be.   These are some of the things that we are discussing today, and I  think it is worth the time on this floor, it is worth the time on the  Senate floor, as they have already passed this bill, and I think the  concerns raised are the discussion of which has been addressed in this.   I think what we look at today is today's bill is a necessary step,  but I believe toward integrity, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues and I owe it  to our neighbors and to Federal employees who serve to increase  whistleblower protections. We need a clear path for public servants to  serve Americans with the knowledge that we will honor their good  character and courage. They should not feel alone in their resolve to  improve the VA or any other agency. Yet too often, we have seen the  current law leave them at the mercy of bad actors. We must strengthen  the existing statutes to address the litany of retaliations aimed at  whistleblowers.   The bill today will deter agency officials from targeting  whistleblowers for shining a light on dark flaws in their organization.  Bad actors are even today evading discipline while whistleblowers who  strive to do what is right too often endure punishment for their brave  actions.   The whistleblowers are on the losing end of a system that often  favors mischief, which means that the American public also suffers.  This bill will bring relief to Federal truth tellers and the everyday  Americans who depend on their services.   We best serve the American people by protecting whistleblowers,  addressing their concerns properly, and investigating their claims with  transparency.                                time  1315    The Federal Government exists to protect its citizens by holding  wrongdoers accountable. It is designed to support those who work to  root out wrongs in the system.   The underlying legislation brings us closer to a Federal system run  by the people and for the benefit of the people, not for the benefit of  a few bad actors who exploit its structure. It delivers justice to both  victims and bad actors, protects whistleblowers who act in good faith,  and ensures that the American Government better serves the American  people.   At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, is that not what it is all about?  At the end of the day, is it not what we as a Congress and as a House  and a Senate should be about, and that is assuring that the people who  we are elected to serve are best served by their own tax dollars  through the agencies and processes of the Federal Government to provide  basic services to our veterans, who serve in our other agencies, who,  at the core of this, actually comes down--to me, this is a protection  of whistleblowers. But in a bigger role, it is actually a protection of  the currency that is the best that can be used in our Federal agencies,  and that is the trust of the American people.   When we are in the discussion of trust in the American people, right  now, many times, if you look around, the Federal Government may not be  in that trusted role because many times they see the actions of the bad  actors as opposed to many times the very shining lights of the good  actors. Those good actors who are willing to participate and to step  forward and to be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem  need that protection.   We cannot continue to perpetuate and turn a blind eye when this is so  relevant in our government. When we do this, we stand for those whom we  serve. We stand, not only for the districts in which we are elected,  but the American people who have taken to this institution to say: I  expect my trust to be exemplified in the employees of the Federal  Government and through the stewardship of their tax dollars.   The question for us today is not do we continue to protect the system  that is broken, but the question for us is to vote ``yes'' on this  previous question, to move this rule, and to move this bill, because  this is saying we value that integrity currency, we value those who are  willing to step forward at risk of themselves, in courage, to say: This  is wrong, we need to fix it, and let the chips fall where they may.   We protect the right. We punish the wrong. That is what this bill  does.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 562 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's  [[Page H7935]]       ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal       of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question       passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in       order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of       the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House       defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition       rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  provisions of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546)  shall apply to H. Con. Res. 81 not earlier than November 2, 2017, but  on the same terms that would have adhered on October 13, 2017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
