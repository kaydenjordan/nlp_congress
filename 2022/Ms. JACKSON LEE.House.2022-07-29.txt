 Madam Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Colorado for yielding, and I thank this body for recognizing the  cruciality of where we are today as it relates to fires.   I know the gentleman's territory, but many people might not know that  Texas also is impacted by wildfires. So, I rise in strong support for  H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act for many  reasons.   One, I support my firefighters. As anyone has seen firefighters who  fight these fires being interviewed, they are in the midst of the fire.  As anyone has heard the families that look and say there is nothing  here; but for firefighters, I would not be here.   So Houston is no stranger to these weather conditions. Fifty-one  trillion gallons of water fell from Hurricane Harvey, yet wildfires are  another type of extreme weather that imperils our community, and it is  attributable to climate change, as Hurricane Harvey was.   Wildfires are often unplanned fires, which burn in a natural area  such as a forest. Along with the destruction and loss of forests caused  by blazes, there are immediate and long-term environmental impacts that  dramatically affect vital resources. Expanded areas of high-severity  fire can impact tree regeneration, soil erosion, and water quality,  and, yes, the quality of life. It can cause major destruction of  property and loss of life, and this legislation is a recognition of  attempting to address this question and address it now.    Madam Chair, this bill would boost pay and benefits  for firefighters, help the U.S. Forest Service fill gaps in fire  management staff, expand forest management projects, and reduce  hazardous fuels.   I ask my colleagues to support the underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5118, also known as the  Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act.  [[Page H7427]]    Climate change is the most important existential challenge of our  lifetime. It is not simply an issue, but a threat with credible and  uncompromising dangers to our world.   Climate change degrades living conditions, human security, and our  government's ability to meet the basic needs of their populations.   For too many years, we have heard warnings from scientists regarding  the danger to people if nothing is done to reverse the amounts of  greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.   One of the most devastating consequences of climate change is the  frequency and intensity of extreme weather disasters.   Houston is no stranger to these intense weather incidents. On August  25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm hit Texas, causing $125  billion in damages and affecting over 13 million people from Texas  through Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky.   Climatologists agree that global warming contributed to Hurricane  Harvey's impact. Studies found the amount of rainfall was between 15 to  38 percent higher because of global warming.   Rising sea levels as a result of climate change also made flooding  more likely near Gulf Coast cities. The sea levels around Houston were  six inches higher than 20 years ago. This is partly because warmer  global temperatures have been melting the ice caps in Antarctica. They  have been shrinking at 1.6 meters per year, compared to 3.8 centimeters  annually before 1992.   Global warming also stalled weather patterns in the region. That  allowed Harvey to hover over Houston instead of moving back out into  the ocean.   Wildfires are another type of extreme weather event that imperils  many regions of the country. Wildfires are often unplanned fires which  burn in a natural area such as a forest, grassland or prairie. They  have devastating consequences on a region by decimating an environment,  while weakening a community's health and economy.   Along with the destruction and loss of forest caused by blazes, there  are immediate and long-term environmental impacts that dramatically  affect vital resources. Expanded areas of high-severity fire can impact  tree regeneration, soil erosion, and water quality.   Wildfires can affect the physical, chemical, and biological quality  of streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. These changes are noticeable  for years and even decades after a fire.   The smoke from wildfires can cause eye and respiratory tract  irritation and in more severe cases, reduced lung function, bronchitis,  and an exacerbation of asthma and heart failure. Air pollution can  spread up to thousands of miles away, not just in the surrounding  region.   Property loss and damage is another consequence of wildfires. In 2020  alone, fires in the U.S. caused $21.9 billion in property damage.  What's more, eight of the 10 costliest wildfires ever in the U.S. have  taken place in the past five years.   Climate change exacerbates these conditions. Long periods of record  high temperatures as a result of climate change intensify droughts that  contribute to dry conditions and drive wildfires, which, in turn,  reinforce the cycle of environmental peril.   Wildfire risk depends on a number of factors such as temperature,  soil moisture, and the presence of trees, shrubs, and other potential  fuel. All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate  variability and climate change.   Climate change enhances the drying of organic matter in forests (the  material that burns and spreads wildfire) and has doubled the number of  large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.   The stress that extreme weather is placing on the nation cannot be  understated.   H.R. 5118 would boost pay and benefits for firefighters, help the  U.S. Forest Service fill gaps in fire management staff, and expand  forest management projects to reduce hazardous fuels.   The provisions and purpose of this bill are not new. Historically,  Congress has made numerous investments to fight drought, wildfire and  the climate crisis.   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, passed in November 2021,  dedicated $7.81 billion under Title VIII to the DOI and the Forest  Service to reduce wildfire risk and support ecosystem restoration. In  total, the bill allotted $3.369 billion aimed at reducing wildfire  risks. This amount was allocated to supporting firefighters, research  dedicated to risk mapping, satellite wildfire detection, etc.   The measure would provide $1.6 billion in annual spending on  firefighter salaries and expenses at the Forest Service, and just under  $2.4 billion annually for salaries and expenses for forest stewardship  and management in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   Forest management projects, which mainly involve reducing hazardous  fuels such as dead trees, are part of the bill, authorizing $500  million annually for that purpose. The Department of Agriculture would  select up to 20 large, landscape-scale restoration projects over five  years.   H.R. 5118 represents a continuation of bipartisan efforts to support  the reduction of wildfire risk. It is essential in order to protect  communities from the devastating consequences of wildfires and to  actively fight against the impending climate crisis. The provisions  within H.R. 5118 are essential to the protection of our ecosystems and  to the brave first responders who are tasked with wildfire recovery  efforts.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5118.   I include in the Record ``North Texas wildfire continues to grow amid  high heat'' and ``Bottle-magnified sunlight ignited paper and started a  500-acre Texas wildfire, officials say.''                      [From ABC News, July 19, 2022)]           North Texas Wildfire Continues To Grow Amid High Heat         Graford, Texas.--A North Texas wildfire continued to grow       Tuesday amid sweltering temperatures and dry conditions after       burning at least a dozen structures, officials said.        The Chalk Mountain Fire about 50 miles (80 kilometers)       southwest of Fort Worth was the largest active Texas wildfire       as of Tuesday afternoon after blackening 6,000 acres (2,400       hectares), an increase from 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares)       Tuesday morning, the Texas A&M Forest Service said. The fire,       which began Monday afternoon, was just 10% contained, and       crews using bulldozers were digging containment lines while       fire trucks and aircraft worked to extinguish the flames, the       Forest Service said.        Late Tuesday afternoon, Hood County Judge Ron Massingill       ordered the mandatory evacuation of a rural area south of       Tolar, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of Fort       Worth.        It was not yet clear how many, if any, of the 12 structures       lost as of Tuesday afternoon were residences or businesses,       Forest Service spokeswoman Mary Leathers said.        Meanwhile, crews continued to battle a wildfire that has       burned at least 10 structures, five of them homes, around a       lake in North Texas, authorities said.        The fire at Possum Kingdom Lake about 70 miles (113       kilometers) west of Fort Worth, which began Monday afternoon,       had burned about 500 acres (202 hectares) and was 10%       contained Tuesday, Forest Service spokesman Adam Turner said.       Firefighting crews were working around the clock, focusing on       protecting threatened homes in resort subdivisions along the       lake's western shore.        The area remained under a voluntary evacuation notice, the       Forest Service said.        No injuries have been reported from the fires, and their       causes were under investigation. A combination of near-      record- and record-high temperatures approaching 110 degrees       Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) combined with breezes gusting       as high as 30 mph (40-50 kph) and drought conditions leave       the region ripe for fire, the forest service said.        The National Weather Service has issued a red flag fire       warning for northern and central Texas and western and       eastern Oklahoma for Tuesday.        ``We are experiencing dry fuels to a level that we haven't       seen in the past 10 years,'' Turner said. ``Any spark that       lands in tall grass or even lands in some short grass right       now is liable to spark.''        Wildfires and intense heat in Texas and some other parts of       the United States come as unusually hot, dry weather has       gripped large swaths of Europe since last week, triggering       wildfires from Portugal to the Balkans and leading to       hundreds of heat-related deaths.                                   ____                  [From the Associated Press, July 28, 2022]   Bottle-Magnified Sunlight Ignited Paper and Started a 5oo-Acre Texas                          Wildfire, Officials Say         Sunlight magnified by glass bottles in an open garbage can       ignite paper trash, starting a 500-acre North Texas wildfire       that destroyed five homes, fire officials said Thursday.        The July 18 fire on Possum Kingdom Lake's western shore,       about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, took eight days to fully       contain.        Chief Bonnie Watkins of the Possum Kingdom West Side       Volunteer Fire Department found a trash can packed with party       trash that included paper goods, food and numerous glass       bottles, according to a department statement Thursday.        Watkins concluded that a wind gust opened the can lid,       allowing sunlight magnified by the glass bottles to ignite       the paper. The fire built rapidly until the fire spilled from       the can and spread to nearby cedar trees, the statement said.        Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of       Texas, a nonprofit insurance industry association, said he       had never heard of such a freakish cause for a wildfire.        ``A fire started in a trash can is one thing, but one       caused by sunlight magnified by glass bottles? That's a new       one,'' Johnson said.        North Texas has been plagued by numerous explosive       wildfires fostered by extreme drought conditions combined       with temperatures topping 100 degrees and wind gusts.        Another fire that began the same day as the Possum Kingdom       Lake fire continued to burn Thursday about 50 miles southwest       of Fort Worth. However, a multi-agency firefighting team       continued to make slow by  [[Page H7428]]       steady progress in containing the Chalk Mountain Fire that       has blackened 10 1/2 square miles, destroyed 16 homes and       damaged five others.        In a statement, team officials said crews had improved       containment from 50% to 53% from Wednesday to Thursday and       crews suppressed a particularly stubborn portion of the fire       with bulldozers Thursday. However, they also continued to       strengthen fire lines and attack hotspots as conditions       remained critically conducive to ignitions and spreading.        The cause of the Chalk Mountain Fire has not yet been       determined.                                   ____       [From the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, July 2, 2022]                        Wildfires and Climate Change         Climate change has been a key factor in increasing the risk       and extent of wildfires in the Western United States.       Wildfire risk depends on a number of factors, including       temperature, soil moisture, and the presence of trees,       shrubs, and other potential fuel. All these factors have       strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and       climate change. Climate change enhances the drying of organic       matter in forests (the material that burns and spreads       wildfire), and has doubled the number of large fires between       1984 and 2015 in the western United States.        Research shows that changes in climate create warmer, drier       conditions. Increased drought, and a longer fire season are       boosting these increases in wildfire risk. For much of the       U.S. West, projections show that an average annual 1 degree C       temperature increase would increase the median burned area       per year as much as 600 percent in some types of forests. In       the Southeastern United States modeling suggests increased       fire risk and a longer fire season, with at least a 30       percent increase from 2011 in the area burned by lightning-      ignited wildfire by 2060.        Once a fire starts--more than 80 percent of U.S. wildfires       are caused by people--warmer temperatures and drier       conditions can help fires spread and make them harder to put       out. Warmer, drier conditions also contribute to the spread       of the mountain pine beetle and other insects that can weaken       or kill trees, building up the fuels in a forest.        Land use and forest management also affect wildfire risk.       Changes in climate add to these factors and are expected to       continue to increase the area affected by wildfires in the       United States.        Since 2000, 15 forest fires in the United States have       caused at least $1 billion in damages each, mainly from the       loss of homes and infrastructure, along with firefighting       costs. The 2017 wildfire season was well above average, with       deadly fires in California and throughout the West, including       Montana, Oregon, and Washington state. The 2018 wildfire       season went on to also break records as the deadliest and       most destructive season on record in California. NOAA       estimates the total costs of wildfires in 2017 and 2018 to be       more than $40 billion. In 2019, wildfires caused an estimated       $4.5 billion in damages in California and Alaska. Alaska's       record-breaking heat and dry conditions over the summer       months set the conditions for the state's historic wildfire       season. In 2020, five of the six largest fires on record       burned in California and Oregon saw historic levels of       wildfire spread and damage. Wildfires across the West led to       weeks-long periods of unhealthy air quality levels for       millions of people.        Wildfire can affect:        Federal and State Budgets:        U.S. Forest Service fire suppression expenditures had       increased from about 15 percent of the agency's appropriated       budget to more than 50 percent in 2017. Nationwide       suppression costs in 2017 and 2018 ballooned to $2.9 billion       and $3.1 billion respectively, while state wildfire       expenditures have also increased substantially.        Public Health:        The growing number of people in wild lands is increasing       the risk to life, property and public health. Smoke reduces       air quality and can cause eye and respiratory illness,       especially among children and the elderly. Wildfires that       burn in residential areas can melt plastic water pipes and       cause contamination of water systems with a known carcinogen.        Natural Environment:        Wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems. Although       wildfires produce a number of greenhouse gases and aerosols       including carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon, the       plants that re-colonize burned areas remove carbon from the       atmosphere, generally leading to a net neutral effect on       climate. However, when fires burn more frequently and consume       larger areas, as they are doing with climate change, the       released greenhouse gases may not be completely removed from       the atmosphere if plants can't grow to maturity before       burning, or if the plants that re-colonize are less efficient       at carbon uptake.                           How to Build Resilience         Communities, builders, homeowners, and forest managers can       reduce the likelihood and impacts of wildfires by:        Discouraging developments (especially residential) near       fire-prone forests through smart zoning rules.        Increasing the space between structures and nearby trees       and brush, and clearing space between neighboring houses.        Incorporating fire-resistant design features and materials       in buildings.        Increasing resources allocated to firefighting and fire       prevention.        Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from forests that are       at risk.        Developing recovery plans before a fire hits, and       implementing plans quickly after a fire to reduce erosion,       limit flooding, and minimize habitat damage.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We can see the lengths the Democrats have gone to to simply try to save  lives. With John Lewis we sat on the floor of the House, not regarding  what would happen to us personally after Parkland and literally said  you have got to do something. As John Lewis said: ``Never give up,  never give in, never give out,'' the moral authority of this Congress.   We failed because my friends on the other side of the aisle just  could not see the carnage and bloodshed that happened to Parkland or  Sandy Hook and elsewhere. Now we have in the backdrop El Paso. We have  Uvalde. And I repeat myself, going there days after that tragedy and  literally hugging crying 9-year-olds who should be on the playground  who are crying because of their loss and deceased friends. The story  that is so powerful, two of them, one that bled to death, and one that  smeared themselves with blood to live.   Do we now stand in the way of stopping carnage and bloodshed? And my  good friend that I have done a lot of things with, M4s, M16s are  weapons are war; if I have the correct numbers, and I believe I do.   You can pontificate about that, but, frankly, the language is  ``assault-style weapons.'' That is what it is. And assault-style  weapons still do not belong in civilians' hands because the munitions  that are used in war, when soldiers can't even bring their weapons of  war home when they are off duty or coming home to see family members or  traveling as a civilian, it is because they are killers. And that is  what killed those children in Parkland, Highland. That is what killed  them in Uvalde, in Buffalo. That is what killed these people in El  Paso, and in the hands in some instances of white supremacists.   Let me be perfectly clear, as I thank Mr. Cicilline for this  legislation, he prohibits that possession. Many of them are  grandfathered in. I wish somebody would read the bill. These are  weapons already grandfathered in. Don't frighten the American people.  What is most frightening are the parents who are outside these doors.    Madam Speaker, what is really frightening is that  parents who are outside these doors are asking the question: What are  we doing?                                time  1430    I would say the families in Buffalo, where the theme was replacement  theory, or these little babies, where is your heart in a reasonable  bill that prohibits the sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of  semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding  devices subject to grandfathering provisions but, in actuality, allows  the possession of any semiautomatic assault weapon lawfully possessed  on the date of enactment?   How much fairer can we get? I only ask my colleagues to stop  pontificating to us like we know less than you when it comes, as a  civilian, that there are weapons of war that our military has, that  there are assault-style weapons that are in the hands of citizens on  the streets of this country, and that they adapt the same munitions.  The individual in Uvalde had 350 pounds.   Madam Speaker, let us vote for the rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I think that we will spend most of our  time here today where facts will be told and then rhetorical  conversations will be told, as well.   Fact: The Constitution, in the Second Amendment, does not prohibit  the ban on assault weapons.   Fact: H.R. 1808, led by Mr. Cicilline, allows gun owners to hold  their guns. This deals with the transfer of guns.   Fact: As we can see, the lives of our children are lost through  carnage, bloodshed, and murder--fact--by the hands of an AR-15, an  assault-style weapon.   Fact: Our fellow citizens are killed by an AR-15, -14, an assault- style weapon.   Fact: Mass carnage is not done by a knife, a BB gun. It is not done  by throwing a water bomb or words. It is not done by taking a bus and  running over citizens. It is done by assault-style weapons.   So, I rise today to support H.R. 1808 because I am tired of a fact of  doing nothing.   Mayor Bowser has a right to complain about Governor Abbott generating  individuals unfairly, unjustly, and wrongly to another jurisdiction.  But the fact is that these weapons have killed.   So, without any concern, we are now offering facts. Anyone that  suggests that we are taking guns from good gun owners, we are not.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record three  articles from The Washington Post, CBS News, and KXAN.     Uvalde Parents, Highland Park Survivors Demand Assault Weapons Ban                            (By Ellie Silverman)         Kimberly Rubio keeps trying to picture the classroom       through her 10-year-old daughter Lexi's eyes, haunted by the       different ways that May day could have ended.        What side of the room did Lexi run toward with her       classmates, huddling and fearing for their lives? What if       Rubio had taken her daughter home earlier after an award       ceremony that day? What if the outside door locked properly?       What if police had immediately engaged the suspected gunman?        But the one question that lawmakers should ask themselves       every morning and night, she posed, was: ``What if the gunman       never had access to an assault weapon?''        ``We are no longer asking for change,'' Rubio, 33, said to       a cheering crowd of about 200 people at the U.S. Capitol on       Wednesday. ``We are demanding it.''        Rubio was one of several people who spoke at a rally about       the ways gun violence had irreparably harmed their lives and       demanded a federal ban on assault weapons.        Those gathered wore bright orange shirts and included       community members from Highland Park, Ill., where a gunman       killed seven adults and injured dozens more during a Fourth       of July parade, and parents of children who were among the 21       people killed in May at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde,       Tex.        Rubio's daughter Alexandria Aniyah Rubio, known as Lexi,       was one of the children killed.        Many openly grieved at the rally, crying during Rubio's       remarks. A mother at the Highland Park parade recounted how       she fled, holding her 1-year-old daughter in her arms as she       was grazed by a bullet. Parents shared the terrifying       questions they're hearing from their young children who       survived shootings. And speaker after speaker demanded more       sweeping federal action to curb the scourge of gun violence.        Last month, President Biden signed a bipartisan gun-control       bill into law, the most significant of its kind in three       decades. It expands criminal background checks for some gun       buyers, bars a larger group of domestic-violence offenders       from purchasing firearms, and funds programs that would allow       authorities to seize guns from troubled individuals. However,       gun control advocates, and Biden himself, have noted that the       legislation does not include everything they hoped for.        During an event on the White House's South Lawn on Monday       billed as ``commemorating the historic achievement of the       passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,'' the father       of a 17-year-old boy killed in the 2018 massacre at a high       school in Parkland, Fla., heckled the president. demanding       more action to curb gun violence. Biden renewed calls for a       federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition       magazines.        On Wednesday, mothers continued to step up to the lectern       near the grassy area by 1st and C streets NE and speak about       their children, friends and relatives who died of gun       violence and the ways survivors grapple with anxiety attacks,       fear and guilt. Democratic lawmakers from Illinois, including       Sen. Tammy Duckworth; Rep. Brad Schneider, whose district       includes Highland Park; and Rep. Jan Schakowsky, also spoke       at the rally before the crowd marched toward the Capitol.        Nubia Hogan, 45, stood among the crowd and held a poster       with a photo of her father, Eduardo Uvaldo.        Uvaldo was at the July Fourth parade with Hogan and their       relatives when gunfire rained on the crowd. The parade was a       family tradition and Uvaldo's favorite holiday, she said.        Hogan said she thought about how when gunfire erupted from       a nearby rooftop, she froze. Her son, Brian Hogan, 13, yelled       to run and the family tried to flee. A bullet hit Brian in       the arm and fragments hit Nubia Hogan's mother, too. Uvaldo       was also struck and was rushed to the hospital, where he died       two days later.        ``I get anxiety really bad. I get nightmares, waking up to       hearing `boom boom' like the shots,'' said Nubia Hogan, of       Waukegan, Ill. ``These types of guns should not be out there       for civilians. These are for the military and for police.''        She plans to continue with activism around this issue,       joining the many other people who have channeled their grief       into advocacy for change. Thousands of people gathered       earlier this summer on the National Mall to join the rally       staged by March for Our Lives, the organization founded by       student survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, where a       gunman killed 17 people.        Still, more than 115,000 students have been exposed to gun       violence on K-12 campuses during regular hours since the       Parkland massacre, according to a Washington Post database.        Brett Cross, 39, stood toward the back of the crowd and       said he thought about his nephew, 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia,       and how the ``system'' didn't protect his family and so many       others. The day of the shooting in Uvalde, his wife raced       over to the school where Cross said police pushed and blocked       parents from entering the building to save their children.        In the first classroom the gunman entered, Cross said, was       his nephew, ``Uzi,'' the young boy who was fast, always       racing people, and who aspired to make music, be a YouTuber       and one day become a police officer to help people.        ``Those same cops that he looked up to failed him and his       classmates,'' Cross said.        His 10-year-old son and Uzi shared a room together but now,       his son doesn't want to be in there. Cross bought a cot and       placed it next to his bed, where the two hold hands before       falling asleep.        ``He said he wanted to go to school that day so that he       could have done something,'' Cross said. ``He wants to know       why an 18-year-old kid can go buy these weapons, why it took       his brother from him.''                                   ____                      [From the CBS News, July 27, 2022]    Gunmakers Made Over $1 Billion in Assault Weapon Sales in the Past                     Decade, Congressional Report Finds                              (By Clare Hymes)         An investigation by the House Oversight and Reform       Committee found that manufacturers of the firearms used in       some of the nation's deadliest mass shootings have made over       $1 billion in revenue from military-style assault-rifles in       the past decade.        The committee said the industry reaped those profits in       part through marketing and sales tactics aimed at enticing       civilians into purchasing military-style weapons--especially       targeting younger men with opportunities to purchase       expensive firearms on credit, and by subtly referencing       extremist groups, for instance invoking imagery identified       with these groups. The findings were published ahead of an       Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday on the       marketing practices and the profits of the country's top five       gun manufacturers.        Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said the companies       market the weapons ``to children, preying on young men's       insecurities, and even appealing to violent white       supremacists.''        During the hearing, the committee heard from the CEOs of       two of those manufacturers, Christopher Killoy, president and       chief executive of Sturm, Ruger & Co, and Marty Daniel, CEO       of Daniel Defense. A rifle used in the recent mass shooting       at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that was used to       kill 21 students and teachers was made by Daniel Defense.        Smith & Wesson, President and CEO, Mark P. Smith was       invited to testify but ultimately did not appear at the       hearing. The committee announced it will be subpoenaing the       company for documents.        ``A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil.       The difference is in the intent of the individual possessing       it, which we respectfully submit should be the focus of any       investigation into the root causes of criminal violence       involving firearms,'' Killoy  [[Page H7515]]       told the committee in his opening statement. ``        The committee, which was led by the Democratic lawmakers,       produced an investigation into Smith & Wesson, Bushmaster,       Ruger, Daniel Defense and Sig Sauer that alleged that the       manufacturers engaged in ``disturbing sales tactics'' that       targeted young men as a means to ``prove their manliness,''       according to the report.        The committee also noted that despite the rise in gun       violence and the pervasiveness of mass shootings, that rifle       sales have continued to increase.        Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the firearms used at       the massacres in Highland Park, Parkland, and San Bernardino,       has made at least $695 million in revenue from AR-1-style       rifle sales alone in the past decade. Between 2019 and 2021,       its revenues more than doubled from all long guns, from $108       million to $253 million.        Daniel Defense tripled its revenues of its AR-15-style       rifles from $40 million in 2019 to over $120 million in 2021.       Since 2012 Daniel Defense has made $528 Million from AR-15       style rifles.        Ruger's earnings followed a similar trend, tripling from       $39 million in 2019 to over $103 million in 2021. Over the       past decade its AR-15-style firearm revenue totaled $514       million. Ruger's weapons were used in the massacres at       Sutherland Springs that left 25 dead, and Boulder, Colorado,       resulting in the deaths of 10 people.        Sig Sauer refused to provide the committee with figures       that would detail the revenues from AR-15 style rifles. Its       firearms were used in the mass shootings at the Pulse       Nightclub in Orlando, which killed 49 people, and at a Las       Vegas music festival where 60 died.        Bushmaster only provided the committee with revenue figures       for 2021, citing its recent acquisition by another company,       and disclosed that it had earned $2.9 million from the sales       of AR-15-style rifles. Bushmaster firearms were used in the       racially motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York that killed       10 people, and in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook       Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, where 27 died.        Maloney, said the committee found the manufacturers had       engaged in ``dangerous marketing tactics'' as part of their       efforts to sell assault weapons.        ``None of these companies take even basic steps to monitor       the deaths and injuries caused by their products,'' Maloney       said. ``That is beyond irresponsible.''        She asked the CEOs of Ruger and Daniel Defense whether they       would accept responsibiity for their companies' roles in mass       murders that took place in places like Southerland Springs,       Highland Park and Uvalde, and whether they would apologize to       victims and their families.        ``Chairwoman Maloney, these acts are committed by       murderers. The murderers are responsible,'' Daniel replied.        ``Congresswoman, with all due respect, while I grieve like       all Americans at these tragic incidents,'' Killoy said. ``To       blame the firearm is [to blame] an inanimate object.''        Earlier this month, advocates from Everytown for Gun Safety       filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, asking       it to investigate the marketing practices of Daniel Defense,       alleging the manufacturer violates the law by ``marketing       assault weapons to the civilian market with violent and       militaristic imagery'' and ``appealing particularly to the       thrill-seeking and impulsive tendencies of susceptible teens       and young men who are attracted to violence and military       fantasies.''        The FTC declined to comment regarding investigation       requests but told CBS News it has not taken any legal action       against gun manufacturers. CBS News has reviewed similar       complaints against gun manufacturers brought to the FTC since       1996 but has not found any evidence that the agency has ever       taken any action against the industry for its marketing       practices.        Daniel Defense's marketing has drawn particular scrutiny       since the Uvalde shooting for targeting ``at-risk young       men.'' Its Instagram account features photos of members of       the military holding its weapons, as well as celebrities such       as actor Josh Brolin in ``Sicario 2'' and Post Malone       wielding its products. Promotional videos from the       manufacturer also feature dramatizations of law enforcement       and military drills using their weapons.        The committee's report cites Palmetto State Armory's ``Big       Igloo Aloha'' AK-47-style assault rifle which is designed       with a floral pattern, a reference to the Boogaloo movement,       a violent far right, anti-government group which is often       associated with wearing floral-print shirts. The committee       found that Daniel Defense posted an lnstagram photo in June       2021 of its M4A1 assault rifle that had been accessorized       with a similar floral pattern.        The committee began investigating the manufacturers in May       after the mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo.        None of the five manufacturers immediately responded to CBS       News' request for comment.        The House is scheduled to vote on Friday on the first       assault weapons ban proposed since 1994.                                   ____     `I Will Not Let my Students Die in Vain': Uvalde Teacher Calls for                      Assault Weapons Ban in His Town                            (By Jala Washington)         Uvalde, Texas (Nexstar).--There's now a petition to stop       the sale of all assault rifles in Uvalde. Who is the one       helping lead this effort? A teacher who watched his students       be murdered and wounded himself.        Arnulfo Reyes, posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday       saying: ``I meant what I said and said what I meant. I will       not let my students die in vain. Now Uvalde back me up.       #uvaldeatrong.''        This comes just over two months after he lost his students       in the May 24 Robb Elementary School shooting.        The petition is addressed to Randy Klein, the principal       owner of the Oasis Outback. It's a bar and grill that also       sells ``archery supplies including ammunition, targets, tree       stands, fishing rods, reels, and tackle,'' according to its       website.        The Oasis is where the accused Uvalde gunman bought the       rifle--within days of his 18th birthday--according to       investigators.        The petition authors are a group called, ``Uvalde Strong       for Gun Safety.'' They wrote:        Mr. Klein,        As you know, on May 24, 2022, a massacre occurred in our       community at Robb Elementary School that resulted in the       untimely and tragic death of nineteen children and two       teachers. It was an assault rifle purchased at your place of       business that was used in the shooting. This tragedy will       undeniably negatively impact the community at large for       generations to come. Therefore, we write to you today with       great urgency.        Soon after the murders befell our town, we formed an       organization called Uvalde Strong for Gun Safety. Many       citizens from Uvalde and the surrounding areas are members of       this group, as well as individuals from all over the country.       We recognize that Oasis Outback has positively served the       community in several ways and performs a vital role in       contributing to our municipality's vibrancy. The members of       this group feel strongly about our second amendment rights       and support your establishment's commitment to selling guns       and ammunition. However, we come to you today with a request.        Out of RESPECT for and in support of those affected by this       catastrophe, we strongly urge you to cease the sale of       assault rifles and the ammunition paired with them. In       addition, we ask that you discontinue the handling of gun       transfers of this style of firearm from gun retail stores and       manufacturers. Doing so will ensure that children across       Uvalde County will never have to worry about a new purchase       of this type of weapon. We hope you will comply with our       request over the next thirty days.        Stand with us! Your support will help us heal as a       community. We thank you for your time.            Sincerely,                                      Uvalde Strong for Gun Safety.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for H.R. 1808.  That is a fact.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1808, the ``Assault Weapons  Ban of 2022,'' that would prohibit the sale, manufacture, transfer, or  possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity  ammunition feeding devices.   Whether we call them assault weapons or AR-15 style weapons, we all  know that we are talking about civilian versions of firearms created  for the military.   Day after day, mass shooting after mass shooting, we are confronted  with the carnage that is inflicted on the human body when these weapons  of war are used against elementary-aged children, teachers, parade- goers, high school students, worshippers, shoppers, and on and on.   In America, gun violence is the leading cause of death among children  while mass shootings occur ever increasingly each year.   It is no secret that I am adamantly opposed to assault weapons and  large capacity magazines--implements designed for war. Neither belong  in our communities.   Since the time I first joined my colleagues in the House in 2003 to  extend the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, we have seen innumerable acts  of violence and carnage perpetrated using assault weapons and large  capacity magazines.   I have hugged far too many grieving spouses and friends, wiped away  the tears of too many loved ones left behind to pick up the pieces, and  offered condolences to countless communities across the country-- including my own.   There is no debating that when paired together, large capacity  magazines and assault weapons perform as they were designed--killing  more people quickly and efficiently.   We all know that the parents in Uvalde were asked to provide DNA  swabs to identify their murdered children because they were  unrecognizable. I am tired of seeing parents bury their children--tired  of promising that we in Congress will remove these military-style  weapons from our communities--then, returning and doing nothing.   H.R. 1808 will help gradually reduce the number of assault weapons  and large capacity magazines available--keeping them out of the hands  of criminals--while reducing the number of lives lost to gun violence,  and making us all safer, the bill still recognizes that many Americans  already own assault weapons and  [[Page H7516]]  large capacity magazines and provides ways in which they can keep their  firearms, transfer them following a background check.   The evidence is clear. Bans work. During the 1994 federal assault  weapons ban was in effect, mass shooting fatalities were 70 percent  less likely to occur. And, when the large capacity ammunition feeding  device ban was in place, there were 77 percent fewer injuries from  guns.   In the past decade, gun makers have flooded the market with assault  weapons, making over $1 billion in sales, but at a tragic cost to the  rest of us.   From 2000 to 2004, the average number of people killed from active  shooter incidents per year was 22. But from 2005 to 2021, the average  number of people killed from active shooter incidents was 68.7.   We know the common denominator here--assault weapons and large  capacity magazines--and H.R. 1808 is the solution. It is time to act.   H.R. 1808 is a necessary measure that will protect Americans and  promote public safety. We should all be tired of bracing ourselves for  the next attack on another unsuspecting gathering of Americans going  about their daily lives or identifying the nearest exits as we sit and  try to enjoy time with our loved ones or hearing children tell us about  the active shooter drills they participate in at school or camp.   I thank Representative David Cicilline for his leadership on this  important measure.
