 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my Republican  colleagues, who continue to vote against reopening the government, how  they respond to their constituents who are suffering during this  inhumane shutdown.   For example, my office was contacted by the wife of a Federal  corrections officer from South Carolina's Third District. Her husband  works at the Federal prison in Edgefield, and she just had bariatric  surgery and is unable to work. She is unable to afford the vitamins her  doctor prescribed because they are not covered by insurance. Without  these vitamins, she may develop deficiencies that could cause death.   To further add to their financial difficulties, her husband, as a  correctional officer, was required to sign a document that he would not  get another job. They sacrificed a lot to build the good credit score  they have that this shutdown is impacting, and their family's finances  will be affected well into the future.   Again, I ask my colleagues across the aisle: How do you respond to  your constituents who are suffering?   They need leadership from the President, Leader McConnell, and House  Republicans to end the shutdown now. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
