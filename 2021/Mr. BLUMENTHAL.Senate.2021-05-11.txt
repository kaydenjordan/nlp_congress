 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Dr.  Saul Hertz, a pioneer for medical uses of radioiodine, RAI.   The son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, Dr. Hertz graduated from  Harvard Medical School in 1929. While serving as director of the  Massachusetts General Hospital's thyroid unit, he attended a  presentation about the use of physics in medicine. Inspired by the  concept, Dr. Hertz worked alongside Massachusetts Institute of  Technology physicist Dr. Arthur Roberts to discover the potential for  iodine radioisotopes in thyroid disease diagnosis and treatment.   On March 31, 1941, after years of experiments, Dr. Hertz administered  the first therapeutic use of radioiodine to a human patient. Never  before had humans been successfully treated with an artificially  produced radioactive material. In 1946, Dr. Hertz was the lead author  of the May issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association,  which featured a 5-year study following 29 patients he treated through  this method. Today, medical uses of RAI remain the gold standard of  targeted precision oncology.   Dr. Hertz made a number of other outstanding contributions to the  medical field. Notably, his research played an essential role in the  developing field of nuclear medicine, which was critical during World  War II and beyond. In 1949, he established the first Nuclear Medicine  Department at the Massachusetts Women's Hospital.   Dr. Hertz passed away on July 28, 1950, but his legacy is enduring.  Not only does his work continue to support extraordinary medical work,  but his memory also encourages other researchers through the Saul  Hertz, MD, Award. Bestowed by the Society for Nuclear Medicine and  Molecular Engineering, this eponymous award honors individuals who make  phenomenal strides in the radionuclide therapy field.   Dr. Hertz's archives are kept in Greenwich, CT, offering a rich  history of research in this critical field and a testament to his  brilliant, lifesaving work. This year, Greenwich, CT, First Selectman  Fred Camillo issued a proclamation, naming March 31 ``Dr. Saul Hertz  Nuclear Medicine/Radio Pharmaceutical Day.'' This recognition is a  tribute to Dr. Hertz's remarkable legacy and the impact he will forever  have on this field.   I applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in remembering Dr. Saul Hertz.                            ____________________
