 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair and our  ranking member for this bipartisan bill, and I am pleased to speak  today in support of the Postal Service Reform Act. Amongst other good  policy, this bill would finally get rid of the prefunding of retirement  health benefits that has unnecessarily marked the U.S. Postal Service's  finances in a way that other Federal agencies are not treated, nor the  private sector.   Under current law, the Postal Service is required to prefund retiree  health benefits for all current and retired employees for 75 years in  the future. This is a unique requirement, and I am pleased that this  bill that enjoys widespread support would fix this. The bill amends the  2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act to correct this  accounting problem, allowing the Postal Service to save an astonishing  $27 billion over the course of 10 years. The accounting problem led to  U.S. Postal Service showing losses annually of $5.2 billion since 2007  when the U.S. Postal Service, from 2013 to 2018, instead would have  shown a surplus of nearly $4 billion.    I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to  note my strong concerns about delayed and undelivered mail in the  District of Columbia. Throughout most of the pandemic, I have written  to the Postal Service to repeatedly raise these concerns. These  problems at the Postal  [[Page H1047]]  Service in the Nation's Capital and throughout the country need  immediate attention.   I thank Congresswoman Maloney for her leadership on this important  issue.                                time  1515
