 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the John Wesley  United Methodist Church in Cape May Courthouse in south Jersey on their  180th anniversary celebration this year.   John Wesley United Methodist Church is the oldest African American  church in all of Cape May County. John Wesley founded the church in  1840 after escaping slavery in North Carolina in 1823.   The church also is home to a cemetery, where there are veterans from  the Civil War all the way to the Vietnam war.   I was proud to attend the celebration event on Saturday, February 29.  In addition to the celebration, the congregation is planning to hold an  African  [[Page H1523]]  American cemetery tour in April of this year, which should be extremely  enlightening and interesting.   John Wesley's mission statement is that they will promote unity and  diversity within our church and our community.   I thank them for their commitment to this community. I thank them and  congratulate them on 180 years. May God's blessing be upon them.                            ____________________
