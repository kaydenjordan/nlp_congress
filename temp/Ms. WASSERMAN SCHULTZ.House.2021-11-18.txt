 Madam Speaker, I proudly rise to support the  largest investment in America's working families, a human safety net,  and the protection of the planet since FDR's New Deal.   To families facing high healthcare or childcare costs or struggling  to find affordable pre-K programs, the Build Back Better Act has your  back.   We deliver real help and support, including paid family leave and a  child tax credit extension that cuts child poverty in half and puts  money in parents' pockets each month.   It expands healthcare coverage for millions and helps seniors pay for  home care, hearing aids, and prescriptions by finally allowing Medicare  to negotiate lower drug prices.   Build Back Better also seriously tackles climate change by moving us  toward our 2030 emissions reduction goals and does it by producing  high-paying, green, union jobs.   For veterans, it invests $5 billion to upgrade aging VA hospitals and  ensures we better serve those who so bravely served.   Build Back Better is fully paid for and returns fairness to the Tax  Code by making sure corporations and America's wealthiest pay their  fair share.   Paired with the bipartisan infrastructure bill, both bills will make  life a lot better for all Americans, especially families in Florida.  Let's build back better now.
