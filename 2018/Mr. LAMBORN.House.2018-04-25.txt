 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3144, introduced by Mrs. McMorris Rodgers of  Washington, was considered by the subcommittee I chair, Water, Power,  and Oceans. It looks to provide certainty and reliability to the  Federal Columbia River Power System in the Pacific Northwest. This  system includes four large dams in the lower Snake River in Washington  State that provide the region with a number of benefits, including  renewable emission-free hydropower.   Despite all of these benefits, the power system has been mired in  third-party litigation for decades. Some litigious groups have focused  their efforts on removing the four dams in the Lower Snake under the  false assumption that it will improve endangered species. In reality,  however, these dams already have survival rates for salmon in the upper  90th percentile.   Most recently, a Federal court ordered round-the-clock spillover of  the Columbia and Snake River dams that went into effect last week.  These additional spills will do little to help the fish species, and in  reality, do nothing more than leave the region's ratepayers to foot a  spill surcharge estimated to cost up to $40 million per year.   This bill ensures that the power system is operated in accordance  with the current operations plans until certain reasonable targets are  met. It was found to be legally and scientifically sound by the Obama  administration, and has resounding support among stakeholders in the  region.   We need to ensure that science is guiding the operations of the power  system and not judicial orders and special interest ideologies. We need  a consensus approach by local stakeholders, not a mandate imposed by  judicial fiat.   This bipartisan bill is supported by trade unions, the Farm Bureau,  regional stakeholders, and a number of public utility districts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good piece of  legislation.
