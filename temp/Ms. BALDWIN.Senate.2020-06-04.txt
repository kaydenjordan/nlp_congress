 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of Milele Chikasa Anana, who passed away on May 6, 2020, at the age of  86. An activist, businesswoman, public servant, publisher, mentor, and  change-maker, she was a dynamic force in Madison for over 50 years,  helping to shape the community for the better and light the torch of  many young leaders working to improve the lives of the city's African- American community.   Milele was born and raised in Oklahoma, went to college in Alabama  and Indiana, and lived in Boston before making Madison, WI, her home in  1968 with her husband Jim. By that time, she had started a career in  computer technology and worked for the NAACP, organizing in Boston for  the educational rights of Black students.   Milele continued to develop her civic engagement and leadership in  her early years in Madison when she was elected to the Madison School  Board in 1974. She was the first African American to serve on a school  board anywhere in the State.   In another first--also in 1974--Milele became the first African- American affirmative action officer for the city of Madison, a post she  would hold for 5 years. Under her determined and steadfast advocacy,  the city made significant changes to its hiring practices to better  recruit and hire candidates of color, particularly in the police  department. She also addressed the lack of diversity on the city's  boards and commissions, bringing new perspective to bodies that were at  the time dominated by White men. Milele established the Women's Issues  Committee and the Minority Affairs Committee, giving employees of color  and female employees a greater voice. She was known to call out city  leaders when she saw injustice or inadequate progress and kept them  focused on the mission of her agency. Her impact as affirmative action  office is far-reaching to this very day.   Later in her career, Milele worked as interim director of the Madison  Equal Opportunities Commission and was a founder of the Madison Black  Chamber of Commerce, building its directory of Black-owned business and  establishing Black Restaurant Week. She has been an active member and  mentor to many organizations including the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority  Alumni Chapter, the Greater Madison Urban League, NAACP of Dane County,  and Mt. Zion Baptist Church.   Milele Chikasa Anana is perhaps best known for her leadership of  UMOJA Magazine, Wisconsin's oldest black magazine. From 1990 to 2018,  Milele served as editor and publisher, growing it from a 2-page  newsletter to a 52-page monthly publication. Milele used UMOJA to  celebrate the accomplishments and showcase the good deeds of Black  leaders, community members, business owners, and youth.   Yet, despite these significant accomplishments, ``Ms. Milele'' or  ``Mother Milele,'' as many called her, will be remembered most dearly  as a dedicated mentor. Many influential African Americans have credited  her with demonstrating the passion and persuasion that led to their  success as leaders. Countless others looked to her as a role model who  inspired them to join the fight for equal rights.   While small in stature, Milele leaves behind an enormous legacy. As a  mother of 5, grandmother of 13, and great grandmother of 4, her  character lives on as the matriarch of a loving family. Her tenacity  and determination live on in each young person she encouraged and each  leader she challenged to do better. I know I will think of Milele every  time I see the pride of accomplishment in a young African-American  woman's eyes.   I consider myself lucky to have known Milele, and I am grateful that  the depth of her spirit will continue to guide Madison toward a  brighter, more just future.                            ____________________
