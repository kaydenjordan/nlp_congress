 Mr. President, I would like to be recognized to speak on  the bill.   We will soon be moving to a vote on the so-called CHIPS legislation.  It has had several names during its consideration in the Senate and in  the House. I prefer to call it the CHIPS and Science Act. But it is an  important bipartisan piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption.   Is my friend from Vermont seeking recognition?    So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation.  It will expand American semiconductor production, create new  opportunities for research into cutting-edge technologies, and enhance  our ability to compete with China.   There is no more important competition than the one for technological  supremacy between the United States and China. The outcome will shape  the global balance of power for decades and will impact the security  and prosperity of all Americans.   Regrettably, at this moment, we are not in the driver's seat on a  range of important technologies; China is. China and other nations are  increasingly dominant in tech innovation, posing a massive threat to  not only our economy but to our national security.   But with today's vote, Congress has a chance to move us back in the  right direction and put America back into a place to win the game.   This legislation--the CHIPS and Science Act, I will call it--will  provide a historic boost to our semiconductor industry, which for too  long has played on an uneven global playing field.   Increasing American chip production is absolutely vital, given the  importance of chips to our economy, as well as our national defense.  The pandemic taught us the hard way that we cannot be dependent on  semiconductor production halfway around the globe.   But, of course, chip semiconductors are not the whole ball game. This  legislation goes much further, advancing American innovation in quantum  computing, advanced robotics, biotechnology, advanced materials, and  artificial intelligence--the full suite of technologies that we need to  outcompete China.   And instead of limiting those investments to a small handful of  institutions in five wealthy States, this bill casts a wide net,  enlisting the talent and expertise of STEM researchers nationwide. This  legislation will guarantee that EPSCoR, a program designed to stimulate  competitive research in 25 predominantly rural States, receives 20  percent of all R&D funding from the National Science Foundation, up  from the current 13 percent--13 percent now, 20 percent when it is  finally ramped up.   The bill will also reauthorize the National Science Foundation, the  gold standard for funding basic research, and it will establish a new  Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships, called TIP,  at NSF to supercharge the process of translating basic research into  technology development, and then to the commercial market, enabling us  to compete better with China across a vast range of technologies.   This legislation would not be complete without new safeguards against  espionage--which we know is taking place right now--against  intellectual property theft, for which the Chinese have become  notorious. I am pleased we were able to include a number of long- overdue reforms to protect the fruits of our Nation's R&D investments.  Even so, there is more work to be done to protect American research  across the whole of government, and I commend my friend Senator Portman  from Ohio for moving forward with his initiative, which I hope can be  incorporated into the statute at some point.   This moment has been a long time in the making, and I want to issue  some bipartisan congratulations and words of thanks.   My dear friend and colleague from the State of Washington, the chair  of the Commerce Committee, Senator Cantwell, is on the floor, and I  congratulate her and commend her and thank her for her cooperation with  me on this issue.   I want to thank Leader Schumer and Senator Young, the original  cosponsors of the Endless Frontier Act, as well as Senator Cornyn,  Senator Sinema, and many other colleagues who helped make this a better  bill.   And I also want to congratulate and commend officials from the  previous administration--from the Trump administration--who are also  telling  [[Page S3713]]  Americans about the importance of this legislation.   This is a bill that will be signed by President Joe Biden, but it is  also endorsed by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, President Trump's  International Trade Adviser; by Mike Pompeo, President Trump's CIA  Director and Secretary of State; and by Robert O'Brien, former National  Security Advisor to President Trump. So three distinguished and  knowledgeable national defense officials and foreign policy officials  are saying this about the bill we will soon vote on.   Ambassador Lighthizer, of the Trump administration, said on Kudlow 2  days ago:         We are in this existential competition with China. The       battleground of that competition is technology and chips.       That is where we are going to win it or lose it.    And he goes on to point out that the bill, while not perfect, is  exactly the bill that we can get done right now, and I don't know of  any bill that is ever perfect.   Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, a stalwart in the last  administration on national defense, says this:         Congress must pass the CHIPS Act for both our national and       economic security. We have to become less dependent on China       for critical technologies--and this is how we do it. . . . A       bipartisan bill, supporting R&D for semiconductor chip       manufacturing, is essential to securing vital technologies       for our economy and our military.    That is Mike Pompeo, President Trump's Secretary of State.   And then Robert O'Brien, former National Security Advisor to  President Trump, said:         America needs this legislation without delay.    So I want to also say a note of thanks to my own staff--my personal  staff and my committee staff--for their tireless efforts over the last  year and a half on this issue. This is the culmination of a great deal  of work by some very, very talented personnel--countless meetings, a  legislative hearing in April, a markup in May, a final vote by the  Senate in June after days and days of debate on the floor. All of these  staff members worked nights and weekends, considering and helping to  manage almost 1,000 amendments through the committee and the floor, and  all of them contributed in many ways.   I will single out for recognition my policy director, James Mazol,  who was absolutely vital to us in putting it all together, and his  entire team.   So thank you very much, Mr. President. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I think  the strong 64 votes we had yesterday on cloture was indicative of the  support, and I anticipate its passage and look forward to its  successful passage in the House of Representatives.   I yield the floor.
