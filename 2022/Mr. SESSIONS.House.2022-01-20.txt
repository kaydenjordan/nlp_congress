 Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of great respect and  mourn the loss of Dr. Marcy Zwelling from California.   Dr. Zwelling, since 2012, has headed up the National Physicians  Council for Healthcare Policy, which is a group of some 570 independent  physicians across the country. Dr. Zwelling not only challenged me but  challenged all 570 members of the Physicians Council to please advocate  on behalf of not only patients but also physicians. She dedicated her  service and life not only to patients, attempting to give them the very  best of medical help, but also for physicians. Physicians who many  times are faced with innumerable challenges, not just to provide  service but also in their own lives.   So it is today I offer to the House of Representatives the great life  of Dr. Marcy Zwelling who passed away this last weekend. May she rest  in peace. May God bless her life and that which she gave each of us.   Whether she was helping organize one of the over nine conferences of  the National Physicians Council for Healthcare Policy nationwide,  developing new screening tools for patients with cancer, or supporting  her fellow physicians, Dr. Zwelling served as an inspiration and  servant leader for myself and so many others in the medical community.  I will miss her leadership and inspiration.                            ____________________
