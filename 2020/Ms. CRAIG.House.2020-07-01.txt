 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 4116) to extend the authority for  commitments for the paycheck protection program and separate amounts  authorized for other loans under section 7(a) of the Small Business  Act, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
