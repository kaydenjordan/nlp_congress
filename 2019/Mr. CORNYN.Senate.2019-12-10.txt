 Mr. President, let me begin by commending our friend from  Oklahoma for his patience. It takes a lot of patience to get things  done around here. It also takes a lot of perseverance. Sometimes I  think that if you can't convince people, maybe you can just wear down  their resistance over time. But this is an idea whose time has come,  and I congratulate our friend from Oklahoma and Senator Hassan and  would love to join them in supporting their effort. Thank you.
