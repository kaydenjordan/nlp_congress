 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Before I walked out of my office, I first looked at my calendar. I  knew it was July, but I wondered if it was back in February. It is  another day on the floor, and it is like ``Groundhog Day'' all over  again.   Yesterday on this floor was a sad day. It is not a day about decorum.  It is not a day about any of the issues that any of my constituents ask  about.                                time  1445    They ask me when I go home, and, Madam Speaker, I envision that they  ask most every Member in this body: Have you done anything about  surprise billing? Have you made sure preexisting conditions are  protected like that bill   Greg Walden has with so many cosponsors?  Have you done anything to make sure the economy continues to grow?   No, I go home, and I tell them: They had another resolution to attack  President Trump or the administration. So we may be in July, but it is  Groundhog Day all over again.  [[Page H5946]]    Are we doing anything about a budget? Because, Madam Speaker, I  listened to my colleagues when they say: Show me your budget; show me  your values.   And I know winning a majority is important, and I knew, Madam  Speaker, when we were in the majority putting a budget out is not easy,  but it is the fundamental responsibility of a majority. So, yes, I came  to this floor hoping we would have that debate. But, no, no debate  about a budget. I can't tell my constituents that the majority did a  budget this year.   When they ask me: Well, what about I read all these things about  caps, that you have got to come into agreement to ever make something  happen together.   No, I am coming back down to the floor this time, and we are talking  about contempt.   They ask me, Madam Speaker: What contempt are you talking about?   I said: Well, it is regarding the Census.   Well, wasn't that all solved?   Well, yes, that has already been solved and already been decided,  but, Madam Speaker, this majority thinks it is another political  opportunity.   Then I listened and I heard this comment the other day. Madam  Speaker, they said: I challenge you to find voters who can name a  single thing House Democrats have done for their kitchen table this  year, a single thing, challenging all voters to name one thing.   And I wondered: Did my press operation put that out? No, it didn't  come from my office.   And then I wondered: Maybe it was another Republican inside this  body. No, it wasn't. It wasn't one Member elected on the Republican  side.   This quote actually came from a chief of staff of one of the most  prominent Members on the other side of the aisle. I agree with that  chief of staff. Name me one thing that we have done for the kitchen  table.   Yesterday we did a resolution attacking the President, but we  couldn't even get to that because, Madam Speaker, we couldn't even have  decorum in this body.   We set a record that we have never seen before based upon a Speaker's  action. The very first page in Thomas Jefferson's manual talks about  decorum. But not only did this body try to change the rules after the  fact, they don't think everybody is equal, Madam Speaker. Because if  your words get taken down, you don't have a right to speak that day.  But, no, we should change that. We should show them. The majority  should get what they want.   Madam Speaker, I guess the majority doesn't want a budget. I guess  the majority doesn't want to do anything about surprise billing. I  guess the majority doesn't want to find, when it comes to our national  defense to keep a 58-year history of bipartisanship, they broke that  record, too. They made it partisan. And that is what we did last week.   Well, now we are right back at Groundhog Day, and we are going to  have contempt votes today. But that is not all we are going to do  today. We are going to go for the third time on impeachment-- impeachment.   Madam Speaker, I watched a crisis on the border. I listened to the  other side, who asked the President if he would pause a court action so  we could deal with it, and I patiently waited those 2 weeks to have a  hearing on it because, Madam Speaker, I am not in the majority. I can't  control these committees. The majority party can.   They didn't have one hearing on it, but they have scheduled another  one. They have got Mueller coming in. They even postponed it so they  could have more time. I guess 22 months, $40 million, 13 countries, I  guess that is not enough.   Madam Speaker, I wonder if it is only one chief of staff challenging  to find voters that can name a single thing House Democrats have done  for the kitchen table this year, because when I am home, they don't  come up to me and talk to me about party; they talk to me about what  the House is doing. In their house, at their kitchen table, you know  what they talk about there? They talk about their budget, because they  do know their budget is their values, and they value having a budget.  They will talk politics, but I don't think they get too petty.   It is interesting, at the kitchen table in the House of  Representatives, there are rules for different people. I thought the  rule of law mattered in this country, and I was kind of excited when I  watched a Problem Solvers Caucus stand up together, Republicans and  Democrats, before there was a vote for a Speaker in this Congress, and  they requested a Consensus Calendar. And what does a Consensus Calendar  mean? It means, if a Member from any side of the aisle works really  hard, that they believe in the issue, that they get 290 cosponsors--and  you have to understand what that means.   That doesn't mean walking up to a Congresswoman or Congressman and  saying? Will you support my bill? Will you put your name on this? Do  you believe this policy is so great you will put your name on this?   It takes 218 to pass a bill, but that is not the number they put  out--290, to get above politics. If you made that happen, your bill  would come to the floor.   Well, that was the rule. That is what we just put in.   Madam Speaker, do you know what happened? There was this Congressman  from South Carolina. He didn't get 290. He is up to 370. He followed  the exact rule that the majority just put in. And do you know what  happened the day that he was going to be the very first bill on a  Consensus Calendar? And what was the topic that really brought people  together? Survivor benefits for those who gave their life to defend  this Nation.   I was proud. I was proud that more than 370 people in this body did  not play politics with that issue.   But do you know what happened when that day came? The rules are not  equal. The rules are not equal. They are written, but they are changed.  They were changed last Friday. They were changed so he could not have  his vote. So Congressman   Joe Wilson could not come to this floor.   Was it changed in a committee? No. They put it in a rule, self- executing.   Yesterday, when I watched decorum on this floor, any other Member of  this body would not have the right to speak if their words were taken  down, if it were me, you, anybody else. But, no, the rules were changed  once again, and everybody on one side of the aisle, Madam Speaker,  voted to change those rules; they hold people who seem to be different,  seem to be special, seems to be that they can break the rules.   I guess the majority should get what they want, not what the people  around the kitchen table of America want.   I wonder, Madam Speaker, I wonder, when I watch people campaign and  they talk about what they want to achieve here, how many said they  wanted to have a week of contempt, of impeach and resolution, all after  one entity, the President of the United States?   I didn't have anybody on any side of the aisle ever ask me that  question.   I hold this job with a great deal of respect. There are less than  12,000 people who ever had the privilege to serve here. I travel a long  way each week to have that opportunity. I spend a lot of time thinking  about it. I spend a lot of time listening and talking to my  constituents.   Last night I went home and I did a telephone townhall. Thousands of  people were on that call. Not one person asked me about the contempt of  a Census form that is already going out. They talked about an  earthquake. They wondered if they would have enough money. I said: I  don't know; we don't have a budget.   The hospital, because this community is not very big, Ridgecrest,  about 30,000, the earthquake did damage to the hospital. People can get  some surprise billings, not anything their fault, but we are not  talking about it on this floor. We are not solving that problem. But we  are holding another person in the administration in contempt.   Is this going to go anywhere? Is this going to do anything for  anybody's kitchen table?   I know some people on the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker,  might get mad at this chief of staff, but sometimes you get upset when  people speak the truth. Sometimes it hurts.   What hurts more to the American public is more of this, if it is just  going to be Groundhog Day every day that we serve here, because once we  get done with this, we will debate impeachment for the third time. For  the third time, we will debate impeachment.  [[Page H5947]]    When we go home this week and we talk about what we achieved, I don't  know what I can say. That is not why we ran. We are better than this.   When I watched the decorum yesterday, I know we are better than that.  But what is most disturbing to me is, when somebody did not abide by  the rules of the House, the rules were changed to protect that person.   America is more than a country. America is an idea, an idea of self- governance, an idea of rule of law, of respect. If you care so much to  change the rule that you would have a Consensus Calendar, abide by it,  not just because somebody on the other side of the aisle worked harder.  If you cared so much that you said a budget matters, that it sets the  tone of who you are, produce one.   I understand there are winners and losers in elections, but, Madam  Speaker, when I heard what a Member said of why they wanted to battle,  they admitted to their colleagues they were using the Census  investigation to gather information that, in his words, the courts  could use in ongoing litigation.   So are we really here because your constituents asked about it? Are  we here because you just want to play a little more politics? Because I  would tell you this: You have got another thing coming up right after  they can play politics on it one more time.   I would ask deep inside that, for once, let's put it aside. I know  that election didn't turn out the way you wanted it, but at the end of  the day, people expect us to find common ground. They expect us to give  on both sides.   I will guarantee you no one ever went to the polls to say: I want you  to go there to spend a whole week just attacking an administration. I  imagine the majority of people who voted for you had the same question  as that chief of staff. They wanted you to change the kitchen table. So  let's start focusing on the issues that the American public is talking  about around their kitchen tables.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to table the articles of  impeachment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 332,  nays 95, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 4, as follows:                               [Roll No. 483]                                 YEAS--332       Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Allred      Amash      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Axne      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (UT)      Blunt Rochester      Bost      Brady      Brindisi      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Brownley (CA)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Bustos      Byrne      Calvert      Carbajal      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Cartwright      Case      Casten (IL)      Castor (FL)      Chabot      Cheney      Chu, Judy      Cisneros      Cleaver      Cline      Cloud      Clyburn      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Conaway      Connolly      Cook      Cooper      Correa      Costa      Courtney      Cox (CA)      Craig      Crawford      Crenshaw      Crist      Crow      Cuellar      Cummings      Cunningham      Curtis      Davids (KS)      Davidson (OH)      Davis (CA)      Davis, Rodney      DeLauro      DelBene      Delgado      Demings      DesJarlais      Deutch      Diaz-Balart      Duffy      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Eshoo      Estes      Ferguson      Finkenauer      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Fletcher      Flores      Fortenberry      Foster      Foxx (NC)      Frankel      Fulcher      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gallego      Garamendi      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Golden      Gonzalez (OH)      Gonzalez (TX)      Gooden      Gosar      Gottheimer      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green (TN)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest      Guthrie      Haaland      Hagedorn      Harder (CA)      Harris      Hartzler      Hastings      Hayes      Heck      Hern, Kevin      Herrera Beutler      Hice (GA)      Higgins (LA)      Hill (AR)      Hill (CA)      Himes      Holding      Hollingsworth      Horn, Kendra S.
