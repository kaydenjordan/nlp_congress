 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  legislation, and I thank my dear friends and colleagues, Grace Meng and  Judy Chu, for their passionate leadership on this issue, and for  leading the charge on this bill today.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, this country has witnessed  a shocking rise in hate crimes against the AAPI communities. I am proud  to represent New York City's Chinatown on the Lower East Side of  Manhattan and Brooklyn's Chinatown around 8th Avenue and Sunset Park.   It goes without saying that my constituents, and every one of our  constituents, ought to be able to go to work, walk to the grocery  store, or ride public transportation without fear of a bigoted, and  even dangerous attack.    We need to bring justice to all the victims of these heinous crimes.  That is why passing this bill is a must. Vote ``yes'' and let's lead  with action. Let's send a strong message that hate and bigotry will not  be tolerated in the United States of America.
