 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to  Jody Wilson, a veteran who passed away last month.   Jody was dearly loved by her friends, family, and community. She  served bravely in the United States Army for 9 years.   After her military service, Jody served her community as a clerk, a  nurse, and later as a letter carrier for the United States Postal  Service. Her kindness, sense of humor, and infectious smile were  sources of joy for those who knew and loved her.   Arizona has lost an incredible community member, veteran, and public  servant.   Pat and I are keeping Jody's family, friends, and community in our  prayers as we mourn her passing.                            ____________________
