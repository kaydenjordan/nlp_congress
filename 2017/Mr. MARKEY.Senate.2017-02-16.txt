 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency.   When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked  Scott Pruitt for critical information on his environmental record as  attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt said no to the Environment  and Public Works Committee.   When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee asked  our fellow Republicans to delay Mr. Pruitt's vote until he got that  important information, the Republican leadership here said: No, we  won't wait for that critical information so that all Senators and the  American people can understand who is being nominated.   When I asked Scott Pruitt if he would recuse himself from all issues  relating to the cases that he has brought against the EPA as Oklahoma  attorney general, Scott Pruitt said no to me.   Today we are here to respond to these very serious issues that are  being raised about his ability to be an impartial Administrator of the  EPA because the question before the American people and the Senate is  whether Scott Pruitt should be the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency, and that answer is no.   The EPA is our cop on the beat, protecting the American people and  our environment from harmful pollution, hazardous waste, and the  impacts of climate change. But as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott  Pruitt has tried to undermine the clean water rule and the Clean Air  Act, putting the public health of millions of Americans at risk.   Scott Pruitt questions the science of climate change. Scott Pruitt  has accused the EPA of overestimating air pollution from drilling of  natural gas wells in Oklahoma. Scott Pruitt has argued against  President Obama's Clean Power Plan, which the EPA is supposed to  implement. Scott Pruitt has sued to block the EPA from restricting  mercury, a toxin that causes brain damage in children in the United  States.   The only thing that Scott Pruitt is certain of is that he wants to  represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry. He wants to change  the environmental watchdog into a polluter lapdog. And today we are  drawing a line out here on the Senate floor because it is critical that  the American people understand the moral implications for the water  Americans drink, for the air they breathe, for the mercury that could  go into the blood systems of children in our country, for the amount of  smog that is allowed to be sent into the air, the amount of haze that  is created across our country, and why the nomination of Scott Pruitt  leads inevitably, inexplicably toward more pollution, more unhealthy  air, and more unhealthy water going into the systems of our families  across our country.   That really goes to what the moral duty is of the Senate, the moral  duty we have to ordinary families across the country. Do Americans  really think the air we are breathing is too clean? Do people really  believe the water we drink is too clean? Do people really want to water  down those standards? Do they want to reduce the safeguards we have put  in place?   One hundred years ago, life expectancy in the United States was about  48 years of age. In other words, we had gone from the Garden of Eden  all the way to about 100 years ago, and we had increased life  expectancy to about 48 years of age--not much progress. Now, it was  always good for the Methuselah family. The wealthy always did pretty  well. They could protect themselves from the things that would affect  ordinary families, poorer families, from the Bible to 100 years ago.  But then what happened? All of a sudden there was an awakening in our  country that we had to make sure the sewage systems in our country were  not going to be able to pollute families across our society. Then step  by step, beginning with sewage and water, we in our Nation came to  understand that we had to remove the majority of pollutants that were  out there that were damaging the lives of ordinary Americans. That was  a change that transformed not just the United States but, over time,  the whole rest of the world.   Now, 100 years later, life expectancy goes out to age 80. In other  words, we have added 32 years of bonus life to the average American  over the last 100 years. And what did it? Well, it is no  [[Page S1248]]  secret formula; it is just that we looked around and we saw the things  we had to put in place in order to protect families, and we took a  moral responsibility to make sure that those industries, especially  those that were not providing protections, were forced to provide  protections for those ordinary people.   Here we are now considering Scott Pruitt as the new Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency. Here is what Mr. Pruitt has done  as the attorney general of Oklahoma: He has sued the national  Environmental Protection Agency for the State of Oklahoma 19 times, and  the issues on which he has sued are almost a litany of the things that  go right to the heart of the protections the American people want for  their families.   There are still eight cases that he brought pending before the EPA.   I said to Scott Pruitt in the confirmation hearing: Attorney General  Pruitt, will you recuse yourself from consideration of any of those  eight pending cases during the time you are Administrator of the EPA if  you are confirmed? And Mr. Pruitt said no. Well, as I said to him in  the hearing, if you do not recuse yourself, Mr. Pruitt, that turns you  into the plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury for all of  those cases, and that is just an unconscionable conflict of interest.  As a result, he would never be seen as an impartial Administrator at  the EPA as he moved forward trying to repeal or weaken environmental  protections through regulations that he originally sought to accomplish  through litigation.   We all know that across our country, overwhelmingly, the American  people want--in the highest possible polling numbers, Democrat and  Republican, liberal and conservative--they want the EPA to protect  clean air, clean water, public health. They don't want children  unnecessarily being exposed to pollutants in the atmosphere that can  cause asthma. Those numbers are going up. The goal in America is to see  the numbers go down, but that will not be the agenda Scott Pruitt  brings to the EPA if he is, in fact, confirmed.   This question of his fitness for this job also goes to the question  of climate change. The science of climate change is now well  established.   Pope Francis came to the Capitol a year and a half ago to deliver his  sermon on the hill to us, and what Pope Francis said to us is very  simple: No. 1, that the planet is dangerously warming and that it is  something which is being caused by human activity largely and that  those who are going to be most adversely affected are the poorest and  most vulnerable in our society. As the Pope said, we have a moral  responsibility to do something about it as the most powerful country in  the world and, along with China, the leading polluter in the world.  This is Pope Francis talking to us about climate change.   What does Scott Pruitt say about climate science? He says he is not  quite certain any actions really have to be taken in order to deal with  that issue. Well, we have a Pope who actually taught high school  chemistry and who delivered a science and morality lesson to the  Congress. He told us that science is certain, and he told us that our  moral obligation is unavoidable.   If we had a nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency who  embraced that science and morality, I would be voting for him, but that  is not who Scott Pruitt is. He is ignoring the impact the fossil fuel  industry is having, and he is unwilling to commit to taking steps that  can reduce that danger for our planet and for the most vulnerable on  the planet.   So I stand in opposition to his nomination, as I will be standing out  here all day and into the night. I don't think that we are going to  have a more important discussion than the direction of the health of  our planet and the health of the children in our country. I think it is  something that the American people have to hear all day and through the  night.   With that, I see the arrival of the Senator from Ohio. I know that he  has time to speak on the Senate floor. So I yield back my time so that  my good friend Senator Portman can be recognized.    Mr. President, I just want to follow up on what Senator  Booker has been talking about.   This is a historic nomination tonight. This reminds the country so  much of James Watt being nominated in 1981 to be the Secretary of the  Interior. That turned out disastrously. He had to resign. This reminds  the Nation of the nomination of Anne Gorsuch, in 1981, as the head of  the EPA. That ended disastrously. She had to resign.   We are just repeating history here today as we are going through the  very same stages of an administration--a radical rightwing, anti- environmental administration--that is trying to dismantle environmental  laws across our country. It did not end well back then, and this will  not end well. Scott Pruitt, as attorney general of the State of  Oklahoma, has not demonstrated the qualities that are going to be  necessary in order to protect the environment of our country.   Today, many of us recognized a day without an immigrants. Businesses  across the country closed, students did not attend classes, and workers  did not head to their jobs--in protest. In my own home State of  Massachusetts, the museum at Wellesley College took down all of the  works of art that were created and donated by immigrants. Bare walls,  empty desks, shuttered restaurants--all of these things--show us just  how essential, how fundamental immigrants are to our economy and to the  very fabric of our Nation.   Now imagine if tomorrow we recognized a day without the Environmental  Protection Agency. Imagine that--with no Environmental Protection  Agency; no Clean Air Act enforcement; no clean water rule enforcement;  no one to clean up abandoned Superfund and toxic waste sites; more  climate change; more kids with asthma; more rivers with toxins running  through them; more families with cancer; more environmental injustice  for communities of color because it is those communities, the most  vulnerable communities, that will suffer the worst consequences on a  day without the EPA.   If Scott Pruitt has his way, it won't just be a day without the EPA.  It could be a nation without the EPA. That is what Scott Pruitt wants.  That is what congressional Republicans want. That is what Donald Trump  wants--no more clean air and water protections, no more pollution  controls, no more environmental justice. That is Scott Pruitt's  favorite day. That is Scott Pruitt's EPA.   That is why we are out here tonight. We are out here tonight to begin  this warning to the country that there is trouble brewing if Scott  Pruitt is, in fact, confirmed as the next head of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   What is it that we can look forward to?   The oil, the gas, the coal industries opposed many of the Obama  administration's commonsense protections for our air, for our water,  for our climate.   One by one, Republicans in Congress are working to legislatively  overturn many of those protections. They now have twice deployed a very  rarely used procedural tool known as the Congressional Review Act to  benefit the coal, the oil, the gas industries by rolling back  environmental protections. Republicans are planning to use the  Congressional Review Act to hand out even more giveaways to the fossil  fuel industries in the coming weeks.   You can pick any industry you want--coal, oil, mining, timber,  grazing. You go through, and no matter how you spin it on the  Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' some industry gets a big giveaway.  They are trying to decide right now what is the next one they will  bring out here that waters down the protections that the American  people need in each and every one of these areas. But don't question  for a second if that is what this whole year is going to be about. Just  take oil. There will be big tax breaks for oil coming very, very soon-- like they need it. The same thing is going to be true in area after  area. We have our helpful tool here, the GOP ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' to  help viewers at home keep track of which industries the Republicans are  making the weekly winners.   Now, by nominating Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, President Trump and  Senate Republicans have found their new host for this great Republican  show--the ``Wheel of Giveaways''--and that will be Scott Pruitt,  attorney general of Oklahoma, because Scott Pruitt has already made a  career of handing out prizes to the fossil fuel industry in our  country.   As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sued to block the EPA from  restricting toxic mercury pollution from powerplants in order to  benefit the coal industry--that is right--blocking protections from  mercury that could affect the lungs of children in his own State and,  ultimately, across the whole country.   Then, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he questioned the EPA's  estimate of air pollution from new natural gas wells in Oklahoma. By  doing that, he took natural gas and oil, and he made sure that would,  as well, be something that wasn't subject to the types of regulations  that were necessary in order to protect the public health and safety.   Then he moved on, as attorney general of Oklahoma, to push for a  rollback of protections of our Nation's waterways to the benefit of  corporate polluters. Corporate polluters love to use the waterways of  our country as one big sewer. Why do you have to store that dirty  water? Why do you have to make sure that it is just not put in some  safe place when you can just use rivers? Just dump all of that garbage  right in the river. Put all of that pollution right in the river. Who  cares what impact it has upon families? Who cares what impact it has  upon children?   So, again, this ``Wheel of Giveaways'' is really a way to ensure that  the polluting industries don't have to pay to clean up the messes they  create, just pass it on to innocent families, because with Scott Pruitt  as the new host of the Republican ``Wheel of Giveaways,'' we know who  will always win every time, every week, during all 4 years of the Trump  administration. It will always be the oil industry, the natural gas  industry, the coal industry, the polluters of all stripes that  otherwise the EPA would be regulating and protecting the public health  and safety of our country.  [[Page S1293]]    It is going to ultimately be those American families who are left to  lose protections which for generations we have fought to put on the  books in order to ensure that we increase life expectancy and reduce  exposure to asthma and other diseases that otherwise, because of these  polluting companies, are going to be visited upon hundreds of thousands  and millions of families within our country.   When we think about this whole issue of the environment, many times  we say: Well, the Republicans--the coal industry, they say there is a  War on Coal in the United States of America, an absolute war, a war out  there to destroy the industry. However, upon closer examination, it  turns out that it is the free market that has been working to replace  coal with other sources of energy.   A decade ago--here are the numbers--50 percent of all electricity in  the United States came from coal; now it is down to 30 percent of all  electricity in our country. What has replaced coal? Well, the free  market has actually substituted natural gas, which has grown from a  little over 20 percent of U.S. electrical generation a decade ago to 35  percent of all electricity in our country right now. And coal has been  replaced by clean energy--by wind, which has grown to 5 to 6 percent of  our generation from almost nothing, and solar, which is up to 1 percent  of all of our electrical generation. And between wind and solar, there  are additions of 1.5 percent every single year between those two  sources, to renewable electrical generation capacity in our country. So  we can see that every year that goes by--over a 15-year period, for  example, that would be 22 percent of all electricity would be wind and  solar if we just keep on the current pace.   From the coal industry's perspective, that is terrible. That is a War  on Coal, what natural gas is doing, what wind and solar are doing. But  the reality is that they are losing it in the marketplace. Adam Smith  is spinning in his grave--so quickly, by the way, that he would  actually probably qualify as a new source of energy. So the Republican  complaint is that the free market is killing coal; it is a war. It is  capitalism, actually, and it is working. So the only way they can stop  it, the only way they can slow it down, is to get somebody like Scott  Pruitt to be the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency. This  isn't a conspiracy; it is actually a competition, and the competition  for those clean energy jobs is global.   Back in the 1990s, I was the author of a law that moved over 200  megahertz of spectrum. In 1993 in America, the average phone that was  wireless was the size of a brick. It looked like the phone Gordon Gekko  had in the movie ``Wall Street.'' People didn't have one. It cost 50  cents a minute. But I was able to move over 200 megahertz of spectrum  in 1993, and four new companies were able to compete. They both went  digital, and by 1996, this is what people had in their pocket--under 10  cents a minute, and all of a sudden everyone had this phone. It just  killed that phone that was the size of a brick.   But then another remarkable thing happened. Within 8 or 10 more  years, there was a guy out in Silicon Valley, and he came up with an  idea for an iPhone, and that revolution just kept moving because we had  opened it up to competition.   You can imagine there were devotees to the black rotary dial phone  who kept saying: Oh my goodness, it is a war on the black rotary dial  phone, all of these new devices. But it wasn't. It was just technology.  It was a revolution. It was capitalism, and it had finally been opened  to that competition after 100 years.   Well, that is what has happened in electrical generation. We finally  have passed laws that open it up to competition. It is not a secret.  And the only way to shut it down is to have someone like Scott Pruitt  as the head of the EPA because then, all of a sudden, you can have an  EPA chief who says: We are not going to have any new rules on climate  change. We are not going to have any more rules that reduce the amount  of pollution that goes up into the atmosphere. We are not going to have  any more rules that ensure that President Obama's Clean Power Plan is  implemented in our country, which would again telescope the timeframe  that it would take in order to deploy these massive amounts of new  renewable electricity sources in our country and expedite the pace at  which natural gas resources get deployed in our country.   So that is really what this is all about. It is a special interest  giveaway--pick your industry. How do we protect it? How do we make sure  we don't move beyond the 20th century? How do we not have this  incredible green generation be able to invent the new energy  technologies of this century, the same way that they invented the new  telecommunications technologies at the end of the 20th century? How do  we stop them? Well, you have to really find people who are willfully  committed to it.   Let's go to Scott Pruitt. Scott Pruitt, as the attorney general of  Oklahoma, unbelievably sued the EPA 19 times. Now, what attorney  general sues the EPA 19 times? Well, let's look at the subjects he sued  on--clean air, clean water, soot, mercury, haze. It is almost like a  laundry list of the dirtiest issues that America would want us to have  an Environmental Protection Agency working on. And he sued over and  over and over again. And even as he is being considered for  confirmation, after I questioned him in the hearing, saying: Will you  recuse yourself from any consideration of any issue that you have  already sued the agency on that is still pending, he said he would not  recuse himself.   So I said to Mr. Pruitt in that hearing: Well, if you don't recuse  yourself and you still have eight pending cases, that will make you the  plaintiff, the defendant, the judge, and the jury on these matters that  are at the heart of the clean air, clean water agenda that the American  people want to see implemented in the 21st century.   What was he doing in Oklahoma? What was he trying to accomplish?  Well, I decided to ask Mr. Pruitt some questions.   Question No. 1: I asked Mr. Pruitt to describe the actions he took as  Oklahoma's attorney general to enforce the State's environmental laws.  His response: He told me to go file an open records request.   Secondly, I asked Mr. Pruitt how much of the budget he controlled as  attorney general did he devote to Oklahoma's Office of Environmental  Enforcement. Do you know what he told me? He said: Go file an open  records request.   No. 3: I asked Mr. Pruitt how many individuals he employed in the  Office of Environmental Enforcement. Do you know what his answer was?  You are asking for too much information. Go file an open records  request.   No. 4: I learned that Mr. Pruitt had hired one of his campaign  contributors to sue the EPA, so I asked him to show me the contract.  And do you know what he told me? You are right. You guessed it. He told  me to go file an open records request.   So his answer to me over and over again was go FOIA yourself. But  that is not a sufficient answer to a Member of Congress because we  actually get the right to ask for critical information on the  environmental records of those who are applying for the job of chief  environmental protector of our country. And if you are looking for  evidence to convict Scott Pruitt on the charge of protecting public  health and the environment, he is unwilling to give it to you.   During his confirmation hearing, we heard a lot about Scott Pruitt  respecting States' rights. Scott Pruitt's record shows that he is in  favor of States' rights but only when it is good for the State of  Oklahoma and the oil industry of Oklahoma. When I asked him about  protecting the rights of States like California and Massachusetts to do  more to protect their environment, he declined to support their rights  to do that for their States.   So under Scott Pruitt, EPA is going to turn into Every Polluter's  Ally. He won't be there as the cop on the beat to ensure that those  protections are in place to ensure that every American--all 320  million--is given the protections they need. No. It will no longer be  an Agency that is a watchdog for the environment; this is an Agency  that is going to be a lap dog for polluters across our country. And if  that is the case, then we are going to see a rollback in the health,  the safety of those protections that all Americans have come to expect  in the area of the environment.  [[Page S1294]]    When we raised the issues of his conflict of interest in the  committee, we received unsatisfactory answers. When we raised the  issues of providing us the information we were going to need in order  to fully understand his complete record, we were not given the answers  we need.   Now let me once again come back to 1981 and 1982. What did James Watt  do at the Department of Interior? Well, he wound up selling off for  bargain-basement prices the coal resources in the Powder River Basin in  Wyoming. It was a scandal of massive proportion. It led to his  resignation. It was avoidable but predictable because he made very  clear what his attitude was about all of these resources.   The same thing was true over at the EPA with Anne Gorsuch. It was an  Agency that the Reagan administration, in actual reports, said that the  goal of the EPA Administrator would be to bring the Agency to its  knees--to its knees--and that became the goal during the Gorsuch time  at the EPA. So another resignation.   We have here with Scott Pruitt someone who has the same agenda, the  same goals, and the same unfortunate allies to accomplish those goals.   So I am going to continue, along with my colleagues, for the rest of  the evening to bring this case to the American people. We believe this  is a preview of coming attractions. We want America to know who Scott  Pruitt is because when he begins to take action in March, in April, and  in May, if he is confirmed, then they will know who he is very simply  because everything we are saying tonight is going to be a preview of  those coming attractions.   So at this point, I reserve the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today I spoke on the floor about  Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt and his nomination to lead the  Environmental Protection Agency. Since that time, an Oklahoma judge has  now ruled that Scott Pruitt must comply with a 2-year-old request to  release email correspondence between the attorney general's office and  fossil fuel companies, like oil company Devon Energy and coal company  Murray Energy.   After an over 2-year struggle, these communications will finally come  to light starting next Tuesday, but the Senate is due to vote on Scott  Pruitt's nomination tomorrow afternoon, Friday, at 1 p.m. Now, that  smells to the high heavens. The American people in the Senate have a  right to know what is in all of those emails that have finally been  ordered to be released by a court. Instead, what the Republican  leadership is going to do is rush to judgment, forcing Members of the  Senate to vote on this confirmation without knowing what is in all of  these emails that have been subject to litigation for the last 2 years.   Now, it is a little bit fishy because Republicans have been obsessed  with emails for over 2 years. They have spent millions of dollars on  attempts to gain access to emails during the Presidential campaign, but  now they are denying the Senate and the American public the right to  examine Scott Pruitt's emails. That, again, is not OK. The only thing  Senate Republicans seem to want to deny more than climate change is the  right of Senators to review these 3,000 emails. That, again, is not OK.  So we are going to be in a very funny situation at 1 tomorrow  afternoon. The emails are on the way. We are going to find out what was  in all of those emails. We are going to find out what kind of  correspondence Attorney General Pruitt had with all of these different  entities with which he was communicating, but the Senators will not  have it for a basis of casting a vote.   Now, maybe it is benign, but maybe it is not. Maybe that is why this  vote is being rushed. It is being rushed so the Senators don't know  what is in there; that they are blind as they vote. Then, as each email  becomes public, as each new revelation becomes public in the weeks and  months ahead, people are going to look back at this body and they are  going to say: Why could you not wait just another week so Senators  could know what was in those emails? I think there is a reason why many  people have arched eyebrows that are going up so high that it would hit  the roof a ceiling. There is a reason to be skeptical that something is  happening here that is meant to be a rush to judgment to avoid all of  the evidence being placed in front of the Senators and the American  people in terms of his nomination.   Members of the faith community are weighing in as well. They have  opposed Mr. Pruitt's nomination. I want to read portions of a letter  that the bishops of the Episcopal Church of Massachusetts sent to  President Trump:         The Episcopal Church stands strongly for the protection of       the environment. We respect the facts of science. We support       the laws and policies that address the reality of climate       change.        Our respect for our government leaders and our reverence       for the earth as God's creation impel us to write you to       express our dismay about your selection of Scott Pruitt to       head the Environmental Protection Agency.    These are the bishops of the Episcopal Church of Massachusetts. They  continue:         We wonder why a person who has consistently and adamantly       opposed all laws and policies that provide even minimal       ``protection'' to the environment should be entrusted with       leading such an agency.        President-elect Trump, you have promised economic       development. Like you, we value a stable and prosperous       economy. However, a thriving economy depends on a healthy       environment. The more we weaken and dismantle the E.P.A.'s       vital protections of our natural world, the more we threaten       the common good.        You have also promised to strengthen our national defense.       Like you, we value national security. However, our country's       top military intelligence have concluded that climate change       is a ``threat multiplier'' that is already creating       instability around the world and will likely create       significant security challenges in the years ahead. If       someone who casts doubt on the reality of climate change       becomes the head of the E.P.A., our national security will be       compromised.        As citizens of this beloved country, we intend to write our       members of Congress, urging them to block the nomination of       Scott Pruitt to lead the E.P.A. We will pray for a better       choice.    The letter is signed by the following faith leaders: Right Reverend  Douglas J. Fisher, Bishop Diocesan of Western Massachusetts; the Right  Reverend Alan M. Gates, Bishop Diocesan of Massachusetts; the Right  Reverend Gayle Harris, Bishop Suffragan of Massachusetts; the Right  Reverend Barbara C. Harris, Bishop Suffragan of Massachusetts; the  Right Reverend Roy F. Cederholm, Bishop Suffragan of Massachusetts.   The reality is, this is not just a question of these Episcopal  bishops, but Pope Francis came to the Congress just last year and  preached a sermon on the Hill, saying the planet is dangerously  warming, human activity is causing it, and we have a moral  responsibility to take action as Americans, as the House and Senate, a  moral responsibility to protect this planet that God created and those  who are the poorest and most vulnerable who will be most exposed.   This is a moral issue of the highest magnitude. The leaders of  religions all across our country are praying for us, begging us to do  something in order to protect this planet. Scott Pruitt does not intend  on taking those actions.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to continue on the subject that I  was just referencing. This is a story from Oklahoma that is on the  wires right now across the country.   Headline: ``Judge orders Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to  release emails related to fossil fuel industry.''   Let me read a little bit of this news story. This is Oklahoma City.         A judge has ruled that Americans have a right to know how       much of a relationship Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt       has with oil and gas leaders before becoming the head of the       Environmental Protection Agency.        For years, Pruitt has been an outspoken adversary of the       EPA and is currently suing the agency.  [[Page S1295]]         In December, President Donald Trump selected Pruitt to lead       the agency despite concerns from lawmakers.        A 2014 New York Times report claimed that Pruitt's ties to       Devon Energy Corporation directly influenced decisions he       made while in office in Oklahoma.        Through open records requests, the New York Times obtained       a letter written by Devon's attorneys, which was then taken       to Pruitt.        The article states, ``The attorney general's staff had       taken Devon's draft, copied it onto state government       stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to       Washington with the attorney general's signature.''        In 2014, KFOR asked for a comment to the allegations, but       received a statement focusing on the benefits of the oil       industry. . . . Six Senators from the Senate Environment and       Public Works Committee asked Pruitt to list his connections       to energy companies so they can decide whether those       interactions will affect how he will run the EPA. . . . The       Center for Media and Democracy filed nine open records       requests with the AG's office, beginning in January 2015.        ``Probably the largest request we have is for       communication: emails, phone calls, [and] scheduling related       to his involvement with various energy companies, as well as       his involvement with the republican attorney general's       association,'' attorney Blake Lawrence said.        The group alleges that Pruitt received nearly $350,000 in       campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry. They       want his dealings with those in the industry made public--and       soon.        ``Just last week our office contacted the Center for Media       and Democracy to notify them that release of their request       was imminent. The fact that they have now filed suit despite       our ongoing communications demonstrates that this is nothing       more than political theater,'' AG spokesman Lincoln Ferguson       said in a statement.        According to the Hill, Democrats asked Pruitt for the       documents as part of his confirmation hearing, but he       declined. Instead, he told them to file public records       requests themselves.        Now, a judge has ordered the Oklahoma Attorney General's       Office to turn over close to 3,000 documents related to       Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal companies,       according to E&E News.        Pruitt's office has until Tuesday to release the emails,       but his confirmation vote was originally believed to be held       Friday, Feb. 17.    Meaning today, in 5 more minutes.         ``Scott Pruitt and Senate Republicans have made a mockery       of the confirmation process, permitting the nominee to escape       scrutiny and hide his deep ties to the fossil fuel industry.       What is he hiding in all of these emails? The vote to confirm       Pruitt must now be delayed until every senator can see just       who Pruitt is and what he will do if permitted to run the       EPA,'' a statement from the Sierra Club read.    That is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen. We are 6  minutes to midnight on Thursday night. The vote is now scheduled in 13  hours 5 minutes here on the Senate floor.   These emails are going to be released next Tuesday so there can be a  public examination of them, to finally determine what is the  relationship between Scott Pruitt and these industries that he will be  given responsibility to regulate.   What are they hiding? Why are they rushing? Why will they not give  the American people the ability to find out what is inside these emails  before there is a vote on the Senate floor? Because once that vote  takes place, he will be the head of EPA, and then we will find out what  conflicts may exist, what relationships may exist, what decisions had  been made. But, no, the Senate leadership will not give the American  people the respect they deserve to ensure that all of that information  is out for public viewing so they can make an informed judgment as to  the exact nature of the relationships between this nominee for the EPA  and industries that he has had responsibility for regulating in  Oklahoma and he will have responsibility for regulating as the head of  the national Environmental Protection Agency.   It is an absolutely unacceptable policy to know that critical  information that makes it possible for the public and the Senate to  understand a candidate for such a powerful office is to be available  and yet not in fact considered as part of this historic decision.   For me, it is a ``March of Folly.'' It is just another example of how  the Republican Party, the GOP, has become the gas and oil party. That  is really what it stands for now, just committed to ensuring that they  cover up what is in these emails. They don't give the public the chance  to be able to understand what these potentially explosive relationships  may be so the Senate can deliberate fully on whether Mr. Pruitt does in  fact qualify to be an impartial head of the Environmental Protection  Agency of our country and ultimately of the world because the world  looks to us to determine where climate change is going, where  environmental protections are going, not just for our own citizens but  for theirs as well. What we do is replicated inevitably, inextricably  in the rest of the world.   This man will have one of the most powerful positions on the planet.  Emails are available right now if we just wait to help us in our  deliberation. It is really a tragedy. It is a sad commentary upon this  institution that rather than just delaying, examining, and then giving  the public the information they need in the Senate, instead we rush to  judgment. We rush to judgment, but ultimately the judgment of history  is going to be on us if it is determined, through these emails, that  Mr. Pruitt is unqualified for this position; that the conflicts which  he has had disqualify him for this position; that the emails disclosed  to us the conflicts of interest that are going to ultimately impair his  ability to be impartial in his regulation of clean air and clean water  and mercury and haze and soot and smog and this whole litany of issues  that go right to the public health and safety of every American.   From my perspective, it is a sad day in the Senate when the  information is now available, a brief delay would make it possible for  each Senator to be able to make an informed decision, and yet the  Senate moves on, not waiting, not listening, not willing to give the  American public the information they will need to make an informed  decision that they can then give to their Senators to make a wise  decision that could lead to much stronger protections that they can  receive from this critical Agency that is the overseer of the  environment in our country.   Again, I oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination. I would ask for a delay. I  know it is not going to happen. I understand why, but it is a sad day  in the history of the Senate.   Mr. President, I wish to reclaim the remainder of my time and yield  the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Andrew  Falacci, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  duration of debate on the Pruitt nomination.
