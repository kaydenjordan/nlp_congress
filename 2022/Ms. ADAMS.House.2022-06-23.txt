 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  today for the millions of children who will go hungry next week if  Congress does not extend child nutrition waivers.   No student or child should ever go hungry in our country. At the  start of the pandemic, Congress authorized waivers to help make it  easier for schools to deliver meals to kids, and we gave 10 million  more children access to healthy food.   Given the reality of higher prices at the grocery store, children and  their families can't afford to lose the free, nutritious meals  available at schools across the country. As a 40-year educator, I know  hunger has been a crisis in our schools and our communities since long  before the pandemic.   Madam Speaker, one in seven households today has a child struggling  with food insecurity. In my home State of North Carolina, food  insecurity has been a tragic fact of life for our kids and our  students.   Before the pandemic, in North Carolina, 92,000 students were  participating in the Summer Food Service Program, and 441,000 children  were receiving SNAP assistance.   These numbers have only gone up. Our choice is clear: We can choose  to act, or we can let millions of children go hungry.   Madam Speaker, as always, I am standing with our students, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support S. 2089, as amended.
