 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Harley Wheeler, an  outstanding rugby player from Knoxville, Tennessee. His granddad, Roy,  and his grandmother--he recently lost--Alice, were dear friends of  mine.   Harley played rugby since he was 14 and is now one of the top players  in the United States. Harley began his rugby career with the South  Doyle Rugby Club while a student at South-Doyle High School. In 2015,  he enrolled at Life University to compete on its rugby team at the  collegiate level.   Harley's 4 years on the Life University rugby team were incredibly  successful. The team advanced to the Division 1A College Rugby National  Championship match every year he was on the team, and won the  championship in 2016, 2018, and 2019.   After graduating with a degree in business, Harley was selected to  represent the United States on the international stage at the 2019 Pan  American Games in Lima, Peru. Team USA finished third at the games,  defeating Brazil 24-19. Harley scored 10 points during the bronze medal  match.   As we approach the 2020 Summer Olympics, I wish Harley the best of  luck as he competes for a spot on the national rugby team. I hope to  see him representing Knoxville and the United States in Japan.                            ____________________
