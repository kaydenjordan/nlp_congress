 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  yielding me this time.   This bill before us today, H.R. 1699, as I understand it, would  eliminate the safeguards for manufactured homes that were put in place  to protect consumers through the Dodd-Frank legislation, which included  the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   The American people are looking at us and asking: What is Congress  doing?   After everything went down after the 2008 crash, we saw how  irresponsible folks on Wall Street were, many within the banking  industry, the nonbank banks, and what they were doing. And the answer  here is to take away even further protection for the American consumer.   The attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an attack  on everything America stands for. More than 12 billion in ill-gotten  gains have been returned to the American taxpayer through the CFPB.   The CFPB stands up for them when others have let them down. So,  naturally, from its inception, the Republicans have done everything  they possibly could to knee-cap this important agency. Now a Republican  White House is attempting to destroy it from the inside out.   The Great Recession brought millions of Americans a foreclosure  notice and a pink slip, through no fault of their own. They were  victims of a financial system that didn't look out for consumers. There  weren't enough referees on the playing field, but they did look out for  big banks.
