 Madam Speaker, it is past time we took the  power to make deeply personal healthcare decisions out of Governors'  mansions and State legislatures and put them back where they belong, in  the hands of patients and their doctors.   Just this week, my home State of Florida filed a horrific anti- abortion bill that is a revolting assault on women's rights. With  Federal courts becoming more hostile to reproductive access, we must  not waver in the passage of the Women's Health Protection Act.   Thankfully, this bill before us today protects the right to access  abortion throughout the United States and safeguards against medically  unnecessary bans and restrictions like those in Texas' S.B. 8.   Equal access to abortion care everywhere is essential to economic  participation, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine our  own lives.   Congress has a responsibility to pass legislation that makes these  human rights a reality.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this vital piece of legislation.
