 Mr. President, I am back today now for the 20th time  to shed a little light on the dark money scheme to capture and control  our Supreme Court.   Part of what allows that scheme to flourish is the ethics-free zone  around the Supreme Court. It is quite unique. So let's look at it.   The last time I gave this speech, No. 19, I walked through the  various problems with how the Supreme Court handles allegations of  misconduct by the Justices.   The short answer is that it doesn't.   The U.S. Supreme Court is the only court in the country not covered  by an ethics code. And worse than that, it is the only part of the  Federal Government that has no process for ethics investigation and  enforcement--none.   Now, any meaningful ethics regime contains three things: first, a  process for receiving complaints; second, a process for investigating  those complaints once they are received; and, third, a process for  reporting the result and holding powerful people accountable should  those complaints turn out to be merited.   The House and the Senate, for instance, we have our Ethics  Committees. The executive branch has inspector generals and the  attorney general. The Federal courts, except the Supreme Court, have  their own investigative procedures. It is just the Supreme Court that  has none. The closest you get is probably a motion to recuse.   Let's start with the difficulty of raising ethics complaints with the  Supreme Court. People who are concerned about ethics violations over at  the Court have to get pretty creative because the Court has no place to  submit  [[Page S378]]  an ethics complaint. If you like, there is no inbox.   We saw this play out when Judge Kavanaugh became Justice Kavanaugh.  Multiple ethics complaints were pending against Judge Kavanaugh. The  lower courts, like the DC Circuit that he was sitting on, do have a  process for receiving complaints and for investigating them; and  pursuant to that process, a special panel was appointed to review the  complaints against Judge Kavanaugh.    But as soon as Judge Kavanaugh squeaked onto the Supreme Court as  Justice Kavanaugh--poof--the lower courts lost jurisdiction over him,  and the complaints had to be dismissed mid-investigation.   Now, the complaints could have been refiled up at the Supreme Court,  but there was no place to file them.   We saw the problem again when a man named Robert Schenck sent Chief  Justice Roberts a letter explaining how he learned, after a donor's  private dinner with Justice Alito and his wife, how the Supreme Court  was going to rule in the Hobby Lobby decision.   Apparently, a letter directly to the Chief Justice isn't a proper way  to lodge a complaint because Schenck never heard back from the Court.   Months later, Schenck then went to the New York Times, which was  following up on an earlier POLITICO story about Schenck's covert  lobbying campaign to have wealthy rightwing donors invite some of the  Justices to meals, to their vacation homes, or to private clubs.   It took the press, the fourth estate, to fill in the investigatory  gap about that $30 million wining and dining campaign.   More recently, a former coworker of the Chief Justice's spouse  alleged ethics problems with the Chief Justice's failure to disclose  financial connections between his spouse and parties and law firms  appearing before the Court. With no mechanism to ask the Supreme Court  to review whether this arrangement presented a conflict, the former  coworker sent his complaint around to congressional offices in hopes  that someone might take it seriously somewhere.   Again, the complaint made it to the fourth estate; and, again,  without an inbox at the Court or a process, it took journalists to give  the inquiries an airing.   Set aside the merits of these complaints, the point is: They never  got in the door for the Court's consideration. The Court's refusal to  receive ethics complaints is unique to the Supreme Court, and I submit  it is not serving the institution well. So even if there were an inbox  for an ethics complaint, the Court still has no process to investigate  it.   Turn back to Mr. Schenck. After the New York Times reported on his  allegation, there was understandable public uproar.   Chairman Hank Johnson and I wrote to the Court as Courts subcommittee  chairs to ask whether it was investigating the allegations. After  months of silence, amid growing public clamor, the Court did something  it almost never does: It acknowledged the accusations.   Mr. President, I have a two-page letter from the Court's legal  counsel, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at  the conclusion of my remarks.   In that letter, the Court said the equivalent of: Justice Alito says  he didn't leak the decision, and that is good enough for us. No mention  in the letter of the lobbying campaign or of private wining and dining  and no description of anything resembling an actual investigation.   I have been the attorney general of my State, a position that has  criminal jurisdiction across the entire State. Only three attorneys  general in the country have that; Rhode Island is one of them. I have  been the United States attorney for my State and led Federal  investigations. I know a little bit about investigations.   It is ``investigation 101'' to take statements from witnesses. That  is how you make a record, and that is how you deter lying: by tying  people to a statement so they can be held accountable if it turns out  that the statement is false. No sign in the letter that that was done.   Same again with Justice Thomas regarding his refusal to recuse  himself from cases implicating his wife's efforts at overturning the  2020 election.   Back in January 2022, Justice Thomas participated as the lone  dissenter in a decision that allowed the House January 6 Select  Committee access to records from the Trump White House. And a couple of  months later, it turned out that Justice Thomas's wife had texted with  White House officials repeatedly about overturning the 2020 election.  So she was clearly covered by that investigative effort by the January  6 Commission.   He did not recuse; and, indirectly, it was suggested that Justice  Thomas knew nothing at all about his wife's activity, so he didn't need  to recuse.   OK. But that is a fact question. What did Justice Thomas know about  his wife's activities at the time of the case? Easy to ask him. Easy to  take a statement from him. But no sign that that was done. So, of  course, no statement and no consequences.   Later, after the reporting about Justice Thomas's wife's activities  came out in the public press and he failed to recuse himself in another  case, the issue was no longer just a fact question about what Justice  Thomas knew, he was now on notice about his wife's conduct, and he  still did not recuse.   Why not? Again, no justification, no investigation, no conclusion.  The Court has repeatedly failed to investigate or even acknowledge this  glaring problem, which brings us to the third element of an effective  ethics regime: accountability and transparency--a report at the end.   An investigation ought to be designed to get to the truth and to  report its findings so that people can be held accountable for  wrongdoing and the public can have confidence in the outcome.   That is a statement so obvious I find it hard to believe I actually  have to say it here about the Court.   The one investigation we have seen the Supreme Court undertake was  done in response to the Alito draft opinion leak. As an investigation,  it was pitiful and marred with conflicts.   My surmise--my surmise--is that in the heat of the Court's ire about  the leak, the assumption was made that some clerk or staffer was  responsible. Chief Justice Roberts directed the Marshal of the Court to  investigate. He called the leak a ``singular and egregious breach of  trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public  servants who work here.''   Well, for more than 8 months, the public waited to find out whether  the Marshal's investigation would live up to the Chief Justice's words.   In the end, the Court's handling of the Dobbs investigation was a  case study in how not to conduct a fair and transparent investigation.  The problems were numerous, not least that the Marshal of the Court  isn't normally responsible for leading investigations. But the problem  that really emerged was that some of the prime suspects for the leak  were her bosses, and the investigation held the Justices to a different  standard than everyone else at the Court. Everyone else at the Court  had to sit down for formal interviews, had to turn over their private  communications, had to sign affidavits under oath, but when it came to  the Justices, it was different. They were subject to something that the  Court called an iterative process. I have no idea what an iterative  process is. I can tell you what it isn't. It isn't an investigative  process. The Justices even asked questions of their own--some  statement.   The premise seems to be that even here, the Justices can never be  investigated. This was going to be a top-tier investigation as long as  it looked like it was going to be clerks and staff, but once it looked  like it might be Justices involved in the leak, suddenly the wheels  fell off.   I have never seen an investigation where the investigator called in a  third party to provide public assurance that they did a good job, like  a little sidecar running next to the investigation: Yeah, they are  doing a good job. In this case--worse--it was a third party with  conflicts of interest, with relationships with obvious suspects and  with contracts with the Court.   So if you compare all of that with how misconduct investigations are  handled everywhere else in the Federal Government, you see some pretty  big discrepancies. In the executive branch, Congress has established  inspectors general who are surrounded by professional staff experienced  in internal investigations. IGs know how to conduct  [[Page S379]]  real interviews and record witness statements. Congress has its own  internal procedures and investigators for ethics complaints. We have  our Ethics Committee. The House has its Ethics Committee. Congress set  up procedures for ethics investigations in the lower courts. They  exist. Judges are investigated, and people can know where you submit  your complaint and how that complaint gets investigated.   The Supreme Court is unique across the entire Federal Government in  being impenetrable to investigation, from no ethics inbox, to no  process for reviewing a complaint, to no credible report at the end of  the day. The highest Court in the land should not be held to the lowest  standards in government.   So last week, Congressman Hank Johnson and I, joined by Senator  Blumenthal and Congressmen Nadler, Quigley, and Cicilline, reintroduced  our Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act. Our bill would  finally require the Supreme Court to have not just a code of conduct  but a real process to enforce that code and other Federal ethics laws.   Our bill would also update judicial ethics laws, ending the ability  of judges to ignore conflicts of interest and their recusal  obligations; requiring Justices of the Supreme Court to disclose gifts  and travel, as other Federal officials do; and exposing the real  interests appearing at the Court behind amici curiae who lobby the  Court under fake names.   Apparently, there has been a halfhearted effort at the Court to begin  to deal with this. The Washington Post reported last week that the  Justices discussed for years a binding code of ethics to no result, and  the effort seems to have fallen apart. So that leaves Congress in the  position that if they won't fix it, we will.   There are many problems plaguing our Supreme Court. Far-right, dark- money interests spent years stacking the Court with their handpicked  Justices, who in turn have delivered for those interests at every  available opportunity. We need to undo the damage wrought by the Court  that dark money built and by those who built it, but we can start--we  can start--by bringing basic standards of integrity to the Supreme  Court, standards all other judges follow and standards that govern all  high-ranking Federal officials across all three branches of  Government--officials who are paid by taxpayers to serve the best  interests of the American people.   To be continued.    I yield the floor.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Supreme Court of the United States, the Legal Office,                                 Washington, DC, November 28, 2022.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Henry C. Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Whitehouse and Chairman Johnson: I am writing       in response to your letter dated November 20, 2022.        Justice Alito has said that neither he nor Mrs. Alito told       the Wrights about the outcome of the decision in the Hobby       Lobby case, or about the authorship of the opinion of the       Court. Gail Wright has denied Mr. Schenck's allegation in       multiple interviews, saying the account given by Mr. Schenck       was ``patently not true.'' (Don Wright is deceased.) Justice       and Mrs. Alito became acquainted with the Wrights some years       ago because of their support for the Supreme Court Historical       Society, and they had a casual and purely social       relationship. The Justice never detected any effort on the       part of the Wrights to obtain confidential information or to       influence anything he did in either an official or private       capacity. Mr. Schenck's allegation that Justice Alito or Mrs.       Alito gave the Wrights advance word about the outcome in       Hobby Lobby or the authorship of the Court's opinion is also       uncorroborated. Politico reports that despite several months       of efforts, the publication was ``unable to locate anyone who       heard about the decision directly from either [Justice] Alito       or his wife before its release at the end of June 2014.'' The       New York Times stated that ``the evidence for Mr. Schenck's       account of the breach has gaps.''        There is nothing to suggest that Justice Alito's actions       violated ethics standards. Relevant rules balance preventing       gifts that might undermine public confidence in the judiciary       and allowing judges to maintain normal personal friendships.       Judicial Conference gift regulations provide that a judge may       not accept a gift from a person seeking official action from       or doing business with the judge's court or whose interests       may be substantially affected by the performance or non-      performance of the judge's official duties, with only limited       exceptions. See Guide to Judiciary Policy, vol. 2C, Ch. 6,       Sec. 620.35. The Wrights owned a real estate business in       Dayton, Ohio, and to our knowledge, they have never had a       financial interest in a matter before the Court. In addition,       the term ``gift'' is defined to exclude social hospitality       based on personal relationships as well as modest items, such       as food and refreshments, offered as a matter of social       hospitality. Id Sec. 620.25(a), (b). Similarly, Justice and       Mrs. Alito also did not receive any reportable gifts from the       Wrights. Gifts of less than ``minimal value'' received from       one source in a calendar year need not be reported. And gifts       do not count toward this threshold if they take the form of       food, lodging, or entertainment received as personal       hospitality of an individual, or food or beverages which are       not consumed in connection with a gift of overnight lodging.       See 5 U.S.C. App. Sec. Sec. 102(a)(2)(A), 109(5)(D).        Very truly yours,                                                   Ethan V. Torrey,                                                     Legal Counsel.     I yield the floor.
