 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud  Lourdes University of Sylvania, Ohio, and its new president, William  Bisset, who held a vital convening last week as part of the  university's Courage Conversations Town Hall series. It focused on the  Israel-Palestine conflict, with dozens of students, staff, and faculty  taking part.   University President Bisset and Professor Mary Robinson, who chairs  the history, geography, and political science departments at Lourdes,  said their goal was to offer a historical perspective to develop an  understanding of the past history of Israel and Palestine to help  people grasp the full scope of what is taking place in that war-torn  region. They hope the conversations will help provide a better  understanding of a longstanding conflict in which world leaders have  long sought a true path toward a lasting peace and a two-state  solution.   Thoughtful discussions in which history is examined, as was done at  Lourdes University last week, is the way a breakthrough for peace and  reconciliation will come about. May other organizations follow the lead  of Lourdes University.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of an editorial from the  Toledo Blade that recognizes this event and its important contribution  to human understanding.                      [From The Blade, Nov. 25, 2023]                          Editorial: Lourdes Leads                       (By The Blade Editorial Board)         Kudos to Lourdes University for showing us the way forward       on the future of Palestine and Israel.        Not afraid to tackle probably the most emotionally fraught       topic of our day, the university last week offered a ``town       hall'' on the topic of the Israeli-Hamas War.        Would that others who have taken to the streets shouting       chants and waving signs and issuing orders to U.S. Rep. Marcy       Kaptur (D., Toledo) would show some of the same awareness of       how complicated this problem is.        The university in Sylvania devoted its Courageous       Conversations Town Hall to the topic.        Conscious of the ethnic and religious tensions, there was       security stationed at the door, but it wasn't needed.        About 40, including administration staff, faculty members,       and students, attended.        ``My goal was to offer this from a historical perspective       because I think the more people understand the past and the       history, the better understanding they will have of the       subject and be able to better understand both sides of the       story,'' said Mary Robinson, associate professor of history       and department chairman of history, geography, and political       science at Lourdes.        President William Bisset said, ``We needed to start with a       conversation that explained that this has been a very, very       complicated part of the world for many, many years, that       leaders throughout the world have tried to figure out.        ``We felt that it was important, especially for our       students, but also for our community members to start the       conversation [about Israel and Palestine] with a historical       perspective,'' Mr. Bisset said.        Israel and the Palestinian people, and the armed guerilla       groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, who nurture the bitterness of       the Palestinians over their displacement from the land that       officially became Israel in 1948, are at an impasse, with       both sides claiming ownership of the land between Jordan       River and the Mediterranean Sea.        But yet, there have been instances under at least two U.S.       presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, that the       Palestinian people came close to securing a Palestinian       state.        Among the Arab states of the Middle East, there appears to       be a willingness to once again take up the possibility of a       so-called two-state solution.        It's not going to happen, though, if Hamas remains in power       in the Gaza Strip. Whether by Israel's current invasion of       Gaza or through the diplomatic intervention of Arab leaders       in the neighboring Islamic countries, Hamas and Hezbollah       have to be neutralized.        Calm discussion in which the history is examined, as was       done in Lourdes University's Courageous Conversations Town       Hall last week, is the way a breakthrough will come about.                                   ____________________
