 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in favor of the Global War on  Terrorism War Memorial Act. This act will initiate the process for  constructing a memorial to the brave men and women of the Armed Forces  who have fought and, too often, died for this country in the wake of  the September 11 attacks.   As a veteran of the Iraq war, I am extremely proud to be on the floor  today as we memorialize the bravest and best of Americans: the ones who  volunteered to put themselves in harm's way and did not come back.   I want to commend my fellow Marines, Mr. Moulton and Mr. Gallagher,  for sponsoring this act. As you know, Mr. Speaker, it takes a lot for  an enlisted marine like me to speak very highly of any officer, let  alone Marine Corps officers, but there are always exceptions.   Mr. Speaker, as we consider this legislation, I hope every Member of  this body will take a quiet moment today to think about the courageous  men and women we have lost over the past 16 years. When I cast my vote  today, I know I will be thinking about my close friends, including  Corporal Andre Williams and Lance Corporal Christopher Lyons, who died  12 years ago today in Cykla, Iraq.   This memorial will honor thousands of our countrymen who have been  killed and wounded in Iraq and around the world. It will memorialize  the service of those who have survived the battle only to fall victim  to the mental and emotional demons of post-traumatic stress. And it  will represent a token of thanks to the family and friends who have  served by supporting their loved ones in uniform.  [[Page H6545]]                                     time  1130    For as long as this memorial stands, it will continue the proud  tradition of America honoring its sons and daughters who have given  their last full measure of devotion.   I look forward to commencing design and to the day when the memorial  passes from an idea on a piece of paper to a landmark on the National  Mall.   I thank Congressman Moulton and Congressman Gallagher for their  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta). To show our bipartisan nature, we are going  to allow somebody from the Army to speak also on this bill.    That is worse.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I thank Congressman Gallagher, Congressman Moulton, and all of  the veterans who have sponsored this bill in remembrance of our  brothers and sisters from the global war on terrorism.   I would like to speak a couple more minutes just because I rarely  have the opportunity to speak about the guys that I served with. It was  a group called Lima 325 out of Ohio. It was one of the best groups of  men who I probably have ever met. We were nice young men from New  Mexico that were suddenly added to these country boys and city boys  from Ohio and sent to the middle of nowhere, Iraq. And from there, we  saw a lot of combat. We lost a lot of friends.   In section 60, many of us veterans have this tradition where we go  and we put our quarters on the headstones of the men we served with.  And I, unfortunately, have to put down a lot of quarters.   But one of the things that I will always remember is that this unit,  Lima 325, really brought people from all walks of life in America. You  had African Americans, you had country boys from Ohio, you had Navajo  from the Navajo Nation and other parts of our Tribal Nations, you had  Latinos.   We even taught some of the Ohio boys how to cook since they don't  really have good taste. We introduced them to the idea of green chili,  which I have heard has now taken off in Oliver, Ohio. And we lived  together for 7 months, going from house to house, from hole to hole.  And even today, though many of us cannot see each other, we still live  with each other in our spirits and in our souls.  [[Page H6547]]    These types of memorials matter. For many of us, this generation is  not the generation that served together on a base. Many of us actually  served from different parts of the world. We dropped our jobs and what  we were doing, our school sometimes, to join in, leave our families,  leave the comfort and safety of the United States to go and defend what  we believed was important to this country and to honor our commitment.   Sometimes it is these types of memorials that are the only thing that  actually bring us together. I recently was lucky enough to have my 10- year reunion with the guys from Lima Company, and that is the first  time I had seen many men that I had lived with for so long. It was a  very inspiring as well as moving, and really consoling thing for me.   I believe that having a memorial of this nature would be extremely  important for many men and women to be able to see, to be able to come  and maybe not necessarily physically meet with their partners, with  their comrades, but to at least be able to spiritually have a place to  meet with their comrades, with the people that they served with in  arms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, my experience with the  Affordable Care Act actually comes from the State legislature, where,  in a bipartisan manner, the Republican governor joined with the  minority Democrats and a handful of Republicans in the Senate State  House to pass Medicaid expansion.   Why did we do that?   If you looked at what was happening in Arizona, it was some of the  Trump areas, as I like to call them, these rural districts where the  rural hospitals, which are not only the medically necessary  infrastructure of the area but also the economic drivers, the only  high-wage employers in the area, they were about to shut down.   There was so much uncompensated cost, because people were using the  emergency room as their primary care doctor, that these hospitals were  starting to have to charge more and insurance companies were starting  to refuse to pay more for their premiums, that they needed to respond  to that.   In the end, what we started hearing from these hospitals is that we  are going to have to shut down the emergency room, and if you have an  emergency, we are going to have to helicopter you either to Tucson or  Phoenix.   Now, for many of you guys who are not Southwesterners like us in the  Southwest, we have a lot of territory and a lot of land. For you to  just drive to Phoenix for emergency care would be pretty insane, let  alone the expense of helicoptering into Phoenix was even more so than  that.   Because we had the goal of actually increasing and improving our  healthcare outcomes, we worked again in a bipartisan manner with  Governor Brewer, with Republicans and Democrats to pass one of the most  comprehensive Medicaid expansion bills in the country that has actually  turned around, lowered costs, created better healthcare outcomes, and  has now insured more than 400,000 poor Arizonans that did not have it  before, including people in the disability community, as well as  children.                                time  1315    To counteract what we saw today, if it wasn't really for the bravery  of Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, and Senator McCain, as well as  all of the Senate Democrats, what we would have seen would have been a  bill that would not only have just rolled back the millions of people  who are now covered with health insurance, but it would also have been  detrimental to the people who currently have even private health  insurance.   Premiums were going to go up for everybody. The estimated amount of  people just on the so-called skinny bill that were going to lose health  insurance would be 16 million people, and on the House bill it was  going to be 23 million people, in addition to the essential gutting of  Medicaid, all for giving a tax cut to the top 1 percent.   Now, this is bad policy, but it is worse policy when you don't have  an open process to it, when you seek it through the middle of the  night, hoping that the American public is just going to accept what  comes out.   There is a reason why TrumpCare was polling less than Congress, and  trust me, it is very difficult to poll less than Congress. At this  point, it is just our families that like us.    I like you, too, Ted. You are a good man.   But the fact that we the American public knew so little, just knew  enough, and said this bill is bad and were able to come out and put  pressure on our Senators and our Members of Congress with public  hearings and townhalls was key to stopping this.   Lastly, before I move back to Ted, if you are so proud of this bill,  if you are the Senate Republicans and you are so proud of this bill, if  you are Donald Trump and you are so proud of this bill, even our House  colleagues, why didn't you have consistent townhalls? Why didn't you go  out there and explain to people what you were planning to do and why  this is better for America?   Instead, they tried to hide it. They tried to move it as fast as  possible, and then tried to schedule a vote in the middle of the night.  If you have to vote for something in the middle of the night, it means  you are not very confident and you are not very proud of that bill.   So what is the solution now? Nobody in the Democratic Caucus thinks  the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as some people call it--is the  be-all and end-all. We don't think it is perfect. We certainly think  that there is a great bipartisan approach we can take to make it  better. And what I mean by ``better'' is more coverage, lower premiums,  and better healthcare outcomes.   When I use those words, those were almost exactly, word for word,  what Donald Trump said he wanted to see happen when he was going to  replace the Affordable Care Act.   But, point by point, whether it was the bill that came through the  House or the bill that came through the Senate, none of those would  have even fit Donald Trump's mandate. Which is why, at the end of the  day, that bill was radioactive. Nobody liked it, and they had to hide  it.   So what we should do is follow the advice of Senator McCain in  Arizona, follow the example of Senators Murkowski and Collins and all  of the Senate Democrats: get back to regular order and work out an  actual fix to the Affordable Care Act and get Americans more coverage,  lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes.   I say that also as someone who is on an ObamaCare plan. I am not  exempt from it, and neither is Mr. Lieu. We are in it just as much as  everyone else is, and we want to see it fixed.    Mr. Speaker, if you want to hear some ideas--and I think  it is important that instead of just us knocking what was introduced,  we could also give some ideas--certainly, for me, and I think I am also  speaking for Ted Lieu, we would prefer to have Medicare for all, so  people have a stable insurance, a system that we know works, a system  that actually brings down costs. But if we can't do that, there are  many things we can do in the meantime.   Why not drop the age of Medicare eligibility to 55? If you do that,  you are going to also decrease premiums for people who are not on  Medicare, people who are just buying private health insurance. You  could be on Medicare at 55 and still be working.   What about for those counties that don't have private insurers on the  subsidized market? They should be able to buy into the Federal health  insurance plans of all of the workers who live in those districts, or  buy into the plans that Ted and I have. Why can't we let them do that?   Why not cover every U.S. citizen up until the age of 18 under  Medicaid to relieve the parents of that burden?   We can also start looking at community health centers, reinforcing  those to make sure that we are taking the poorest of the poor who  actually cost the most when it comes to healthcare costs and, instead  of forcing them into a hospital or into a primary care situation, they  could get consistent care without putting a burden on the overall  medical system.   There are tons of ideas that we could be working on with our  colleagues that will, again, fulfill President Trump's goal of lower  costs, lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes. So this doesn't  have to be a static situation. This doesn't have to be an either/or.   President Trump is making it sound like, because we did not pass his  idea of reform, we must collapse the whole system. That is unnecessary,  that is irresponsible, and that is not how adult people that legislate  act.   You can fix this. We can fix this so more people can have healthcare  coverage, more people can have that security that they are going to  always have health insurance so they can go and start a business and  know they are going to have health insurance, know that they can send  their kid to college and they are still going to have health insurance,  know that they can retire knowing that they have been healthy the whole  time and they are going to have a good, dignified retirement because we  had made sure that we established a good healthcare system from the  time they were born until the time they retire.   This is possible. This is possible.    Mr. Speaker, lastly, I will close with this. If you were  one of those Members of Congress, if you are a Republican Senator or a  Republican Member of Congress who voted to gut the Affordable Care Act,  there is time. There is a way to come back from that really bad  decision. You can turn around and start working for the betterment of  this country by trying to fix the Affordable Care Act.   The American public will look kindly upon those legislators who are  here to work in a bipartisan manner to, again, lower costs, lower  premiums, and provide more coverage and better healthcare outcomes.  There is time to do this. But there is not time for more opportunities  to gut this, for more time to kick people off Medicaid, or for more  time to create some kind of situation that is only go to raise  premiums.   If we allow Trump to actually, in his words, make the whole thing  fail, it is not ObamaCare that fails, it is not the Affordable Care Act  that fails--it is the American people that fail. He is playing a game  with the lives of the American people.   What he is going to do is he is going to cause millions of people to  either lose their insurance because insurance companies are going to  have to start shedding people, or premiums are going to end up going up  because, if he creates instability in the market, these insurance  companies are going to try to recoup their costs somehow, and it is  going to discourage younger individuals from actually coming on and  buying into the ObamaCare insurance pool, which, again, will raise  premiums. This is unnecessary.   Mr. Speaker, for those Members of Congress and those Senators who  want to work with us, the first step is to encourage and stop the  President from sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and to work  diligently in a bipartisan manner to fix the Affordable Care Act and  cover more people.
