 Madam Speaker, I was honored to be appointed to the  Speaker's working group charged with renegotiating the deeply flawed  NAFTA agreement that the President signed in 2018. It enshrined the  failed status quo that had hurt American workers while extending  monopoly protections for pharmaceutical companies that would lock in  high medicine prices.   I was focused on crafting effective and meaningful standards to  protect labor rights, constructing an enforcement mechanism for the  U.S. and Mexico, strengthening and protecting environmental standards,  and protecting access to affordable medicines.   I was pleased the principles we presented to and, in many instances,  forced on the USTR are reflected in the final agreement. Our gains  include a labor-specific enforcement mechanism  [[Page H12260]]  for new labor standards, a review body to ensure Mexico is meeting its  obligations, penalties for goods and services not produced in  compliance, and robust resources for monitoring and enforcement.   Despite the President's rhetoric, this agreement will not bring back  U.S. manufacturing jobs or undo the damage of outsourcing provisions in  the Republican tax law. Despite our best efforts, it lacks more robust  climate standards, labor and environmental terms, and protections for  food and product safety. So, it is not the model for the future.   Wage stagnation in America is not the inevitable result of  globalization and technology. Special interests have shaped government  policies that have held down wages and increased inequality.   Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said: ``Inequality is not  inevitable. It is a choice we make.''   We made progress on this agreement. It is a framework to build on. I  support the agreement and pledge to continue our work addressing  globalization and trade policy.
