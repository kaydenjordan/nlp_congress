 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2093, the Veterans and  Family Information Act. This bill would require VA to make fact sheets  available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, and  Tagalog.   I appreciate Congressman Jeffries' introduction of this legislation,  and I am glad to support it today. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support  this bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 239, the Equal Access  to Contraception for Veterans Act.   The bill would prohibit the VA from charging copayments to veterans  for contraception.   Women are volunteering to serve our country in uniform in record  numbers. When they separate from the service, they are seeking care  from the VA in record numbers as well. Ensuring that those women  receive the recognition, respect, and welcome they are owed is one of  our highest priorities.   This bill would further that goal. I am glad to support it here  today.   Copayments have been prohibited for contraception in the private  sector for many years. This bill would bring the VA healthcare system  in line with that precedent.   This bill passed the committee last year with unanimous, bipartisan  support. One of those supporters was the former Republican leader of  this committee, Dr. Roe. Dr. Roe, who is an OB/GYN, has decades of  experience with women's health and reproductive care. Like me, he is  also a steadfast defender of pro-life principles.   This bill also passed the House last Congress by voice vote. I hope  that it can do so again this Congress.   The Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act was introduced by  Congresswoman Brownley. I thank her for her continued efforts on behalf  of women veterans and for introducing the bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to join me in voting for this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H2775]]         Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1257, as amended, the  Homeless Veterans Credit Repair, Enhancement, and Debt Improvement for  Tomorrow--or CREDIT--Act.   This bill would direct the VA to study the effects of financial and  credit counseling for homeless veterans.   COVID-19 has impacted our economy and our lives in many ways.   The most recent Department of Housing and Urban Development Point-in- Time--or the PIT--count found that, on a single night in January of  2020, an estimated 37,252 veterans were homeless.   We must do everything we can to help eliminate veteran homelessness  and prevent those who have worn the uniform of our country from having  to worry about where they will lay their head at night.   This bill, which I am proud to support, would direct the VA to  conduct a comprehensive study on the financial and credit counseling  services for homeless veterans.   This study would use data from the Supportive Services for Veterans  Families--or the SSVF--program to look at barriers that homeless  veterans are facing in relation to financial counseling services.   I thank Congressman Pallone for his hard work on crafting this bill  and for his continued support of our Nation's veterans.   This bill, as amended, also includes some technical changes to the  omnibus bill that was signed into law earlier this year that were  requested by the Committee on Appropriations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2429, the VA Police  Improvement and Accountability Act.   This bill represents months of bipartisan work by the committee. I  thank my colleagues for their efforts.   This bill would increase transparency and accountability in the VA  police force by requiring each officer to wear a body-worn camera. It  would also require VA to make police statistics public and available  and report on police actions, including arrests and use of force.   Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, the VA began modernizing its police  force. This legislation would support the VA's ongoing efforts.   Veterans deserve safe environments in which to seek the care and  benefits they have earned. I believe this legislation and the VA work  will help provide those safe environments.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2726, the VA FOIA  Reform Act of 2021.   Madam Speaker, over the last few years, VA has worked hard to reduce  the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests backlog. These  efforts have achieved some success, but the VA still has a long way to  go.   At the end of fiscal year 2020, VA reported 4,206 pending requests.  This bill would require VA to carry out a plan to reduce the backlog  and comply with existing FOIA requirements.   It would also require VA to report to Congress on a plan and the  Department's work. This will help Congress oversee VA's efforts to  reduce the FOIA backlog and provide additional resources that may be  necessary.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan work on this legislation,  and I encourage my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2545, a bill that  would clarify the role of podiatrists in the VA health system.  Podiatrists are increasingly called upon to care for veterans in the VA  medical facilities.   This bill would make a technical correction to current law to ensure  that they are properly compensated for their important work.   This bill is sponsored by Dr. Wenstrup. Dr. Wenstrup is a veteran, a  podiatrist, and a former member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I  am grateful for his continued commitment to those who he serves.   Madam Speaker, I urge every Member of the Chamber to join me and Dr.  Wenstrup and the chairman in supporting this bill today, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support this piece  of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 293, VA Hospitals  Establishing Leadership Performance Act. I believe that a high- performing organization needs to have clear qualifications and metrics  by which they can measure success. Without them, organizations lose  their way.   That is why I am proud to have, once again, introduced the VA  Hospital Establishing Leadership Performance Act. My bill would require  VA to establish standardized qualifications and performance metrics for  each human resource position within the Veterans Health Administration.   A few years ago, the committee found that certain HR professionals  working in the VA healthcare system did not have the proper education  or experience for the jobs that they held.   For example, one HR director at a medical center lacked both a  college degree and relevant work experience when hired for the job.  This bill would make sure that that does not happen again by requiring  HR staff to be qualified and equipped to handle VA's complex human  resources needs.   During the 115th Congress, this bill passed the House by a vote of  417-0. I hope that it, again, gains that type of support with this  entire Chamber.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support my bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 290, as  amended, to create a sole liability for GI Bill payments during  transfer in certain cases. This bill would hold a servicemember liable  should they transfer the GI Bill entitlement but fail to complete their  service obligation.   The GI Bill is a fantastic benefit. The GI Bill has helped tens of  thousands of veterans and their families obtain a higher education.  Some servicemembers are eligible to transfer their GI Bill entitlement  to a dependent. They can do this once they have completed 6 years of  active service and agree to serve an additional 4 years.   Under my bill, if the servicemember begins to transfer the  entitlement at the 6-year mark but fails to complete the additional 4  years of the required service, their dependent would not be held liable  for overpayments. This would help dependents avoid unexpected VA debt  for actions outside of their control. Some overpayments can total  hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is only right that we ensure that  they are assigned to the right person.   Madam Speaker, I thank our VSO partners, especially those at the  Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors for bringing this issue to my  attention.  [[Page H2782]]    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I just want to encourage all of my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
