 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the many advocacy  groups, health organizations, and constituents working with our  offices, for ensuring an extension of the Violence Against Women Act  while a long-term reauthorization is finalized. This is a crucial first  step toward ensuring that victims of violence continue to have the  resources they rely on and our law enforcement officers can keep up the  fight against domestic violence and sex crimes.   VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation enacted over two decades ago.  It plays two very important roles: first, to prevent against violent  crimes against women; and second, to provide care and assistance to  women who were victims of violent crimes.   VAWA has enhanced domestic violence and stalking penalties, added  protections for abused elderly and disabled women, helped to fight  against sex trafficking, and addressed the rape kit backlog in many  States.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues toward a  long-term reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of my bill, H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business  Tax Cuts Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady, the entire Ways and Means  Committee, and the Ways and Means staff for their hard work in getting  tax reform 2.0 to the House floor.   Last December, this Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That  legislation was the first major tax reform in 31 years and delivered on  our promise to bring tax relief to middle class families across the  country.   In fact, in my district in central Illinois, the average family of  four making the median income of $78,500 will see a tax cut of roughly  $2,200 this year. That is certainly not crumbs, Mr. Speaker.   Since passage of tax reform, we have seen historic growth in our  economy. It currently sits at 3.9 percent unemployment, with  approximately 6.6 million open jobs, and a GDP last quarter of 4.2  percent. With companies raising wages and increasing benefits, it is no  wonder 90 percent of workers are seeing bigger paychecks, thanks to  last year's tax cuts.   Unfortunately, last year, the constraints of the budget  reconciliation process in the Senate forced us to sunset many of the  provisions found within that act. H.R. 6760 simply makes those  sunsetting provisions permanent.   These provisions include the expanded child tax credit, which we  increased from $1,000 to $2,000; the new double standard deduction; and  the improved tax brackets, which have lowered rates for all taxpayers.   As the economy continues to reach new heights, H.R. 6760 represents  our continued commitment to the millions of hardworking middle class  Americans who have benefited from the tax cuts enacted last year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support middle class families by  voting for this bill.
