 Mr. Speaker, each year, Americans attend  nearly 1 billion medical appointments and emergency room visits and  quite often are unaware of how much their treatments will cost until  after their appointment has ended.   Now, the House has a chance to pass bipartisan legislation to address  this issue and to stand up for our patients.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act would immediately benefit  patients by providing clear price transparency for medical procedures,  allowing patients the flexibility to choose where they will receive  their care.   This bill includes legislation that I authored to provide funding for  community health centers, which provides care to over 30 million  Americans nationwide. From pediatric checkups to dentistry, rural  communities rely on these health centers to meet their daily medical  needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
