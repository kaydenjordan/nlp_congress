 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H360]]  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, 29 days ago, on January 6, 2021,  insurrectionists attacked our Capitol seeking to overturn the results  of our Nation's election.   Twenty-nine days ago, the glass in and around this very Chamber was  shattered by gunshots, clubs, and by individuals seeking to restrain  and murder Members of Congress duly elected to carry out the duties of  their office.   Twenty-nine days ago, Officer Sicknick, who just laid in honor  yesterday in our Nation's Capitol, was murdered on the steps just  outside this hallowed floor. Two Capitol Police officers have lost  their lives since, in addition to the four other people who died during  the events of January 6.   Twenty-nine days ago, food service workers, staffers, and children  ran or hid for their lives from violence deliberately incited by the  former President of the United States.   Sadly, less than 29 days later, with little to no accountability for  the bloodshed and trauma of the 6th, some are already demanding that we  move on, or, worse, are attempting to minimize, discredit or belittle  the accounts of survivors. In doing so, they not only further harm  those who were there that day and provide cover for those responsible,  but they also send a tremendously damaging message to survivors of  trauma all across this country that the way to deal with trauma,  violence, and targeting is to paper it over, minimize it, and move on.   Sadly, this is all too often what we hear from survivors of trauma as  the reason why they don't get care; that what they experienced wasn't  bad enough or too bad to talk about; or that they are afraid of being  invalidated, accused of exaggeration or making a mountain out of a mole  hill. As a result, thousands, if not millions, deny themselves the care  that they need and deserve to live better lives.   Twenty-nine days ago, our Nation's Capitol was attacked. That is the  big story, and in that big story resides thousands of individual  accounts just as valid and important as the other.   Tonight, for this Special Order, we will begin to hear and commit to  the Congressional Record just some of those many stories. I thank my  colleagues who have bravely come forward today to share their accounts.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I think that what Representative  Tlaib speaks to is so powerful and so important because when we attack  not just Members of Congress and focus on them because of their gender,  their faith, their race, their creed, we make everyone on this complex  feel unsafe and feel less than safe. Our seats do not belong to us.  They belong to the people of the United States. We, as Members who come  in and leave this Chamber, are not permanent fixtures. There are so  many others in this country who see themselves in the 435 Members of  this body. And to see individual Members targeted, demeaned, singled  out by virtue of how they were born is to single out and demean so many  people in this country who see themselves on this floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush), a  powerful woman and leader that so many in our country see themselves  in.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Bush for her  comments today and for how she carries herself in this Chamber every  day, which is just a powerful demonstration of why so many people are  inspired by her example.   Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, lastly, I would like to close,  speaking to some of the individuals who have already been mentioned,  and some of the folks who have already been mentioned in prior remarks:  our staff, our Capitol Police, our House clerks, we thank you.   We know how many of you were put in the line of danger because of the  job that you have. We know and felt how many staffers were willing to  put themselves on the line in order to protect the Members that they  serve alongside, and that is a weight that no one should have to carry.   And so we say thank you to our House clerks. We say thank you to  every single staff member of the United States Congress. We say thank  you to our food service workers. We say thank you to our custodial  workers, sweeping up the glass on the floor shattered by white  supremacists, cleaning up after their mess.   There are not enough ways to say thank you. We say thank you to our  Capitol Police who were willing to defend us. And, again, to our  staffers we say thank you.   I would be remiss if I did not specifically thank my staffer right  here to my left, Gerardo Bonilla Chavez, who was with me on the day of  the attack, and who did everything he could to protect me.   I want his community to know that he is a hero. I want his parents  and his family to know that he is a hero. Our staff already know that  he is a hero, and I believe he is a hero, too.   And I know it is not just him. He will be the first one to say that.  But to every one of our House clerks, we say thank you; to our Capitol  Police we say thank you; to our food service workers, our custodial  workers, every person here that was standing to fight for our  democracy, we thank you.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
