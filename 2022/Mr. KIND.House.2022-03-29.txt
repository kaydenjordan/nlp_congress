 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Securing a  Strong Retirement Act, or SECURE 2.0, as it is being referred to. This  falls on the heels of passage of the SECURE Act roughly 2 years ago, to  try to make it easier for individuals to save for their retirement  security, especially for small businesses to offer retirement savings  plans for their employees, which has traditionally been a big black  hole when it comes to individual savings.   I am proud that a few of the provisions in this legislation have been  based on legislation I have been working on throughout the years with  my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). We offered  legislation that would extend the startup tax credit to small employers  that joined multiemployer plans.   Again, with Mr. Kelly, this allows 403(b) plans to participate in  MEPS, including pooled employer plans, or PEPS, as they are known under  the SECURE Act.   Finally, there has been an anomaly in the tax code that we are  addressing in part trying to make it easier for S corporations to be  able to convert to an ESOP model, or an employee share ownership plan.  It is a very good business model, but we are trying to bring that on  par with C corporations.    This has been a great bipartisan effort in committee.  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for creating the  environment not just with today's legislation, but the previous SECURE  Act that we passed roughly 2 years ago, and the ongoing work that we  will have.   My friend from Arizona is right, with 70 million baby boomers  beginning their massive retirement, we have to figure out ways to make  it easier for individuals to save for their own retirement and for  future generations to participate and get a head start. I believe this  legislation accomplishes that.
