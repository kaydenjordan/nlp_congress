 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse)  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of  this measure, H.R. 3053.   As my good friend alluded to, this legislation has bipartisan support  and takes an important step towards permanently securing nuclear waste  in our country.                                time  1230    Thirty-six years ago, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  In doing so, this institution created a formal process for constructing  a permanent geological repository for the growing amount of nuclear  waste across our country.   This particular provision established a scientifically based,  multistage process for selecting an eventual site of permanent storage  for highly radioactive nuclear waste, delineated the Federal  Government's responsibilities for the transportation of spent nuclear  fuel, and created a dedicated funding source for disposing of nuclear  material.   Five years after passing the NWPA and following significant  congressional review of the Department of Energy studies, it was  determined that the facility be built at Yucca Mountain. However, after  many subsequent years of planning, licensing, and construction, the  project has stalled--at a cost of tens of billions of dollars.   The question of how to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear  waste has been an ongoing problem in our country for decades. Even with  the statutory requirements put in place by the NWPA nearly four decades  ago, no permanent solution is currently available for safely storing  high-level radioactive waste in a consolidated, secure location.  Rather, spent nuclear fuel is stored at nuclear reactors across the  country. Many of these facilities have been shut down, or soon will be,  without any solution to the long-term problem.   For obvious reasons, the issue of nuclear waste storage at plants  across the country is of great concern to the surrounding communities,  especially as some nuclear plants are shuttered early. The longer we  wait, the greater the problem will become.   H.R. 3053, the underlying legislation, directs the Secretary of the  Department of Energy to create a program to consolidate and temporarily  store commercial spent nuclear fuel during the development,  construction, and initial operation of a national repository. The  legislation provides the Energy Department with consolidated storage  options to help fulfill the Federal Government's obligations to take  possession of spent nuclear fuel in other States that are waiting for a  permanent repository.   This bill, although I have some concerns, is a good step forward.  This is a complicated issue, and I believe this institution has come  together to present at least a viable option for addressing a very  serious need.   Mr. Speaker, in taking up this legislation, the Rules Committee has  acted for the second time in just a few weeks to bring bipartisan  legislation to the House floor. While the bill we are debating today is  certainly not perfect, it is, nonetheless, an example of what can be  accomplished through compromise and bipartisan cooperation. This type  of process should not be the exception to the rule. It should be the  standard operating procedure for the House of Representatives.   I mention this because we all know this is, by and large, not the  case. Instead of working together, we have witnessed dozens of  controversial and partisan bills pushed through the House through a  closed process designed to silence the minority and even voices within  the Republican majority. That is wrong, and for the sake of this  institution, it cannot continue.   Using the closed process, my Republican friends recently pushed  through one of the largest tax giveaways in American history. They did  so at the expense of middle class families across the country, passing  the bill without so much as a single hearing or bipartisan  conversation.   According to the latest survey by the National Association for  Business Economics, the massive tax cuts have not made any difference  in businesses' hiring plans. Rather, almost every week, we hear of  corporations using their millions of dollars in handouts to buy back  stock and pad the pockets of their investors. It is no wonder most  Americans haven't seen their paychecks go up.   In a few years, when the tax breaks expire--that is right, they are  only temporary--the few families across the country who benefit will  recognize the tax scam for what it really is: an empty bag of goods  that added nearly $2.5 trillion to the national debt.   My friends on the other side are even contemplating paying for part  of their tax plan by retroactively eliminating funding for a number of  programs, and the children's healthcare program is one of them.  [[Page H3846]]    Let me say that again. In order to pay for the tax cuts for  millionaires and large corporations, my Republican colleagues are  suggesting cutting billions of dollars from healthcare programs for  vulnerable children.   How dare they.   The closed process isn't just about what is being rammed through the  House; it is about what is being blocked altogether.   Americans across our Nation continue to be victims of gun violence,  yet Congress has failed to pass even basic commonsense reforms like  banning bump stocks or fixing our background check system.   More than 26,000 children and teens have been killed in gun violence  since 1999. This year alone, 500 teens and over 100 children have been  killed or injured by guns. People are killed every single day, and this  body has done nothing but prevent sensible reforms from even being  considered.   Another example is DACA. Eighty-three percent of Americans say they  favor continuing the DACA program, as do a majority of the Members of  this House, and that includes Republicans and Democrats; yet the  majority refuses to bring up the Dream Act for a vote.   Just put it down here for a vote; that is all. The 26 measures for  guns that are reasonable, put it down here for a vote. If it doesn't  pass, then at least we can say to the American people that we tried to  do something about gun violence and we tried to do something about the  Dream Act.   Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to the American people to  consider legislation in a transparent and serious manner, and the  legislation that we are considering today is exactly that kind of  situation, something that doesn't happen nearly enough. I commend my  colleagues for their bipartisan work on H.R. 3053, but it is absurd  that bipartisan work is such a rarity, and that is worthy of comment.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, few people in this body understand the dynamics of Yucca  Mountain as do the Members from the State of Nevada. One of my good  friends is on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and on  the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I have had the pleasure of being on  the Rules Committee and hearing her make presentations with reference  to this matter. She speaks very clearly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Titus).    I yield the gentlewoman from Nevada an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When debating a bill as significant as this one, it is imperative  that the people's House allow as much debate and as open a process as  possible. Sadly, the Rules Committee did not even allow all Members  from Nevada, whose State this bill will impact the most, to offer their  amendments on the House floor.   Once again, this majority picked winners and losers and limited  debate to just a select few amendments. This is unfortunate but all too  common an event during the 115th Congress.   To block a Member from offering an amendment to a bill that would  impact their district, in particular, is to block a Member from  representing their constituents. I might add, there were five Members,  Democratic and Republican, from the Nevada delegation who were present  at the Rules Committee last night.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule to allow the people's House to debate and vote  on Representative Rosen of Nevada's amendment, which was blocked by the  Rules Committee.   Her amendment, which is a thoughtful proposal, would delay licensing,  planning, or construction of the nuclear repository at the Yucca  Mountain site until the Director of OMB studies the economic viability  and job-creating benefits of alternative uses of the Yucca Mountain  site.   It is bothersome to me that we have had most of the discussion here  already without talking about reprocessing; and I asked last night how  much research is being done, of the distinguished chairman of the  committee, who, I believe, has done an incredibly good job in offering  up bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    As I said previously, the members of the Nevada  delegation know more about this issue than all the rest of us combined.  So to discuss our proposal, yet another clear voice that came to the  Rules Committee last night and her amendment was not made in order.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen), a  member of the Armed Services Committee, and the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), my good friend, who serves on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and is a former member of the Rules Committee, so  she understands our process extremely well and has done extraordinary  work on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by again commending the committees  involved in presenting this legislation, and for doing so in a  bipartisan manner.   While the underlying bill we are debating today is not perfect, it  is, nonetheless, an example of what can be accomplished through  bipartisan work.   In bringing up this bill, the Republican leadership has, perhaps,  tipped its hand. It has demonstrated that it is capable of working with  the minority and allowing for mature debate and compromise worthy of  this institution. I hope this trend continues. I suspect that it will  not.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and the  rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
