 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the hard numbers are now in on TrumpCare,  and there is no sugarcoating them for the American people, as 24  million Americans get kicked off their insurance plans, as $880 billion  is slashed from Medicaid in the first decade, and as a payday worth  hundreds of billions of dollars goes out to the wealthiest and the  special interests. That is what is going to be dropped on Ms. Verma's  plate if she is confirmed and if the bill passes. It is her nomination  that is up for debate right now, and we should make no mistake that she  is going to be in charge of the specifics.   If TrumpCare passes, under section 132, the new Administrator would  be able to give States a green light to push sick patients into high- risk pools when the historical record shows that these high-risk pools  are a failure when it comes to offering good coverage that is  affordable.   The new Administrator would be in charge of section 134 and could  decide exactly how skimpy TrumpCare plans would be and how many more  Americans would be forced to pay out-of-pocket for the care they need.   The new Administrator would handle section 135, which paves the way  for health insurers to make coverage more expensive for those who are  approaching retirement age. That is just the start.   The fact is that TrumpCare is about enormous tax breaks for the  fortunate few, financed by raiding Medicare, gutting Medicaid, and  hurting older people and the sick and those who are of modest income.  Ms. Verma would have the job of implementing all of this at the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   My view is that the Senate cannot debate this nomination without  debating the matter of the TrumpCare program itself because it will be  a very huge part of the job. Today, I am going to walk through some of  the specifics with regard to TrumpCare, beginning with the scheme that  I call ``Robin Hood in reverse.''   If you look at the funds, it is clear that this is an eye-popping  transfer of wealth away from older people, from women and kids--from  the most vulnerable--directly into the wallets of the fortunate few. No  part of the TrumpCare bill shows this more clearly than the fact that  it steals from the Medicare trust fund to pay for a tax cut that goes  only to the most fortunate--only to those who make a quarter million  dollars or more per year.   Everybody in America who brings home a paycheck has a little bit  taken out each and every time for Medicare. It is right there on the  pay stub. It is automatic. Under TrumpCare, the only people who are  going to see a Medicare tax cut are the people who need it the least. I  want to repeat that. Everybody in America, when one gets a paycheck,  sees a Medicare tax, and everybody pays it, and we understand why it is  so important. There are going to be 10,000 people turning 65 every day  for years and years to come. The only people who are going to get that  Medicare tax cut are the people who need it the least, and that tax cut  that is going to go to the fortunate few will take 3 years off of the  life of the Medicare Program, depleting the program in 2025 instead of  in 2028.   That particular cut breaks a clear Trump promise not to harm  Medicare. All through the campaign, then-Candidate Trump was very, very  firm in his saying that he would do no harm to Medicare.   He said:         You can't get rid of Medicare. Medicare's a program that       works . . . I'm going to fix it and make it better, but I'm       not going to cut it.    The promise not to cut Medicare lasted about 6\1/2\ weeks into the  Trump administration before it was broken. The bottom line is that  TrumpCare raids Medicare. It raids Medicare and causes harm to Medicare  in violation of an explicit Trump promise during the campaign, and it  brings Medicare 3 years closer to a crisis to pay for a tax cut for the  wealthiest in America.   So you have this enormous, eye-popping transfer of wealth from  working people, seniors, and people of modest means to the most  fortunate. Yet, somehow, people have the chutzpah to say it is a  healthcare bill? I do not think so. It is a huge, huge tax windfall for  the fortunate.   There is also the tax break on investment income. Once again, this is  a break that is going to only go to the most fortunate among us, and,  with the investment tax break, the overwhelming majority of the  benefit--nearly two-thirds of it--will go to the top one-tenth of one  percent of earners in America. That looks like an awful lot of money  that is going to be going to the fortunate few, but we are not even  done there.   On top of all of this, there is yet another juicy tax--this time for  health insurance executives' salaries. It is another juicy tax cut for  executives who are making over $500,000 per year.   It is not just Medicare that is getting raided under this proposal.  Some of those who are hit the hardest by TrumpCare are those who are  approaching retirement age. If you are an older American and are of  modest income--55 or 60--and you have to get insurance in the private  market, TrumpCare is going to cause your prices to go through the  stratosphere. In parts of my home State, especially in rural areas, a  60-year-old who brings home $30,000 a year could see his insurance  costs go up by $8,000 or more.   Much of this is due to what we call an age tax. It is a key part of  TrumpCare. It is another key part of what Ms. Verma will be in charge  of implementing. The bill would give health insurance companies the  green light to charge older people five times as much as they charge  younger people. If you are a person of modest means, are a few years  away from qualifying for Medicare, and your insurance premiums jump by  $8,000, that means you are just out of luck. You are going to be locked  out of the system. You are, basically, going to have to hope that you  just do not get sick before you are eligible for Medicare.   Those tax credits that you hear so much about from TrumpCare  advocates are not going to be of much consolation to you. That is  because TrumpCare puts a hard cap on your tax credit as an older  person--just $4,000--and the odds are good that it would not come close  to covering the expense of a decent insurance plan.   Now, I am going to turn to Medicaid because TrumpCare does not just  make little changes around the margins. It does not strengthen or  preserve this program that covers 74 million Americans. TrumpCare hits  Medicaid like a wrecking ball, and it has particular implications for  seniors. I am going to walk through those.   The Medicaid nursing home benefit is very much at risk now because of  the TrumpCare cuts as it relates to Medicaid. Medicaid picks up the  bill for two out of three nursing home patients. These are the people  who have worked a lifetime, raised kids, put them through school, and  scrimped and saved all they could. These are the people who, in Kansas  and in Oregon and across the country, never went on the special  vacation, who never bought a boat. All they did was to try to scrimp  and save and educate their kids. The fact is that growing old in  America is pricey, and after a few years of balancing the rent bill  against the food bill and the food bill against the medical costs, what  happens is that a lot of seniors just exhaust their savings.   When I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, what I saw in my  State--and it is duplicated everywhere--was older people walking every  single week on an economic tightrope. They were balancing the food  bills against the medical bills and the medical bills against the rent  bills, and they just couldn't keep up. They burn  [[Page S1766]]  through all of their funds and they burn through their modest savings,  so when it is time to pay for nursing home care, they have to turn to  Medicaid.   Today in America, the Medicaid nursing home benefit is a guarantee  that those vulnerable older people--the people who are walking on that  economic tightrope--are going to be taken care of. TrumpCare breaks the  Medicaid nursing home guarantee, and it goes even further than that. A  lot of States--mine is one--worked hard to give more care choices to  seniors as well as those with disabilities. Maybe instead of living in  a nursing home or an institution, they would rather be in the  community. Maybe they would rather live at home where they are most  comfortable. TrumpCare could mean that those home- and community-based  choices could disappear as well.   So what we are talking about is that with these cuts in Medicaid, at  a time when, in Kansas and in Oregon and across the country--what we  have tried to build for older people is a continuum of services. There  would be help at home. There would be help in terms of long-term care  facilities. There would be a wide array of choices. And because of  Medicaid, there was enough money to fund these choices, to fund this  continuum of care for vulnerable older people. Now, as a result of the  Medicaid cutbacks, my concern is that there is not going to be enough  money for any of these choices--not going to be enough money for the  nursing home benefit, not going to be enough money for home- and  community-based services. Suffice it to say that my own home State has  indicated to me that they are very concerned about the cutback in home-  and community-based services.   Nobody wants to see older people get nickled and dimed for the basics  in home care they rely on and good nursing home benefits. Yet, when it  comes to Medicaid, TrumpCare would effectively end the program as it  exists today, shredding the healthcare safety net for older people and  millions of others in our country.   It puts an expiration date on the Medicaid coverage that millions of  Americans got through the Affordable Care Act. For many, it was the  first time they had health insurance. It brought an end to an era where  those individuals could turn only to emergency rooms for care. And now  TrumpCare is going to cap the Medicaid budget and just squeeze it and  squeeze it and squeeze it some more until vulnerable people will not be  able to get care.   The program is particularly important for seniors and the disabled,  and I want to make sure that people understand what it means for  children as well, for those in the dawn of life as well as those in the  twilight of life.   Medicaid pays for half of all births, and kids make up half of  Medicaid's enrollees. It is important to remember that in many cases,  these are kids who already have the odds stacked against them. They are  from low-income families. They are foster kids. They are kids with  disabilities. We know they are already facing an uphill climb.  Medicaid, though, has been there now with the Affordable Care Act to  make sure they could see family practitioners and even pediatric  specialists. That was just unheard of for these youngsters before the  Affordable Care Act. And when a kid needs emergency care, Medicaid is  what makes it affordable. TrumpCare puts that in danger.   I have talked about what it means for older people and what it means  for the disabled and what it means for kids, and I am just going to  keep on going because now that we have the hard numbers in--the hard  numbers have arrived here in real time from the budget office that is  charged with giving us this analysis--it is important to talk about  what it means, because budgets are not just facts and figures and cold  sheets of paper; they are about people's hopes and aspirations. And the  hopes and aspirations that I have had since those days when I was  director of the Oregon Gray Panthers were to make sure that people had  affordable, quality, decent healthcare choices because in America, if  you don't have your health, you really are missing much of what makes  life so special in our country.   The bill also takes an enormous toll in other areas, and I want to  mention next opioid abuse. By slashing Medicaid, TrumpCare is going to  make America's epidemic of prescription drug abuse-related deaths even  worse.   The papers this morning had accounts about how families were losing  most of their children to opioid addiction--most of their children lost  to opioid addiction--on the front pages of the papers. Medicaid is a  key source of coverage for mental health and substance abuse disorder  treatment, particularly after the Affordable Care Act, but this bill  takes away the coverage for millions who need it.   Republican State lawmakers, to their credit, have spoken out about  this issue. Frankly, it just ought to be a head-scratcher for anybody  who remembers the last Presidential race when, in the primary race, a  parade of candidates rolled through State after State that had been hit  hard by the opioid crisis, and all of those candidates were trying to  outpromise the one who had spoken previously in terms of how they would  help solve the opioid crisis. Then-Candidate Trump was one of the most  outspoken on saying that he would fix the opioid crisis. He said he was  the guy who could end the scourge of drug addiction and get Americans  the help they need. Instead, what we have is TrumpCare, which makes the  opioid crisis worse, and there is no getting around it.   TrumpCare puts States in the unimaginable position of having to  decide whose Medicaid to slash. Are they going to tell seniors that the  nursing home benefit is no longer a guarantee and they are going to  have to get in a long waiting line for an opportunity to get a place in  the local nursing home? Should they tell pregnant women that births are  no longer covered? What about telling mothers and fathers that their  kids are cut off and they will have to hope for the best or make their  way back to the emergency room?    I also want to touch on a final point that really deserves some  discussion and hasn't gotten much, and the finance staff has been  looking at it; that is, how TrumpCare really creates a disincentive to  work, because I think TrumpCare and Ms. Verma's role implementing it  are going to have a substantial effect on American workers and  entrepreneurs.   It is my view that TrumpCare creates a substantial, significant  disincentive to work. Today, if you are on Medicaid, you are able to  pick up a few extra hours at work or go out and accept a higher paying  job without the fear that you will lose access to care. That is because  under the Affordable Care Act, low-income Americans get the most help  when it comes to paying insurance premiums. A lot of persons can get  health insurance for less than $100 a month.   Let's compare that with the TrumpCare approach. Under the TrumpCare  plan, those who are walking an economic tightrope, bringing home barely  more than the minimum wage, don't get the most help. They don't get the  most help, and they could see their insurance costs go up by thousands  and thousands of dollars each year, which would effectively mean they  would be locked out of the healthcare system. So for millions of  persons, staying on Medicaid would suddenly look a lot more attractive.  Making a little more money and losing your Medicaid coverage could mean  losing your access to high-quality healthcare altogether. So my view is  nobody has been able to counter this. TrumpCare, in effect, would keep  Americans trapped in poverty.   Entrepreneurs and Americans who want to go back to school to pursue a  degree would face the same dilemma. Somebody who wants to quit their  job and pursue their dream of starting their own business ought to be  able to do it without a fear that they won't be able to any longer  afford healthcare. The same goes for those who want to go back to  school full time to pursue a degree or certification. TrumpCare makes  insurance unaffordable for those persons.   TrumpCare is going to be the big issue on Ms. Verma's plate if she is  confirmed this afternoon in the Senate to administer this office. We  all understand that this bill has been taking a pounding from all  sides. Moderate Republicans and those who consider themselves  conservative Republicans are against it. Governors from both  [[Page S1767]]  parties are against it. Democrats are united. The AARP, the American  Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the  American Nurses Association have all come out against the bill--not any  surprise to me. I don't think these groups think that healthcare and  healthcare legislation is primarily about ladling out big tax breaks  for the fortunate few, but that is what this so-called healthcare bill  does. And it is financed by raiding Medicare, by gutting Medicaid, and  by hurting older and sicker and lower income Americans.   There has been a lot of happy talk about why we ought to support this  bill, but what I have tried to do this afternoon is lay out the broken  promises. This weekend, for example, the new Secretary of Health and  Human Services said: ``I firmly believe that nobody will be worse off  financially in the process that we're going through, understanding that  they'll have choices, that they can select the kind of coverage they  want for themselves and for their family.'' That statement from the  Secretary of Health and Human Services is disconnected from the facts.  The simple math shows that TrumpCare forces millions of people-- particularly older people and less affluent people--to pay thousands of  dollars more for their health insurance.   The OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, was pressed on why TrumpCare breaks  the President's promise of ``insurance for everybody.'' His response  was that TrumpCare is about access, and the bill ``helps people get  healthcare instead of just coverage.'' But we all understand that  access doesn't mean a lot if people can't afford to get coverage. That  is the future that TrumpCare is going to bring for millions of  Americans.   I asked Ms. Verma the most basic questions during her confirmation  hearing so we could get even a little bit of an insight into how she  would approach these issues. I asked for one example--these are not  ``gotcha'' questions; these are the questions you ask if you want to  know about running a program involving $1 trillion. I asked Ms. Verma  for one example of what to do to bring down the cost of prescription  medicine. I gave her three or four to choose from. I particularly would  like to see more transparency by lifting this cloud of darkness  surrounding how medicines are priced. She didn't have any answers to  any of these questions.   So here is where this nomination stands. Ms. Verma gave the Finance  Committee and the public virtually nothing to go by in terms of how she  would approach this job, but the fact is that, if confirmed, she would  be one of the top officials to implement TrumpCare--a bill that raids  Medicare, slashes Medicaid, and kicks millions of Americans off their  health plan to pay for a tax cut for the wealthy.   I am unable to support this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to  oppose it.   Mr. President, over the past decade, the Trump administration's  nominee to be CMS Administrator, Seema Verma, has demonstrated a  conflicting pattern of working directly for the State of Indiana on its  health programs while also contracting with a handful of companies that  provided hundreds of millions of dollars in services and products to  the very same programs she was helping the state manage.   Those companies are Hewlett Packard, Health Management Associates,  Milliman, Inc., Maximus, and Roche Diagnostics. All were vendors to the  State's Healthy Indiana Program agencies, while Ms. Verma helped design  and direct that Program--first for Governor Daniels and then for  Governor Pence. As she describes her role on her company's website,  ``Ms. Verma is the architect the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), the  Nation's first consumer directed Medicaid program under Governor Mitch  Daniels of Indiana and Governor Pence's HIP 2.0 waiver proposal. Ms.  Verma has supported Indiana through development of the historic program  since its inception in 2007, from development of the enabling  legislation, negotiating the financing plan with the state's hospital  association, developing the federal waiver, supporting federal  negotiations and leading the implementation of the program, including  the operational design.''   Ms. Verma collected more than $6 million from Indiana taxpayers while  overseeing the State's Medicaid reform and ACA implementation. At the  same time, while under contract with the State as a consultant, Ms.  Verma also collected more than $1.6 million from Milliman Actuaries,  more than $1 million from Hewlett Packard, $300,000 from Health  Management Associates, and tens of thousands of dollars from Roche  Diagnostics and Maximus. All while these companies held important  contracts with the State.   In addition to being on ``both sides of the table,'' in at least two  cases involving her contracts with Hewlett Packard and Health  Management Associates--her duties for the State of Indiana overlapped  directly with the tasks those firms were also billing the state to  complete.   While there are questions about Ms. Verma's work for the several  companies above, I want to focus for the moment on what I believe to be  the clearest conflict: her work on behalf of Hewlett Packard.   Hewlett Packard Conflicts. In 2014, the Indianapolis Star newspaper  reported:         ``Verma's work has included the design of the Healthy       Indiana Plan, a consumer-driven insurance program for low-      income Hoosiers now being touted nationally as an alternative       to Obamacare. In all, Verma and her small consulting firm,       SVC Inc., have received more than $3.5 million in state       contracts. At the same time, Verma has worked for one of the       state's largest Medicaid vendors--a division of Silicon       Valley tech giant Hewlett-Packard. That company agreed to pay       Verma more than $1 million and has landed more than $500       million in state contracts during her tenure as Indiana's go-      to health-care consultant.''    While this in and of itself is deeply concerning, Indiana state  contract records show that Ms. Verma was instrumental in helping the  state determine this contract was even necessary in the first place.   Let me say that again: Ms. Verma, in her role of advising Indiana,  helped the state determine there was a need for the services of a  vendor like Hewlett Packard. She then joined the company on a bid to  provide those services, received a contract, and was ultimately paid  more than $1 million. Hewlett Packard bought the company that  originally contracted with the state, Electronic Data Systems in 2008.  That company, in a January 2008 press release characterized the Indiana  contract in this way:         `` `The EDS solution will provide Indiana with enhanced       transparency as it implements Gov. Mitch Daniels' package of       Medicaid reforms such as the Healthy Indiana Plan . . .' `At       the conclusion of the procurement process, it was evident       that EDS was able to bring great value and experience to the       taxpayers of Indiana,' said Mitch Roob, Family and Social       Services Administration Secretary. `The technology and       insight that EDS has to offer will be a tremendous asset as       we continue to make great strides in new, innovative       programs, such as the Healthy Indiana Plan.' ''    Ms. Verma helped Indiana outline Medicaid reform policy goals as  State contractor before joining a vendor in its bid to fulfill those  duties--and then remained a paid participant on both sides.  Furthermore, it appears that Ms. Verma was billing Hewlett Packard and  Indiana, in some cases, for the same work she was already performing  under her own contracts with the State. In written responses for the  record to the Finance Committee, Ms. Verma provided a 2013 presentation  from Hewlett Packard and herself to Indiana health program executives.   The presentation identified several functions that Ms. Verma would  provide to the State through the Hewlett Packard contract. Many of  those duties are exceptionally similar to duties the State had already  contracted with her directly to provide in 2012 and 2013.   For example, that 2013 presentation outlined specific duties HP was  paying her to perform that included: monitoring the Federal regulatory  environment, providing Medicaid policy expertise, and supporting  Indiana's State Plan Amendment waivers and process. These were things  Verma was already under contract to provide the state directly.   On February 21, 2012, Verma's firm was contracted by the State to  review Federal regulations that would impact Indiana's Healthy Indiana  Plan.   On May 13, 2013, she was contracted to provide the State with advice  on the impact of new ACA regulations related to Medicaid.   To me, that sounds a lot like monitoring the federal regulatory  environment in the HP presentation.  [[Page S1768]]    Under the February 21, 2012 contract, Verma's firm was contracted by  the State to provide general policy expertise to the Healthy Indiana  Program--also known as Indiana's Medicaid program.   To me, that sounds a lot like providing Medicaid policy expertise in  the HP presentation.   Under this same February 21, 2012 contract, Verma's firm was  contracted by the State to develop State Plan Amendments and waivers-- these are the agreement between the State and Federal Governments that  ensures the State adheres to Federal rules for Medicaid and CHIP.   To me, that sounds a lot like supporting Indiana's State Plan  Amendment waivers and process in the HP presentation.   Ms. Verma has not addressed how being paid twice for what appears to  be largely similar work was ethical. She has, however, consistently  denied that any conflicts of interest existed while she worked both  sides of these deals in Indiana. During her confirmation hearing before  the Senate Finance Committee on February 16, 2017, Ms. Verma claimed  she had her staff recused themselves when potential conflicts arose:         ``When there was the potential or when we were working on       programs, we would recuse ourselves. So we were never in a       position where we were negotiating on behalf of HP or any       other contractor with the state that we had a relationship       with.''    That all sounds well and good but that claim has been disputed by the  former head of Indiana's Family and Social Services Agency. As first  reported in 2014 by the Indianapolis Star,         ``Verma's arrangement with HP also came as a surprise to       former FSSA Secretary Debra Minott, who said she learned       about it sometime in 2013. `We had delayed paying an HP       invoice because of an issue we were trying to resolve, and HP       sent Seema to our CFO to resolve the issue on their behalf,'       Minott said. `I was troubled because I thought Seema was our       consultant.' ''    Ms. Minott made this allegation again just last month in a February  14, 2017 story by the Associated Press about Ms. Verma's conflicts,         ``There was at least one instance where Verma crossed the       line in Indiana when she was dispatched by HP to help smooth       over a billing dispute, said Minot. `It was never clear to me       until that moment that she, in essence, was representing both       the agency and one of our very key contractors,' said Minot,       who was removed as head of the agency by Pence over her       disagreements with Verma. `It was just shocking to me that       she could play both sides.' ''    Additionally, in response to questions for the record that I  submitted to Ms. Verma, she said that her firm worked directly with HP  for the state, and that representatives from SVC participated in  meetings between the state and HP,         ``SVC worked with the State of Indiana and its vendors,       including HP, to design systems for implementation of the       Healthy Indiana Plan. We helped vendors translate the policy       and waiver language into system operations. We did not       oversee HP or any other vendor in this regard, and did not       negotiate or participate in change orders or contract       amendments. To the best of my recollection, State officials       participated in all meetings with HP regarding the Healthy       Indiana Plan work at which SVC representatives were also       present.''    That sounds to me like Ms. Verma and her team were in meetings with  both HP and the State discussing issues where her duties clearly  overlapped and when she was being paid by both parties. In fact it  sounds like the only safeguard in place was that State officials sat in  on these meetings between her firm and HP.   Finally, with regard to her claim that she always recused herself, I  specifically asked her to provide for the record any documentation that  she had of the process for determining when she needed to recuse  herself and documentation of the recusals actually taking place. She  replied that there were none.   Consequently, it's hard to believe Ms. Verma was truly able to avoid  very real conflicts of interest while she and/or her firm were guiding  HP's work on behalf of the State and sitting in on meetings with both  the state and HP while being paid by both.   In the case of Health Management Associates, Verma also had contracts  with the state that covered the exact same work HMA was separately  being paid by Indiana to fulfill and while she was also being paid by  HMA. For example, in 2007, the State awarded Verma's firm a non- competitive contract to develop the Request for Proposal for a company  to implement the Governor's Healthy Indiana Program. On the same day,  Indiana gave HMA its own non-competitive contract to develop the very  same proposal. This occurred while HMA was also paying Verma's firm on  a separate but related contract. Again, as in the case of HP, she was  helping the State manage key programs while being paid by contractors  performing work for those programs. In this case, what she was doing  for the State was essentially the same thing that the contractor was  being paid to do--develop a Request for Proposal to implement the  Healthy Indiana Plan.   Ms. Verma claims there was no conflict because she did not directly  oversee these two contractors--HP and HMA--in her role with State. She  also points to the fact that in 2012 she received an opinion from the  Indiana Ethics Commission that stated her work for HP was not in  violation of state conflict of interest laws because she was a  consultant, not a State employee.   I do not believe that her work for the State and her work for these  contractors was a true arms-length relationship. As the Associated  Press recently highlighted, Ms. Verma maintained an office in the State  government center and that the AP characterized her work as ``usually  reserved for state administrators.'' The existence of this opinion, in  my view, does not absolve Ms. Verma from what look to be very clear and  obvious conflicts of interest.   I am not alone in this opinion, as President George W. Bush's ethics  lawyer Richard Painter--hardly a liberal partisan--said Ms. Verma's  consulting arrangement in Indiana, ``clearly should not happen and is  definitely improper.'' Ms. Verma helped the State decide it needed a  vendor like HP, and then went to work for HP on the resulting contract.  She was also under contract with yet a third company--Health Management  Associates--which was being paid to develop the Request for Proposal  for the same contract. That certainly seems like a conflict of interest  to me.   When I asked her in writing whether she had obtained similar ethics  opinions with regard to her work for any of the other state contractors  who had hired her--Milliman, Roche Diagnostics, Maximus, or Health  Management Associates, she said she hadn't.   All of these companies continue to do business with the State of  Indiana and with other State and Federal health programs that will be  under Ms. Verma's purview at CMS. Maximus, for example, is the largest  provider of enrollment services for these programs in the U.S.   Just because Indiana chose to play fast and loose with conflicts of  interest doesn't mean that these practices were right.   I have no confidence that Ms. Verma will take her responsibilities to  avoid such conflicts at CMS any more seriously than she did in Indiana.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the following  documents printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [from INDYSTAR, Nov. 29, 2016]   Seema Verma, Powerful State Health-Care Consultant, Serves Two Bosses                               (By Tony Cook)         President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Seema Verma, a       consultant who helped craft the state's Healthy Indiana Plan,       to serve as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid       Services. Verma worked closely to shape the health care       policy of both former Gov. Mitch Daniels and Gov. Mike Pence.        The health policy consulting company she heads, SVC Inc.,       also has provided its services to Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky,       Tennessee and Michigan. A 2016 recipient of the Sagamore of       the Wabash award, Verma also served as vice president of       planning for the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion       County. She also holds a master's of public health from Johns       Hopkins University.        Meet the architect of Gov. Mike Pence's signature health-      care plan, Seema Verma.        For more than a decade, the little-known private consultant       has quietly shaped much of Indiana's public health-care       policy. The state has paid her millions of dollars for her       work--amid a potential conflict of interest that ethics       experts say should concern taxpayers.        Largely invisible to the public, Verma's work has included       the design of the Healthy Indiana Plan, a consumer-driven       insurance program for low-income Hoosiers now being  [[Page S1769]]       touted nationally as an alternative to Obamacare. In all,       Verma and her small consulting firm, SVC Inc., have received       more than $3.5 million in state contracts.        At the same time, Verma has worked for one of the state's       largest Medicaid vendors--a division of Silicon Valley tech       giant Hewlett-Packard. That company agreed to pay Verma more       than $1 million and has landed more than $500 million in       state contracts during her tenure as Indiana's go-to health-      care consultant, according to documents obtained by The       Indianapolis Star.        Verma's dual roles raise an important question: Who is she       working for when she advises the state on how to spend       billions of dollars in Medicaid funds--Hoosier taxpayers or       one of the state's largest contractors?        In a written statement, Verma said unequivocally that she       played no role in HP's contracts with the state. ``SVC has       disclosed to both HP and the state the relationship with the       other to be transparent,'' Verma said. ``If any issue between       HP and the state presented a conflict between the two, I       recused myself from the process.''        But the recently ousted head of the state agency       administering Verma's contract told The Star that Verma once       attempted to negotiate with state officials on behalf of       Hewlett-Packard, while also being paid by the state.        HP said it can find no one in its company with any       recollection of such a meeting. Verma declined to answer       further questions about her work with the state or HP.        Verma's dual roles have surprised some leading Republican       lawmakers and expose one of many loopholes in Indiana's       government ethics laws.        Ethics experts consulted by The Star called the arrangement       a conflict of interest that potentially puts Indiana       taxpayers at risk. If Verma were working for the federal       government, they point out, she would have to show how the       government was protected, or step aside.        ``If I were a taxpayer in Indiana, I would be concerned       about whether the advice the government was receiving from       her was tainted by her own financial interest and the       financial interest of her other clients,'' said Kathleen       Clark, a professor at Washington University School of Law in       St. Louis who specializes in government ethics.        But in Indiana, government consultants aren't required to       disclose such potential conflicts, even when they have       offices in state government, as Verma does.        So the nature of Verma's work--and the extent to which it       benefited HP--remains unclear.        HP referred any other questions on the matter to the state.       Verma's spokesman, Lou Gerig, noted in a statement that ``all       contracts between the state and SVC Inc., or between the       state and SVC Inc. as a subcontractor, have been reviewed and       approved in accordance with all requirements of state law.''        Pence's office issued a written statement in response to       The Star's questions.        ``Seema has played a valuable role in the state's health-      care policy since the O'Bannon administration, and we       appreciate her advice and counsel, especially on the       continuation of the Healthy Indiana Plan and HIP 2.0,'' said       Christy Denault, a spokeswoman for Pence.        State officials didn't directly address questions about       Verma's work for HP. But James Gavin, spokesman for the       Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, said the       state does take steps to prevent conflicts in the bidding       process.        He said the state's procurement guidelines ``clearly       require that all decision-making authority lie with state       employees and agency executives. These guidelines are       designed to eliminate conflicts of interest.''                             Powerful contractor         Verma enjoys a tremendous amount of sway for a private       contractor. She has her own office at the state government       center. Earlier this year, Pence turned to her to broker a       deal with the state's hospital industry to help finance his       plan to expand the Healthy Indiana Plan. And when Verma and       one of Pence's Cabinet members--Family and Social Services       Administration Secretary Debra Minott--butted heads over how       soon to roll out the program, it was Minott who lost her job.        Verma's influence reaches back at least a decade and across       the administrations of four governors, two from each party.       During his first term, Gov. Mitch Daniels tapped Verma to       help create a new health-care plan to address the state's       uninsured population. Her solution: the Healthy Indiana Plan,       a new low-income health insurance program that features high       deductibles and requires participants to contribute a portion       of their income to a health savings account.        ``This structure melds two themes of American society that       typically collide in our health-care system, rugged       individualism and the Judeo-Christian ethic,'' Verma wrote in       a 2008 Health Affairs blog article co-authored with former       FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob. ``HIP combines these diametrically       opposed themes by promoting personal responsibility while       providing subsidized health protection to those who can least       afford it.''        The plan won the support of both Republicans and Democrats       in the Indiana legislature and was implemented in January       2008. Today, 52,000 Hoosiers are enrolled in the program.        Now, Pence wants to expand the plan to an additional       350,000 low-income Hoosiers through what he's calling HIP       2.0. And like Daniels, he turned to Verma for help in       developing the plan and negotiating a financing agreement       with the state's hospital industry. If approved by the       federal government, billions of new Medicaid funds would flow       to the state.        And because HIP 2.0 would generate significantly more       claims, some of that money would likely go to Hewlett-      Packard, Verma's other client.        The extent to which Verma's advice has benefited HP is       difficult to determine, given that none of the parties       involved will talk much about the subject. Further obscuring       the issue: Several of her most recent contracts weren't       publicly available on the state's online transparency portal       until The Star began making inquiries. Denault said that was       because ``some of them were mistakenly coded as not for       publication.'' The contracts have since been added to the       online list.        What they show is that her duties involve crafting       requirements for contractors. negotiating with contractors       and supervising vendors. Her company's website also says she       provided ``requirements for the state's three technology       vendors to support HIP.'' That would include Hewlett-Packard.       One contract gives her the authority to ``initiate and/or       track'' a contract or contract amendments with the state's       fiscal intermediary, which is HP. Another puts her in charge       of technical changes to the state's medical management       information system, which is operated by HP.        Those responsibilities put Verma in the position of making       decisions about a state contractor that is also paying her       hundreds of thousands of dollars. HP's claims management and       information system contracts show it has agreed since 2007 to       pay Verma's company $1.2 million as a subcontractor for       ``health consulting services.''        During that time, HP received more than $500 million in       state contracts, including millions of dollars in contract       changes to accommodate the Healthy Indiana Plan that Verma       helped create and other new programs.        ``Certainly on the face of it, there is the appearance of a       conflict,'' said Trevor Brown, an expert on government       purchasing and director of Ohio State University's John Glenn       School of Public Affairs.        If Verma was a federal contractor, her dual roles ``would       certainly raise tremendous concern for regulators and       purchasing officials,'' he said. ``This is exactly the kind       of thing that would land an agency in a hearing before a       legislative oversight committee.''        Lawmakers in Indiana, however, were unaware of Verma's work       for HP.        ``I was only aware she was working for the state,'' said       Sen. Patricia Miller, R-Indianapolis, chairwoman of the       Senate Health Committee.        ``There certainly appears to be the potential for conflict,       and appearances matter,'' said Ed Clere, R-New Albany,       chairman of the House Health Committee.        Verma's arrangement with HP also came as a surprise to       former FSSA Secretary Debra Minott, who said she learned       about it sometime in 2013.        ``We had delayed paying an HP invoice because of an issue       we were trying to resolve, and HP sent Seema to our CFO to       resolve the issue on their behalf,'' Minott said. ``I was       troubled because I thought Seema was our consultant.''        HP spokesman Bill Ritz said the company ``checked with a       number of its employees and can find no one with any       recollection of such a meeting.''        Gerig, Verma's spokesman, said Verma's work for HP was a       matter of public record because she is listed as a       subcontractor in HP's contracts with the state.                               A lack of rules         Ethics experts say that kind of scenario would be unlikely       at the federal level, where government purchasing officers       are required to identify and avoid ``organizational conflicts       of interest,'' which occur when a person is unable or       potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice       to the government because of other business relationships.        Many states, including Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and       Illinois, have adopted similar rules at the state level,       according to Dan Forman, a Washington, D.C.-based government       procurement attorney. Other states, such as Tennessee and       Washington, have implemented rules at the agency level. Still       others, such as California and Maine, have introduced rules       via standard state contract provisions.        But in Indiana, that's not the case.        Minott said when she brought her concerns to FSSA's ethics       officer, she was told Indiana's ethics rules didn't apply to       conflicts of interests among state contractors.        The lack of any such rule is just the latest in a litany of       loopholes that good government advocates say Indiana needs to       address.        In recent months, The Star has reported on several high-      profile cases--including those of state Rep. Eric Turner,       former highway official Troy Woodruff and former state       schools chief Tony Bennett--where ethics officials criticized       the behavior of public officials but took little or no action       due to exemptions in state ethics rules.        The issues raised in Verma's case are not unique to       Indiana, said Brown, the Ohio State professor. State       governments across the country are increasingly grappling       with potential conflicts of interest as more private       contractors perform what has traditionally been government       work.  [[Page S1770]]         ``Historically, the practice was these decisions would be       made by the leadership of the agency, and in many states they       are,'' he said. ``But Indiana is not alone in having to rely       on advice and services of a private actor to perform what is       at the boundary of, if not a clear instance of, a government       function.''        State reliance on private contractors is especially common       in the health-care arena, where rapid changes in federal       health-care law have put a premium on speed. And indeed,       several executive summaries of Verma's contracts emphasize       the need to quickly utilize her services amid the threat of       losing federal grant money.        ``Over the short run, it sounds like you're going to get       speed,'' Brown said. ``And you may get some cost savings over       the short run.''        But in the long run, states can become dependent on private       contractors, who can then jack up their prices.        ``They essentially become a monopoly, and there's a risk       that they can raise costs over time,'' he said. Verma's       arrangement with the state demonstrates how difficult it can       be to control such costs.        An amendment to her contract in January added $300,000       without increasing her workload or extending the term of the       contract. The reason listed: ``to cover claims.'' State       officials declined to elaborate.        The hourly rates listed in her contracts also have       increased over time, from $110 in 2007 to $135-$165 this       year.        Lawmakers expressed surprise when told by The Star that the       state paid Verma's company $1.15 million in the past year       alone.        ``I had no idea her firm received that much money. I think       it would come as a surprise to most legislators,'' Clere       said. ``I think there's a larger issue of transparency and       accountability as the state increasingly relies on       contractors, including consultants. I'm all for harnessing       the power of the private sector, and the key word is       `harness,' which suggests the state is in control. The       question here is, `Whose hands are on the reins?' ``                                   ____                  [From the Associated Press, Feb. 15, 2017]        Pick for Medicare Post Faces Questions on Indiana Contracts                  (By Brian Slodysko and Carla K. Johnson)         Indianapolis.--President Donald Trump's pick to oversee       Medicare and Medicaid advised Vice President Mike Pence on       health care issues while he was Indiana's governor, a post       she maintained amid a web of business arrangements--including       one that ethics experts say conflicted with her public       duties.        A review by The Associated Press found Seema Verma and her       small Indianapolis-based firm made millions through       consulting agreements with at least nine states while also       working under contract for Hewlett Packard. The company holds       a financial stake in the health care policies Verma's       consulting work helped shape in Indiana and elsewhere.        Her firm, SVC Inc., collected more than $6.6 million in       consulting fees from the state of Indiana since 2011, records       show. At the same time, records indicate she also received       more than $1 million through a contract with Hewlett, the       nation's largest operator of state Medicaid claims processing       systems.        Last year, her firm collected an additional $316,000 for       work done for the state of Kentucky as a subcontractor for HP       Enterprises, according to documents obtained by AP through       public records requests.        In financial disclosures posted this week, Verma reported       she has an agreement to sell SVC Inc. to Health Management       Associates of Lansing, Michigan, within 90 days of her       confirmation.        In a statement, a spokesman for Verma said there was no       conflict of interest and added that she has the support of       former officials who served with her under Pence.        Her firm was ``completely transparent in regards to its       relationship with HP and that there was never a conflict of       interest,'' spokesman Marcus Barlow said in a statement.        A spokesman for Pence did not respond to a request for       comment.        Verma faces a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday.       Democrats in Washington are aware of many of her consulting       arrangements, and have broader concerns about her philosophy       about government entitlement programs, lack of background in       Medicare and inexperience leading a large organization.        As a trusted adviser to Pence, she had an office in the       state government center and took on duties usually reserved       for state administrators. Verma was also widely respected for       her grasp on policy and designed a federal Medicaid waiver       that allowed Pence to undertake his own conservative       expansion of the program while still accepting money made       available through the Affordable Care Act.        Verma did not specifically address how she would handle       decisions related to HP in a letter to the Department of       Health and Human Services that was released this week. The       letter outlined her plan for managing potential conflicts of       interest should she be confirmed by the Senate to lead the       Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Her relationship       with HP was first reported by the Indianapolis Star in 2014.        Legal and ethics experts contacted by AP say Verma's work       for Hewlett, and offshoot HP Enterprises, raised questions       about where her loyalties lay--to the company, or to state       taxpayers.        Richard Painter, former President George W. Bush's chief       ethics lawyer, called Verma's arrangement a ``conflict of       interest'' that ``clearly should not happen and is definitely       improper.''        Such arrangements are typically prohibited for rank-and-      file state employees under Indiana's ethics rules and laws,       but they're murkier when it comes to consulting work.       Contractors have often replaced state employees in a GOP bid       to drive down the number of public employees, distinctions       between the two can be hard to discern.        ``She was cloaked with so much responsibility and so much       authority, people thought she was a state employee,'' said       Debra Minot, a former head of Indiana's Family and Social       Services Agency under Pence who worked with Verma.        Indiana University law professor David Orentlicher compared       Verma's dual employment to an attorney who represents both       the plaintiff and the defense in a lawsuit. It's also similar       to federal contract negotiator with a side job for a company       they regularly negotiate with, he said.        ``If you have one person on both sides of the negotiating,       they can't negotiate hard for both sides,'' said Orentlicher,       a former Indiana Democratic state lawmaker.        There was at least one instance where Verma crossed the       line in Indiana when she was dispatched by HP to help smooth       over a billing dispute, said Minot.        ``It was never clear to me until that moment that she, in       essence, was representing both the agency and one of our very       key contractors,'' said Minot, who was removed as head of the       agency by Pence over her disagreements with Verma. ``It was       just shocking to me that she could play both sides.''        State contracts show Verma's duties to Indiana and Hewlett       have overlapped at times. One agreement she held with the       state's social services agency required her to ``provide       technical assistance'' to state contractors, as well as the       governor's office. Another duty was ``contract development       and negotiation'' with vendors, which included HP and HP       Enterprises        Verma reported her salary with SVC is $480,000 and her       business income from the company as nearly $2.2 million.                                   ____           [From Electronic Data Systems Corporation, Jan. 7, 2008]           Indiana Awards EDS New $209 Million Medicaid Contract          Agreement Extends 16-Year Relationship with Hoosier State         Indianapolis.--EDS, Indiana's Medicaid partner since 1991,       has been awarded a $209.9 million, six-and-a-half-year       contract to upgrade and continue to maintain the state's       Medicaid Management Information System.        The new contract will leverage EDS' leading-edge       interchange Health System, which serves as an industry model       and is in operation or being implemented in more than a dozen       states, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and       Kentucky. Among the upgrades are a Web-based tool that will       enable health care providers to electronically enroll in the       Medicaid program as well as a number of internal processes.        EDS will continue as fiscal agent to the state and its       27,000 health care providers, who care for more than 800,000       recipients and comprise the nation's 17th-largest Medicaid       program.        The agreement includes a seven-month phase to design,       develop, test and implement the additional features followed       by a six-year management term.        The contract, which was signed in late December, extends a       16-year relationship between EDS and Indiana.        The EDS solution will provide Indiana with enhanced       transparency as it implements Gov. Mitch Daniels package of       Medicaid reforms such as the Healthy Indiana Plan, which       provides health coverage to previously uninsured Indiana       residents, and the movement of aged, blind and disabled       residents to a care management model. It also will continue       claims processing coverage for other Indiana health programs.        ``At the conclusion of the procurement process, it was       evident that EDS was able to bring great value and experience       to the taxpayers of Indiana,'' said Mitch Roob, Family and       Social Services Administration Secretary. ``The technology       and insight that EDS has to offer will be a tremendous asset       as we continue to make great strides in new, innovative       programs, such as the Healthy Indiana Plan.''        ``As Indiana's technology partner for more than a decade       and a half, EDS understands the Healthy Indiana Plan and the       state's goal to cover its uninsured residents,'' said Sean       Kenny, vice president, EDS Global Health Care. ``Our       continued relationship will provide stability not only for       the current Medicaid program, but also for future reforms.''        ``Long relationships are reflections of earned trust and       understanding of cultures and goals,'' said Barbara Anderson,       vice president, EDS U.S. Government Health Care. ``Over the       years, Indiana and EDS together have delivered program       efficiencies to enable reforms and help push forward vital,       new programs to improve health outcomes for Hoosiers.''        EDS is the nation's largest provider of Medicaid and       Medicare process management services, administering more than       $100 billion in benefits a year. EDS processes about 1       billion Medicaid claims annually, more than any other       company, and provides fiscal  [[Page S1771]]       agent services/Medicaid information technology support for 21       states.

Ethics Opinion        Dear Ms. Verma: Thank you for contacting our office. I       understand you are requesting ethics advice to determine       whether a conflict of interest would arise under the Indiana       Code of Ethics set forth in 41 I.A.C. 1-5 (``Code of       Ethics'') if SVC, Inc. d/b/a Seema Verma Consulting (``SVC'')       entered into a consulting agreement with Hewlett-Packard       Company (``HP'') to assist HP on a contract HP has and/or       would have with the Indiana Family and Social Services       Administration (``FSSA''). In your inquiry, you explain that       SVC is an Indiana Corporation that provides a range of       consulting services on health policy, including policy and       legislative analysis, grant and proposal development, project       and grants management, managing community and stakeholder       relationships, survey and evaluation design and data       analysis. You further explain that SVC is currently a       contractor to the State of Indiana (``State''), specifically       FSSA. Pursuant to this contractual relationship, I understand       that SVC provides overall management, project leadership and       support for the Indiana State-Operated Health Insurance       Exchange Level One Grant Activities. You also state that SVC       has been a long-standing contractor to HP and its       predecessors-in-interest, Electronic Data Systems Corporation       and EDS Information Services L.L.C. You indicate that SVC and       HP have entered into discussions about a new contractual       arrangement between the parties. Generally, the draft       proposal you've submitted along with your request for an       informal advisory opinion indicates that SVC would assist HP       in their efforts relating to work on State's Medicaid       Management Information System (MMIS).        The threshold question in this case is whether the Code of       Ethics applies to SVC. The Code of Ethics applies to a       current or former state officer, employee, and special state       appointee and a person who has a business relationship with       an agency. SVC is neither a state officer nor a special state       appointee. The term ``employee'' is defined in 1.C. 4-2-6-      1(a)(8) to include an individual who contracts with an agency       for personal services. In this case, the contract between SVC       and FSSA appears to be a personal services contract. However,       SVC is not an individual, it is a corporation. Because SVC is       not an individual, SVC would not be considered to be an       ``employee'' as the term is defined.        It would appear that SVC would be a ``person who has a       business relationship with an agency.'' Specifically, the       term ``person'' is defined to include a corporation. I.C. 4-      2-6-1(a)(12). SVC is a corporation. Furthermore, a business       relationship includes the dealings of a person with an agency       seeking, obtaining, establishing, maintaining, or       implementing a pecuniary interest in a contract with an       agency. I.C. 4-2-6-1(a)(5)(A)(i). SVC has a contract with       FSSA, a state agency. Accordingly, the Code of Ethics would       apply to SVC as it applies to a ``person who has a business       relationship with an agency.''        While the Code of Ethics contains fifteen rules, including       two that specifically address conflicts of interest, the only       rule in the Code of Ethics that applies to a person who has a       business relationship with an agency is the Donor       Restrictions rule set forth in 42 IAC 1-5-2. The Donor       Restrictions rule prohibits a person who has a business       relationship with an employee's agency from providing any       gifts, favors, services, entertainment, food, drink, travel       expenses or registration fees to the employee if the employee       would not be permitted to accept the item under 42 IAC 1-5-1,       the Gifts rule.        As a person who has business relationship with an agency,       SVC is not subject to the conflict of interest rules set       forth in the Code of Ethics. Accordingly, a conflict of       interest under the Code of Ethics would not arise for SVC if       it entered into a consulting agreement with Hewlett-Packard       Company (``HP'') to assist HP on a contract HP has and/or       would have with FSSA.        Thank you again for contacting our office. I hope this       information is helpful. Please note that this response does       not constitute an official advisory opinion.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
