 Madam Speaker, I rise in solidarity with the American  people who want our government to work by passage of this continuing  resolution.   When I talk to hardworking families, seniors, and veterans that I  represent, not once did I hear a single person say they want their  parks shut down, their Social Security offices closed and employees  furloughed, or their VA benefits and healthcare services delayed.   So not to allow the government to function would be outrageous. The  continuing resolution we have before us today will ensure the Federal  Government remains operational, that people are taken care of, and we  must deliver the emergency relief to communities which have been  devastated by recent natural disasters, as the Speaker referenced.   As the chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, it is  important to highlight that this continuing resolution will ensure that  the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the  Department of Energy have the resources necessary to continue their  vital work to families and communities across our Nation, including  those that are running short of water and where fires are raging.   As we continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implore our  colleagues to work in the best interest of the people we represent, not  throw up roadblocks that harm our Nation that is crawling its way out  of a pandemic.   The American people deserve the best we have to offer. Let's pass  this continuing resolution and continue our work to build back better  for all of America.
