 Mr. Speaker, the people of Iran have  taken to the streets in defiance of their oppressive regime and refuted  the lies that Soleimani was a beloved general. Already 1,500 people  have been killed while protesting the authoritarian regime.   The Epoch Times of January 7 is correct: ``The protesters' central  demand in Iran is for the mullahs' regime to step down, stop its  terrorist adventures abroad, and end its massive corruption at home.''   This is why I am cosponsoring H. Res. 791, introduced by Leader Kevin  McCarthy that supports the protesters of Iran. I am thankful for the  courageous leadership of President Donald Trump and his support for the  Iranian people.   He tweeted in Farsi: ``To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran:  I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my  administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your  protests closely and are inspired by your courage.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
