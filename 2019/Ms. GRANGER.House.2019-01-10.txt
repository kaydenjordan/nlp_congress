 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 265.   Unfortunately, moving this bill across the House floor will not  resolve the partial government shutdown. As the President has said, he  will not sign this bill into law.    It is the job and responsibility of the Congress to appropriate  funds, who must come together to find a solution that will reopen the  government and fund border security. We need a compromise that  represents the will of both Chambers and the American people.   By considering the Senate-passed versions of the appropriations  bills, we are eliminating House Members' involvement in the process.  When it comes to investment in agriculture, rural development, and  public health programs that are important to Americans across the  country, H.R. 265 funds Senate priorities by shortchanging House  priorities.   For example, this bill provides less funding for food and drug safety  and public health. For the average American, this means decreased  access to medical products because there are less resources to bring  those products to market in a safe and efficient manner.   This bill also leaves behind funding to address persistent poverty in  rural areas. This is a vital resource as rural communities across the  country seek to break the cycle of poverty. We can and we must do  better.   Madam Speaker, Republicans stand ready and willing to negotiate with  our friends on the other side of the aisle on legislation that includes  priorities of both Houses, and both Chambers. This is how this  legislative body and our system of government are designed to work.   I want to thank my colleague from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt) for his  efforts today and over the last several months to ensure that the  House's voice is heard in this debate.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 267.  Unfortunately, moving this bill across the floor will not resolve the  partial government shutdown, as the President has said he will not sign  this bill into law.   It is the job and responsibility of the Congress to appropriate  funds. We must come together to find a solution that will reopen the  government and fund border security. We need a compromise that  represents the will of both Chambers and the American people.   By considering the Senate-passed version of the appropriations bills,  we are eliminating House Members' involvement in the process. When it  [[Page H423]]  comes to Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related  agencies, H.R. 267 places a lower priority on creating jobs and  expanding opportunity.   For example, this bill provides $1.4 billion less for highway funding  to the States and territories. That is less money to address our  Nation's crumbling roads and bridges.   When it comes to the Federal Aviation Administration, this bill  provides $250 million less to modernize our air traffic control system.   The bill also reduces programs for the most vulnerable among us. It  provides millions less for a voucher program that enables families with  children to move to neighborhoods with greater economic opportunity and  virtually eliminates funds that House Republicans provided for  impoverished citizens living with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans stand ready and willing to negotiate with  our friends on the other side of the aisle on legislation that includes  priorities of both Houses and both Chambers. That is how the  legislative body and our system of government is designed to work.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) for his efforts  today and over the last several months to ensure that the House's voice  is heard in this debate.                                time  1415
