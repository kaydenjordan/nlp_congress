 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York,  Ranking Member Nadler, for yielding and for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 382, an  important bipartisan resolution condemning the rise of anti-Semitism  and highlighting the importance of Jewish-American heritage.   I start by recognizing my friend, Representative Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, the author of this resolution, for her leadership in making  Jewish American Heritage Month a reality and in leading so many efforts  to stand up for the Jewish community and speak out against anti- Semitism. I am proud to join her and Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick  and   David Kustoff, Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and many others, as an  original cosponsor of this legislation.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, this month is Jewish American Heritage Month, a time to  recognize and celebrate American Jews and their many important  contributions to our society.   For centuries, since the first arrival of Jews in 1654, Jewish  Americans have enriched communities in every part of our country,  forming an indelible part of our national fabric. Jews have contributed  to every facet of American life, from science and medicine to  education, business, technology, music, theater, art, sports,  philanthropy, the labor movement, the fight for civil rights, and the  pursuit of justice.   The history of the Jews, time and time again, has been about  resilience and achievement in the face of adversity.   It is deeply meaningful for us to have a month dedicated to telling  the rich and remarkable story of the American Jewish experience.   Yet, as we celebrate the contribution of Jews to America, we cannot  ignore the alarming rise of anti-Semitism here in the United States and  around the world. According to the FBI, anti-Semitic hate crimes rose  by nearly 20 percent in 2021. The data also shows that Jews are the  single leading targets of religiously motivated hate crimes in this  country.   It is clear that we need a better, stronger, and national-level  commitment to counter this steep rise in anti-Semitism.   That is why, last year, more than 125 members of the House and Senate  Bipartisan Task Forces For Combating Anti-Semitism, which I am proud to  co-chair, signed a letter to President Biden calling for a unified  national strategy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism.   Last week, the White House did just that, releasing the first-ever  ``United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism,'' a truly  comprehensive, whole-of-society effort to combat hatred of Jews.    This important plan recognizes that we all have a role  in this fight. It highlights the importance of raising awareness and  understanding of anti-Semitism. It requires education both inside and  outside the classroom and the workplace. It calls on Members of  Congress individually and in a bipartisan group to speak continually  about the evils of anti-Semitism and to share this message with our  constituents.   I am committed to working with my colleagues to further combat anti- Semitism and other forms of hate which threaten our values and the  foundation of our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of those who helped us be able to recognize  Jewish American Heritage Month, and I urge my colleagues to join in  supporting this important legislation.
