 Madam President, as recently as 2006, Hawaii relied on  imported fuel for 92 percent of our energy needs. This was bad for our  economy and bad for our environment, and it needed to change. Today,  Hawaii has the most ambitious renewable energy goals in the country,  and we are working toward becoming 100 percent energy self-sufficient  for electricity by 2045. In order to meet this ambitious goal, we are  investing in a renewable energy future. It means cleaner air and water  to enjoy, and it is driving a lot of local innovation. Let me give you  a few examples.   Last Friday, I attended a blessing for a new biofuel project in  Maui's central valley. Pacific Biodiesel, run by Bob and Kelly King, is  repurposing 115 acres of land previously used for commercial sugar  cultivation in order to test the energy potential of different  sunflower varieties for biofuels. If they are successful, this project  could grow to provide hundreds of jobs on the island and help Hawaii on  its path to energy self-sufficiency.   Bob and Kelly got their start in repurposing used cooking oil. They  have grown their company to run the Nation's first commercially viable  biodiesel distillery on Hawaii Island, and they employ 80 people. Along  the way, they have received support and funding through the Hawaii  Military Biofuels Crop Program, which has allowed them to experiment,  learn from their mistakes, and, ultimately, succeed.   Yesterday, I met with Naveen Sikka, the founder and CEO of TerViva,  which is a startup that grows pongamia trees that produce an oil seed  that can be used for biofuels. In working with Hawaii's Energy  Excelerator, TerViva is already growing pongamia trees on 200 acres on  Oahu and is looking to expand its operations across the State.   TerViva and Pacific Biodiesel are working together to explore how to  help Hawaii achieve its renewable energy goals.   In 2015, I met with Global Algae Innovations, a company that is  pioneering the production of algae for use in biofuels on Kauai.  Funding from the Department of Energy, or DOE, has been instrumental in  its research. Support from the Department is vital in helping them and  other algae biofuel companies finish scaling up commercial production  at competitive prices.   These stories provide a compelling counternarrative to the  President's belief that we should prioritize fossil fuel extraction  over renewable energy development. These stories also demonstrate the  role government can play in encouraging energy innovation.   During the Obama administration, our country made significant  progress in confronting the challenge of climate change, investing in  clean energy research and development, and growing our renewable energy  economy. Unfortunately, by nominating Rick Perry to serve as Secretary  of Energy, the President is sending a clear signal. Instead of  continuing the progress we have made, he wants to take us backward.   During his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry insisted that he  believed in an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. So far, it does  not seem that the President shares his commitment.   During the transition, a disturbing report leaked in the media that  outlined the President's plans to make dramatic funding cuts at the  Department of Energy. This extreme plan included eliminating the DOE's  Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, which focuses on the  transition to American energy generation that is clean, affordable, and  secure, not to mention sustainable. The plan would eliminate the DOE's  Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which ensures  the Nation's energy delivery system is secure, resilient, and reliable.  This office works to strengthen the resiliency of the electric grid.  The plan would also eliminate the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy, which  focuses on technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.   It is hard to see how it would be possible to pursue an ``all of the  above'' energy strategy if so much of the Department's ``all of the  above'' capabilities are eliminated.   I asked Governor Perry, during his confirmation hearing, whether he  supported those proposed cuts and program eliminations within the  Department that he was nominated to head. His response was telling.  Governor Perry said: ``Well, Senator, maybe they'll [meaning the Trump  administration] have the same experience I had and forget that they  said that.''   Remember, Governor Perry had originally said that the Department of  Energy should be eliminated. Governor Perry's ``oops'' answer got a  laugh at the hearing, but it failed to convince me that he has the  willingness and fortitude to stand up to the Trump White House on its  energy policies.   I also asked Governor Perry if Hawaii could count on his support in  our efforts to become energy independent and a leader in the clean  energy economy. Again, Governor Perry said yes, but in the same  transition memo, the Trump White House proposed eliminating the DOE's  Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy entirely, as I mentioned  before. It is unclear how Governor Perry could keep his commitment to  the State of Hawaii and to me if the entire office that is responsible  for renewable energy is eliminated.   Many of my constituents share my concerns about Governor Perry.  Charlotte from Wailuku wrote to me:         Please do not confirm Rick Perry for US Secretary of       Energy. He is not a visionary leader. In Hawaii, we have       committed to being 100% carbon emission free by 2045.        Rick Perry is not the person who can help provide       innovation, funding or the tools needed to make this happen.   [[Page S1557]]     I share Charlotte's concerns. We have made so much progress over the  past 8 years in embracing a clean and renewable energy future, and  Governor Perry and the Trump administration will work to reverse this  progress and take us backward.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.   I yield the floor.
