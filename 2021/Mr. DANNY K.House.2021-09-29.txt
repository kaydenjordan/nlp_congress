 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of this legislation.   This is legislation that protects the full faith and credit of our  Nation; that protects the well-being of millions of our most vulnerable  citizens, including seniors receiving Social Security, veterans,  servicemembers, small businesses, as well as physicians treating  Medicare and Medicaid patients; and that protects our economic recovery  and the global financial system.    The refusal of Republican leadership to extend the debt limit  threatens catastrophic damage to America and Americans. Economists  estimate that default could cost to United States' economy up to 6  million jobs; wipe out as much as $15 trillion in household wealth;  cause the unemployment to surge to 9 percent; and send global financial  markets into chaos.   Republicans must work and be real with Democrats to address the debt  limit to ensure that hardworking Americans, businesses, and communities  across the country do not pay the price.   Raising the debt limit is the only responsible thing to do.
