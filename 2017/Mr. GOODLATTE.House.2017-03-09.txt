 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 725.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 175 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 725.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1455                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 725) to amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent  joinder, with Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans are some of the leading victims of  frivolous lawsuits and the extraordinary costs that our legal system  imposes.   Every day, local businessowners routinely have lawsuits filed against  them based on claims that have no substantive connection to them as a  means of forum shopping on the part of the lawyers filing the case.  These lawsuits present a tremendous burden on small businesses and  their employees.   The Innocent Party Protection Act, introduced by Judiciary Committee  member Mr. Buck of Colorado, will help reduce the litigation abuse that  regularly drags small businesses into court for no other reason than as  part of a lawyer's forum shopping strategy.   In order to avoid the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, plaintiffs'  attorneys regularly join instate defendants to the lawsuits they file  in State court even if the instate defendants' connections to the  controversy are minimal or nonexistent.   Typically the innocent but fraudulently joined instate defendant is a  small business or the owner or employee of a small business. Even  though these innocent instate defendants ultimately don't face any  liability as a result of being named as a defendant, they,  nevertheless, have to spend money to hire a lawyer and take valuable  time away from running their businesses or spending time with their  families to deal with matters related to a lawsuit to which they have  no real connection.   To take just a few examples, in Bendy v. C.B. Fleet Company, the  plaintiff brought a product liability claim against a national company  for its allegedly defective medicinal drink. The plaintiff also joined  a resident local defendant health clinic alleging it negligently  instructed the plaintiff to ingest the drink.   The national company removed the case to Federal court and argued  that  [[Page H1969]]  the small, local defendant was fraudulently joined because the  plaintiff's claims against the clinic were time barred by the statute  of limitations, showing no possibility of recovery.   Despite finding the possibility of relief against the local defendant  ``remote,'' the court remanded the case after emphasizing the draconian  burden on the national company to show fraudulent joinder under the  current rules.   The court practically apologized publicly to the joined party  stating: ``The fact that Maryland courts are likely to dismiss Bendy's  claims against the local defendant is not sufficient for jurisdiction,  given the Fourth Circuit's strict standard for fraudulent joinder.''   Shortly after remand, all claims against the local defendant were  dismissed, of course, after its presence in the lawsuit served the  trial lawyers' tactical purpose of forum shopping. When courts  themselves complain about the unfairness of current court rules,  Congress should take notice.   In Baumeister v. Home Depot, Home Depot removed a slip-and-fall case  to Federal court. The day after removal and before conducting any  discovery, the plaintiff amended the complaint to name a local  business, which it alleged failed to maintain the store's parking lot.   The court found the timing of the amended complaint was ``suspect,''  noting the possibility that the sole reason for amending the complaint  to add the local defendant as a defendant could have been to defeat  diversity jurisdiction.                                time  1500    Nevertheless, the court held Home Depot had not met its ``heavy  burden'' of showing fraudulent joinder under current law because the  court found it was possible, even if it were just a tenth of a percent  possible, that the newly added defendant could potentially be held  liable and remanded the case back to State court. Once back in State  court, the plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the innocent local defendant  from the lawsuit, but only after it had been used successfully as a  forum-shopping pawn.   Trial lawyers join these unconnected instate defendants to their  lawsuits because today a case can be kept in State court by simply  joining as a defendant a local party that shares the same local  residence as the person bringing the lawsuit. When the primary  defendant moves to remove the case to Federal court, the addition of  that local defendant will generally defeat removal under a variety of  approaches judges currently take to determine whether the joined  defendant prevents removal to Federal court.   One approach judges take is to require a showing that there is ``no  possibility of recovery'' against the local defendant before a case can  be removed to Federal court or some practically equivalent standard.  Others require the judge to resolve any doubts regarding removal in  favor of the person bringing the lawsuit. Still others require the  judge to find that the local defendant was added in bad faith before  they allow the case to be removed to Federal court.   The current law is so unfairly heavy-handed against innocent local  parties joined to lawsuits that Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie  Wilkinson of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has publicly supported  congressional action to change the standards for joinder, saying:  ``That's exactly the kind of approach to Federal jurisdiction reform I  like because it's targeted. And there is a problem with fraudulent  jurisdiction law as it exists today, I think, and that is that you have  to establish that the joinder of a nondiverse defendant is totally  ridiculous and that there is no possibility of ever recovering . . .  that's very hard to do,'' he says. ``So I think making the fraudulent  joinder law a little bit more realistic . . . appeals to me because it  seems to me the kind of intermediate step that addresses real  problems.''   The bill before us today addresses those real problems in two main  ways:   First, the bill allows judges greater discretion to free an innocent  local party from a case where the judge finds there is no plausible  case against that party. That plausibility standard is the same  standard the Supreme Court has said should be used to dismiss pleadings  for failing to state a valid legal claim, and the same standard should  apply to release innocent parties from lawsuits.   Second, the bill allows judges to look at evidence that the trial  lawyers aren't acting in good faith in adding local defendants. This is  a standard some lower courts already use to determine whether a trial  lawyer really intends to pursue claims against the local defendant or  is just using them as part of their forum-shopping strategy.   This bill is strongly supported by the National Federation of  Independent Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other  legal reform advocates. Please join me in supporting this vital  legislation to reduce litigation abuse and forum shopping and to  protect innocent parties from costly, extended, and unnecessary  litigation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment makes several  technical changes to the bill, none of which alter its basic policy,  but all of which add clarity to the bill where necessary.   First, in the section of the bill governing conflicts of interest,  this amendment strikes the prohibition on the use of the same class  counsel if the named plaintiff is a present or former client or has a  contractual relationship with the class counsel. In some instances,  those restrictions may unduly limit the availability of class counsel  or class representatives, so this amendment would remove them. It also  clarifies that nothing in the conflicts of interest section of the bill  applies to securities class actions, which have their own provisions  for selection of class representatives and counsel elsewhere in the  U.S. Code. The same exemption for securities class actions is made to  the stay of discovery section of the bill because, again, securities  class actions have their own discovery stay provisions elsewhere in the  U.S. Code.   Second, the amendment makes technical changes to the misjoinder  section of the bill, making clear it applies only to civil actions  commenced in State court and subsequently removed to Federal court, and  that a Federal court can retain jurisdiction over claims that are so  related to each other that they form part of the same case and  controversy under Article III of the Constitution, and the plaintiff  consents to the removal of the claim.   Third, the amendment extends from 30 days to 90 days the amount of  time for Federal courts to review the sufficiency of the allegations  verification submissions made in the section on multidistrict  litigation. The amendment also makes clear that a particular case may  not be tried in a multidistrict proceeding unless all parties in that  particular case consent--not all parties in the entire multidistrict  proceeding. And it also makes clear in the section providing that the  claimant shall not receive less than 80 percent of any monetary  recovery, that such section does not alter the claimant's obligations  to satisfy liens on the recovery--that is, debts owed to the Federal  Government or to private insurers--for medical services received by the  claimant for the treatment of the injuries alleged in the litigation.  So, for example, if a person took a medicine and alleges he suffered  injury as a result, a Federal program may  [[Page H1984]]  have paid for the treatment of the injury. If the person gets a  settlement of his claim, it would include money for those medical  services that should be paid back to the Federal Government. The  revision makes clear that the satisfaction of such liens should come  out of the 80 percent received by the claimant. The amendment also  makes clear that the authorization for appeals from orders in MDL  proceedings is limited to cases seeking redress for personal injury.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these  clarifying and improving amendments, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).   The amendment was agreed to.                                time  1645                    Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Deutch    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated.  Abraham Lincoln left behind pages of notes on a lecture he was to give  to lawyers. They say: ``Never stir up litigation. A worse man can  scarcely be found than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a  fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search  of defects in titles, whereon to stir up strife and put money in his  pocket?''   That was Lincoln in the 1850s. Here is Forbes Magazine just a couple  of years ago:         The lead plaintiff in the 5-Hour case . . . worked in       marketing for a cosmetic surgery center in California. But in       a grueling 5-hour deposition, she admitted she had been       recruited to serve as a plaintiff by her cousin, who worked       for a Texas lawyer; had purchased two bottles of 5-Hour       ENERGY specifically to sue the manufacturer; had never       complained to the company or sought a refund; and had signed       a backdated retainer agreement with the trial lawyer,       Rubinstein, the fellow seen here at his own deposition. . . .       Another one of Rubinstein's clients . . . admitted she had       served as a plaintiff for Rubinstein in at least four class       actions over products like Swanson pot pies and lipstick. . .       . Emails and other communications 5-Hour's lawyers uncovered       in their suit showed that Rubinstein belonged to a loose       affiliation of lawyers who ran an assembly-line process of       identifying companies to sue and then helping each other find       plaintiffs.   [[Page H1985]]     Lawsuits are supposed to be initiated by truly injured plaintiffs  seeking redress, not invented by lawyers who hunt for a plaintiff to  assert a supposed injury made up by the lawyer.   Few class members bother to collect the payments available in class  action settlements, in large part because they don't feel injured by  the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place.   In too many cases, trial lawyers come up with an idea for a lawsuit  and then search for a person who has bought the product, or they send a  relative or employee to buy the product so they will have someone who  can sue on behalf of a proposed class of all other buyers. No product  purchaser has actually complained or feels cheated; it is just lawyers  in pursuit of money. That is a major reason why so few class members  bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements.  They don't feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first  place.   This abuse of the class action lawyer-driven lawsuits must end. The  base bill, therefore, requires lawyers to disclose how proposed class  representatives became involved in the class action. Further, it  prohibits class actions in which any proposed class representative,  that is, a named plaintiff that will be representing everyone else in  the class action, is a relative of or an employee of the class action  lawyer.   Further clarifications making clear that this provision will not  apply to present or former clients of, or those who have had any  contractual relationship with, class counsel have already been made to  the bill in the manager's amendment. The only prohibition that remains  in the bill is the bar on class counsel using a relative or employee as  a class representative. Clearly, that shouldn't be permitted.   The class representative is supposed to be representing the class  interests, to independently ``be the client'' for the class, and tell  counsel what to do. That independence will be gone if the class  representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel. This  amendment should be defeated.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated.   Insofar as a class action seeks equitable relief, that is, the  nonmonetary relief, including any injunctive relief that seeks to stop  the defendant from doing something wrong, the portion of any class  action lawyer's fee should be limited to a reasonable percentage of the  value of that relief as determined by the court.   This provision won't affect fee awards in civil rights cases because  both the monetary and equitable relief attorney's fees provision in  this bill are qualified with the initial phrase, ``unless otherwise  specified by Federal statute.''   The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in  its discretion, to award reasonable attorney's fees as part of the  costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including  cases brought under 28 U.S.C. section 1983, the statute most commonly  used to assert civil rights claims. Consequently, this bill won't  affect attorney's fees in civil rights class actions at all.    Regarding other equitable relief cases that don't involve civil  rights claims, Federal courts routinely determine the value of  intangible relief such  [[Page H1986]]  as equitable or injunctive relief for purposes of determining whether  the amount in controversy requirement--currently, $75,000 to get into  court--is met.   A majority of courts consider only the value of the injunctive relief  from the plaintiff's perspective or viewpoint. Some courts determine  the jurisdictional amount by evaluating the claim from the perspective  of the party seeking Federal court jurisdiction. Others have adopted  the ``either viewpoint'' rule, which allows the court to look to either  the plaintiff's or the defendant's viewpoint in establishing the amount  in controversy in cases seeking some form of injunctive relief.   The bottom line is that, under this bill, Federal courts will be able  to use either approach in deciding the value of the injunctive relief  provided to class members; and generally speaking, counsel should be  paid on the basis of what lawyers actually deliver to their clients.   This base bill, of course, does not alter in any way the relief that  would be granted to equitable relief class action members. It only  limits the fees attorneys would receive to a reasonable percentage of  the value of what the class members actually received. So all this  amendment would do would be to put more money in the hands of lawyers  and less in the hands of victims.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, constitutional rights are priceless, but  attorney's fees have to be set by the court. Who else is going to set  them in those cases?   I want to correct the gentleman, again, on this point about section  1983 cases because this bill says very clearly: unless otherwise  specified by Federal statute.   So this bill is not affected by the very example that he cites  because that is something that is otherwise specified by Federal  statute.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this needless and  harmful amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The gentleman from Virginia is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The gentleman from Virginia is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be rejected. The discovery  process--the pretrial process in a lawsuit in which trial lawyers  demand documents and other things from the people they are suing-- imposes huge costs on defendants, particularly because of the  astronomical costs associated with the discovery of electronic  information, such as emails.   Law Technology News has reported that the total cost of electronic  discovery rose from $2 billion in 2006 to $2.8 billion in 2009 and  estimated that the total cost would rise 10 to 15 percent annually over  the next few years. In a more recent case study of Fortune 500  companies, the RAND Institute found that the median total cost for  electronic discovery among participants totaled $1.8 million per case.   These costs are asymmetric. While defendants typically are subject to  gigantic discovery costs, because they are large organizations  possessing large amounts of data, plaintiffs have little information in  their possession, and, therefore, are subject to a very small financial  burden during the discovery process.   Moreover, discovery conducted before a motion to dismiss is decided  is unfair. Why should defendants bear the burden of paying for  discovery before a complaint is held legally sufficient, especially  when the threat of huge costs may coerce an unjustified settlement?   The reality for most civil litigation is that the defendants'  obligation to bear these exorbitant discovery costs incentivizes  plaintiffs to serve burdensome discovery requests on defendants with  zero downside risk to themselves. As professor Martin Redish has  explained: ``The fact that a party's opponents will have to bear the  financial burden of preparing the discovery response actually gives  litigants an incentive to make discovery requests, and the bigger  expense to be borne by the opponent, the bigger incentive to make the  request.''   Because defendants seek to avoid these exorbitant costs, discovery is  all too often used as a weapon to coerce settlement of claims  regardless of their  [[Page H1987]]  merit. Even the Supreme Court has recognized this problem, lamenting  that the threat of discovery expense will push cost-conscious  defendants to settle even anemic cases before reaching trial.   For example, assume that a defendant moves to dismiss a class action  because it doesn't assert any valid claims. Under current law, the  named plaintiff can serve massive discovery requests that force  defendants to spend $10 million to collect the requested documents. A  rational decision for that defendant is to settle the case for  millions, even if 4 months later the court grants the motion to  dismiss, finding the class claims to be totally without merit. That is  because, without a stay in discovery, the defendants will, in the  meantime, have been required to spend all or part of the $10 million  costs complying with the discovery requests for, it turns out, no  legitimate reason. Trial lawyers pursue discovery in this circumstance  primarily in an effort to pressure the defendant to settle invalid  claims.   The subsection of the bill entitled ``Stay of discovery'' would stop  the use of discovery to coerce unjustified settlements by requiring  Federal courts to stay discovery pending resolution of rule 12  motions--that is, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim-- motions to strike class allegations, motions to transfer, and other  motions that would dispose of class allegations unless the court finds  that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to  prevent undue prejudice to a party.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be defeated, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman will be pleased to know  that tomorrow we will consider on the floor of this House legislation  that, under rule XI, would impose mandatory sanctions on attorneys who  engage in the type of activity he just described. That is an abuse as  well. It will be covered by that legislation. But this legislation is  appropriate to make sure that justice is done in class action  litigation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would subject certain  class members to unfair treatment and should be rejected.   The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of  evaluating like  [[Page H1988]]  claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a  class to extort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of cases  from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to  incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger  and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of  disproportionately awarding uninjured parties.   Why should only the claimants covered by the amendment be subject to  particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a  class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to  see their own compensation reduced? This does a disservice to those  claimants. Yet, that is exactly what this amendment would do.   Regardless of the subject matter, class action plaintiffs are  increasingly inclined to include fraud claims in their complaints. If  they are suing about an allegedly defective product, they will add  fraud claims, alleging that the manufacturer committed fraud by not  disclosing the defect. If they are suing for a breach of contract, they  will add fraud allegations, saying that the defendant didn't disclose  the alleged breach, and so on and so forth.   Thus, this amendment would effectively gut the entire bill, since, to  avoid its important reforms, class action lawyers would simply add  fraud claims to their complaints, as they are increasingly prone to do  in any event.   Regarding the Volkswagen case, some opponents have urged that, if  enacted, the base bill would have prevented the filing of the class  actions related to the Volkswagen diesel emission controversy. Those  assertions are false.   This bill's injury provision would be readily satisfied in the VW  cases, as class members presumably would argue that they have been  injured by their purchase of vehicles with noncompliant emission  systems.   Further, if the scope or type of injury differed among class members,  separate class actions could be filed for each group, as actually  occurred with respect to differing models in the Volkswagen MDL  proceeding.   The bill's requirement about class representative disclosures would  be easily satisfied. Many class members are interested in the  litigation and presumably ready to serve as conflict-free class  representatives who would not run afoul of these provisions.   The bill's ascertainability provisions would pose no obstacles  because vehicle registration records would provide reliable class  member lists and counsel could easily demonstrate a method to get any  relief to class members.   Requiring that payment of counsel fees await distribution of class  benefits and that fees reflect a reasonable percentage of benefits  actually received by class members would not impede bringing such  cases.   The cases would be litigated without resort to issues classes.  Disclosure of any third-party litigation funding of the class actions  wouldn't preclude such cases. The provision doesn't prohibit such  funding. Only disclosure is required. Staying discovery while motions  to dismiss are pending also poses no roadblock.   Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to defeat this gutting  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say to the gentleman that  there is nothing in this bill that would restrict access to class  actions based upon fraud claims. And in fact, this bill is designed to  maximize the recovery for those fraud victims, rather than lining the  pockets of attorneys.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, with great deference and respect to my  friend and colleague, the ranking member, this amendment would subject  certain class members to unfair treatment and, thus, should be  rejected.   First, the bill's provisions on type and scope of injury only apply  to proposed classes ``seeking monetary relief for personal injury or  economic loss.'' Insofar as civil rights cases do not seek money  damages, they are completely unaffected by the bill and would proceed  just as they do today.   However, if money damages are sought by a proposed class, then, of  course, they should be subject to the procedures in the bill. The  purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like  claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a  class to extort a larger settlement value.   Exempting a subset of money damage cases from the bill, as this  amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of  artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from  innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding  uninjured parties.   Any claims seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic  loss should be grouped in classes in which those who are the most  injured receive the most compensation. Why should civil rights  claimants seeking money damages be subject to particularly unfair  treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other  uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own  compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those claimants. Yes,  that is exactly what this amendment would do.   Further, the bill's provision on attorneys' fees won't affect fee  awards in civil rights cases at all because both the monetary and  equitable relief attorneys' fees provision in the bill are qualified  with the initial phrase ``unless otherwise specified by Federal  statute.''   The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in  its discretion, to award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the  costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including  cases brought under 28 U.S.C. section 1983, the statute most commonly  used to assert civil rights claims.   Consequently, this bill will not affect attorneys' fees in civil  rights class actions at all, including, of course, cases brought under  the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has its own attorneys' fees  provision.   The conflicts of interest provision reflects a valid concern in all  class actions. The courts need to know how the named plaintiffs came to  be involved in class actions in all types of cases to ensure there  aren't conflicts and that the due process rights of all class members  are protected.   The issues class provision won't disrupt the manner in which civil  rights cases are normally litigated. Discovery stays while dispositive  motions are pending won't disrupt civil rights cases. Like any other  case, the plaintiffs need to show they have a facially valid complaint  before discovery should commence.   Disclosure of third-party funding is no less important in civil  rights cases than in other class actions. The appeals provision  benefits both plaintiffs and defendants, giving either side the right  to appeal if class certification is granted or denied.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would set  back the just causes of civil rights claimants.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1730    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized  for 5 minutes.  [[Page H1999]]         Mr. Speaker, the base bill contains provisions that  allow all claims to go forward as class actions and also maximize  awards to deserving victims.   Why would anyone want to single out safe drinking water victims for  adverse treatment and deny them the benefits of the base bill that  would maximize any recovery they might receive in a class action?   This motion to recommit would do that, and it should be defeated.   In closing, let me say that we know that only the tiniest fraction of  consumer class action members ever bother to claim the compensation  awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that the vast  majority--the vast large numbers of class members are satisfied with  the product they purchased. They don't want compensation. They don't  want to be lumped into gigantic class action lawsuits.   Federal judges are crying out for the Congress to reform the class  action system, which currently allows trial lawyers to file classes  with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those  artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.   As I have recounted, some class action settlements have left lawyers  with millions in fees while the alleged victims receive absolutely  nothing.   This bill prevents people from being forced into class actions with  other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to have the  compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer fees  be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims  actually receive.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this motion to recommit  and supporting this bill on behalf of the consumers and injured parties  everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
