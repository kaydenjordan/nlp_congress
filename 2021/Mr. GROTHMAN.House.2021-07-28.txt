 Mr. Speaker, I noticed this morning that in the last  week there were a couple more homicides in the city of my birth,  Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee right now is on pace to exceed the  record number of homicides they had last year. This did not happen in a  vacuum.   There are some people who blame guns, but other crimes are up as  well, which shows guns have nothing to do with it. The reason is that  law enforcement is under attack and has been passive, not only in  Milwaukee, but in Chicago, in Baltimore, in Philadelphia, and  Washington.   And why are they passive? Because politicians in this Chamber and  politicians around the country have tried to blame the police for  incarceration rather than blame the criminal. And as a result, police  are scared to act, afraid to be aggressive, and we have murder rates  higher than we have seen in quite a while, and we recently hit 90,000  deaths a year from illegal drug use.   These additional deaths, to me, the blood is on the people who ignore  the studies that show that police are not racist and continue to push  the police into a more passive fashion. We must stop this cheap  politicking.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to talk about this bill  overall, as well as potential amendments to the bill.  [[Page H4150]]    Above all, this time around, after the massive increase of spending  due to COVID, I think we ought to look as to whether this budget is  frugal and whether the increases in the budget are actually necessary.    I am going to address the line in the budget for international  organizations, contributions to international organizations. The bill,  as proposed on the floor today, is a 10 percent increase over last  year. A lot of that money is going to the United Nations, a body that  seems to delight in being critical of the United States and a body in  which the clear majority of members operate governments in which you  would not want to live there at all, human rights abuses and otherwise.   In any event, I think we should go back to the last en bloc. There is  an amendment in there. Rather than increase the amount to these  international organizations by 10 percent, decrease the amount by 10  percent.   We are putting so much pressure on the value of the dollar, so much  debt on our children and grandchildren.   The idea of going back, not to a draconian level, but the idea of  going back to somewhere between where we were in 2019 and 2020, not a  radical number, I think would be prudent.   I think, in this line as well as other lines of the budget, we should  be looking to hold things about even or a mild step back, not another  massive 10 percent increase, which will largely fund an organization  that takes delight in making fun of the United States and the freedoms  that we have.    Madam Speaker, as part of this en bloc, we have two  separate amendments. I will address them separately.   The one amendment that was just addressed concerns DACA recipients  and whether they should be hired here.   In 2018, we had 830,000 Americans sworn in to be new citizens. I  don't think anybody can accuse the United States of being shy about  letting other people in this country.   Obviously, if we make permanent the policy that any young person who  is brought here automatically can work their way to be a United States  citizen, we will have what we currently see at the southern border. We  will have, again and again and again, parents coming here either asking  for asylum or sending their children here by themselves, knowing that  we are not going to enforce the immigration laws.   Now, I think everybody here knows that the day will probably come  where something is done with some DACA recipients, but it shouldn't be  all DACA recipients. The idea of establishing right now that if you  came here, you automatically are--I think the inference is you are  going to become a citizen by saying that you can work in the Capitol  when these jobs are highly in demand for many of our own citizens is a  little ridiculous.   One of my amendments removes the provision that says that people who  are still in this country illegally can wind up working for the  legislature.   The second amendment concerns the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  I think the gentleman from Ohio kind of mischaracterized the amendment.  We  [[Page H4168]]  are not cutting anything here. We are leaving things in the same place  they were in the last budget.   We have spent money in the last 12, 14 months of this institution  like never before. We went through trillions of dollars. That is one of  the reasons why we have such high inflation, one of the reasons why  young people are going to find it so difficult to buy a house compared  to the older generation, one of the reasons why the cost of food is up.   We cannot, as we go line by line through this budget, create a  situation in which we are doubling lines in the budget. That is what we  are doing here.   The other things that are particularly irritating about this, if you  go through the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, almost all the things  they purport to do are done somewhere else in the legislative branch.  They are really not adding a lot.   Obviously, it is one of these groups that I think is going to train  people to view themselves not as individuals but more as a group, which  I don't think is helpful for America as a whole. But, again, after  going so overwhelmingly in debt, we have a Legislative Branch budget  that is up 13 percent.   It would be interesting to ask how many Americans out there, how many  of their individual salaries or compensation went up by 13 percent in  the last year. But for Congress, no big deal.   Legislative Branch is up 13 percent, House Office of Diversity and  Inclusion doubled. On its face, preposterous. I bet if you polled the  American public, I wonder if there are any lines in this budget they  want doubled, but particularly in an agency that, like I said, their  function can be dealt with by other groups.   Madam Speaker, in any event, I encourage passage of this en bloc and  the two amendments.
