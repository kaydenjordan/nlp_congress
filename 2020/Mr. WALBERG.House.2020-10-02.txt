 Madam Speaker, I thank the Speaker and the leadership  for asking me, as the chairman of the House Congressional Prayer  Caucus, to lead the House in prayer for our President.   I would ask the Members to join me.   Father, I thank You that You are a God that hears and answers  prayers. And, God, You aren't partisan. And today, we have been shocked  with the word that our President and First Lady, Melania, have tested  positive with COVID.   You know and You care. God, I would pray that we would unite together  at least in this today, as a country and as a body, to pray for our  President, even as Your Scriptures instruct us to pray for those in  authority.   We pray that You would spare them, that You would heal them, even as  we pray for many, many, many others in our country and around the world  who have been caught with this virus. But, in turn, I pray as well that  You would tenderize our hearts, that You would unify our country, even  with this being brought on today.   And I pray that our President would understand and take on the words  of Psalm 16:1, words that meant much to George Washington, our first  President, that said: Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.   God, may we take refuge in You, even as our President, and may You  heal our land as You heal him.   It is in the name of Jesus, my Savior, I pray.   Amen.                            ____________________
