 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a printing of a painting  done by a talented Detroit artist, Jonathan Harris.   Jonathan named the painting ``Critical Race Theory.'' It gives me  chills as I look at it on how the contrived fight against our history,  Black history specifically, seeks to erase the fight, struggle,  triumphs, and success of our Black neighbors in our country.   So as many of us recognize and celebrate Black History Month, I  implore those who are pushing to erase our history, including many  colleagues in this body, to stop with the empty words and gestures. You  cannot erase history to paint the picture you want. We won't stand for  it.                            ____________________
