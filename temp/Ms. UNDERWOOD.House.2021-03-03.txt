 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  1, the For the People Act.  [[Page H1030]]    My amendment would require the Comptroller General to analyze the  impact of the voluntary small-donor financing program on the racial,  gender, and socioeconomic diversity of candidates for public office.   As the first woman and first person of color to represent Illinois'  14th Congressional District, I know that Americans with diverse  backgrounds and experiences are electable everywhere in this country,  but too often, excellent candidates without personal wealth or  corporate backing are outspent and overpowered long before the voters  get a say.   The Brennan Center found that small-donor financing cannot only make  running for public office an opportunity for more Americans, but also  increase the racial and gender diversity of our elected officials by  giving every candidate a fighting chance.   My amendment would make sure H.R. 1 fulfills its promise of letting  the people decide who represents them. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
