 Mr. Speaker, last year's Presidential election  was the first in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting  Rights Act. What was the result?   Fourteen States had new voting restrictions, including strict voter  ID, cuts to same-day registration and early voting, and fewer polling  places. This suppressed the vote, particularly among voters of color  and in poor communities, and had a major impact in close races in North  Carolina, Virginia, and Florida, according to the Brennan Center for  Justice.   The Voting Rights Act once enjoyed bipartisan support, and Congress  should, once again, come together to modernize the law and respond to  the Supreme Court's objections. Yet despite calls to pass legislation  for the past 4 years, nothing has happened.   Voting is a right, not a privilege, and there is no debating that  point.   The Founders in Philadelphia, women at Seneca Falls, and marchers in  Selma all recognized the power of the vote. When we protect the rights  of voters to make their choices, whatever they may be, we do our part  to build a more perfect union.   We can't wait for the next election. Congress must restore the full  protections of the Voting Rights Act now.                            ____________________
