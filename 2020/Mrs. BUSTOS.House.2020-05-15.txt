 Mr. Speaker, a Boy Scout named Noah from Peoria,  Illinois, wrote to me. He heard his city council talking about layoffs  in the wake of COVID-19. Noah understands that we have failed towns  like his. He  [[Page H2230]]  wrote: ``Many people are going to lose their jobs. Some of those will  be firefighters and police officers. That will not help my city. . . .  The city will not be as safe.''   Noah, I hear you. Today, the United States House of Representatives  hears you.   With $915 billion for State and local assistance, we will help towns  and cities like Noah's. We will also expand assistance to small  businesses and farmers and keep families afloat.   This isn't the final battle in the war against this virus, but the  HEROES Act will increase American security--our food, health, and  workplace security. I will vote ``yes.''
