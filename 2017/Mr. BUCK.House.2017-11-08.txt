 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 609 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 609         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2201) to       amend the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt certain micro-      offerings from the registration requirements of such Act, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Financial Services; (2)       the amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. The rule provides 1 hour of debate and makes in  order all amendments offered at the Rules Committee.   I want to note that not one amendment to this rule or to this bill  was offered by the Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is an important step  toward helping small businesses grow across our country. Small  businesses aren't just about selling a product or providing a service.  Entrepreneurs take the risk for a chance to improve their community and  their family's livelihood. These individuals employ our friends and  families and improve our quality of life. Congress needs to do what we  can to help entrepreneurs succeed.   Young businesses need to use their limited capital, time, and  resources to grow their business, not fill out bureaucratic paperwork.  This problem has only grown worse since Congress passed the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.   When Dodd-Frank passed, Congress promised it would protect consumers.  But it has only hurt community banks, small businesses, and the middle  class. Dodd-Frank's burdensome regulatory regime has caused community  banks to disappear across America, making access to capital more  difficult for many small businesses.   The House passed the Financial CHOICE Act to repeal and replace Dodd- Frank, but it currently sits untouched in the United States Senate. I  hope they will quickly vote to repeal Dodd-Frank and make credit easier  to access for Main Street.   But there is more we can do in the people's House to help create new  jobs and opportunities. All too often the Federal Government creates  regulations that disproportionately hurt small businesses. While a  large corporation may have a team of lawyers to comply with these  rules, this is rarely the case for a young business. That is why I  support this bill.   This bill ends ambiguity in the law by clearly defining a nonpublic  offering exemption under the Securities Act. Currently, companies just  starting out risk unintentionally violating these laws, which might  discourage them from seeking the capital they need to grow. It is  common sense to ensure our country's laws are clear and to allow small  businesses to operate without fear of accidentally violating the law.   Our economy depends on small businesses and those who put everything  on the line to pursue the American Dream. This bill will benefit all of  us by helping those individuals grow their businesses and create jobs  in their communities. In order to help our small businesses grow and  create jobs, we need to pass this rule and pass the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step to improve the American  economy. We need to support small businesses and their ability to grow.  This will happen if we give the free market the opportunity to work.   We should get bureaucrats out of the way of small-business owners who  only want to serve their families and communities. This bill moves us  in that direction.   I thank Congressman Tom Emmer for introducing this important bill and  for taking the time to come to the floor today. I also thank Chairman  Hensarling for his work on these bills as well as the House Financial  Services Committee.   Chairman Hensarling recently announced that he will not be seeking  reelection to Congress, but we will all remember the great work he has  done during his time in D.C. and the important contribution he made to  the legislation we are looking at today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule, and I  ask them to vote ``yes'' on the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 609 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2 Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
