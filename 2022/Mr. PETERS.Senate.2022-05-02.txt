 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of U.A. Sprinklerfitters Local No. 704 of metro Detroit.  Functioning under different names and charters over the past century,  the Local has supported the employment of its members, while  simultaneously bargaining for higher wages and better benefits.  [[Page S2245]]    In May of 1907, Sprinklerfitting tradesmen in the Detroit area came  together in their first effort to organize. They were rewarded for  their efforts with a charter by the United Association of Plumbers,  Gasfitters, and Steamfitters of the U.S. and Canada--U.A.--as Local No.  358. Initial optimism quickly dimmed, as the Local faced opposition  from surrounding contactors and companies. Disbanding and reorganizing  twice, the Local reemerged as Local No. 669 in 1915 and was granted a  new charter by the U.A. It would operate under this charter for another  32 years.   Within its first 7 years of formation, leaders from Local No. 669 had  successfully argued for 2 consecutive years of wage increases and the  addition of a local U.A. auxiliary office location to better serve the  craftsmen of the region. This sense of unity was in no small part  responsible for helping the local weather the economic devastation of  America's Great Depression, which stifled progress across the country's  economy for nearly a decade. Membership in Local No.669 protected the  wages and working conditions of sprinklerfitters in Detroit throughout  the economic crisis.   Passage of the New Deal legislation by President Franklin Delano  Roosevelt provided work opportunities in the form of public projects,  supporting the sprinklerfitters of Local No. 669. In 1941, as the  United States formally announced their entrance into the Second World  War, factories in Detroit quickly pivoted to join the efforts turning  the city into the ``biggest war boomtown of them all.'' Among the  projects undertaken by Local No. 669 in this time was the outfitting of  the Ford Willow Run Bomber Plant in Ypsilanti. In 1947, Local No. 669  once again reorganized, taking on the charter of Local No. 704 with  jurisdiction over sprinklerfitting work in Wayne, Macomb, and Oakland  Counties, with nearby Washtenaw joining a decade later. Local No. 704  continued to enjoy positive growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s,  increasing their number of journeymen and apprentices, along with  increased benefits and wages.   This progress would begin to falter as the local headed into the  1970s and companies began moving factories to ``right to work states,''  decreasing one of their core contract bases. Despite the auto flight,  members of Local No. 704 remained well employed and worked on a variety  of local projects, including the Pontiac Silverdome and Detroit's Joe  Louis Arena and Renaissance Center. Although they faced low employment  in the first half of the decade, by the end of the 1980s, Local No. 704  had helped build, along with many other projects, the Detroit Hamtramck  Assembly Plant, the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building, the Chrysler  World Head Quarters and Technological Center, the Palace of Auburn  Hills and would close out the decade with a newly negotiated contract  with the National Fire and Sprinkler Association, formerly known as the  U.A.   Demand for work remained strong throughout the 1990s, and Local No.  704 entered the new millennium with a robust membership able to meet  the demands of the growth of local automakers and universities. Between  2000 and 2007, Local No. 704 assisted in the construction of the  General Motors Assembly Center, the north terminal of the Detroit  airport, Detroit's MGM Grand and Greektown Casinos, and the Henry Ford  Hospital in West Bloomfield. The Great Recession of 2008 stalled much  employment in the area for a number of years, bringing membership in  Local No. 704 down by nearly half. However, as work slowly started to  resume in 2011 and 2012, Local No. 704 was able to rely on its history  of strong organization skills to successfully secure jobs using the  Local's targeted fund. In 2012 alone, the Local saw a return of nearly  $6 for every $1 spent by the fund.   By 2015, Local No. 704 had emerged into a period of success carrying  them easily to their 100th year anniversary in 2021. In these 6 years,  members of the Local had a hand in many major projects in the area,  including the construction of a new Amazon facility and the renovation  of the historic David Whitney Building in Detroit. The opening of a new  state-of-the-art training center and headquarters for the  sprinklerfitters of Local No. 704 helped close out the decade.   U.A. Sprinklerfitters Local No. 704 has weathered many obstacles but  has remained strong and enters their 101st year well positioned for  continued success. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing  their longevity, their skilled membership, and the immensely positive  impact they have made on the communities of southeast Michigan.                            ____________________
