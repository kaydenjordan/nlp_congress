 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3652 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It eliminates  the instruction to the Senate Finance Committee whereupon people would  be able to have their taxes increased.   If you want to have taxes go up in this country on corporations or  people, vote against my amendment. If, instead, you want to make sure  taxes are not raised on corporations or people, vote for my amendment.  Simple as that.   I ask people in this audience who want to keep taxes down, vote yes.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
