 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Florida  Air National Guard's 125th Fighter Wing on their return home after a 4- month deployment in support of Operation Spartan Shield.   During their deployment, the 125th Fighter Wing served as an  essential and direct combat support component of that mission that  provided intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in southwest  Asia and contributed to a successful mission. I thank these brave Air  Force men and women who are willing to go abroad and risk their lives  for our freedom.   We are incredibly proud of the more than 1,600 Air Force men and  women who make up the 125th Fighter Wing to provide 24/7, 365 air  homeland defense to combatant commanders worldwide, while  simultaneously protecting the life and property of Floridians during  times of crisis.   I especially want to thank their families and the northeast Florida  community for supporting these brave men and women before, during, and  after they are sent into harm's way.   Also, Mr. Speaker, as a 41-year law enforcement officer, I know what  due process is and I know what fairness is when I see it. This  impeachment process provides no due process, nor fairness.                            ____________________
