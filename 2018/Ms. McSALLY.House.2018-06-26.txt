 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the underlying  legislation, H.R. 6157, the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year  2019, and I appreciate the chairwoman's hard work on this issue and her  support for our troops.   My amendment is about the A-10 Warthog.   Three years ago, when I first came to Congress, I began to fight  against the Obama administration and their plan to mothball the entire  A-10 Warthog fleet. This is an airplane I flew and commanded in combat.  I know a little bit about it.   We won that fight.   Since then, the A-10 has been pivotal in schwacking ISIS and  bolstering European defenses, being ready south of the DMZ, and it has  now been sent back to Afghanistan.   Just recently, I visited the 25th Fighter Squadron in Korea, which  continues to serve on the front lines just south of the DMZ.   From close air support to combat search and rescue, the Warthog  continues to do the heavy lifting in saving lives wherever it is  called.   Now our fight is to ensure that we minimize any operational impact on  the A-10 fleet as it carries out these vital missions.   Of the 281 A-10s in the fleet, 109 of them still need new wing sets  in order to remain in the air and to fight. I fought for and got  funding in the fiscal year 2018 bill to start this re-winging again,  and we are glad to see the Air Force has chosen to include additional  funding in this year's base request to continue the re-winging.   In fact, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told the House Armed  Services Committee publicly for the first time in March, the Air Force  ``expects the A-10 to continue flying until at least 2030.''   Now that we are all on the same page, we can't afford to lose the A- 10's critical capabilities. We must move as quickly as possible to re- wing the rest of the fleet in order to mitigate impacts to current  operations.   That is why the House and Senate NDAA bills both authorized an  additional $65 million above the requested amount currently included in  this appropriations bill, for a total of $144 million for the A-10 re- winging in fiscal year 2019.   If we only appropriate the base request currently included in the  bill, we will only secure enough funding to re-wing somewhere between  12 and 16 aircraft.   At that rate, it will just take too long to re-wing the remaining 109  A-10s. It is just not fast enough.   These missions are happening now. We are literally flying the wings  off of these airplanes today, and our enemies won't wait.   We must accelerate the A-10 re-wing to ensure that we maintain these  critical missions and capabilities for our troops. My amendment simply  funds the A-10 wing replacement program to the fully authorized House  and Senate NDAA level by adding an additional $65 million above the  request.   Mr. Chair, I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Chairman, I want to say I just appreciate the  chairwoman's support for this amendment and for the critical missions  of the A-10. I would ask everyone to please support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
