 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House  Intelligence Committee, I am proud of the bipartisanship that allowed  us to put this bill together.   Our committee, which normally operates quietly, has gotten more  attention than normal this year as we conduct the critical business of  investigating Russian intervention in our elections.   But we still do our day job--overseeing intelligence programs and  providing support to the men and women of our intelligence community  who fight to keep our country safe.   This bill is the culmination of this cooperation.   Our country is facing a wide array of pervasive and complex threats.   Our near-peer adversaries, Russia and China, are rapidly growing  their military capabilities and regularly, unashamedly violating  international law.   A nuclear weapons stockpile and functioning ICBM program now sit in  the hands of an unpredictable North Korean dictator.   And the so-called caliphate started by ISIS is losing ground, only to  increase homegrown attacks against the United States and its allies.   My constituents, like all Americans, are rightly concerned.   But they can feel confident that we are working with the intelligence  community on ways to address them.   As the Ranking Member of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, I am  particularly interested in supporting our intelligence professionals  who assess and prevent terrorist threats to our homeland--while  protecting the civil rights and liberties of innocent Americans.   I'm working to ensure they use their expertise, as well as that in  the private sector, to find and remove online propaganda used to  recruit would-be attackers.   I'm also proud to include language that will enable the IC and  private sector to temporarily exchange IT talent in order to better  tackle some of the toughest cybersecurity challenges.   Mr. Speaker, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff have led this  process with bipartisan professionalism.   This bill is stronger because it reflects the input of all of our  members.   The full House should have this same opportunity--not be forced to  vote up or down under suspension.   Republican leadership owes it to our members to return to regular  order so our bill can benefit from the input of the full House.
