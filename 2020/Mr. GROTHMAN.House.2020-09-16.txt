 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Bacon).     Recognizing Dean C. Mathisen's Service to our Nation and Nebraska's                              Second District     Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to address several issues.   The first issue that has been in the paper lately is vitamin D. I  have spoken before this Chamber several times in the past on the  importance of taking vitamin D. Over 40 percent of American adults do  not have an adequate amount of vitamin D in their system.   Several institutions of higher learning have done research and  strongly suggest that vitamin D is a way to reduce the number of people  who get COVID as well as greatly reduce the effects of COVID on those  people who unfortunately get it. This has been found by MIT, by  Northwestern in Evanston, and by Trinity College in Iowa.   It has been my disappointment to this point that the appropriate  government agencies that have no problem sending out press releases and  advertisements on COVID have not addressed vitamin D.   I was, therefore, elated to find out that, late last week, Dr. Fauci  came out and supported the evidence behind vitamin D's benefits. Even  more than that, Dr. Fauci said that he has been taking vitamin D  himself, which is very good. This is a change.   Traditionally, many people out there said that you should even stay  inside, and one way to get vitamin D is to be out in the Sun. So, the  idea that we need more vitamin D is the opposite of what some of the  experts or at least what some politicians have told us.   Vitamin D, of course, is good not only to prevent COVID but to  prevent other sorts of infections and respiratory problems as well.   Now that Dr. Fauci has come out and told us that getting more vitamin  D is a good idea, and particularly now that Dr. Fauci has admitted that  he himself has been taking vitamin D, I strongly encourage the CDC and  all other appropriate government agencies to publicize the benefits of  vitamin D.   We have to do something other than just wait for a vaccine, which may  or may not happen. And we all know, when it does happen, many people  will not take that vaccine.   I strongly encourage Dr. Fauci to follow up on his statements with  approving TV commercials talking about vitamin D and the fact that he  takes vitamin D in his future interviews.   Harvard estimates that 1 billion individuals worldwide may be vitamin  D deficient, and of course, the rest of the world looks to the United  States for leadership. So, the benefits would not only accrue to  American citizens but to citizens around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I remind you to take vitamin D, particularly if you have  any friends or relatives who may be vitamin D deficient or have special  problems. I would talk to your doctor and anybody who is going in for a  regular check-up. I would ask for a vitamin D test as well because  there are ways to reduce the number of people getting COVID and to  reduce the number of fatalities other than just hanging around and  waiting for a vaccine.   Mr. Speaker, the next topic I would like to address tonight is also a  medical topic that has been something I would have liked to address  since I got here. I came across some information with regard to  biosimilars, and that is people who need insulin.   I consider myself an advocate for the Juvenile Diabetes Association,  and I am aware of many different people who have diabetes. Depending  upon the type of insurance you have, Mr. Speaker, if you have diabetes,  you may be spending $100 a month on insulin. I have run into people who  are spending $800 or $1,000 a month for insulin.   Can you imagine if you have a child and you have to go out of pocket  for another $1,000 a month just to keep your child alive?   I ran into the fact that people are working on substitutes for  insulin called biosimilars. I am introducing H.R. 8190, the Biosimilar  Insulin Access Act, which will increase competition in the insulin  market by making biosimilars available. Biosimilars are to insulin what  generics are to normal prescription drugs.   It would be tremendous if we could get more of these to the market.  Right now, for whatever reason, it takes far too long to get these  products to market. Sometimes, they aren't available at all. Because  they are not available, people continue to have to overpay to keep  themselves or their loved ones alive.   Interchangeable biosimilar products are able to be automatically  dispensed at the pharmacy counter for their brand-name reference  product or brand-named insulin. We want to generate the same type of  cost savings for insulin that we have already done in the past for  generic drugs.   I realize it is late in the session, but things can move fast. We all  know that bills pass around here relatively soon after they are  introduced.   When I think of the people who are having to pay $1,000 a month or  maybe just $500 or $600 a month for themselves or their children, I  hope people in this building and the relevant committees and relevant  leadership find a way to get this bill to the floor.   I will be available to explain the importance of this bill. I am  ready to explain the importance of this bill to any of the Members. I  will be on the floor the next couple of days talking about it. I hope  to get a good cosponsorship list, but I do hope that the relevant  committees immediately take up this bill and get it to the floor so  that we can save as much money as possible for the people who are stuck  with this disease.   The final point I am going to bring up tonight is concerning border  security. It is an issue that, because of the COVID, has been pushed to  the background. But pushed to the background or not, it remains to be  important for this country.   No country can continue to exist if they have open borders and  unlimited and unvetted people continue to come here.   Now, there are people who come here whom we do not expect to come  here, who are caught or who come in contact with the border security,  and there are other people who sneak across the border. They are never  contacted by border security because, quite frankly, we have a shortage  of agents, though they are caught on cameras.   A year ago in May, right now about 15 months ago, 16 months ago,  about 90,000 people came into contact with the Border Patrol and were  allowed in this country--people who were not coming here through the  normal immigration channels. Since that time--it is something that has  been underpublicized, and quite frankly, it ought to be more publicized  by President Trump himself because he is not afraid to publicize his  successes--we have dropped from 90,000 people to under 2,000 people  coming into contact with our Border Patrol and let in the country.   This has been done by three things, all underpublicized.   One, President Trump, in part by talking about tariffs--I believe,  maybe not--has gotten the Mexican Government to agree to hold people on  the Mexican side of the border instead of having people who are asking  for asylum come to the United States and be released into the American  interior where we never see them again.                                time  1745    We all know that some of these people are probably drug-running. We  [[Page H4488]]  know that some of these people are breaking the law. And we know that  some of these people are going to wind up on some sort of public  assistance. So we salute President Trump for reaching an agreement and  holding people south of the border.   The next thing President Trump has done is he has contacted the  countries in Central America, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras and  made sure they are holding more people of not only their own nations,  but people further south in their countries rather than allowing them  into Mexico.   Now, the United States does provide foreign aid to these countries,  and I think it is important that we maintain good relations with these  countries. But I think it has been under-publicized that President  Trump, through negotiations with these countries, is further decreasing  the number of people who are coming into this country who we do not  necessarily want to have come into this country.   And the final situation, is now people coming into this country, who  may have COVID, are immediately turned around and told to go back home.   So you combine these three things, and you go from about 90,000  people coming into contact with the border patrol and being allowed in  here to--I am told--under 1,000. It is almost too good to believe. But  that is what happens when you have a man of action, a person who is  committed to holding people south of the border.   This is particularly true because in the future, we have people  talking about giving people coming across the border free healthcare.  We already know--unless you are blind--that people are taking advantage  of public benefits who are coming here illegally.   So I think at a time when there is so much bad news out of  government, we ought to pay attention to exactly what happened when we  went over 90,000 to certainly under 2,000--and maybe under 1,000  people--allowed in the country. I will point out that this does not  include people who do not come in contact with the border patrol. And  in the year that is wrapping up, we estimate that about 10,000 people  have come in here without contact with the border patrol. We know this  because we have cameras taking pictures of people sneaking across the  border. We do not have enough border control to turn these people  around.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the border patrol for the number of  pounds of cocaine, methamphetamines, and fentanyl which they have  turned around at the border in the most recent year. That is certainly  a degree of success. I know fentanyl, in particular, has been the  newest lately, and I wish Congress would pay much closer attention to  the people who are dying of fentanyl overdoses this year as the number  of people who are dying of other unfortunate incidents.   In any event, those are three things I want the American public to  pay attention to. I, again, emphasize the importance of taking vitamin  D.   I emphasize the importance of getting biosimilars to the market so  that we can save money for the poor people who have to take insulin.   And I salute the border patrol and the administration for all they  have done in greatly decreasing the number of people who are coming  into this country illegally.   Now, of course, in the Chamber today, we have many different people.  And I am prepared to ask to adjourn, but if the people in the front of  the room would rather hear a little bit more about fenofibrates, I  would be happy to talk about fenofibrates.   Do you want to hear about fenofibrates?    Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time and ask  for adjournment.                            ____________________
