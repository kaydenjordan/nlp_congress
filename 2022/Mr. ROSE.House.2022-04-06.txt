 Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States of America,  the most prosperous country in the world, has warned the American  people that a food shortage is a real possibility in our near future.   Much like our national energy shortage, this potential crisis has  been made much more likely by President Biden's out-of-control spending  and his unwillingness to tap into American resources, ingenuity, and  its people.   Since January of 2021, the prices of many of the key inputs used to  produce our Nation's food supply have substantially increased. Ammonia  is up 203 percent; liquid nitrogen is up 162 percent; and farm diesel,  used in almost every piece of farm equipment, is up a whopping 95  percent.   Spending more money won't fix this; in fact, it has made it worse by  causing the prices of everything to go up.   If a food shortage does come to the United States, the sole person to  blame will be President Biden, who has wasted no time spending our  country into a crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  hosting this Special Order tonight.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden's budget is symbolic of his wasteful  build back broke agenda that was filled with partisan provisions.   There is $73 trillion in new spending, $58 trillion in taxes, and $16  trillion in new debt, all over the next 10 years.   When hardworking Tennesseans get together and come up with a  household budget, they have difficult conversations with one another  about what exactly they can afford. If something falls under the  category of unnecessary and unaffordable, the last thing they do is put  it on their grandchildren's credit cards. That is exactly what this  budget does.   President Biden and congressional Democrats praising his proposal are  now on record seeming to have no issue with mortgaging our country and  its children's futures, even amidst the largest increase in inflation  since 1982.   There are many wasteful provisions in President Biden's budget  proposal, like the $11 billion being sent to foreign developing  countries to help adapt to global warming. The one that I struggle with  the most is the one that gives $400 million to Planned Parenthood and  other entities that perform abortions.   The Hyde amendment has existed in every Federal appropriations bill  since 1976. It is one of the most longstanding and bipartisan  agreements to protect Federal taxpayer dollars from going toward  abortion.   President Biden's decision to purposefully keep this out of his  budget proposal is wrong and will never get my support nor the support  of my constituents in middle Tennessee who are firmly pro-life.   Leaving out the Hyde amendment is only another partisan attempt to  advertise the President's anti-life position and satisfy those who  support the horrible atrocities of abortion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the Congress to stand firm in  their commitment to protecting life. We must restore the Hyde amendment  and reject President Biden's budget because no Tennessean's tax  dollars, nor dollars borrowed from our children and grandchildren,  should go toward subsidizing Planned Parenthood and the immoral  practice of abortion.
