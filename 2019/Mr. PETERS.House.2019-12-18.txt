 Madam Speaker, many have lamented that this effort is not  bipartisan, but that is on my Republican colleagues.   Republicans have not sought the truth. They have sought to avoid the  truth. They have demeaned and insulted witnesses, patriots, warriors,  and career diplomats who have provided evidence against the President.   No House Republican has joined us to demand the documents and  witnesses that President Trump has refused to produce.   And Senate Republican leaders, this week, have announced that  President Trump, himself, can set the rules of his trial and there will  be no fact witnesses.   Republicans refuse to seek the truth and condemn the abuse of power  or to work with us to prevent this ongoing behavior in the future, and  that is the tragedy of today's events.   In our Nation's history, thousands of Americans have gone into battle  without reservation to fight for our Republic as they still do today.  Many have been gravely injured, and some have made the ultimate  sacrifice. But today, in contrast, for fear of losing an election, my  colleagues will not speak up for the rule of law or against  Presidential abuse of power. Voters may give them a pass, but history  will judge them harshly.   I will vote for the Articles of Impeachment.
