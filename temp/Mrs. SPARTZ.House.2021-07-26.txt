 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Consider Teachers Act. When  created, the TEACH grant program was to support students interested in  becoming teachers. Unfortunately, the grant program has run into  administrative challenges brought on by clerical and paperwork issues.  Because of these issues, approximately two-thirds of all TEACH grants  are converting into Federal student loans.   To address these inadvertent errors, the Consider Teachers Act  reforms the program to ensure that teachers are not indebted due to  simple mistakes. First, the legislation gives grant recipients the  ability to reverse a conversion and eases the timeline for when the  grant recipients must certify their employment with the Department of  Education.   Second, the bill also extends the time grant recipients have to  fulfill their service obligation in response to the challenges posed by  the pandemic. The pandemic upended all of our lives, and teachers who  lost their job shouldn't be unfairly punished for circumstances outside  of their control.   Mr. Speaker, with the TEACH grant program, the Federal Government  made a commitment to future teachers, and the Consider Teachers Act  fulfills the original promise of the program. I urge all Members to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    In closing, Mr. Speaker, the TEACH grant program fails  too many of our teachers, and it needs to be fixed. It is important  that our Federal Government honors its promises. The Consider Teachers  Act creates flexibility and streamlines processes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this bill. Strong  teachers are essential for high-quality learning.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
