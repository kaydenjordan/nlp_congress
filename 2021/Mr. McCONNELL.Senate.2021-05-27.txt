 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, from coast to coast, American  families are facing an explosion of violent crime on their streets and  in their neighborhoods. The year 2020 saw homicides skyrocket  nationwide--the sharpest 1-year increase in decades--and 2021 is  already shaping up to be even worse.   Last year, Seattle saw a 61-percent increase in murders citywide. In  2020, Minneapolis saw homicides hit levels not seen since the 1990s,  and, so far, 2021 is about doubling last year's pace. Here in  Washington, DC, 2020 saw homicides hit a 16-year high, and, again, 2021  is already on an even worse trajectory. The situation is devolving all  across the country. In my hometown of Louisville, as one report put it:  ``[T]he number of slayings in 2020 dwarf[ed] anything Louisville has  seen--obliterating the previous record.''  [[Page S3549]]    Crime and delinquency have many causes. In some ways, the pandemic  likely contributed, but it is impossible to ignore that these terrible  trends are coming precisely as so-called ``progressives'' have decided  it is time to denounce and defund local law enforcement. Seattle, for  example, cut police funding by 20 percent. Minneapolis defunded cops by  millions of dollars. The District of Columbia's city council approved  $15 million in cuts. These boneheaded decisions are the direct result  of an anti-law enforcement fad that has swept through the political  left like a wildfire.   Perhaps just as important as these funding cuts is the wave of  hostile sentiment that has come with them. Harvard scholars have found  that, after high-profile incidents reduce the trust that the public and  politicians put in the police, the cities in question receive less  active policing and, subsequently, see an increase in crime, including  homicides.   In other words, in the wake of terrible incidents like we saw last  summer, local leaders should look for ways to build bridges and rebuild  trust between the vast majority of brave and honorable officers and  their communities.   Oh, no. Instead, from city councils to the Halls of Congress, many on  the far left decided to crank the knob all the way up on anti-cop  rhetoric all across the board:         Not only do we need to disinvest from police but we need to       completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department.        Policing in our country is inherently and intentionally       racist . . . No more policing, incarceration, and       militarization.    Incredulous people asked whether this nonsense was ever meant  seriously.   Helpfully, one Member of Congress clarified: ``Defunding police means  defunding police.''   That is a clarifying comment.   A small set of politicians may see selfish opportunities for fame or  fundraising if they defame and defund the police, but American families  are paying a deadly price.   Defunding the police isn't just a terrible idea for overall public  safety; it is also a uniquely awful strategy for racial justice. One  study recently confirmed: ``Larger police forces save lives, and the  lives saved are disproportionately Black lives.''   So, look. I am not sure exactly how the rantings of far-left Twitter  about crime and policing became official Democratic Party dogma in so  many places across America. What I do know is that ordinary Americans  cannot bear much more of this, and that goes double for the most  vulnerable neighborhoods.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, last week, the  Senate took up sweeping legislation that touches on big issues that  span many committees--from economic policy to national security, to  scientific research, and beyond.   Eighty-six Senators voted to proceed to this debate, me included.  That wasn't because the legislation was ready to go. It happened  because there is broad bipartisan agreement that America needs to  upgrade our competitiveness with China. There was broad agreement that  this subject deserved a robust debate and amendment process.   Since then we have voted on some amendments, but as of this moment,  the Senate's bipartisan work is simply not completed.   The Democratic leader indicated that if the chairman and ranking  members worked together, if committees put their heads together, their  work would get consideration out here on the floor.   Well, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo of the Finance  Committee have a bipartisan provision that is ready to go. They have  already done the hard work. They have reached a solution, but thus far  the Democratic leader has refused to include it in his substitute and  has not allowed the Senate to vote on it separately.   These are long-term issues we are considering. We need to get this  right. And during the time this legislation has been on the floor, we  have had entire days come and go without any votes at all on the bill.   In several instances, the Democratic leader chose to pivot away from  this legislation and devote floor time to nominations.   So there is no excuse for shutting off debate prematurely before the  Senate has been able to have its say.   So we will have to see how today unfolds, what additional amendments  the Democratic leader lets the Senate consider, how open a process he  permits.   Republicans don't want some big fight over this. We would like to see  an outcome--a bipartisan outcome. Even now, discussions are continuing  behind the scenes.   But the Democratic leader should not try to force a cloture vote  prematurely to stifle the Senate before Members are satisfied that our  work is finished.   There is nothing unusual about a minority party denying cloture to  secure more amendment votes. I have been here a while. This happens all  the time.   Six years ago, even after about two dozen amendment votes, Democrats  blocked cloture on a Keystone Pipeline bill until the Senate took a  dozen more amendment votes on top of that.   Just last year, even as the economy was tanking around us, the  Democratic leader blocked cloture multiple times on the CARES Act-- emergency legislation. Why? He wanted more changes.   But I hope it doesn't come to that today. I hope the Democratic  leader lets the Senate be the Senate so we can finish this important  legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, now one final matter. As my  colleagues know, I have been clear and unflinching in my own statements  about January 6. But as I have also repeated, there is no new fact  about that day we need the Democrats' extraneous Commission to uncover.   The Department of Justice is deep into a massive criminal  investigation. Four hundred and forty-plus people have already been  arrested. Hundreds--hundreds--have been charged. Even more arrests are  said to be planned. And the Attorney General indicates this  investigation will remain a top focus. Multiple Senate committees are  conducting their own bipartisan inquiries. And, obviously, the role of  the former President has already been litigated exhaustively-- exhaustively--in the high-profile impeachment trial we had right here  in the Senate several months ago.   I do not believe the additional extraneous Commission that Democratic  leaders want would uncover crucial new facts or promote healing.  Frankly, I do not believe it is even designed to do that.   That is why the Speaker's first draft began with a laughably rigged  and partisan starting point and why the current language would still  lock in significant unfairness under the hood.   So I will continue to support the real, serious work of our criminal  justice system and our own Senate committees, and I will continue to  urge my colleagues to oppose this extraneous layer when the time comes  for the Senate to vote.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
