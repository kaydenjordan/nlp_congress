 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck  Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. This urgently  needed legislation will help provide almost $700 billion in additional  grants and loans to small businesses and farmers reeling from the  coronavirus crisis. It invests $75 billion in providers, $25 billion in  testing, and requires the administration to develop a national plan for  testing, so once our businesses reopen, they can stay open.   Congress has more to do. Frontline workers need PPE. Families and  communities need relief. But this bill is a necessary interim fix to  keep needed-funds flowing to small businesses and our health system.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it.
