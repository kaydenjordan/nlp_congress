Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield  [[Page H1025]]  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we met in the Rules Committee and  reported a rule, House Resolution 912, providing for consideration of  two different measures; first, H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act  of 2022, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. It makes in order a manager's  amendment and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6617, the Further  Additional Extending Government Funding Act, under a closed rule. The  rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations  and provides for one motion to recommit.   Finally, the resolution adopts H. Con. Res. 69, which provides for a  joint session of Congress to receive a message from the President, and  the rule restricts former Members' access to the House floor during the  joint session.   Mr. Speaker, the Postal Service Reform Act is a major update and  improvement to what is going on with our post office. Even in this  increasingly digital world, Americans rely on the U.S. Postal Service  for access to lifesaving prescription drugs and other essential items  of living.   In the ongoing pandemic, the Postal Service has been critical in  helping tens of millions of Americans vote safely and securely.   The Postal Service is processing an astounding 5,000 pieces of mail  each second and is responsible for processing and delivering 46 percent  of the world's mail.   It is no surprise that first class mail used to send things like  letters and bills is on the decline in the digital environment we live  in. Still, the Postal Service remains a critical lifeline, especially  for people who live in rural areas and Tribal communities and for  people with disabilities.   The Postal Service adds a million new delivery points each year. That  means that the Postal Service is delivering a little bit less mail but  to a lot more places.   This act addresses the financial needs of the Postal Service,  ensuring that we can continue relying on it for generations to come.   The decline in first class mail, increasing expenses, and the  requirement that the Postal Service prefund retiree health benefits  have all contributed to some financial instability in the Postal  Service.   H.R. 3076 puts USPS on a far more stable financial footing.  Specifically, it requires future Postal Service retirees to enroll in  Medicare, saving the Postal Service $22 billion over the next decade.  While retirees have paid into Medicare their entire careers, a quarter  of retirees choose not to enroll, requiring the Postal Service to pay  for higher premiums.   Similarly, the legislation also eliminates the uniquely arduous  requirement that USPS prefund retiree health benefits for a period of  75 years. No other company or governmental entity has this requirement,  which has resulted in significant financial losses for USPS.   The Postal Service Reform Act also strengthens transparency and  requires 6-day integrated delivery, ensuring high-quality mail service  for at least 6 days a week to all Americans. It requires USPS to  develop an online dashboard detailing weekly national and local-level  performance data to promote compliance with on-time mail delivery.   Mr. Speaker, the consideration of this measure gives us the  opportunity to celebrate the remarkable successes of the post office in  our history. The Founders created the post office even before they  signed the Declaration of Independence, and they named, of course,  Benjamin Franklin as the first Postmaster General for the emerging  Nation.   It was the post office that unified 13 divergent and quarreling  Colonies into a nation as it created a great communications network  that brought the news of the day and the news of public events to the  doorstep of every fledgling American citizen. It was an idea that  scandalized and horrified the European powers that, of course, always  wanted to keep the people in the dark under the monarchies and  aristocracies of Europe.   The post office also created the transportation system for America,  which is why so many of our towns and cities have streets and roads  called Post Road or Postal Road or Old Post Road running through the  center of town.   The post office, of course, was an explicit delegation of power to  Congress in the Constitution, as well as the power to build postal  roads under Article I, Section 8.   The communications and transportation network created by the post  office gave rise to the democratic political infrastructure of the  Nation. This is how the committees of correspondence met that created  the political will for the American Revolution and developed the  political philosophy of our revolutionary forebearers.   The post office also gave rise to America's glorious free press. That  is why so many of our newspapers, again, bear the name The Washington  Post, the Buffalo-Courier Express, the Richmond Times-Dispatch. They  were named after the postal operation that made the mass media possible  in the country.   The post office has done wonders for American commerce and business,  and continues to do that right up to today, so this legislation will  help the post office grow and meet our needs in the new century.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his  kind words for the bipartisan leadership and initiative taken in the  Postal Service Reform Act, H.R. 3076.   Unfortunately, I have to take exception to the suggestion that this  is somehow unique on our part. The gentleman may remember the  bipartisan infrastructure act that the Democrats brought forward but we  incorporated lots of Republicans in the process and we passed it on a  bipartisan basis. That is more than $1 trillion invested in the roads,  the highways, the ports, the airports, broadband, and cybersecurity.   That was something I remember was talked about during the last  administration. I never saw a bill partisan, bipartisan, or otherwise  come from that side of the aisle, but within the first year of the  Biden administration that bipartisan infrastructure act was moved  through Congress. We brought lots of Republicans in. I know a lot of  them voted against it, some of whom are claiming credit for it back in  their districts now.   But, in any event, this is not new for us. It takes two to tango. So  I am glad that the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognizing what we  are doing here, but it is hardly unique in terms of the leadership  being offered.   Mr. Speaker, speaking of bipartisan leadership, I yield 3 minutes to  the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney),  who is the chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her very lucid  remarks.   One other historic breakthrough of the post office, I am recalling  now, is the fact that it was the first Federal public institution to  provide for the hiring of women, African Americans, and other minority  groups. So I am glad, again, that we have got bipartisan support for  this really critical measure to reform the post office in different  ways in order to make it viable in the new century.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a quick note on the gentleman from California's points.  He concedes that our bipartisan legislation does a lot of good things,  but he says that it doesn't do everything.   He makes the point that the post office is not making a profit. That  is true. It is not making a profit. Of course, our offices don't make a  profit. There are very few Federal entities that make a profit. That is  not what government does. Government serves the people. We want to be  as efficient as possible in doing that, but the post office serves  people from Alaska to Hawaii to Puerto Rico to Florida to Texas.   Everybody gets mail, and we want to do it as efficiently and as  effectively as possible, but the point is to make sure that we are all  connected and that everybody gets the benefit of being able to get  their prescription drugs, that small businesses are able to send out  their parcels, that consumers are able to receive what it is they are  ordering, and so on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), who is a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I do want to add one point to Ms. Scanlon's  excellent delivery.   This legislation, the Postal Service Reform Act, requires the Postal  Service to develop an online dashboard that will detail for all of us  weekly national-and local-level performance data to promote compliance  at every level with the on-time mail delivery expectations that we all  have.   I too have spent time in a lot of neighborhoods of mine in Frederick  County, Carroll County, and Montgomery County making sure that the  Postal Service is getting on time delivery and making it happen. This  new tool will allow all of us to monitor exactly what is going on in  our particular communities.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6617, of course, extends funding for  the Federal Government until March 11, 2022.  [[Page H1028]]  We eagerly anticipate the success of bipartisan negotiations for the  full omnibus package.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those excellent  remarks and note that I think she speaks for millions of postal workers  across the country who are excited about this legislation and the  reforms that it is going to institute. This has the endorsement of the  American Postal Workers Union, the National Association of Letter  Carriers, the mail handlers, and a number of other organizations that  are invested in this. So we are excited about this bipartisan  investment in making the Postal Service work for the people in this new  century.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Washington Post this morning has an article about how a number of  Governors--California Governor Gavin Newsom, New Jersey Governor Phil  Murphy, Delaware Governor John Carney, and Connecticut Governor Ned  Lamont--have all announced changes to indoor masking requirements  because of changes of where we are in the disease.   I certainly hope that my colleagues are not saying that we never  should have worn masks, although I know some of them have said that and  some of them have opposed masking guidance from the very beginning.  Need I remind my colleagues that we have lost more than 900,000 people,  including a lot of children, to this terrible disease. We have faced an  epidemic of denialism from the beginning. Of course, the former  President of the United States was out hawking quack medical cures and  denying the virulence of the disease for a long time saying it would  just disappear at Eastertime. Maybe everybody should just be injected  with bleach.   We have come a long way from then, and President Biden has led us in  an aggressive scientific effort, including masking where it was  appropriate, in order to beat the disease, and we are making great  progress. Now the States and localities are able to drop the masking  requirements. So I see that they want to get on top of the wave and  somehow claim that they are responsible for that when it was the  President from their party who presided over an historically reckless  and irresponsible approach to COVID-19, one that gave us a leading  position in the spread of COVID-19.   So in any event, I haven't seen the bill that they have just  introduced yet. I know that the Biden administration has used the post  office to ship 500 million coronavirus test kits to people across the  country, which, again, underscores the importance of the legislation we  are really here to talk about today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1029]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania doesn't have to take it from me. He  can take it from President Trump's own Coronavirus Response  Coordinator, Deborah Birx.   Dr. Birx said the first 100,000 deaths were perhaps inevitable, but  the hundreds of thousands that came after it were avoidable and were  the cost of the failure to undertake the public health precautions that  were required. So, I would direct him to Dr. Birx.   Of course, when the virus was out of control and President Biden came  into office, he was doing everything in his power to try to reverse the  damage done by the lethal irresponsibility of the prior administration.   But in any event, Madam Speaker, we are here to try to get beyond all  the wreckage at this point. We are here to fund the government through  March 11. We are here to make these substantial reforms to the post  office, on a bipartisan basis, that will make the post office far more  efficient; that will guarantee 6-day service to our people all over the  country; that will end that uniquely difficult and punitive policy of  making the Postal Service alone have to prefund everybody's healthcare  for the next 75 years, which explains a lot of its financial problems.  That is what we are here to do today.   We are making progress for America, and we are trying to do it on a  bipartisan basis. It seems strange to me that my colleagues would try  to pick a fight about COVID-19 in this context when we are just trying  to recover from the wreckage left by the prior administration.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Someone just tuning in right now might be a little confused and think  that we are somehow debating COVID-19. We are here to talk about  bipartisan legislation on the Postal Service and to keep the government  open until March 11.   I would just point out to my good friend from Pennsylvania, who I am  afraid seemed to disparage science on our side or the professional  credentials of Dr. Deborah Birx, who was the former President's  coronavirus coordinator; she went to Penn State medical school. I don't  think the gentleman from Pennsylvania meant to disparage her  educational credentials, certainly as a graduate of Penn State.   Look, we don't need the Federal Government dictating to the States  and the localities what their policies are going to be about masking. I  just read this morning about a bunch of States--I think they have  Democratic Governors; New York, California, Delaware--that have pulled  back on their masking policies because the virus, today, has  dramatically subsided.   Are we going to pass a Federal bill every time the virus goes up or  the virus goes down and tell them what their rules are going to be?  Come on. I thought that we were all champions of federalism. But  instead, they want to dictate it from up on high.   Remember, what this legislation is about--and I wish we could focus  more on it--is reform of the Postal Service.   We have bipartisan support now for this. I am delighted to learn that  it is not just the postal unions that I invoked before, but we have a  bunch of postal associations for it. We have the American Postal  Workers Union, the National Association of Letter Carriers, the  National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, the National Association  of Postal Supervisors, the National Active and Retired Federal  Employees, the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, the Package  Shippers Association, the Major Mailers Association, the National  Newspaper Association, Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service,  Publishers Clearing House, American Catalog Mailers Association, and  the National Retail Federation.   We have both the workers in the Postal Service and then big  businesses and small businesses across the country, underscoring the  fact that the Postal Service remains the central nervous system of  commerce in America as well as our public life. That is something that  we should be celebrating rather than picking an unnecessary fight,  which is completely irrelevant to this legislation, about what is going  on at the State and local level in other places.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to say a word on behalf of Stacey Abrams, who was the target  of some rhetorical attacks over there.   There is a picture of her without her mask on in front of a bunch of  kids who did have their masks on, and it was being denounced by the  speaker from North Carolina momentarily and also by the floor leader,  who didn't have their masks on, standing in front of a whole group of  people who did have their masks on.   In other words, they were in exactly the same position Stacey Abrams  was, because the rule of reason we have adopted according to medical  advice, I think across the country, is where masks are recommended and  indicated, people wear them unless they are speaking. To turn that into  a political football to denounce a fellow public servant seems to be a  little bit beneath the dignity of this body.   But in any event, we are very excited about our postal reform  legislation that we are moving through to guarantee excellent 6-day  service to everybody, to have an online dashboard so we can all keep  track of where the mail is in different parts of the country, and if  there are problems, we can address them quickly.   I am glad we have bipartisan legislation--at least I hope it is  bipartisan--to keep the government open until March 11.   As for COVID-19 policies, I think we should trust the States and the  localities to deal with the manifold questions that come up as we  continue to address this public health crisis, which was, of course,  set into motion by a President who denied it, avoided it, said he would  refuse to wear a mask even when it was indicated, who got it, who had  dozens of doctors at his beck and call, who flew in a helicopter to get  himself served.   Look, we need to get back on track in America. That means the  government has to work for everybody. We have got to stop fighting  about public health. We have got to work together for public health,  just like we have got to work together for the post office, a great  American institution which we improve and we advance today in the 21st  century.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 912         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6619) to prohibit the Secretary of Education from       providing Federal funds to a local educational agency unless       in-person instruction is available to all students and       parents may opt out of student mask mandates, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and Labor; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6619.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
