 Madam Speaker, the leak of Associate Justice Alito's draft  opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson was clearly illegal. That is why more than  20 Republican Members of the House joined me in calling on Attorney  General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Wray to open a criminal  investigation into a potential violation of U.S. law.   Title 18 United States Code Section 2071 states in part: A person who  willfully carries away any document filed or deposited with any clerk  or officer of any court shall be fined or imprisoned or both.   Anyone trying to criminally undermine the division of power in our  government should be held accountable to the full extent of the law,  especially as the leak is already proving to be dangerous as Justices  are facing harassment outside their homes.   Our country is built on the fundamental respect for law and order. It  is clear to me and my Republican colleagues that the law was clearly  violated.
