 Mr. Speaker, tonight is our third time that we have  hosted People's Night. This is a time for our Members to bypass outside  forces and influences and talk directly to the American people.   Tonight we are presenting something that has been very important, not  just a topic, but something that nearly 6 years ago--or a little over 6  years ago--right here where we stand tonight was passed in an overly  bipartisan manner and has burdened the American people in what is now  known as ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act.   This is a piece of legislation that has burdened small businesses and  individuals alike. Now we have been asked to fix it, to repeal and to  replace. Well, it takes Members to be able to have experience in this  particular field to understand the heart of community. One of the  people who does that most, specifically in the area of poverty  initiatives, who reaches across community lines, reaches across party  lines is the gentleman from Kentucky, my good friend, Representative  Andy Barr from Kentucky. I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    I thank Representative Barr. Your compassion on this  topic is certainly evident. We appreciate your comments this evening.   Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of numbers I would like to share that  puts it a little bit in the context of what we are dealing with here.  Seventy-five percent of co-ops have failed. In five States, Americans  are down to just one option. The great thing about our country's  history is that we have choices. We have decisions. Yet, since the  takeover of this administration over health care, those choices have  continued to reduce. Sometimes you may hear Congress this or Congress  that. One of the neat things about Congress is the amount of people  coming from diverse backgrounds.   Our next speaker tonight is Representative Mike Bishop, former senate  majority leader in his home State of Michigan, who was already working  on those reforms when he came to the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).    I thank Representative Bishop of Michigan.   One of the numbers my friend just mentioned was 8 out of 10. Nearly  80 percent, according to Gallup, believe this law should be overhauled  or completely repealed. So I ask people watching tonight and my friends  across the aisle: Are we to do nothing? In fact, even in the press  conference today, President-elect Trump said that, if we did nothing,  it would continue to fail. But we have an obligation to stand up and do  what is right.   We can't do nothing. People are suffering--in fact, suffering to the  place that even recently a couple months ago a Minnesota Governor was  honest enough to talk about how it has damaged small business. Goodness  gracious, even a former Democratic President has acknowledged the  destruction it has caused for individuals and small businesses.   No one knows more about what it does to our States than individual  Representatives. One of the fine gentlemen that is speaking tonight is  Representative French Hill. He is one of the sharper minds that we have  had as part of the 114th class that I have been privileged to meet and  serve with for the last 2 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    If you listened closely there, Representative Hill talked  about some of the premiums increasing. If you think back 6, 7, even 8  years ago, even part of the original campaign talking about the  Affordable Care Act, this ObamaCare, we think about three promises--we  have all heard them--you can keep your doctor, you can keep your  healthcare plan, and premiums are going down. Specifically one that  stands out more was the premiums going down $2,500.   My Democratic friends want to ignore some of those numbers, but here  are the facts: In 2014, premiums increased across the board 37 percent;  2015, again, last year, 25 percent. In fact, in some States, it is out  of sight. In my home State of North Carolina, it is 40 percent. But in  some places, in Arizona, it is as high as 116 percent.   So the process of working to put this together, the RSC plan and the  repeal and replace, who better than to have people that have experience  in this? There is maybe nobody better in the House who has the  insurance background than our friend, Representative Austin Scott from  Georgia's Eighth District.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin  Scott).   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, there is something I very  much want to speak on. I rise today on behalf of my many constituents  back in Georgia's Eighth Congressional District who have been  negatively impacted by ObamaCare.   It is pretty clear to the vast majority of us that the attempt to fix  our Nation's healthcare problems by inserting more Federal control into  the system has simply failed. There are some counties in the district  that I represent in middle and south Georgia that are down to just  one--maybe two--insurance providers that people can choose from. That  is not competition, and that is not affordable. It is not even a choice  really, and it is certainly not ``if you like your plan you can keep  it.''   My colleagues and I on the Republican Study Committee have worked for  a couple of years, and we have offered a plan to repeal ObamaCare and  replace it with patient-centered reforms and free-market solutions for  American citizens.   The American Healthcare Reform Act is not just about repealing  ObamaCare. It is about fixing problems that existed in the healthcare  system before ObamaCare and problems that, quite honestly, were made  worse by ObamaCare. There is a lot of talk about what is in the bill  that is a problem. I would like to talk just a second today about what  is not in the bill that is a problem.   Mr. Speaker, the President, by leaving the health insurance industry  exempt from the antitrust laws of the country, created a bigger problem  than we had prior to the healthcare bill going in place. That's right.  I want you to hear what I said. Under ObamaCare, health insurance  providers are exempt from the antitrust laws. These are the very laws  that are designed to promote competition for the benefit of the  consumer.   How is it that ObamaCare can mandate that Americans purchase a  product from an industry that that very bill left exempt from playing  by the rules? Why did the President and the Democratic leaders leave  the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws in the  bill? I have asked these questions over and over. It is baffling to me.  It means the big boys can play and the little man has to pay.   I wish somebody from the press would ask that question. I don't  understand why the press doesn't ask the Democratic Party: Why did you  leave the health insurance industry exempt from the antitrust laws of  the country? It is a question the President should answer.   The American Healthcare Reform Act reverses that. Our legislation  injects much-needed competition into the health insurance marketplace  by eliminating the antitrust exemptions for the insurance providers. By  applying the antitrust laws to the insurance industry, we are making  the market more competitive which, in turn, will drive down premium  cost, increase choice, and does so without adding any new taxes.   I hope the American Healthcare Reform Act will serve as the baseline  for discussions on how to repeal and replace ObamaCare, bring about  debate on how to lower healthcare costs, and allow for input from both  sides of the aisle, which is something ObamaCare did not do. Along the  way, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Speaker, I sure do wish the press would ask  the President and the Democratic leadership: How could you do that to  the American citizens?    Representative Scott, well articulated. I appreciate your  heart on this.   Looking at this and tackling this project because of the 2,600 pages  of complexities, I guess we don't need to reiterate it, but how the  minority leader said that we needed to pass this law to be able to  figure out what is in it.                                time 1930    Obviously, it is more than just a running joke. With the people in  the background, what does it take to kind of wrap our minds around it  and to wrap our arms around it so as to find our way back? It takes  people with medical experience, and it takes people with budget  experience. This is going to be huge.   One of the Members we have here with us tonight is the vice chair of  the Committee on the Budget, someone who has great concern about the  damage that this has caused to the fine folks of Indiana, whom he  represents. It is my privilege to yield to the Representative from  Indiana, Todd Rokita.    I thank Representative Rokita.   Mr. Speaker, as I was sitting here, I just received a text from a  volunteer fire department official right outside of Charlotte, North  Carolina. He writes that they were watching the proceedings this  evening:         I just want to let you know that even my drug prescription       has gone up $200 out of pocket per person.    He has three daughters in his family.   Think about this. This is real-life stuff. That is why we are  stepping in. Part of our plan in the repeal and replacement--the  American Health Care Reform Act--allows you to have immediate access to  your health savings account. You would not have to worry about  somebody's needing a prescription or somebody's needing medicine--one  of the children--and, every time, it is $200 out of pocket. That is why  it is important to move--and to move with diligence.   Someone who knows a little bit about the healthcare industry is my  friend Dr. Brian Babin of Texas, who has been dealing with this in his  own dentist's practice. He is a former veteran and is someone who cares  about his district but who cares about all Americans. It is my  privilege to yield to my friend from the great State of Texas, the Lone  Star State, Dr. Brian Babin.     I thank Dr. Babin. I appreciate that spirited, heartfelt  talk. In my previous vocation, we would usually call for an invitation  at about this time.   Mr. Speaker, this is not just a problem in red States; this is a  problem in blue States, like it is with my good friend from the First  District of California, Representative Doug LaMalfa, to whom I yield as  he shares a little bit of his heart when it comes to ObamaCare and the  repeal.   Mr. LaMALFA. I really want to thank Chairman Walker of the RSC, the  Republican Study Committee. I greatly appreciate the gentleman's  leadership on this event here tonight as well as the great job the  gentleman is doing on the Committee.   Mr. Speaker, we have had alternatives to the Affordable Care Act ever  since I have been here. The American Health Care Reform Act, as put  forward by the Republican Study Committee, has many of the elements we  have all been talking about for several years: with the Affordable Care  Act being forced upon Americans not in a bipartisan effort but strictly  by the votes of one party when they had the majority--the ability--to  force it  [[Page H379]]  through. We are suffering the effects of that now.   One of my colleagues earlier was talking about: Why isn't this being  reported? Why isn't this being talked about in the broad sense of how  it is really affecting the Americans who are paying for it?   People in my district, ever since I have been a Member of this House,  have been pleading with us to do something about these high premiums,  about the high deductibles, about the lack of access they have,  especially in rural areas. Why are the proponents continuing to prop  this up? It is clear that it doesn't work: higher costs, fewer options,  unworkable plans. The exchanges--we have watched in several States-- most of them, after billions in investment, are shuttering; they are  closing up shop. Where do those billions go that we have invested as a  country into these exchanges?                                time  1945    But on a patient level, it is putting even more of our most  vulnerable patients on a system already known to be unsustainable  without even ensuring access to quality care. In some cases, no care at  all.   How are people defining that as a success?   We know that the main reason why so many people are uninsured is the  high cost of coverage. But instead of investing vast amounts of money  to bring more people into a broken system, let's take this opportunity  to start fixing the root of the problem.   One, this is done by increasing competition, giving patients more  options, choices. Mr. Speaker, give them a menu of options they can  pick themselves, tailor the plan to what they need. A 20-year-old young  man has a completely different need than a 30-year-old mom and her  family. Let them have the choices.   Also, let's get rid of the costly mandates, the taxes. There are  taxes on everything, it seems, to help prop up ObamaCare, the  Affordable Care Act, including the cost for students for college. They  are paying for some of that.   Then let's build off successes that we have seen in the past and that  are part of the proposal of the Republican Study Committee and the  American Healthcare Reform Act. That could help fill our gaps in the  healthcare delivery system.   Community health centers, for example, is a model that is both cost  effective and efficient in expanding access to care services in  underserved areas, very rural ones, such as my own district at home.   Healthcare reform affects the lives of every single person in this  country, which is why it is high time that we put the health and well- being of the American people ahead of partisan politics and legacies.   Let's get to work and deliver actual solutions that empower patients,  drive down the costs, and increase access to care in every part of the  country. Let's give back to Americans: ``Keep your plan that you like,  keep your doctor that you like.''   So it is time to stop the partisan squabbling over it and the  deception that has gone on for what is indeed for some a bad legacy of  the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), our resident veterinarian in the House.    Mr. Speaker, we talk about numbers. Twenty-five percent  of all Americans have been damaged at some point under this Affordable  Care Act. We cannot look the other way.   One gentleman who doesn't look the other way but stands up and speaks  the truth is Representative Pete Olson.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, who better to close out our Special Order  than a gentleman, a doctor who has employed hundreds of people and has  worked with thousands of patients?   You may have heard the false narrative that, yes, we have contributed  in breaking the program, from the Democrat's perspective, and you guys  need to fix it, but you don't have a plan.   Well, that is a false narrative and here to tell you why is Dr. Phil  Roe.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Speaker, the bottom line to the American people is  this: it is time to return healthcare choices to the American people.   God bless and good night.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
