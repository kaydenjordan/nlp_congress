 Mr. Speaker, this is the close of Virgin Islands  History Month. Throughout the Virgin Islands this past month of March,  young children have learned about extraordinary Virgin Islanders.   They have learned about Alexander Hamilton, who comes from the island  of St. Croix, and learned about this being the only place in the United  States on which Christopher Columbus actually set foot.   They learn about the inventions and work of Virgin Islanders in our  history, but they also learn about the oppression, about the brutality  under Danish rule.   They learn about Alexander Hamilton, his fieriness coming from the  fact that he was deemed an illegitimate child and his parentage was  constantly questioned.   Last week, House Republicans passed H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of  Rights Act. Under that act, much of that history would be forbidden.  Much of that history would be erased.   That is the American story--of resilience, of oppression, of the  constant  [[Page H1474]]  fight for freedom, of the change that we all are coming together as  Americans.   Let's not erase all of our history.                            ____________________
