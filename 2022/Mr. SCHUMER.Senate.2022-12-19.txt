 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me start by wishing Jewish  Americans everywhere a happy start to Hanukkah.   I celebrated the first night with my family up in New York, and I  hope my colleagues who observe Hanukkah were able to do the same.   The story of Hanukkah is, among many things, a story of perseverance  in the face of unspeakable hatred. It is also a lesson that hits home  this year for many Jewish Americans targeted recently by anti-Semitism.   After decades of hard work, it is terrifying to see today that anti- Semitism is on the rise in America. We must do everything we can to  stomp it down.   No matter what our faiths may be, of course, I urge all Americans of  goodwill to take a stand against the forces of bigotry and intolerance.   There are many out there who are trying to use their platforms to  make anti-Semitism more acceptable in our country, and we must oppose  them at every turn.   I have faith that the forces of intolerance will lose in the end,  just as they did in the days of Hanukkah when Judah Maccabee led the  Jewish people against an oppressive majority.   But the fight is long, and all of us must do our part. So as we  continue observing the Festival of Lights, I say to colleagues and to  Jewish Americans across the country: Chag Sameach, happy holiday.   And thank God that, in this country, freedom of religion and  tolerance is part of our watch word, unlike it was in the old days of  Judah Maccabee.
