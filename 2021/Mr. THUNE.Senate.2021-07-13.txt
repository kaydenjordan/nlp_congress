 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last month, Speaker Pelosi was asked if she  thought a 15-week-old unborn baby was a human being. She declined to  answer. A few days later, the President's Press Secretary was asked if  the President thinks a 15-week-old unborn baby is a human being. She  also declined to answer.   In case the President and the Speaker are in any doubt, let me just  clear things up for them. A 15-week-old unborn baby is a human being.  That baby has a human mom and a human dad, and human beings have other  human beings. That is not a complex moral or philosophical question.  That is biology 101.   Of course, I am pretty sure the reason the Speaker and the  President's Press Secretary declined to answer these questions is not  because they are confused about the answer. I don't think there is  anybody out there who isn't aware on some level that unborn human  beings are human beings. The moment of birth does not magically confer  humanity.   No, the Speaker and the President don't want to admit that unborn  children are human beings because admitting it would make it hard to  defend the fact that they support the right to kill these babies. If  you support abortion, it is much easier to pretend an unborn baby is  just a clump of cells rather than a separate human being with his or  her own fingerprints and DNA. It is a lot easier to defend killing that  baby if you pretend that baby is just a part of the mother instead of a  unique, separate, unrepeatable individual.   That is why the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the  Press Secretary for the President of the United States have declined to  answer a question any 10-year-old could answer: whether the baby inside  his or her mom is a human being.   At the end of May, President Biden released his budget. It was a slap  in the face to pro-life Americans. The President's budget abandons  decades of bipartisan compromise and calls for the elimination of the  Hyde amendment, which protects taxpayers from having their tax dollars  go to fund abortions.   And that is not all. The budget contains a whole host of pro-abortion  measures that would, among other things, direct taxpayer dollars to  fund abortion providers here at home and overseas.   This isn't just some theatrical proposal. Democrats in the House of  Representatives have already acted in committee to exclude the Hyde  amendment and other pro-life measures from appropriations bills. If we  can't agree that unborn human beings deserve to have their human rights  protected, we should at least be able to agree that taxpayers should  not be forced to fund the killing of unborn persons.   The American people don't think taxpayers should fund abortions. In  fact, nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of  abortions. The President himself has, as recently as his Presidential  campaign, supported the Hyde amendment, but there is one interest group  that controls the Democratic Party. It is the abortion industry and its  supporters, and I guess the President figured that he needed to  sacrifice his support for the Hyde amendment if he wanted to win the  election.   And now Democrats and the President are following through by  attempting to force taxpayers to pay for abortions. To hear Democrats  talk, you would think abortion on demand, without limits, up until the  moment of birth, was the standard position of this country and the  world. But it is actually not. The United States is one of only a tiny  handful of countries in the world--in the entire world--that allow  elective abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy.   Americans are squarely to the right of the Democratic Party on  abortion. A strong majority of Americans believe abortion should be  illegal or there should at least be some restrictions on abortion, and  that has been the position of the American people for a long time   Despite the Democrats' best efforts, Americans still aren't convinced  unlimited abortion on demand should be the law of the land. It is  really not surprising. No one who has ever heard the thump, thump,  thump of an unborn baby's heartbeat really thinks that we are just  talking about a clump of cells. No one who has ever looked at an  ultrasound screen and seen an unborn baby waving her hands or kicking  her feet is in any doubt that that baby is a human being.   And at some level, every person knows that human beings have human  rights and that human beings deserve to be protected, even when they  are small and weak and vulnerable--especially when they are small and  weak and vulnerable.   No matter how hard the abortion lobby pushes, they can't convince the  majority of Americans that abortion is an unqualified good.  Unfortunately, however, they succeeded in turning the Democratic Party  into their legislative arm. And President Biden and Democrats in  Congress are obediently pursuing a radical abortion agenda that puts  them squarely to the left of the majority of the American people.   It is not limited to taxpayer funding of abortion or abortion  providers. President Biden nominated a radical pro-abortion crusader as  the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In May, Secretary Becerra  appeared before a House subcommittee where he chose to answer a  question on Federal abortion law by indulging in a game of semantics.  Not only did he fail to commit to enforcing the Partial-Birth Abortion  Ban Act, he refused to even acknowledge its existence, even though he  voted against the law repeatedly during his time in the House of  Representatives.   Then there is the so-called Equality Act--Democrats' unprecedented  assault on free speech and religious liberty that would also erode  conscience protections on abortions as well as restrictions on Federal  funding. Under the Equality Act, doctors and nurses who have a moral  objection to participating in abortions could be forced to participate  or lose their jobs.   I haven't even mentioned the Women's Health Protection Act, sponsored  by almost every Democrat in the Senate, which would threaten even the  mildest State limits on abortion.   It is deeply disheartening that making sure unborn children are  deprived of their human rights has become a defining cause for one of  the two major parties in this country. We can do better than this. We  have to do better than this.   Congressman Henry Hyde, for whom the Hyde amendment was named, once  noted that abortion--which, as he said, denies ``an entire class of  human beings the welcome and protection of our laws''--is a betrayal of  ``the best in our tradition.''   And he was right. What kind of a message does it send to our children  [[Page S4841]]  when we tell them that an entire class of human beings is not worthy of  protection, when we deny human rights to the most innocent and  vulnerable humans among us? We have to do better.   To my Democratic colleagues, I would say, if we cannot act today to  secure justice and human rights for unborn human beings, let's at least  stand for the great American tradition of freedom of conscience and  protect the rights of doctors and nurses who decline to participate in  abortions. Let's at least spare Americans who oppose the taking of  innocent human life from having their tax dollars go to fund abortions.  At the very, very least, we should be able to agree upon that.   As I said, I am saddened and disheartened that a major political  party in this country made depriving unborn human rights as their  defining cause, but their right to life will not be ignored.   While Democratic leaders may deny the humanity of the unborn, there  are a lot of Americans out there--a lot of Americans--who recognize it.  I have faith that sooner or later this country will live up to its  founding promise and the best of its tradition and extend the  protection of its laws to every human being, born and unborn.
