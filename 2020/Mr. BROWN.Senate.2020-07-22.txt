 Mr. President, I thank Senators Murphy and Stabenow and  Senator Baldwin's terrific leadership on this. I echo Senator Murphy's  earlier comments about China.   I see on the other side of the aisle Senators and President Trump. It  is campaign season. So it is time to bash China, even though they have  been in the pockets of China.   I was in the other body when corporate interests came and lobbied the  House of Representatives and lobbied the Senate asking for China to get  all of these trade breaks and tax breaks so that American companies  could shut down production in Milwaukee or in Cleveland and move  overseas to China and get all kinds of tax breaks. And then my  Republican colleagues were also pro-China because they wanted these  American corporations and their contributors, starting with Senator  McConnell down the hall, to get all of these advantages for China.   Now, if you are thinking about running for President of the United  States in 2024 as a Republican, you bash China. If you are in a tough  reelection right now for the Senate, you bash China. If you are a House  Member and afraid of being defeated, you bash China. If you want to  help the cause for Donald Trump, you bash China. It doesn't matter that  President Trump has been the best friend of China. It doesn't matter  the Republican leadership has been in the pocket of Chinese Communist  interests because of their support for American corporations. It is  just good politics to bash China. So we know that, and Senator Murphy  touched on that.                                   S. 4049    Mr. President, I want to say a few words first about Agent Orange and  thank Senator Tester for his work on behalf of the tens of thousands of  Vietnam vets who suffered because of exposure to Agent Orange.   We all know what the issue is. The National Academy of Sciences has  recognized the four illnesses that are suggestive or where there is  sufficient evidence associated with Agent Orange. For years, we have  known that. The VA has added illnesses in categories to the list of  presumptive medical conditions associated with Agent Orange. They have  resisted this.   Time is running out for these veterans. We did this to them. The  American Government decided to spray Agent Orange. We knew it was  harmful. We definitely know it is harmful now. If you were exposed to  poison while serving our country, you deserve the benefits you earned,  period.   For 3 years, in the Veterans' Affairs Committee--I sat in the  Veterans' Affairs Committee--I begged the Veterans' Administration to  recognize that these three illnesses are caused by Agent Orange and  they should get Veterans' Administration benefits. I begged the  Veterans' Administration, and no answers. I begged the President of the  United States, and President Trump said he is a friend of veterans, but  he couldn't be bothered to add these three illnesses on the list. So  these veterans, individually, have to get down on their knees-- figuratively, if not literally--and beg the VA for benefits when it  ought to be automatic. That is what Senator Tester's amendment does  today. It makes it automatic.   Instead, the White House said no and the Veterans' Administration  said no, but because of the work of Senator Tester today, my colleagues  are finally--it doesn't happen often around here. My Republican  colleagues actually stood up to the President of the United States and  said: No, Mr. President, you are wrong on the VA about covering these  illnesses for Vietnam vets. And, finally, this Congress did the right  thing. I thank Senator Tester for that work.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3627    Mr. President, we know a lot of things. We know 144,000 Americans are  dead. We have grown numb to these numbers. We can't forget who they  are. They are our friends, our sisters, our brothers, our parents, and  our neighbors.   As has been said, we are 4 to 5 percent of the world's population. We  have accounted for almost 30 percent of the deaths in the entire world.  That is not because we don't have skilled doctors. It is not because we  don't have smart scientists. It is not because we don't work hard. It  is because of leadership.   We know this President and the majority leader down the hall, who  does the bidding every single day of this President, had chance after  chance to get ahead of this virus. President Trump failed and Senator  McConnell failed. Now they have stopped even pretending to try   The President demands that schools reopen--no plan to protect  teachers and students. He demands businesses open up--no plan to  protect workers and consumers. The American people have done their part  and made incredible sacrifices. Essentially, they bought President  Trump time in March, April, May, and June, and he wasted it.   This spring, people stayed home. They worked hard to flatten the  curve. Members of both parties--both parties--begged him to use the  Defense Production Act to scale up the production of medical supplies,  including testing supplies, and coordinate their deployment. All the  way back in March, we knew we faced shortfalls in N95 masks, gowns, and  the materials we needed, most importantly, for test production, like  cotton swabs. I immediately convened Ohio manufacturers back in March.  I know Senator Baldwin did the same thing in her State. I asked them  what support they needed. I released a plan and sent a letter to the  White House outlining Executive actions the President could take  immediately. This was March. Since then--April, May, June, July--and  essentially nothing happened. The Federal Government can acquire the  resources our country needs and send them when they are needed most.   Senator Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, and I worked together to  include provisions in the CARES Act ensuring the President has the  ability to use DPA authority he already has without delay. We worked  with our colleagues in the Appropriations Committee to include $1  billion in new DPA funding. Yet hundreds of millions of dollars just  sit around waiting to be used.   Our States and our healthcare workers continue to face supply  shortages. What exactly is the President waiting for? Imagine if he had  used that DPA money and DPA authority in the spring and said we need to  be producing a million tests a week by the end of summer, or imagine if  we said our goal  [[Page S4384]]  is to be ready to open schools in the fall and I am calling on American  businesses and American workers to manufacture the tests we need to do  it? Look around the world. Other countries figured this out. We are  being left behind. It is time for us to step up. If the President will  not lead, we must. If the President will not use DPA on its own,  Congress must use its authority to force him to.   That is why it is so disappointing to see my Republican colleagues  objecting to Senator Baldwin's bill. But, of course, they are objecting  because they are doing the bidding of President Trump, and they want to  blame China for everything, instead of take any responsibility  themselves. But objecting to Senator Baldwin's bill, which would force  the President to actually do his job and coordinate a national response  to a national crisis--that is the answer.   The American people should not have to fend for themselves again and  again and again in the middle of a pandemic.   I yield the floor.
