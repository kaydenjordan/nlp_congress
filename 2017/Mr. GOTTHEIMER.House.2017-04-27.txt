 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and  spiritual mentor, Rabbi Elyse Frishman, for her 22 years of exceptional  service to Barnert Temple in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.   After decades of service to the Jewish community, Rabbi Frishman will  be retiring this June. Personally, I am very lucky to call Rabbi  Frishman my rabbi.   In addition to leading our congregation, she is the editor of the  reform prayer book ``Mishkan Tefilah,'' and a national leader in  worship and congregational engagement.   Rabbi Frishman has stood as a model citizen and faith leader, going  the extra mile to bring together the community in times of anxiety and  fear.   She was recently featured by The Bergen Record for her work to unite  the interfaith communities in a common mission, forming dialogues,  understanding, and building friendships where they didn't exist before.   In doing so, she has long set an example for the families of our  congregation. As a parent, I am glad my children are growing up knowing  and being led and educated by her in our faith community.   Rabbi Frishman deserves to be held up as a model for public service.  And though our congregation and I will miss her deeply, I congratulate  her on her retirement, and I hope everyone enjoys the evening  celebrating her years of service to us. America and our community has  been very lucky to have Rabbi Elyse Frishman.   Thank you, Rabbi Frishman.                            ____________________
