 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for  yielding. I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this en  bloc, which includes a symbolic amendment in support of the Office of  Technology Assessment, otherwise known as OTA.   The reestablishment of OTA has been a top priority of mine since I  first came to Congress in 2013. Since then, debates around emerging  technologies and concepts have caught this Congress by surprise as we  struggle to legislate on  [[Page H4166]]  complex issues of technological and societal importance.   Before OTA was defunded in 1995, the office served a critical role in  providing Members of Congress and staff with nonpartisan and expert  advice on complex scientific and technical issues. OTA served as a  model of good governance and innovation in government, and believe me,  we could use OTA now in this environment of dissembling and shading of  the truth around vaccines.   Today, OTA would be invaluable as we debate issues related to  cryptocurrencies; nonfungible tokens, or NTFs; cybersecurity;  artificial intelligence; and other developing technologies throughout  our society.   We understand the importance and value of CRS and GAO when it comes  to researching and understanding complex issues. That is not up for  debate. Yet, OTA is necessary to ensure Congress is informed and  knowledgeable on some of the most complex issues facing our society  today.   Staff who will work alongside CRS and GAO to provide this expertise  will help this legislature not only catch up with the rest of our  economy but truly understand how these new forms of technology affect  our economy in everyday life.   The foundation of good policy is accurate and objective analysis, and  the reestablishment of the Office Technology Assessment is how we will  pass new and forward-thinking laws for our country.
