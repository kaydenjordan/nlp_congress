 Madam Speaker, the Bureau of Land Management has revised  down the number of unused oil drilling applications from 9,000 to  approximately 6,700. The Biden administration has been deceiving the  American people to pass the buck for his failed energy policy.   The President's Green New Deal agenda has led to some of the highest  energy prices for American families ever. Today, the national price of  gasoline is $3.35 cents per gallon on average, or even a buck higher  than that in my home State of California. On the day the President was  sworn in, the price of gas was just $2.39 per gallon, nearly a dollar  less.   American households are paying the highest home heating costs in 15  years. On day one of his Presidency, President Biden killed the  Keystone XL pipeline project. This move cost the United States up to  59,000 jobs and $9.6 billion.   The President is currently sitting on over 4,800 pending applications  for permits to drill for more energy. This administration is not  serious about getting America out of these high costs of energy and  this crisis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time to stand before the  House here this afternoon and talk about some issues that are not only  important to my district in northern California to a couple of our key  industries but really, they are important to all Americans because this  is a life-sustaining topic we are talking about, and that is food,  energy, and shelter.   We had that in abundance in California when we were allowed to  produce the things that cause those to happen.   In my northern California district we have much agriculture. We have  also an amazing natural water supply and the opportunities that come  with that by harnessing that water supply for food for people, for  agriculture, for hydroelectric power to make electricity and keep the  lights on in places like this and all over America, and to mine the  minerals that we need to produce all manner of things. These come from  the natural resources we have in northern California, Minnesota, and  all over this country.   So we have been successful in developing them and making them real  since the founding of this country.   We have fallen on hard times more recently, though, with regulations  that although may be well-founded and well-minded 50 years ago have  been turned on their ear and work against good management of our  forestlands, the extraction of minerals we need to sustain some of the  ideals we have going forward for the future, for water supply, for  agriculture, and for this country that has always known plenty.   These days we are actually seeing at some points empty shelves in our  grocery stores in the United States.   It reminds me of a story about the time when former Russian President  Boris Yeltsin was visiting this country with President Bush 41. They  had gone to Houston, I believe, to the Space Center. They had left and  were driving down the road. He saw a supermarket. He hadn't been in an  American supermarket before. So he wanted to just pop in randomly with  the President, the then-President of Russia, to see what it looked  like.   President Yeltsin was amazed by the products that we have on the  shelves in American stores. Not only that, but  [[Page H997]]  that people were freely and casually purchasing them, not in a frenzy  like oh, this is the day the food comes in and everybody has to rush in  and stand in line and rush out before it is all gone. No. People were  easily coming and going and taking what they needed. They were  purchasing it at the register and walking out.   There was all variety of the same kind. All of it was fresh and of  high quality.   That is what the United States has been able to bring itself to over  all these years, and now that seems to be in peril.   A key part of that in my home State of California is that water  supply. So I will touch about upon that here in a little bit.   We have in the northern California district that I represent and also  on the Oregon side, which my colleague, Mr. Bentz, represents, above  this line here in Oregon is the Klamath Basin, the Klamath River.   Now, that is a natural lake that was formed at the beginning of the  creation of this planet, but also it had been enhanced about 110 years  ago through a Federal project. It yielded an additional 7 feet of  elevation and approximately 400,000 new acre-feet of water supply that  was intended when that Federal project was built to be agricultural  water.   So back in 1906 when they created it, it made possible 1,400 farms  and 200,000 acres of prime ag land. Under Federal law under the  Reclamation Act and State law, all the stored water--the newly created  water is called stored water--in the Upper Klamath Lake which was above  the natural level of the existing lake was the stored water.   Again, there are 400,000 acre-feet of new water, but despite the  clear law of the Federal Government, they have been taking advantage of  the farmers year after year by mismanaging the lake and shifting that  clear water right as adjudicated by Oregon courts to environmental  purpose, to other purpose.   The water would not exist had not that project been built and paid  for over the years by the farmers in that basin.   So what do we have, Madam Speaker?   In 2022, the Federal Government even cut off water that could have  gone to finish the crop year. They eliminated 50,000 acre-feet of legal  and available water to farmers. The really maddening thing is that at  the end of the season, there was a surplus of water in the lake above  what was needed to sustain what is known as a biological opinion to  sustain the fish needs in the lake as well as what had been sent down  the river for salmon needs.   There was extra water. We saw it ahead of time, yet they would not  yield that additional water so we could finish the crop year on some of  the needed crops that are planted up there. They plant all sorts of  things up in that basin.   One of them would be the potatoes that they grow up there. They  needed just a couple more weeks of water supply that was available, and  instead they were allowed to die off. A normal, healthy potato ended up  being the size of my pinky and obviously unharvestable and unusable all  because they wouldn't listen to the projections that there would have  been extra water. No. They wanted to start their new water year of 2023  in 2022 on the backs of a water supply that doesn't belong to the  Federal Government. It is clearly for the farmers in the basin created  after World War I and World War II for returning veterans to be able to  set up shop and do that.    The Federal Government made this choice. They did this during a time  when prices of food were skyrocketing around the country. Consumers are  seeing these prices going up and shelves becoming more bare more often  than we should ever see in this country.   So what else do we see?   They are depriving the farms of water. Here is another view of the  basin here. It is a little more close-up of the various sumps and  wildlife areas and the farmed land there. It is kind of hard to see  from this distance, but indeed it is comprehensive, and it is rather  complicated. But smart people have made that work over the years.   Indeed, when the farms thrive, also the refuges thrive. So negative  effects have been such that when the farms don't get the water, the  wildlife refuges in the area also lose access to the water that comes  through that ag system and gets to them.   In 2020, over 60,000 ducks died in the basin in that Klamath refuge  due to avian botulism. I paid a visit up there to folks who were  working voluntarily and through fish and wildlife to help try and  bridge the gap from the water supply that wasn't there and recovering  ducks. It is pretty terrible.   Here we are fishing out dead ducks from the refuge.   Down here on the bottom is one that we rescued that was really sick  but that we took back to a center there where they were helping the  ducks that were recoverable to recover and turn them back loose.   The picture up here shows just how ugly it is.   A thriving basin is a key part of the flyway all through the Western  States, including from northern California on south. The flyway is so  key toward having the type of diversity of wildlife that is enjoyed all  through the Sacramento Valley, the San Joaquin Valley, and other areas  of northern and southern California and Oregon for sportsmen and for  everybody.   It doesn't happen when this is the policy of the Federal Government  to basically take the water away from farms and the refuges.   As I mentioned, as affirmed by the courts in Oregon where the lake  lies, also a portion of the basis is on my side which Mr. Bentz and I  both represent, the stored water is, indeed, owned by the farmers  solely for the use of the Klamath project.                                time  1245    They have paid for it. They continue to pay for its ongoing upkeep  and improvement even when they don't get the water delivered to them.  Isn't that something?   It is one thing to get a bill for the maintenance and upkeep if you  are getting to use the supply, getting to use the asset. They don't  even get to use the asset half the time now, but they still get the  bill for it. It would not exist other than for that 7-foot enhancement  that created the 400,000 acre-feet.   In 2022, they were initially going to get zero water. They did find a  way to increase it to 50,000 acre-feet after some late storms, which is  12\1/2\ percent of the allocation of their water right. There was extra  water, as I mentioned, in the lake to be used in the basin at the end  of the year above an amount that the environmental biological opinion  said had to be remaining in the lake. They chose not to give it up.   In 2021, they were given 6 percent, or 33,000 acre-feet.   In 2020, after some battling, they tried to pull the pin on them  early in the spring after the farmers had planted. They did end up  getting 140,000 acre-feet, which is about a third of their allocation.   In 2019, which was an amazing water year in northern California and  other areas, they still received 92 percent of their allocation. Pretty  good by these standards, but it still wasn't 100 percent.   Downstream of that, on the complex Klamath River situation, are also  four hydroelectric dams that California, Oregon, environmental groups,  and others have all been conspiring for a long time to have removed.  Think about that for a minute.   There is a big push in the whole country, especially in my home State  of California, to convert everything to electricity for its energy  source--automobiles. You are hearing the big controversy over stoves  right now, kitchen stoves.   In my home State and some cities, they are really pushing getting rid  of those. Now, most of the people I know who have gas stoves in their  houses really like them. It is really handy to regulate the  temperature, the rate with which the heat comes up on what you are  cooking. You can see the flame. There is a photograph of First Lady  Jill Biden using one in her own kitchen in the White House, but they  want to take this away. It is going to have to be replaced by  electrical appliances, electric automobiles, electric yard tools such  as leaf blowers and lawnmowers.   I still chuckle at the idea that they are trying to ban gas  generators in California. Think about that for a  [[Page H998]]  minute. A generator is something you use a lot of times in an emergency  for a home or business. There are a lot of other purposes as well for  them, but a lot of people use them in an emergency when the power goes  out. If you don't have a gas- or diesel-powered generator, what are you  supposed to go to when the power goes out if you need to turn it on?  Many hospitals, rest homes, things like that will have a diesel-powered  backup generator. They are now constantly under the gun by an air  quality group, even though they rarely have to use it: This is not  compliant. You have to replace it or get rid of it.   When we keep banning fuel-sourced appliances like this and turn to  more electrification, where are you going to get the electricity,  especially in my home State of California in which the grid on any  given hot day might be on the edge of shutting down?   They have arrangements with the power companies that large  manufacturers have pre-agreed agreements, I will say, that they should  shut down when the grid gets tough on a really hot day when the  electrical load that everybody is pulling is about to break the grid.  If that happens, you will have people having to shut down their  businesses, shut down manufacturing, shut down a cement plant, whatever  it might be due to a prearrangement because we can't keep the power  supply up where it needs to be.   They don't really have replacements. That is expensive for jobs. It  is expensive to stop your business. It is going to be expensive for the  ratepayers to have to bear the brunt of that as well that use  electricity other than those businesses. We want to convert everything  to electricity, huh?   I mean, we had a last-minute intervention in the California State  Legislature to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant  by an additional 5 years. They were slated to shut it down, two  reactors, one in 2024, one in 2025. That plant alone is 9 percent of  the power grid. How do you take a 9 percent chunk out of something that  is already teetering on the edge of failing?   There is a similar case up here on the Klamath River with the four  hydroelectric dams. One is on the Oregon side in Mr. Bentz' district.  The other three are on my side in California in Siskiyou County. They  are hell-bent on getting them out. They think they have it done.   We are here to say no because we need the power supply and many other  aspects of those dams that are important for the area. Indeed, the  local folks have had two different measures in the county on the Oregon  side and in Siskiyou County on the California side by well over 70  percent, an advisory vote saying to please keep the dams in place, that  they are important. Siskiyou County voted 79 percent for that.   This course of action, of course, was based on one single study that  supposedly showed that the dams are contributing to high water  temperatures and reduced flows, which are causing fish populations in  the river to decline, especially the salmon. This is at the same time-- you have dams so deep water in them, right?--on Lake Shasta and others,  Lake Almanor, I think soon Lake Oroville, they are requiring Lake  Shasta to be kept deeper so the water stays colder longer into the year  so they can release colder water for the fish in the fall and early  winter. It is all about cold water by keeping the lake deep.   If you take these dams out that have water stored behind them, you no  longer have that deeper pool of water. They are trying to blame the  dams with deeper pools of water for somehow raising the temperature. I  mean, both sides of the mouth on these arguments here. This all came  from a master's thesis by a government employee, not peer-reviewed. It  contained no in-field research.    A former EPA science integrity officer, actually during the Obama  era, a man named Paul Houser, was tasked with reviewing all of these  efforts for the Klamath dam possible removal. His conclusion--again,  the EPA science integrity officer--said it would be the worst of all  outcomes to remove these hydroelectric dams--worst outcome for a lot of  reasons, including environmental.   The three hydroelectric dams are the biggest taxpayers in the county  on the Siskiyou County, California, side. Removing them will cause a  huge hole in the budget of an already struggling county, which has had  its timber business decimated, the mining business decimated. These  large landholders, these large assets, are pretty fairly lucrative for  the county.   When you couple that with already expensive energy in California, and  probably in a lot of the country, this doesn't make any sense because  this is, you know, green renewable power. When the rain falls behind a  dam, that is renewable. It doesn't require a fuel source. That is the  fuel source. Yet, of course, in my crazy State, it is not recognized as  renewable if the size of the power plant is above 30 megawatts. It  doesn't mean anything.   We all hear about, well, we need green power. I guess that can only  mean windmills and solar panels. Try to get a permit. One environmental  group says, ``Hey, we want these solar panels. They are the greatest  thing,'' or the windmills. The other groups, maybe rightly so, say,  ``Well, if we are going to cover a thousand acres with solar panels, we  can't stand by and allow that to happen.'' It might affect the desert  tortoise. We know the windmills chop up birds, sometimes falcons,  sometimes endangered hawks, even eagles, stuff people care about.   In addition, they are not really very reliable sources of power.  Indeed, some days in California, because of an anomaly where there  might be too much power coming off those grids due to the way the load  is managed, they will find themselves having to pay people to take that  power because they can't just easily shut it off. It is strange,  strange thinking.   I am appalled that this is where we have allowed ourselves in  California to be forced into by the ideal of green power.   What does that mean? Everything else becomes a peaker plant. Peaker  plants got talked about a lot 20, 25 years ago in California when we  had other energy crises. A peaker plant was supposed to help supplement  what the grid might not be fulfilling normally. Indeed, the peaker  plants are going to become the hydroelectric plants and the natural gas  plants because they want to go so far and wide with solar and wind that  you know you can't count on them at night or when the wind isn't  blowing, or, funny enough, if the wind is blowing too fast, they have  to shut the windmills down.   Our electrical situation in the State is already in peril. Removing  these hydroelectric dams means about 70,000 homes' worth of power goes  off the grid and a whole host of other things. It will destroy the  current ecosystem habitat, including some endangered species' spawning  grounds, by releasing 20 million cubic yards of toxic, some of it  possibly toxic, material--indeed, silt. These dams have a lot of silt  behind them that has accumulated over the years. They don't really have  an explanation for what is going to happen with it or how it is going  to be disposed of. They are just going to release it into the river.   If you ever hear anybody talk about turbidity from a slight action  going on in the river, you have to get a permit to do the slightest  thing in the river, whether it is a gravel plant or doing something to  clean up the river, having to move some material because of flooding,  because of silt, and other situations. It takes months and months or  years to get a permit just to move a little bit of material out. They  say this is okay that we are going to unleash 20 million cubic yards  down the Klamath River. The turbidity makes it hard for spawning. It is  hypocrisy.   One of the other effects will be lowering the water table underneath  the ground or near the dams. They have helped to build up the water  table. The underground water table will be negatively affected by their  removal.   It will remove flood control capability that is important for the  communities nearby. The dams are a good way to absorb that water  supply. If too much should happen to come from a heavy rainfall, they  provide flexibility.   They remove the ability to control the river and have a flush flow if  you need it in order to move some material or should it be for a fish  need or other things downriver. That flexibility is taken away by  removal of the dams.   Of course, as I mentioned, it takes hydroelectric power capacity away  [[Page H999]]  from the users of the power and those that benefit from the income from  it, including the County of Siskiyou.   It will possibly cost the taxpayers of California, who, in a water  bond, put forward $250 million for the tearing down of dams. This is a  water bond that builds water supply, builds water storage, but had that  provision in there: $250 million of California taxpayer money to help  tear down the dams. The ratepayers from the utility, mostly on the  Oregon side, also had to front $200 million through a surcharge on  their electricity, for a total of about $450 million raised.   Magically, when they were putting forth the proposal to FERC on what  it will cost to remove the dams, it came in at just under $450 million.  Well, they have already wasted about $40 million, maybe up to $50  million, talking about it, so they are down to an amount of somewhere  around $400 million left of that fund.   When they remove a dam, they find a lot of things that they didn't  count on, including much more silt. Up in Washington, I think it was,  they found triple the amount of silt that they had expected. Instead of  20 million, it could be 60 million cubic yards of silt polluting the  river for how long? Who knows how long it will take. The one in  Washington, I think, was only about 12 or 13 miles from where the dam  is to the sea, where you would have to push the silt. On the Klamath,  it is somewhere 120 to 150 miles, depending on the meander of the silt  going all through that. The life cycle of the salmon is 3 years. Will  there be enough salmon to make it back through this turbid water over  that 3-year period to actually have the species that all the fuss is  over?   This removal will diminish the value of Siskiyou County property  owners by about $1.5 billion, thereby lowering the tax rolls to the  county. The electrical rates will have to go up, and the power supply  will be even more uncertain.   Now, speaking about Mr. Houser a moment ago and the study he made on  removing the dams being the worst option, for putting out that truth,  he was fired by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy at the time.                                time  1300    I guess they didn't really want the truth out there. They just wanted  one paper that they had hinged all this on since that time. The 20  million cubic yards--which might be triple of that, who knows--it is  about the equivalent of one dump truck of material every minute of  every day for 6 years being dumped in the river.   Now, imagine the fine if you accidentally put a little bit of silt in  the river or a stream, like under Waters of the United States, for  example, which we will talk about here in a minute. Imagine how you  would be fined otherwise as a private party doing that.   The salmon hatcheries downstream will be destroyed as part of the  removal. The salmon hatcheries that we are talking about are  responsible for more smolts being raised than actually what the river  has ever made.   There is a ridge under one of the dams, a natural ridge that was  there that is much higher than the river level that no fish would have  ever gotten over to begin with. They don't want to talk about that  because they believe the fish were getting all the way up the  additional 60, 70, 80 miles to Klamath Lake. Bad information.   Now they are trying to somehow cover over that in the dam destruction  that they can maybe get rid of that ridge and have it act like it would  have been a fish passage from the beginning of time. So it would do a  lot to hurt the economy of the county, local agriculture, the flood  control, many things up in that area.   There would be uncertainty when the river system would ever return to  normal. It would result in, at the mouth of the river, at the ocean,  underwater contamination at the Humboldt County estuary, which means  basically loss of seabed life with all that material now being released  with who knows what is in it.   This removal would even cause a violation of the Wild and Scenic  Rivers Act. Siskiyou County's governance over water would be lost.   What are they going to do to replace the salmon with the hatchery  gone?   The actual hatchery is down below the lowest dam.   Of course, there is the loss of recreation, land value, the lake  time, use on those lakes, again, tax revenue to the county.   And the replacement water, where are the farmers and ranchers going  to get that replacement water due to the lower groundwater status?   So there is not a whole lot of good that comes from tearing down  these dams that were there for a good economic purpose and actually do  have ecological pluses, as well.   So moving farther south from the Klamath Basin, our water supply in  California has been enhanced in the last century by some very forward- thinking projects. The State Water Project in the 1950s and 1960s and  the Federal water, known as the Central Valley Projects, in the 1930s  and 1940s.   Joining me here is my colleague from central California, Mr.  John  Duarte, who is a farmer down there, as well as a nursery operator of  many of the nursery crops that we use to grow many tree crops, vines,  et cetera. So the importance of the water supply to agriculture and to  the people of California from these projects is incredible.   Madam Speaker, I recognize my colleague, Mr. Duarte, to offer  whatever comments he would like to on the water supply and on how he  has been treated by government in his agricultural operations down in  his direction in the Central Valley, as well as the portion in my  district in Tehama County.   Indeed, we have a mass amount of excellent and very valuable crops  that are grown in California. Some of them Mr. Duarte is responsible  for helping other farmers to have and even grows himself. I happen to  be a farmer in my real life, too. So we see the value of what is grown  in California and that is imperiled by government action.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Duarte).    I am certainly glad you could join us. You made it as a  Member of Congress because you have a great story to tell as a  Representative and as a farmer, also.   So we do have amazing abundant water in Northern California this year  where so much of it emanates and ends up taking care of our part of the  State and other parts of the State, as well.   Shasta and Oroville--Oroville, I believe will fill this year. It  didn't look like that maybe a little while back, but it holds 3.5  million acre-feet of capacity. It has a good chance of filling.   Lake Shasta is a little lagging behind that. With the snowpack we are  looking at, it could top off. It holds 4.5 million. It, combined with  the proposed Sites Reservoir project downriver, would get us that 6- million number.   But we have to build Sites Reservoir. It has been looked at for many,  many years. It has been planned. The voters of California passed a  bond.   Remember the one I talked about a while ago that is going to use $250  million to tear out dams?   Well, it also puts forth a good amount of money to add to water  storage.   So the Sites Reservoir has been able to corral around $950 million of  that $4 billion or $5 billion bond. The rest is going to other  projects, it looks like.   So we need to get this done. We need Governor Newsom, who expressed  his support for it, to get his bureaucrats to move on that and get the  permits approved so we can start. If we had it this year, we would have  had that dam nearly full at Sites Reservoir with all the amazing water  that we have had. So it is an issue of planning ahead, like those  before us used to do when they built the Central Valley Project,  largely Mount Shasta, and the State Water Project, Oroville, and  others. Folsom Lake near Sacramento, it should fill up pretty rapidly  this year with the snowpack.    So we are doing pretty good. I have to give credit where it is due.  Thank you to the BOR for some of the settlement contractors,  particularly in my area, that did get 100 percent allocation. So they  did right on that, based on how things were looking with the supply,  but that is a narrow group.   When Mr. Duarte talks about others that traditionally have grown 100  percent of their acres in normal-ish years, they have seen their  permanent new normal is going to be 35 percent on a good year, perhaps.  That isn't right. If we plan ahead and build the storage we need, which  we know we can, we have done it, and the plans are out there to do  that.   And when the delta pumps that he spoke about weren't run at max  capacity to help fill another reservoir, known as the San Luis  Reservoir, towards the west side of the central part of the valley,  that facility holds 2 million acre-feet. Right now I think it is at  about 75 percent full.   It wasn't looking so good a while back until we had Mother Nature  bless us with so much. But see, they weren't running the pumps as hard  as they could. They have other biological opinions that say, Well, you  can't do this. You can't do that.   You have so much water in there, I don't know see how it is going to  negatively affect the fish except if somebody is waving a document  saying, No, you can't do that.   So we have to flush so much water through the delta that we could be  capturing and not hurting a thing by running those two sets of pumps,  one Federal and one State, and topping off the San Luis Reservoir.   Now, my neighbors might say: Well, Doug, what do you care about San  Luis Reservoir for? It is way down past us. It can't possibly help us.   Well, the more we enhance the supply of the whole State, the better  off we all are.   I want my neighbors down there to do well. I want my neighbors on the  west side of the valley that got zero water, the west side of the  Sacramento Valley, basically many, many acres had zero.   Some of the districts I mentioned had up to 18 percent, which in some  cases wasn't even usable to them. So we saw dry fields like we had  never seen.                                time  1315    So we saw dry fields like we have never seen; never seen. That ruins  the  [[Page H1001]]  economies of small towns. It ruins the habitat for the flyways, I  mentioned, coming out of the Klamath. There is no downside for having  more water supply.   I just saw recently where the City of Oakland has approved 25,000 new  homes, okay. Well, California does have a housing crisis; we need  homes, but where is that water supply going to come from?   We will need approximately 12,500 acre-feet per year to sustain that  amount of homes, if my numbers are right. Where is that going to come  from? Magic?   They are going to have to take it from somewhere. We need to build  the supply so we can continue to build the housing we need in the  State.   John, we have both experienced this in different parts of the State.  We both see that what we are growing here is, indeed, valuable.   These crops that we are talking about here, the country relies on  them. Many of these crops, 100 percent, 90 percent, 99 percent come  from California.   If we don't have this water, then United States citizens don't have  this food. It will have to be imported, or they will have to do  without.   They will have to eat something else. Well, there isn't always  something else if we are not planning for that.   So it isn't just about California and just a few farmers; it is about  everybody.   Tell them about what you had to deal with on just trying to keep your  operation going on a wheat field or an orchard or what have you.    Mr. Duarte, I appreciate you bringing this sad story  forward; indeed, being regulated for practices that are normal  practices that are supposed to be exempt under the Clean Water Act,  which was formed in the early 1970s, that were reinterpreted under the  Obama administration.   They decided to reinterpret, and now it is a wider scope. We are  having this battle right now in the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, this conversation where we are going to do a  Congressional Review Act on the overreach of the regulation of waters  of the United States, WOTUS. It is going to be in the Supreme Court  soon.   So it is important we get back to a level of regulation that is  reasonable. Nobody wants to skirt reasonable environmental laws,  reasonable usage of water, all of the above. We all get that.   But the bureaucracy, as John was saying, is just waiting to pounce  upon you and level huge fines at people.   He is not the only one in Tehama County that has faced this. I had  one grower--this is some years ago--that had a clover field that he  wanted to relevel.   They showed up there and said, oh, you can't do this. They took at  least 3 years, 3 crop years he didn't get to use his land, while the  bureaucracy pontificated whether he was doing something right or wrong.   I mean, he is owed compensation for that. And others, for planting an  orchard, changing their ground from one type of orchard to another.   That is somehow now a new regulatable situation that is not meant-- Congress would not have had the guts to pass a Clean Water Act that did  not have agriculture exemptions as it was written.   If they had not had those exemptions, there would have been a whole  bunch ridden out of here on a rail had they been that abusive of farm  policy and agriculture and the food supply.   Yet, they are getting away with it by a stroke of the pen by a  bureaucracy, and it changes with administration.   President Trump, he saw they were wrong on this, and they were able  to put through a modified policy on waters in the United States that  actually was working and was reasonable, and Biden pushed it right out.   So this is what we face now; his agencies are pushing this. Waters of  the United States: It means every drop of water that falls from the sky  is under the jurisdiction of the United States.  [[Page H1002]]    Whether it is a puddle here--he talked about vernal pools that might  hold some water here for a little while; that is going to become water  of the United States.   There used to be a term known as navigable waterways, navigable  rivers. Well, if you can't run a boat up and down it, it is probably  not really navigable.   But they have expounded upon this definition so far and so wide that  it works for the bureaucracy to be able to attack growers, to attack  landowners, fine them, seize things from them.   So the American people should be outraged by this because farmers are  just trying to provide. Madam Speaker, 99 percent of them are doing  things correctly.   Yeah, you have your outliers that try and do things on the edge, but  they are caught up with pretty soon, whether it is peer pressure or the  reasonable regulations that should kick in.   They are trying to provide good things for the American people. They  are made to feel like criminals. They are made to feel like why should  I even bother?   So back in the 1970s, it was kind of popular to say after the oil  embargoes, if you like imported oil, you will love imported food.   Do we want to really rely on some of our same overseas partners for  our food supply? Can you imagine trying to--Russia has grown a lot of  wheat in the past. Do you want to buy Russian wheat?   Ukraine, which is a good partner--it is part of the difficulty of  wrestling with that situation. Ukraine is a major exporter of many  agricultural crops and fertilizer.   Heck, somebody I know had a breathing apparatus that was only made in  Ukraine. They had to wait a long time to get parts for it.   So do we want to be reliant on foreign sources for everything, China  for pharmaceuticals? Well, we shouldn't put our food supply in that  situation either.   We are on the road to do that due to lack of foresight, due to lack  of water storage. We could be building Sites Reservoir, 1\1/2\ million  acre-feet.   We need to keep chugging water into the San Luis Reservoir, which  holds 2 million acre-feet. We could raise Shasta Dam 18 feet, which  would yield 630,000 more acre-feet.   This is a representation of the water that was wasted during this  winter, being allowed to run out the delta.   This is a snapshot in time here. You have got the upper delta running  out into the ocean here; 6 million acre-feet during that snapshot in  time. What are we doing here? We are not helping ourselves.   The economy is in a tough way, as Mr. Duarte mentioned. The costs for  struggling families, for their housing costs and their food costs,  almost envelops everything else.   So where is the compassion for the American people on this? We seem  to be focused on a lot of other things. There are environmental issues  that are brought up but show me where it actually is going to help the  fish in the Klamath River. It isn't.   A lot of these other environmental issues, it doesn't really--since  1992, we have flushed hundreds of millions of acre-feet out to the  ocean through the delta.    The Delta smelt is almost nonexistent now. They can't find it. When  they do trawls for it, they cannot find it.   So it is almost like more water has actually harmed that fish. They  have other predatory fish that are nonnative that are eating up all the  salmon smelts there.   We don't do the right things about it. We do the wrong things. It  penalizes good, honest, working people that are only trying to provide  good things for the American people.   So, John, we have to keep telling the story because a lot of folks  are just not quite understanding. They don't have time. They are too  busy in their lives.   So for those that are viewing this today, I hope you will take this  to heart and have your representatives do things that are going to help  our food supply in this country and help farmers, help people that  generate electricity.   On these environmental issues, you only seem to hear one side of it.  No, those dams are not bad. Dams are actually created for a good  purpose.   They don't yield the fish passage that is sometimes advertised. There  are other remedies for that, but they are not allowed to come to the  forefront. Can we build fish ladders around the dam?   Heck, in some cases, they are trucking fish from here to there  because of drought situations. So why don't we have alternatives to  these ideas?   This gets into a very important topic in my area too: forestry. We  have overgrown forests that instead of a healthy 50 to 70 adult trees  per acre, they will have 500, 600, even 1,000 trees per acre.   So what does that mean? Well, fire danger, big time. In my district,  there is fire after fire. Last year in 2022, we kind of dodged a lot of  bullets there.   In 2021, we had a million-acre fire. I have got the poster of it  here. You have seen it before. Anyway, it is devastating toward the  landscape, toward the habitat, and also affects the water supply  because all this ash and silt washes into the water system and pollutes  it.   It makes hydroelectric plants sometimes unusable because there is so  much stuff that came down from the mountainside into the rivers, into  the lakes.   We are not managing our forests properly. There is a Federal nexus to  that; the U.S. Forest Service. The pace and scale at which they are  doing things is way too slow to keep up with the amount of board feet  that they are growing every year.   So how does that affect water? It affects not only water quality but  water supply because the forest is sucking all the water in to have too  many trees per acre.   What, you want to cut all the trees, Mr. LaMalfa? That is what I hear  sometimes when I talk to the urban reporters on it.   No, we are not cutting all the trees. We are thinning. We are  managing. We are having the amount of trees per acre at a ratio that is  sustainable, that is healthy, and we are not doing that.   The trees are out there growing right now. There are manyfold more  board feet of trees that are being added to the supply every year than  we are even coming close to harvesting, so that shows we are going  backward on that.   That shows we are going backward on that.                                time  1330    The pace and scale with which we manage our Federal lands and allow  the permitting on private lands to not cut every tree from here to  Oregon, but to manage them--that is the first thing the environmental  groups yell. ``Oh, you guys are going to clear-cut everything. You are  going to devastate the landscape.''   Do you think what is happening now is good? A million-acre fire-- several of my towns don't exist anymore in northern California. Many  have heard of Paradise. Maybe you have seen some of those videos where  95 percent of that town burned down, and 85 people lost their lives.  Many barely escaped. The town of Greenville in my district, 75 percent  gone, and an adjacent town, Canyondam, was completely gone in minutes.   There is more up on the Klamath River even. Fire after fire because  our forests are not managed, because the Federal Government can't get  out of its own way to aggressively do what needs to be done.   We are way behind, so it affects air quality. The air plume, the  smoke that went up in the plume from the Dixie fire in my district,  came and settled over the East Coast because there was so much smoke.  It affected air quality, I believe, here in Washington, all the way up  to New York. People were advised not to go out and do athletic things  because of air quality from a fire in my district.   I am sorry. We didn't want it to happen, but there it was, year after  year, fire after fire. So, we need folks to be on our side on this  thing. No, we don't want to wipe out the forest or cut down the owl or  any of that stuff. The owls actually like a little room to fly between  not overcrowded trees.   It will help our water supply. It will help the health of the forest.  It will help not spend billions and billions on fire suppression every  year once we are behind, endangering people's lives trying to put the  fire out and flying the air tankers and all that fuel being expended  trying to do that.  [[Page H1003]]    Let's talk CO2. I have a CO2 poster over there  as well. When we are talking CO2, which everybody is scared  to death of around here as being the major pollutant, more  CO2 is released in those fires than a year's worth of cars  driving in L.A., okay?   This climate change, which is half the time what they are talking  about on the other side of the aisle in order to scare people to death,  CO2 represents only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere. The U.S.  is a country leading the way on actually lowering the number anyway.   We are going to export our jobs and export our industry to countries  that are doing nothing about it. China laughs at us as they build  another coal-fired power plant every week, every 2 weeks, whatever it  is. There are those that say, ``Hey, you guys in America, you are not  keeping up with the Paris accords,'' and they keep cranking out more  and more. It makes us look like a bunch of fools.   This climate change religion they are pushing is going to be really  expensive. Watch out for these corporations that are pushing what is  called an ESG policy. We acted on that this week here legislatively  because it is going to make Americans uncompetitive in the areas of  energy and everything else.   This is pie-in-the-sky stuff they are pushing here. It is actually  very harmful to America, which is always the innovator of the cleanest,  best way of doing things. We are always seeking to improve. We got the  best-running car and truck engines, yet it is never enough for the  regulators, including in my home State where 70,000 currently used  trucks, up until January 1, now have to be sold or scrapped or  something else, and therefore, people don't get the stuff delivered to  the stores or to their homes that they normally would. It is going to  be more expensive.   I heard somebody talk about the PRO Act here a minute ago. In  California, that was a bill that makes everybody have to be part of a  workforce or union instead of an independent contractor.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Duarte)  to talk about regulations in California.    Madam Speaker, we want the American people to pay  attention because this affects them. It isn't just for us to stand here  and speak.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
