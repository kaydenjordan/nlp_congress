 Mr. Speaker, we are in a global economic competition, but  for far too long, we have neglected the research, workforce  development, and manufacturing needs to ensure America is the world's  leader in critical industries of the future.   Take, for example, the United States semiconductor industry, which  has seen its share of chip production drop in recent decades. This bill  would reverse that trend through a $52 billion investment to fund the  CHIPS for America Act, reinvigorating American leadership in the  microchip technology arena.   The America COMPETES Act also includes my Micro Act, which will  complement the provisions in the CHIPS for America Act by accelerating  early-stage microelectronics research to feed into the National  Semiconductor Technology Center and manufacturing facilities funded by  this bill.   New York's Capital Region has been home to trailblazers in the  microelectronics industry for over two decades. I am proud that this  legislation would indeed allow them to continue to innovate and compete  on the global stage.   Chairwoman Johnson has done a tremendous job leading us to this  moment. The work she has done with the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee has ensured this groundbreaking legislation responds to the  needs of the scientific community, industry, and the American people. I  thank her and the committee for their efforts and urge my colleagues to  support the passage of the America COMPETES Act. It sharpens America's  competitive edge.                                time  1545
