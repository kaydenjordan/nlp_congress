 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Estuaries Week, a  special time to raise awareness about the vital role estuaries play in  our communities and our economies, and to encourage local involvement  in caring for our diverse ecosystems.   My home in Florida is part of an estuary called the Indian River  Lagoon. Supporting the health of our lagoon also supports vast  economic, environmental, and recreational needs of our communities.   When our Nation's estuaries are thriving, we know our environment,  our fishermen, our businesses and, most importantly, our families are  thriving. I encourage my colleagues to join us in recognizing National  Estuaries Week and the important role estuaries play in our  communities.                            ____________________
