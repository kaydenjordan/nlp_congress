 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record a letter of support for revoking President Trump's threat to  deny 800,000 DREAMers legal status in this country and to support his  executive order affirming DACA for so many young people across this  Nation--4,400 in Ohio, for example--who are following the rules, who  came here as children, who are Americans as apple pie and only want a  chance to succeed in our country like Linda who was brought here from  Palestine when she was 8 years old. She is studying now in our area in  a very difficult STEM program and is working her way through college  through Work-Study in order to make a firm contribution to our Nation  in the future and to the future of whatever family she establishes.   Why should they be denied this opportunity and made to feel so put  upon by the Government of the United States?                                                    August 14, 2017.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: As immigration law teachers and       scholars, we write to express our position that the executive       branch has legal authority to implement Deferred Action for       Childhood Arrivals (DACA 2012). This letter provides legal       analysis about DACA 2012. In our view, there is no question       that DACA 2012 is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial       discretion. Our conclusions are based on years of experience       in the field and a close study of the U.S. Constitution,       administrative law, immigration statutes, federal regulations       and case law. As the administration determines the future of       DACA 2012, understanding its legal foundation and history is       critical.        DACA 2012 was announced by the President, and implemented       in a memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security, on       June 15, 2012. It enables qualifying individuals to request a       temporary reprieve from removal known as ``deferred action.''       Deferred action is one form of prosecutorial discretion in       immigration law and has been used for decades by the       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (and formerly the       Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)) and over       several administrations.        Whether a requesting individual receives deferred action       under DACA 2012 is at the discretion of DHS. Qualifying       individuals may request DACA 2012 if they came to the United       States before the age of sixteen; are currently in school or       have graduated; have continuously resided in the United       States since June 15, 2007; have not been convicted of a       felony, ``significant misdemeanor,'' or three or more non-      significant misdemeanors; do not otherwise pose a threat to       public safety or national security; and otherwise warrant       protection as a matter of discretion. Individuals who are       granted DACA 2012 receive a two-year period in deferred       action and also gain eligibility to apply for employment       authorization.        The legal authority for DACA 2012 originates from the U.S.       Constitution. Article II, Section Three (the Take Care       Clause) states in part that the President ``shall take Care       that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Inherent in the       function of the ``Take Care Clause'' is the ability of the       President to target some immigration cases for removal and to       use prosecutorial discretion favorably in others. As       described by the U.S. Supreme  [[Page H6688]]       Court: ``[W]e recognize that an agency's refusal to institute       proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the       decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to       indict--a decision which has long been regarded as the       special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is       the Executive who is charged by the Constitution to `take       Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' ''        As early as 1976, former INS General Counsel Sam Bernsen       executed a legal opinion that identified the Take Care Clause       as the primary source for prosecutorial discretion in       immigration matters. He wrote: ``The ultimate source for the       exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the Federal       Government is the power of the President. Under Article II,       Section 1 of the Constitution, the executive power is vested       in the President. Article II, Section 3, states that the       President `shall take care that the laws be faithfully       executed.' ''        The U.S. Supreme Court has also recognized the role of       prosecutorial discretion in the immigration system. In       Arizona v United States, the Court noted that ``[a] principal       feature of the removal system is the broad discretion       exercised by immigration officials . . . Federal officials,       as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to       pursue removal at all . . .''        Congress created the Immigration and Nationality Act (the       Act or INA) in 1952 and it remains the primary statutory       authority for immigration law today. Importantly, Congress       has delegated most discretionary immigration functions to       DHS. Section 103 of the Act provides that ``[t]he Secretary       of Homeland Security shall be charged with the administration       and enforcement of this Act and all other laws relating to       the immigration and naturalization of aliens . . .''        Congress has repeatedly acknowledged that the Executive has       power to grant ``deferred action'' for certain categories of       people such as victims of crimes and human trafficking.       Additionally, previous administrations have announced       deferred action programs to protect qualifying individuals.       For example, under the George W. Bush administration, U.S.       Citizenship and Immigration Services (part of DHS) announced       a deferred action program for students affected by Hurricane       Katrina and later developed a program for the widows of U.S.       citizens. Moreover, Congress also recognized legal authority       for immigration prosecutorial discretion in INA Sec. 242(g),       which bars judicial review of three specific prosecutorial       discretion decisions by the agency: to commence removal       proceedings, to adjudicate cases, and to execute removal       orders.        Another important legal source for deferred action is Title       8 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 274a.12(c)(14)       dates to 1981 and is the product of notice and comment       rulemaking. This regulation specifically identifies deferred       action by name and allows individuals granted deferred action       to apply for work authorization upon a showing of ``economic       necessity.'' Over the last two decades, thousands of       individuals have applied for and received work authorization       based on a deferred action grant.        There are also agency guidance documents related to       deferred action issued by DHS (and formerly INS) over the       last four-plus decades. The 1976 legal opinion by former INS       General Counsel Sam Bernsen cites to the Take Care Clause of       the U.S. Constitution, as well as statutory and case law from       as early as 1825 to affirm the exercise of prosecutorial       discretion in immigration. It was around this time when INS       published its first guidance on deferred action in the form       of an ``Operations Instruction.'' This ``Operations       Instruction'' stated ``(ii) Deferred action. In every case       where the district director determines that adverse action       would be unconscionable because of the existence of appealing       humanitarian factors, he shall recommend consideration for       deferred action category.'' Since 1975, deferred action has       been identified in several subsequent guidance documents.       Guidance documents are common in administrative law and are a       recognized form of agency action under the Administrative       Procedure Act.        At tension with the aforementioned body of law is a letter       sent by ten state Attorneys General to the administration       requesting that DACA 2012 be rescinded. This letter refers to       DACA 2012 as ``unlawful'' and does so without citing to the       foundational legal authorities behind deferred action.       Furthermore, the letter conflates deferred action, ``lawful       presence'' and work authorization in ways that are legally       unsound and unclear. Finally, the letter itself shoehorns       arguments into Texas v. United States, a lawsuit that never       included the core of DACA 2012, and instead involved policies       that are at this point in time moot. Moreover, a previous       lawsuit challenging DACA 2012 failed on jurisdictional       grounds and would inevitably inform any future challenge.        While the scope of this letter is to describe the legal       foundation for DACA 2012, it is important to highlight the       history and inevitability of prosecutorial discretion in       immigration enforcement. Prosecutorial discretion exists       because the government has limited resources and lacks the       ability to enforce the law against the entire undocumented       population. Recognizing this resource limitation, Congress       has charged the Secretary of DHS with ``establishing national       immigration enforcement policies and priorities.''       Prosecutorial discretion and policies like DACA 2012 also       have a humanitarian dimension, and such factors have long       driven deferred action decisions. Finally, DACA 2012 has been       an unqualified policy success, allowing over three-quarters       of a million recipients to continue their education, receive       professional licensing, find employment, and pay taxes into       Social Security and other tax coffers.        This letter outlines the legal foundation for DACA 2012 and       confirms that maintaining such a policy falls squarely within       the Executive's discretion. The legal authority for the       Executive Branch to operate DACA 2012 is crystal clear. As       such, choices about its future would constitute a policy and       political decision, not a legal one. As the administration       decides how best to address DACA 2012, we hope that the legal       foundation and history for this policy is addressed wisely       and that decisions on the future of DACA 2012 are made       humanely.        * All institutional affiliations are for identification       purposes only and do not signify institutional endorsement of       this letter.

So with this unanimous consent request, I stand on behalf  of those 4,400 Ohioans as well as 800,000 young Americans who are  DREAMers and will inject new energy and new possibility into our  country, help to fund programs like Social Security which they are  paying into if they are working, and make their contribution to our  country's future.   It is really an honor to rise on her behalf and ask for Congress to  act immediately to pass legislation to protect these young people whose  economic and cultural contributions will only make our Nation stronger.  They will not displace anyone--any person--who has an application  currently pending before our immigration service, but they will wait in  line like everyone else because they are fair people and they deserve  to be treated fairly by the Government of the United States.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the materials will be  included in the Record.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Time will be deducted from the gentleman  from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article about  Alonso Guillen, a DREAMer who died trying to rescue Harvey flood  victims.                     [From the LA Times, Sept. 4, 2017]            `Dreamer' Dies Trying To Rescue Harvey Flood Victims                         (By Molly Hennessy-Fiske)         Alonso Guillen drove more than 100 miles south from his       home in Lukfin, Texas, last week, determined to help those       trapped by Hurricane Harvey flooding in the Houston area.        But he and another man disappeared after their boat       capsized in a flood-swollen creek Wednesday, and relatives       began searching for their bodies.        On Friday, searchers found the body of Tomas Carreon, 25,       of Lufkin. On Sunday, relatives spotted Guillen's body.        ``He was floating in the water,'' his brother Jesus       Guillen, 36, a Lufkin truck driver, said in Spanish during a       phone interview.        Luis Ortega, 22, of Lufkin, who survived the boat accident,       told searchers the men had been swept away by a powerful       current. Ortega barely escaped by grabbing a floating gas       tank, then a tree.        Relatives said Guillen, a Mexican national, was a       ``Dreamer'' enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood       Arrivals program, which President Trump is said to be poised       to scrap, though he may leave it intact for six months to       give Congress time to find a legislative solution. (Ortega is       a U.S. citizen, as was Carreon, Guillen's brother said.)        Guillen moved to Lufkin at age 14 from just across the       border in Piedras Negras, Mexico. He later graduated from       Lufkin High School, attended St. Patrick's Catholic Church,       worked in construction and at a local club, Rodeo Disko, and       radio station, SuperMix 101.9 FM.        He was known as ``DJ Ocho,'' who mixed country and hip-hop,       followed Texans football and the Houston Astros, played       softball and soccer, sported Cowboy hats and red, white and       blue sunglasses.        He used the station to organize fundraisers for those in       need. ``It didn't matter what situation it was,'' said friend       Linda Alvarez.        Guillen masterminded the rescue trip to the Houston area       just like one of his radio station fundraisers: on the fly,       with friends' help. After the storm hit, they borrowed a boat       and drove south to save strangers.        Like many in Texas, Guillen's family has mixed immigration       status and is divided by the border. His mother, a Mexican       national, still lives in Piedras Negras, Mexico, with one of       his brothers. His father is a legal resident, and his brother       Jesus is a U.S. citizen.        Alonso Guillen applied for DACA, an Obama-era program that       protected from deportation about 800,000 immigrants brought       to the country illegally as children. He applied because so       many of his family and friends were in the U.S., and that's       where he saw his future, his brother said.        ``His dream was to open a restaurant, something the whole       family could enjoy and where they could come together,'' his       brother said.        ``He was trying; he was always updated with the news about       the Dreamer program.  [[Page H6690]]       He was ready to get it fixed and done,'' friend Manny Muniz       said of Guillen's immigration status.        Muniz, a fellow disc jockey, met Guillen a few years ago in       the midst of a more minor crisis: He had booked a gig and       didn't have any speakers. Guillen lent him some, and they       started working together.        After the storm struck, Guillen started posting weather       reports on Facebook.        Early last week Guillen told Muniz he was headed to       Houston, ``to go save lives, go help people, volunteer his       time.''        Muniz said part of the reason Guillen applied for DACA and       wanted to become a legal resident was that he longed to be       able to cross the border legally to visit Mexico, especially       his hometown.        Instead, Guillen will be buried this week in Lufkin. He is       survived by an 8-year-old daughter, Mariana, who lives in       Guanajuato, Mexico, his brother said.        Guillen's family is planning his funeral at St. Patrick's       Catholic Church. Guillen's mother may not be allowed to       attend. The U.S. government has not granted her permission to       cross the border for the service, relatives said.        ``We hope that she can come, that they allow her to come,''       said Jesus Guillen's 14-year-old daughter, Zorayda.        U.S. Customs and Border Protection tweeted condolences to       Guillen's family Monday, calling him ``a rescue volunteer who       died during Hurricane Harvey'' and promising to allow       Guillen's mother to cross the border to attend his funeral.        Jesus Guillen said he hopes the DACA program will not be       dismantled.        ``It gives people like my brother opportunities to be       better, to have strength and believe in themselves and become       what they want to be,'' he said.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to  Members of Congress from The United States Conference of Mayors  strongly objecting to what the President did.                                                   The United States                                            Conference of Mayors,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2017.      An Open Letter to the Congress on Dreamers from America's           Mayors         Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the       U.S. Senate: We write on behalf of the nation's mayors to       urge you to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that would       enable Dreamers--people who have lived in America since they       were children and built their lives here--to earn lawful       permanent residence and eventually American citizenship if       they meet certain criteria. We pledge to work with you in       this effort and to do whatever we can to assist you in seeing       it enacted into law.        This June at the 85th Annual Meeting of The United States       Conference of Mayors, we adopted strong policy supporting       permanent legal status for Dreamers and extension of the DACA       program We did this because it is the right thing to do--for       Dreamers, for our communities and for our country.        DACA has benefitted nearly 800,000 undocumented youth since       it began in 2012. With work authorization and without the       fear of deportation, these young people, who have done       nothing illegal, have been able to participate in and       contribute to our country, our cities and the nation's       economy:        Eighty-seven percent of DACA recipients are employed by       American businesses, and six percent have started their own       businesses, leading to higher wages and better economic       outcomes.        DACA recipients contribute 15.3 percent of their wages to       taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, and DACA       recipients are investing in assets like houses, and starting       new businesses, bringing significant tax revenue to cities       and states.        It is expected that DACA recipients will contribute $9.9       billion in tax contributions over the next four years, and at       least $433.4 billion to our gross domestic product (GDP) over       the next decade.        There is broad public support for Dreamers:        Sixty-four percent of Americans support letting       ``Dreamers'' remain in the U.S.        Seventy-one percent of Americans feel undocumented       immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to       apply for legal status.        Seventy-five percent of Americans who voted for the       President support Dreamers.        Because of the Trump Administration's decision to terminate       DACA in six months, this legislation must be passed as       quickly as possible so that the benefits to Dreamers, to our       cities, and to our nation can continue. It would remove       Dreamers' fears of deportation and allow them to contribute       even more to the country they love, which for many is the       only country they have known. They would be able to reach       their full potential in many ways, including serving in the       military. The U.S. Conference of Mayors pledges to work with       you to make this happen.            Sincerely,      Mitchell J. Landrieu,        Mayor of New Orleans, President.      Eric Garcetti,        Mayor of Los Angeles, Chair, USCM Latino Alliance.      Jorge Elorza,        Mayor of Providence, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task       Force.      Tom Tait,        Mayor of Anaheim, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task Force.      John Giles,        Mayor of Mesa, Trustee.      Tom Cochran,        CEO and Executive Director.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, next, I include in the Record an article  that appeared on the National Public Radio web page, entitled,  ``Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport a DREAMer, You'll Have to Go  Through Us.''                         [From NPR, Sept. 5, 2017]   Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport A DREAMer, You'll Have To Go                                 Through Us         America's business leaders are speaking out against       President Trump's move to end DACA.        The president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, took a notable       stand. He said not only will his company lobby for a       legislative solution but also that Microsoft is calling on       Congress to make immigration the top priority, before tax       reform. And he is calling on other business leaders to follow       suit.        ``There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly       for Congress to act on,'' Smith said in an interview with       NPR. ``We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax       reform bill. The entire business community cares about a tax       reform. And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill       needs to be set aside until the DREAMers are taken care of.       They have a deadline that expires in six months. Tax reform       can wait.''        Smith also said if the government moves to deport DREAMers       who are Microsoft employees, ``it's going to have to go       through us to get that person.''        This is the second time in a week that Smith has spoken       out. Last Thursday, Smith and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella       both issued statements calling on the administration to       preserve DACA. Nadella, a first-generation immigrant from       India, struck a personal note: ``I am a product of two       uniquely American attributes: the ingenuity of American       technology reaching me where I was growing up, fueling my       dreams, and the enlightened immigration policy that allowed       me to pursue my dreams.''        Meanwhile, in a letter to employees this morning, Apple CEO       Tim Cook said more than 250 Apple workers are affected by the       DACA repeal and that he has been hearing from them all       weekend.        ``I want to assure you that Apple will work with members of       Congress from both parties to advocate for a legislative       solution that provides permanent protections for all the       Dreamers in our country,'' Cook said.        Dozens of CEOs including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed       Hastings from Netflix, Randall Stephenson from AT&T and Tim       Sloan of Wells Fargo wrote a letter addressed to the       president asking him to preserve the program.        The leaders argued that all DACA recipients grew up in       America and give back to the community and pay income taxes.       They said: ``More than 97 percent are in school or in the       workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent       have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their       first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500       companies count DACA recipients among their employees.''        In a public post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said about       Trump's announcement: ``This is a sad day for our country''       and that he and his immigration advocacy vehicle at Fwd.US       will be ``doing even more in the weeks ahead to make sure       Dreamers have the protections they deserve.''        Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google (an arm of Alphabet), did       not make quite the same commitment on Twitter. But he took a       moral stand, writing, ``Dreamers are our neighbors, our       friends and our co-workers. This is their home. Congress       needs to act now to #DefendDACA. #WithDreamers.''        When President Trump was first elected, leaders in the tech       industry were reluctant to criticize campaign pledges of his       that went against their values and interests. They took a       wait-and-see approach and grappled with how to be a       successful multinational in an increasingly nationalistic       world. Tuesday morning's outpouring illustrates a clear shift       in business leaders' willingness to speak out against       decisions by the administration.        Microsoft's Smith says in the beginning of 2017, business       leaders looked around and wondered how they would navigate       this new unpredictable environment. They feared being       attacked by the commander in chief on social media. Now,       Smith says, ``I don't think people get up in the morning       worrying about tweets. We have much bigger problems to worry       about than that.''    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over  500 business leaders in support of DACA who oppose what the President  did yesterday and who are upset at Congress for its inaction.   [[Page H6691]]                 Open Letter From Leaders of American Industry on DACA        August 31, 2017       To: President Donald J Trump       To: Speaker Paul Ryan; Leader Nancy Pelosi; Leader Mitch           McConnell; and Leader Charles E. Schumer         As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned       about new developments in immigration policy that threaten       the future of young undocumented immigrants brought to       America as children.         The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,       which allows nearly 800,000 Dreamers the basic opportunity to       work and study without the threat of deportation, is in       jeopardy. All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered       with our government, submitted to extensive background       checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and       paying income taxes. More than 97 percent are in school or in       the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65       percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have       purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25       Fortune 500 companies count DACA recipients among their       employees.         Unless we act now to preserve the DACA program, all       780,000 hardworking young people will lose their ability to       work legally in this country, and every one of them will be       at immediate risk of deportation. Our economy would lose       $460.3 billion from the national GDP and $24.6 billion in       Social Security and Medicare tax contributions. Dreamers are       vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With       them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will       continue to have a global competitive advantage.        We call on President Trump to preserve the DACA program. We       call on Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act or       legislation that provides these young people raised in our       country the permanent solution they deserve.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement  signed by over 1,300 Catholic educators who call on President Trump and  his administration to save DACA and protect the DREAMers.     [From Faith in Public Life, Ignatian Solidarity Network, and the                                  Jesuits]  Over 1,300 Catholic Educators Call on Trump Administration to Save DACA                            and Protect Dreamers         Dear Gen. Kelly: As educators at Catholic institutions, we       write to convey profound concern for our vulnerable immigrant       students. In your new position as Chief of Staff, you are now       one of the most prominent Catholics in the Administration.       Your direct line to President Trump and recent experience as       Secretary of Homeland Security provides an opportunity for       you to be an influential champion for the children and youth       who are the next generation of American leaders. We ask that       you protect the dignity of our nation's immigrant youth by       advocating for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals       (DACA) program until Congress passes the Dream Act.        We stand with our students who are DACA beneficiaries.       Their perseverance, hard work and hopefulness is an example       to us as teachers. We witness the obstacles they overcome       each day as they pursue their dream of a better life for       themselves and their families. In facing adversity and       uncertainty with grace and hope, they embody the best of our       schools, our country and the Catholic tradition.        It is a moral and policy failure when our government       targets children and young adults who simply aspire to live       the American dream. Breaking up families and communities       undermines the best values of our nation.        Bishop Joe S. Vasquez, Chair of the Migration Committee at       the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bishop of Austin,       Texas, said recently in a statement.        ``These young people entered the U.S. as children and know       America as their only home. The dignity of every human being,       particularly that of our children and youth, must be       protected.''        We join Bishop Vasquez in urging you to uphold the DACA       program. On several occasions, you have expressed that you       would not make changes to DACA. We strongly encourage you to       maintain DACA as an essential program for the well-being of       young people and our communities.        Please know we are praying that you use your power       prudently and that we remain committed to constructive       dialogue.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Ranking Member Lowey for  yielding me time. Thank you to all members of the committee for the  long hours you have dedicated to these bills, certainly our chairman,  Rodney Frelinghuysen. The artificially low allocations you were given  have resulted in a package that I cannot support, but I want to note  your efforts to find compromise where it was possible.   Though the House passed the Energy and Water bill as part of July's  Christmas tree minibus, I am back down here today because the  Republican majority has harmed the Department of Energy's funding for  the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, or, as  they call it, the ATVM. It has been gutted as a pay-for to cover  another shortsighted Republican cut to a Federal Emergency Management  program.   Today's rule allowed this boneheaded Republican action, plotted just  weeks ago before Mother Nature's catastrophic fury hit Texas with  Hurricane Harvey. It doesn't look good to the American people when the  majority cuts programs that are desperately needed. It doesn't serve  America's future if money is pulled from developing engine technologies  to increase fuel economy of cars, expand domestic manufacturing, and  create good-paying American jobs.   Unless you live under a rock, you know these initiatives are both  popular and effective and necessary: 61 percent of Republicans in Ohio  support the requirement of getting to an average of 40 miles per gallon  in new cars by 2025, with 73 percent of the public, overall, supporting  that.   The Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle program  supported Ford's development of the EcoBoost engine, which is built in  Ohio at Brook Park, in my own district. Advanced Vehicle Research  supported the development of all-electric vehicles, from Nissan's Leaf  in Tennessee to Tesla's Model S in California. It supports America's  competitiveness in a fiercely competitive and tough global marketplace  that is, many times, not on the level.   We should support innovation and collaboration, not eliminate job- creating programs. I will fight to preserve this program in the final  spending package.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chair, thus, I encourage all my colleagues to oppose  this sort of backward maneuver and oppose the final bill.   In closing, I would like to say, and to acknowledge publicly, a very  big thank you and congratulations to Taunja Berquam on her upcoming  retirement from Congress. I know she will have a bright future ahead.   After her distinguished and exemplary service with the Army Corps of  Engineers, including in Iraq, she dedicated over a decade of her  brilliant life and mind to the important task of managing the  Appropriation's Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee accounts during my tenure as ranking member, as well as  for Representative Peter Visclosky before me.    Taunja's high-minded commitment to democratic principles is  unyielding. Our committee is losing a trusted and honorable adviser.  Her expertise and no-nonsense approach served our members, the staff,  and the American people extraordinarily well.   Taunja, you will be missed, and you can leave knowing that you made a  positive difference for America's future in nuclear readiness, in our  energy future security, and in vital Army Corps development from coast  to coast. We thank you.
