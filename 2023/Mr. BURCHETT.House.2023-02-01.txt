 I thank Mr. Clyde and the Speaker for your service to  our great country.   I don't have any notes for this, but I do want to say the ATF, to me,  is the swamp.   Now, here we have a group of unelected bureaucrats, dadgummit, that  have taken upon themselves to interpret a law.   It always reminds me, when I was in Nashville one time. I was sitting  at the Crown Plaza across the street from the Capitol with one of my  dear friends who just passed away; his name was Tom Hensley. He was  called the Golden Goose. He was the liquor lobbyist. I never voted for  his bills, but he always liked me.   He told me one time, a guy came up and threatened him that worked for  our Governor and threatened him; and he sat there, and he chomped on  his cigar; and he walked away and he said--Burchett, he said, you know  what? He said, in a few more years he will be gone and the old goose  will still be sitting here. That is exactly, exactly the mentality of  the swamp.    It is not like on an episode of The Simpsons where they are all--six  people are sitting around at a table in the old cartoon, and they are  deciding what is going on. It is a bunch of unelected, arrogant  bureaucrats who think they know what is best for this country.   Dadgummit, the ATF has overstepped their bounds once again. Law- abiding Americans, law-abiding citizens, law-abiding Tennesseans should  not be deemed criminal because of some bureaucratic whim.   I appreciate the gentleman, thank him for his service to our country,  thank him for this bill. I look forward to voting with him on this bill  and being a sponsor.
