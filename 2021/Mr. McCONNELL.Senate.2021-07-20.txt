 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S4955]]     Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on  President Biden's nominee to serve as general counsel for the National  Labor Relations Board.   There actually shouldn't be a vacancy in this position. When  President Biden took office, the person serving as the NLRB's top  lawyer was still in the middle of a term to which the Senate had  confirmed him. He was doing his job, serving the country, and had no  intention to skip out of his responsibilities early.   But less than 30 minutes after pledging to heal and unify the country  in his inaugural address, President Biden broke precedent and  threatened to fire Peter Robb unless he resigned prematurely that very  day.   At the very first instant that the new President's statements about  norms, institutions, and governance ran up against the demands of the  far left--well, the decision didn't take very long. Where Senate  confirmation and fixed terms were supposed to create independence, this  administration just wanted partisan loyalty.   Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident. It has actually  been a pattern. This small world of independent agencies has offered us  actually a case study in the gap between the administration's unifying  rhetoric on the one hand and its divisive actions on the other.   Back in March, the Biden administration took aim at another Senate- confirmed official, the general counsel for the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission. This time, a full 2 years before her term was  set to expire. Sharon Gustafson had been engaged in important work,  particularly in defense of religious freedom in the workplace. But the  President didn't want to wait for our system to play out properly. He  broke with norms and he fired her.   Just this month, we witnessed the firing of Andrew Saul, the head of  the Social Security Administration. Listen to this. He was just 2 years  into a  6-year term. Mr. Saul had kept a critical agency functioning through a  historically challenging year. He was not some partisan hack. We are  talking about someone the Senate confirmed with 77 votes--77 votes--a  bipartisan supermajority for Mr. Saul.   But powerful liberal interests got the President's ear. They wanted  their own hand-picked insider. Norms and precedents had to go out the  window. Now, the American people deserve to trust in the independence  of crucial watchdog agencies like these, but with these firings, this  administration has instead decided to explore frontiers in partisan  hardball.   We just spent years listening to the left and the media express  outrage over personnel decisions and dismissals, many of which amounted  to a heck of a lot less than the three I just mentioned                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, later  today, the Senate is set to do some bipartisan legislating.   Back in 1984, Congress passed a Victims of Crime Act, which includes  an important Federal program called a Crime Victims Fund. When  criminals who commit Federal crimes are charged fines and penalties,  some of that money flows into this fund. It goes to State-level  programs that help crime victims with services, like counseling and  emergency shelters. It also helps compensate the victims directly with  their expenses, like medical costs, mental health, funeral expenses,  and lost wages. Some of the money also goes specifically to fight child  abuse.   This fund needs to rest on firm financial footing, but right now it  doesn't have that firm footing. Its balance has been shrinking fast.  Congress needs to act to prevent big cuts to victims' services,  particularly in rural areas.   A number of Senators on both sides have come together and produced  bipartisan reforms that will strengthen the program and keep assistance  flowing to the survivors of Federal crimes.   The junior Senator from Pennsylvania has a further amendment to make  sure the program can't be used as part of budgetary shell games that  deliberately cloud Federal accounting. I will support both Senator  Toomey's amendment and our colleagues' legislation later today.   But on this subject, for goodness' sake, elected officials should not  just be racing to replenish the Crime Victims Fund before it runs out.  Leaders at local, State, and Federal levels should be acting to  confront the surge in violent crime that is plaguing our Nation.   For about a year now, the political left has grown obsessed with the  notion that police officers are inherently bad, policing is inherently  evil, and what vulnerable neighborhoods really need is less enforcement  of the laws.   As one House Member has informed us:         Defunding police means defunding police.    Another put it this way:         Defunding the police isn't radical, it is real.    Well, academic research has confirmed something troubling. The broad  anti-police backlash that sometimes follows high-profile, police- involved incidents subsequently leads to less safety, more crime, and  more murders. Sure enough, murders have shot up in cities and  communities all across our country.   My hometown of Louisville has seen 66 percent more homicides than we  had seen by this time last year--66 percent more. Last year was a  record year for carjackings and yet Louisville is on pace to match it  once again. The city's police department is short more than 200 sworn  officers due to low recruitment, low morale, and resignations.   Leaders should be working to contain this damage, but instead of  delivering a sober, responsible message, many of the most prominent  Democratic politicians instead grabbed their megaphones and amplified  the anti-police sentiment as loud as possible.   As I have noted before, attacking and insulting the police is not  just a bad strategy for public safety across the board; the data shows  it is an especially disruptive approach to advancing racial justice.   The truth is this:         Larger police forces save lives and the lives saved are       disproportionately Black lives.    That is another expert study.   So I am glad the Senate will take the important step today of  reforming and strengthening the Crime Victims Fund. It certainly belies  any notion that we can't legislate in a bipartisan way. We absolutely  can and we do. When a bipartisan outcome is what the Democratic  majority leader truly wants, it actually makes it possible.   But I wish anti-crime, pro-police, pro-public safety attitudes and  policies could be just as bipartisan at the State, local, and Federal  levels as today's vote will likely be. Standing up for law enforcement  and the innocent people they protect should never be limited to one  side of the aisle.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
