 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of the CARES Act  with optimism.   On one hand is cautious optimism because we face unprecedented  challenges, but on the other, confident optimism of what can be  accomplished when we work together.   We come together for those who are bravely working on the front lines  of the fight: our nurses and doctors at Lakeland Regional, Brandon  Regional, Southlake Hospital, or one of the many other medical  providers across my district.   We come together for families, like the single mom who worked two  jobs in Florida's tourism industry to keep food on the table but now  doesn't know when her next paycheck will come.   We come together to support the backbone of our economy: small  business. I have spoken to many small business owners this week who are  desperately trying to figure out how to keep their employees. As a  former small business owner myself, I understand the decisions that  they are facing.   As a fiscal conservative, I am cautious about this bill, but I  understand the cost our country would pay without it.   When we face adversity, we rise to confront the threat head-on.   For those in Florida's 15th District and around the country, remain  optimistic because we will win this fight together.
