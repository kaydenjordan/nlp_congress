 Madam Speaker, I am reminded of the old hymn, ``There Is  Power in the Blood,'' ``power in the blood, wonder working power.'' It  also reminds me of something else, that Congress has the power of the  purse.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, before I returned to D.C., I had a meeting  with a local county official. I thought we were going to discuss  infrastructure and workforce problems. He wanted to talk to me about  veterans, homeless veterans, how it was increasing so much in his  county, and the fact that we have borders that are just porous, with  record numbers of people crossing those borders. Here we are, setting  them up in rooms and with food, yet we have veterans all across this  country living under bridges.   Madam Speaker, when I got to the world's busiest airport, I ran into  a dear friend, a marine, on his way to his next assignment. I thought  it was very ironic because here we are this week, discussing the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act. That is right, the power of the purse.   We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that we can't ever repay. We  also owe our military, our current members of the military, all the  tools that they can get in their toolbox.   That is why, this week, we are going to be discussing things. We are  fully funding the health program for our veterans and fully funding the  veterans benefits in all the VA programs. We are also focusing on  infrastructure investments for our current military.   There is another thing we have with that power of the purse--not just  funding, but cutting. See, we are going to cut out of our military DEI  and CRT, which are hurting recruitment and killing morale.   Madam Speaker, as we go throughout this week and have this debate,  for their salvation, I encourage my colleagues to focus on that power  of the blood, but I also encourage them to focus on the power of the  purse for these appropriations bills.                            ____________________
