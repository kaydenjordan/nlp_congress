 Mr. President, I rise to support the historic  nomination of Shalanda Young to be the next Director of the Office of  Management and Budget. Ms. Young brings deep experience with the  Federal budget process to her role at OMB, having served as staff  director of the House Committee on Appropriations. She has been serving  as Acting Director of OMB for the past year, and her top-notch  performance in that role leaves no doubt that she is eminently  qualified to be confirmed as OMB Director.   Ms. Young came into OMB in March 2021, the same month that Congress  passed the American Rescue Plan. This was a time when the Nation faced  an uncertain future, with coronavirus vaccines just starting to go out  and unemployment remaining stubbornly high at 6 percent. Under Ms.  Young's leadership, OMB played a key role to implement the American  Rescue Plan to fight the pandemic and move our economy forward. The  results have been widespread vaccinations, millions of new jobs,  unemployment falling to 3.8 percent, and the fastest economic growth in  nearly 40 years.   We have achieved a great deal during the first year of the Biden  administration, but we must recognize that there is still so much left  to accomplish. Shalanda Young is the right person to have at the helm  of OMB to craft responsible budgets and turn the policies we craft into  actions that make a real difference for the American people.
