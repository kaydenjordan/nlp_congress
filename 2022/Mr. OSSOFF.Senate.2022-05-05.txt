 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Borchien Lai  be granted floor privileges for the remainder of today's session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this evening, I come to the floor of the  U.S. Senate in order to move that we confirm Philip S. Goldberg to  serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea. Ambassador  Goldberg currently serves as U.S. Ambassador to Colombia.   We saw, just yesterday, North Korea test a ballistic missile. We have  seen North Korea continue to develop and test ballistic missiles that  threaten not just South Korea, not just our allies in the region but  the United States and the entire world.   We need our Ambassador in Seoul. South Korea is one of our most  important trading partners. South Korea is one of our most important  security partners. Our alliance with the Republic of Korea is among the  most important bilateral relationships that the  [[Page S2367]]  United States has in the world. And as the Presiding Officer knows, in  our home State of Georgia, a vibrant Korean-American community thrives,  and Georgia is a key destination for Korean investment, bringing  technology, jobs, talent, and opportunity to our State and to the  entire country.   We need a U.S. Ambassador to lead our mission in South Korea. I had  the privilege of leading an economic delegation to South Korea in the  middle of last year. I sat down at that time with now President-elect  Yoon, then-Candidate Yoon. When he was running for President, I  congratulated him on his election. I look forward to working with him.   I had the pleasure last month, alongside Senators Sullivan and  Schatz, to host his special delegation to Washington and meet with the  Foreign Minister Designate, Dr. Park. This alliance is essential, and  we have to strengthen it. In order to strengthen it, we need to confirm  our Ambassador to South Korea.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 897, 898, 899, 900, and 901; that the Senate vote  on the nominations without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  no further motions be in order to the nominations; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate  then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, we look forward to Ambassador Goldberg's  service in Seoul. He will continue his distinguished career in the  Foreign Service, and we look forward to working with him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday,  May 9; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for  the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Phillips nomination; further, that the cloture motions filed during  today's session of the Senate ripen at 5:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 621.   There being no objection, under the previous order and as a further  mark of respect to the late Orrin G. Hatch, former Senator from Utah,  the Senate, at 4:33 p.m., adjourned until Monday, May 9, 2022, at 3  p.m.                            ____________________
