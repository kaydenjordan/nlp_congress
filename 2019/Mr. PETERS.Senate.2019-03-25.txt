 Mr. President, revolution is deeply embedded in the  character of this Nation.   More than two centuries ago, delegates from across the American  colonies gathered in Philadelphia to take what was audacious action.  They risked everything, including their lives, by declaring  independence from the greatest and strongest power in the world at that  time, the British Empire.   I am proud to say that my forefather served in George Washington's  army, and he was called to risk his life and serve in the Continental  Army to fight for an idea--that freedom and liberty would reign in this  country.   As Americans, throughout history, we have been called to service.  Sometimes we are called to service by clear and present danger, such as  the bombing at Pearl Harbor. Sometimes we are called to greatness by  stretching our imagination like, when we went to the Moon, and  sometimes we are called to unity by necessity because the stakes of  inaction are simply too high.   Today the United States faces such a challenge, and I believe we can  once again prove our greatness. It is an undeniable fact that climate  change, caused in large part by humans, is a threat to Michigan, our  Great Lakes, our country, and our planet. Climate change poses a threat  not only to the lands and waters that we all depend on but also to our  health, our economy, and even our national security.   It is also undeniable that the United States, unified in purpose, can  meet the challenges and defeat the threats caused by climate change,  but we need to take action now. Time is simply not on our side.   Without question, taking action involves political risk, but doing  nothing is simply not an option. The longer we  [[Page S1929]]  wait, the risks to our planet only grow more challenging and difficult  to solve.   Our planet is showing clear, unequivocal evidence of climate change,  according to an overwhelming scientific consensus. Our ice caps are  melting. Our oceans are warming. Severe weather is becoming the new  normal. Land temperatures are rising.   Just last week, an alarming new report found that the Great Lakes are  warming more quickly than other parts of the country. This change will  negatively impact fish species, lead to more algal blooms, cause flood  damage to communities, homes, and businesses, and irreversibly alter a  sensitive ecosystem that provides drinking water for 40 million  Americans. I represent the Great Lakes State, and climate change  threatens our economy and our way of life.   I am disappointed that instead of working together on commonsense  efforts and treating climate change with the seriousness that it  deserves, the Republican Senate majority leader has chosen to waste  limited floor time on a political stunt.   What we should be doing is having a thoughtful debate on the need to  address a significant threat to our country. Rather than playing  partisan games, it is time to find unity and take bold action.   The Senate must come together to pass real, concrete policies that  will help to mitigate climate change and to wean us from our dependence  on fossil fuels. I know it is possible because I have worked on  bipartisan efforts with my colleagues to advance clean energy and lower  greenhouse gas emissions.   Together, we have advanced technology innovation, fueled our Nation's  transportation with cleaner energy, bolstered our Nation's  infrastructure to be more resilient to climate impacts, offered  incentives for carbon capture sequestration, and boosted energy  efficiency. These are all accomplishments that we have done together,  but more needs to be done.   This Congress, as we consider a surface transportation  reauthorization package, as well as a new Water Resources Development  Act, would be foolish to ignore climate impacts as we spend taxpayer  dollars for infrastructure. We must seize the opportunity presented by  a clean energy economy to continue driving American innovation while  creating sustainable good-paying jobs.   Today our auto industry in Michigan is rapidly working to advance  electrification. Just last week, General Motors announced plans to add  400 jobs and invest $300 million to build a new electric car at their  Orion plant. But despite these efforts, our State and our country have  been hurt by the lack of a coherent, cohesive, and forward-looking  policy that grows our economy while protecting our environment.   We need a policy that ensures that renewable energy is produced here  in America and done in a way that creates jobs and strengthens our  national security. I know that we can do it if only we can find the  political will.   Together, we can effectively confront climate change in a way that  benefits Michigan workers and families, our Great Lakes, and the entire  country.   The science is clear, but time is not on our side. We must take  action now to confront climate change before it is too late. I urge my  colleagues to stop playing political games. Let's roll up our sleeves  and get to work on solving the climate change crisis together.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Anton Art Center in Mount Clemens, MI. I appreciate  the opportunity to recognize the efforts of the Anton Art Center to  fulfill their mission to enrich and inspire people of all ages through  the arts.   The Anton Art Center was established in 1969 by three members of the  Mount Clemens Art Association: Bea Wright, Gretchen Thompson, and  Phyllis Wickens. Upon its founding, they took over occupancy of the  then Mount Clemens Public Library to save the historical building from  demolition. The library was built by Andrew Carnegie in 1903 and opened  in 1904 and was one of approximately 2,500 libraries that Carnegie  funded throughout the world. The center converted the interior to  include three galleries, an art studio and meeting area, a pottery  studio and kiln room, and offices. In 2006, local businessman Gebran  Anton led a fundraising effort to expand the building with the addition  of a gift shop, an increase in gallery space, and more classroom space.  It is fitting that the center should occupy a Carnegie Library, a  beautifully designed building that is now listed in the State of  Michigan historic register.   The goals of the Anton Art Center are to present a wide array of  programming to appeal to diverse audiences, provide support for the  arts, and become a focal point for arts programming and work toward  inclusion, diversity, equity, and access in all they do. Through its  many programs, the Anton Art Center has become a leading advocate of  the arts and artists in Macomb County and throughout the surrounding  area. In addition to traditional artist exhibitions, the center offers  a multitude of programs for artists to showcase their work to the  public. There are multiple juried statewide competitions, as well as  two annual events that include the ART! Macomb Art Fair and holiday  market. The center's gift shop offers yet more opportunity for the  community to support local artists. The center also supports the  aspiring artist inside many of us by offering adult and child classes  in many mediums including clay, drawing, mixed media, photography,  weaving, and watercolor.   The Anton Art Center also serves as the Region 10A Re-granting Agency  for the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs, MCACA. As such,  they award mini-grants to nonprofit organizations, schools,  municipalities, and individual professional artists in Macomb and  Oakland Counties in support of arts and culture programming and  professional or organizational development. They also provide technical  assistance to organizations applying for funding through this program.   I am pleased to rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Anton Art Center. They have  been a staple of the arts and cultural scene in Macomb County for half  a century, and I wish them continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
