 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of seniors in  upstate New York.   This August, I joined a forum with AARP in New Paltz on the need to  address the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs in our communities.  I heard harrowing stories from seniors, many of whom are on fixed  income, who have seen the medication they rely on triple in price.   The system is working against our seniors. Right now, qualified  covered retirement accounts are included in determining income and  eligibility under the Medicare part D low-income subsidy program, and  this means seniors must choose between saving for retirement and  lifesaving medication.   Saving for retirement shouldn't jeopardize how low-income subsidies  for Medicare part D beneficiaries are distributed. That is why I joined  my colleagues in introducing H.R. 4655, the Enhancing Retirement  Security for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2019, to remove retirement  accounts from that determination and lower out-of-pocket costs for our  seniors.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4655.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise in support of my amendment to the SHIELD Act, which is  meant to keep foreign influences from depressing voter turnout in rural  communities.   Protecting our democracy and upholding the sanctity of our elections  is of critical importance.   Madam Chair, the SHIELD Act is urgently needed legislation. Americans  will go to the polls in a matter of weeks, and every day, we are  presented with more data that our foreign adversaries are working to  influence our elections and undermine our democracy.   These destructive tactics, as we have seen in previous election  cycles, continue to get more sophisticated, with outside parties now  manipulating our elections through the ballot box, social media, and  spreading misinformation.   My amendment fights against these tactics and requires an analysis,  following each Federal election, into whether or not illicit foreign  money was used to carry out disinformation or propaganda campaigns  focused on depressing turnout among rural communities.   The amendment also requires a breakdown of the successes or failures  of these efforts and recommendations for how we can address these  tactics in future elections.   Americans in rural communities face many hurdles to exercising the  right to vote, including the distance to the nearest poll. We cannot  add additional hurdles of foreign disinformation and its influence on  voter turnout.   There is nothing more important than protecting our democracy and  ensuring every American has the ability to vote and the opportunity to  make their voices heard.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would note to my friend that in order for  the FEC to enforce the law as you suggest, which I certainly believe  they ought to, it would help if they would have the data and the  information to do so and to be able to track down attempts to break the  law.   This would be exactly what we are trying to do with this amendment.  To speculate on who might--when, where, and how--be able to do this is  a waste of time when we know at this point that we are under siege.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would be more than happy to work with my  colleague to do whatever we can to deal with protecting our elections  and ensuring that they remain free and fair.   As I am sure the gentleman understands, representing a rural  district, too many folks in our communities are being left behind, and  they should not be left behind in the least bit when it comes to the  sanctity of our elections.   While we might be in a position where, unfortunately, partisanship  gets in the way of these issues, I will note that to simply say these  things won't become law is part of the problem. I think it is also  important to deconstruct why these things are not making their way into  law in the first place.   When people become overly partisan in this environment, we are at an  impasse, unfortunately. I am here to work beyond that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would like to note, to bring the  discussion back full circle, when my friend says that the FEC is  dysfunctional but began this conversation saying that it has the  responsibility to enforce election laws, those two points don't really  go hand in hand.   I think it is important that if we are going to make the FEC able and  capable of enforcing the laws that we know are critical to protecting  our democracy, then we should operate on the assumption of how we could  make the FEC as functional as possible and give the FEC data and  information to achieve its stated purpose.   I thank Chairwoman Lofgren for her leadership on this issue and urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put the protection of our  democracy over partisan division and pass both my amendment and the  underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
