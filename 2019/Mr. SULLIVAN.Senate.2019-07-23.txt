 Mr. President, this week, I have the opportunity  to introduce the U.S. Senate Small Business of the Week. Small  businesses provide essential services to our Nation's communities. In  my home State of Alaska, I have seen firsthand small businesses that  contribute to the local economy and step in when a community is in  need. It is my honor to name ChemTrack Alaska of Anchorage, AK, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   ChemTrack was founded as a construction company by Sig Jokiel in  1973. Shortly after its inception, the company shifted focus and  rebranded itself into an environmental services and engineering company  when Chuck Ronan joined the team in 1985. After studying business at  the University of New Hampshire, Sig's daughter, Carrie, joined the  company in 2002. Carrie, who became the company's majority partner in  2010, brought business expertise and project management skills to  ChemTrack. Throughout the company's 46-year history, it has contracted  with the U.S. Air Force, Alaska Railroad Corporation, Bureau of Indian  Affairs, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, BP, Exxon,  and many other government institutions and businesses. In 2019,  ChemTrack was awarded the Women-Owned Small Business of the Year Award  by the SBA in recognition of its outstanding achievements.   ChemTrack's commitment to developing creative environmental  engineering solutions enables the company to contribute to local  projects in Alaska's great outdoors. As a successful contractor and a  certified 8(a) economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business,  ChemTrack has completed projects for both private businesses and  government clients. ChemTrack helped clean up Alaska's shorelines after  the Exxon Valdez oilspill in 1989 by developing innovative, barge- mounted sweeps to clean sea water. As a testament to ChemTrack's  environmental stewardship, the company was awarded a basic ordering  agreement by the U.S. Coast Guard in 2012, enabling them to provide  containment cleanup and mitigate the harmful effects of oil spills and  hazardous substance incidents all over the state of Alaska.   Carrie is renowned as an advocate for small businesses at both the  Federal and State level. During her testimony in front of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship in June 2018, Carrie  discussed the SBA's contracting programs and provided insight on her  experience operating a woman-owned small business. As a graduate of the  SBA Emerging Leaders program, Carrie is very active in her community  and even mentors other Alaskan businesses through the Women's Power  League of Alaska. Carrie's distinction as a local leader is evidenced  by her inclusion in the Alaska  [[Page S5011]]  Journal of Commerce's Top 40 Under 40 list of 2014 and her selection as  the 2018 Enterprising Women of the Year Award.   Back home in Alaska, Carrie serves on the Associated General  Contractors board of directors, as well as the Boards for Women  Impacting Public Policy and the Alaska State Hockey Association. She  also completed a 6-year term with YWCA, where she served as president  for 2 years, and is a member of the Society of American Military  Engineers and National Contracting Management Association. Carrie's  abilities as an athlete complement her business skills. She was  inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame at the University of New  Hampshire in 2014 and served as an Ambassador for Women's Ice Hockey in  Fast and Female International Program.   ChemTrack has successfully pursued a two-pronged mission of profit  and stewardship. By employing its engineering proficiency to aid in  disaster recovery, ChemTrack has shown us what can be achieved when  individuals and businesses apply their specific skills to help better  their community.   ChemTrack has grown from a small construction company to a successful  environmental engineering contractor with a clear track record of  community involvement. I am honored to recognize Carrie and the entire  team at ChemTrack Alaska as the Senate Small Business of the Week, and  I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
