 Since World War II, 138,103 American soldiers have been  listed as prisoners of war, and 83,114 American soldiers have been  listed as missing in action. National POW/MIA Recognition Day was  created to honor the sacrifice of the men and women who were imprisoned  during wartime and to remember those brave soldiers who never returned  to American soil.   Today, we thank our heavenly Father for returning home those American  soldiers who found themselves confined on foreign soil, and we bow our  heads in prayer and remembrance of those still missing.   I ask the Members of this body and American citizens everywhere to  include these soldiers, their families, and their communities in your  prayers and to join me in thanks for the freedoms and liberties we  enjoy every day because of their sacrifice.                            ____________________
