 Madam Speaker, today the United States Department of  Agriculture published its long-awaited proposed rule to fix the Packers  and Stockyards Act to address institutional bias against small  livestock and poultry farmers.   For decades I have fought alongside our livestock and poultry farmers  to ensure their hard work is respected and standards exacted by their  processing firms were fair and honest. Unfortunately, small producers  have been taken advantage of, retaliated against, marginalized legally  in favor of larger meatpackers, swine contractors, and poultry  companies, and forced to swallow opaque contracts just to pay their  bills.   The proposed rule falls short to address their very serious  grievances. Once again, this administration is happy setting minimal,  powder-puff requirements that sidestep hardworking families in favor of  mega-business integrators.   Let us continue to work hard to improve the proposed rule to ensure  that those who feed America get a fair shake and are treated right by  all of America.                            ____________________
