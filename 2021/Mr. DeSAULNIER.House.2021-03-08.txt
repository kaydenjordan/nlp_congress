Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota,  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today, the Committee on Rules met and  reported House Resolution 188, providing structured rules for  consideration of H.R. 842, H.R. 8, and H.R. 1446.   For H.R. 842, the rule self-executes a manager's amendment by  Chairman Scott, makes in order 19 amendments, and provides for 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking  member of the Committee on Education and Labor.   For H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446, the rule makes in order eight and four  amendments, respectively, and provides 1 hour of debate for each bill  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.   The rule further provides en bloc authority and a motion to recommit  for each bill.   The rule also adds an additional minority member to the Select  Committee on the Climate Crisis.   Finally, the rule provides for recess instructions, suspension  authority, and same-day authority from March 13 through April 22, and  activates the Consensus Calendar.   Madam Speaker, this is the first time I have been able to be on the  floor and present in almost a year. A year ago, as some of you know, I  had an accident and proceeded to spend 6 weeks in the George Washington  University Hospital intensive care unit, 4 of those weeks on a  ventilator.   My sons came from California to be told by the doctors in a  windowless room at George Washington that I had about a 10 percent  chance of survival. The next day, they got a phone call, expecting to  hear that their dad had died. Instead, the doctor told them that I was  doing better.   Madam Speaker, I know that you know how grateful we are to have the  wonderful gift of life, to share it with our children, and to be here  in this sanctum sanctorum of American democracy. I am grateful. I am  grateful to my staff, to the providence of our creator, and to my  family.   Madam Speaker, our Nation is struggling, and not only because of the  coronavirus pandemic. Our Nation needs bold, meaningful changes to make  a real difference for average Americans. That is what the three bills  before us today do. Each addresses its own epidemic: gun violence;  inequality; and, unfortunately, an ugly part of human nature, greed.   Madam Speaker, nearly 40,000 people died from firearm injuries in the  United States in 2019. History would show that enacting smart,  evidence-based policies based on public health premises reduces this  sad phenomenon.   Madam Speaker, 22 percent of U.S. gun owners acquired their most  recent firearm without a background check. That means that millions of  Americans got millions of guns with no questions asked. Approximately  80 percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes are obtained  through private party transfers, which currently do not require  background checks.                                time  1615    Ninety-six percent of the inmates surveyed, who were prohibited from  possessing a firearm at the time they committed their crime, had  obtained their firearm from an unlicensed private seller, avoiding the  background check altogether.   In California, where I am proud to live and serve, all private gun  sales must be completed through a licensed firearms dealer, requiring a  background check--a universal background check and a mandatory waiting  period. Not coincidentally--and the public health experts will let us  know through their evidence-based research--California has the ninth- lowest rate of gun violence across the United States. Gun killings in  Connecticut, similarly, fell by 40 percent after it required a  mandatory background check and a gun safety course before the purchase  of a gun.  [[Page H1088]]    We know what we need to do to help protect millions of Americans.  Universal background checks are supported by decades of evidence. The  Bipartisan Background Checks Act, H.R. 8, institutes universal  background checks.   Additionally, the Enhanced Background Checks Act, H.R. 1446, ends the  arbitrary rule that if a background check hasn't been completed in 3  days, the gun can be sold regardless.   I proudly support these bills because the evidence is clear that they  will make our communities safer and save lives.   Madam Speaker, next, the rule will allow us to consider the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or the PRO Act. The rise in  inequality in this country has coincided with a decline in union  membership. By most estimates, declining unionization accounted for  about one-third of the increase in inequality--one-third--from 1980  through the 1990s through today.   If you watch the data over the years, as States move as a group  toward less union coverage, those same States have much worse income  inequality. You cannot address inequality without increasing access for  working people to representation. Unions do not only raise wages for  the workers they represent, but they have also been shown to moderate  the compensation of executives.   On top of the obvious benefits you think of that are associated with  the labor unions, like higher wages, safer workplaces, some of the  others that come along with union membership also help address the  inequities in our society.   Union workers are more likely to receive paid leave, are up to 28  percent more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance, and  are up to 54 percent more likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored  pensions. Not only do workers have better access to pensions, but their  employers contribute an average of 28 percent more toward those  pensions, retirement security for Americans, than nonunion employers.   As the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, I know that the  PRO Act simply updates labor law to ensure that workers in today's  economy are able to create and join labor unions to receive the same  kinds of protections they see in other sectors. Nothing more.   As President Eisenhower once said during the largest expansion of the  American economy in history, when labor unions had one-third of the  workforce: ``Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of  the right to join the union of their choice.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article  published in the March 3 USA Today titled: ``Congress renews gun safety  push with background check bills.''                       [From USA TODAY, Mar. 3, 2021]        Congress Renews Gun Safety Push With Background Check Bills                             (By Amanda Becker)         Congressional lawmakers this week revived an effort to       enact significant gun safety laws for the first time in more       than 25 years by introducing bills to establish a universal       background check system that has broad support from the       public.        The bills introduced Tuesday in the House and Senate would       extend current federal background check requirements to       transactions conducted by unlicensed and private sellers.        Legislation was reintroduced in Congress to extend       background checks to transactions conducted by private and       unlicensed gun sellers.        The gun safety group Giffords estimates that 22% of U.S.       gun owners purchased their last firearm without completing a       background check. Polling shows that more than 90% of       Americans support a universal background check system.        The measures are what gun safety advocates predicted would       be a first step in pursuing new gun laws now that Democrats       control the White House and both chambers of Congress. In       recent years, gun safety bills stalled even when they had       bipartisan public support, in part because Republican       Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not bring them up for       votes when he led the Senate from 2015 to 2021.        Rep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who chairs a       congressional gun violence prevention task force, on Tuesday       reintroduced bipartisan House legislation that would require       background checks for all firearm sales. The House first       passed the bill in 2019, one year after a mass shooting at       Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida,       left 17 dead.        ``Time and time again, we have seen that the American       people want universal background checks, in fact public       polling shows that the majority of people, Democrats,       Republicans and independents, support this,'' Thompson said       in a statement.        The Senate is evenly split between Democrats and       Republicans, and the measure would have to pick up bipartisan       support to pass that chamber given that most legislation must       clear a 60-vote threshold.        ``This Congress we will finally bring common sense gun       reforms up for a vote in the House and the Senate, and the       single most popular and effective proposal we can consider is       universal background checks,'' Murphy said in a video about       the effort.        When the House passed background checks legislation in       2019, the bill ran aground in the then Republican-controlled       Senate, where McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, did not bring       it up for a vote.        ``Now, with Senate Democrats in the Majority, we have the       opportunity to act on this overwhelmingly popular, lifesaving       legislation to protect American communities,'' Senate       Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on the       bill's introduction.        Advocates for new gun safety laws have hoped that with       President Joe Biden in the White House and Democrats       controlling the House and Senate, there is an opportunity for       action. The NRA is also grappling with multiple crises: New       York's attorney general is investigating whether its leaders       misappropriated more than $60 million for personal use, and       the NRA filed for bankruptcy in January. Its remaining       officials insist the organization remains solvent, and it       plans to reincorporate in Texas.        ``This is the moment,'' said Shannon Watts, the founder of       Moms Demand Action, a grassroots organization started in late       2012 that now has nearly 6 million supporters.        ``We have a trifecta and they have a mandate to act on       this. We have a grassroots army to support them and the NRA       is weaker than they've ever been,'' she added.        Already this week, Rep. Jim Clyburn, a key Biden ally from       South Carolina, reintroduced a bill that would close the so-      called ``Charleston loophole'' that allows firearm purchases       to move forward after three business days, even if a       background check has not been completed. It is named for the       2015 mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine died after       the gunman was able to purchase a firearm when the three-day       window expired.        Last month, to mark the third anniversary of the Parkland       shooting, Biden called for the passage of ``common sense''       gun safety laws. He cited a background checks bill among his       top priorities.        The last major law passed to curb gun violence was the       Federal Assault Weapons Ban enacted by Democratic President       Bill Clinton in 1994. But even that had a 10-year sunset       provision that has since expired. Several attempts to renew       it, including by President Barack Obama in 2013 after Sandy       Hook, all derailed in a Republican-controlled Senate.        Groups pushing for gun safety measures told The 19th       earlier this year that a background check bill would probably       be the starting point early in the Biden administration       because it has broader bipartisan support than other       measures. President Donald Trump acknowledged in 2019 that       there was a ``great appetite'' for such a proposal after mass       shootings in Ohio and Texas, as did McConnell, though he did       not go on to bring it up for a vote.        A ``red flag'' bill giving courts the power to temporarily       confiscate firearms from individuals deemed at risk or anti-      gun trafficking legislation could be taken up next, the       advocates said.        Biden advisers Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond met last       month with gun safety groups that included Everytown for Gun       Safety, Moms Demand Action, Giffords and Brady to discuss       background checks, the proliferation of so-called ``ghost''       guns (homemade firearms or those with serial numbers removed)       and violence intervention programs, the White House said.        Biden has also pledged to work with Congress to reauthorize       the Violence Against Women Act, which he worked on as a       senator in the 1990s. In 2019, the House approved a VAWA       provision to close the so-called ``boyfriend loophole'' that       allows current and former unmarried partners convicted of       abuse and stalking to continue to purchase firearms. That       effort also stalled in the Senate. Democratic House leaders       said this week they will be taking up VAWA reauthorization       later this month.     Madam Speaker, more than 90 percent of Americans  support a universal background check system. Passing this legislation  is simply common sense, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleague and friend on the Rules  Committee that we should enforce existing laws. In States like  California where we have universal background checks, we have seen that  gun violence has gone down, as I said in my earlier remarks. We have  also seen that 30 percent of the guns used in criminal activity are  actually imported into the State from other States.   To the previous comments that we need a national standard, that is  why we need a national standard. It doesn't mean that States like  California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts can't do these things, and  it is a good laboratory, as Justice Brandeis said, that States should  be the laboratory for innovation. We know these things work. So I would  agree that we should enforce and get the revenue, the existing law.   But clearly, eliminating the background checks loophole would help  make Americans safe.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have one comment. The idea of opinions in the  interpretation of the Second Amendment, there are 13 States, as I  understand it, right now, who have universal background checks. All of  them are working consistent with upholding the Second Amendment.  Californians who have a universal background check can go out and  legally buy a gun. It just decreases the number of deaths and injuries  when you have this kind of law, Madam Speaker.   So I agree with the gentleman who spoke and said it shouldn't be  about opinion. Neither of us decides what is constitutional in this  instance. The courts do, and the courts have allowed local and State  governments to implement these commonsense laws.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, a correction. The bill doesn't say  indefinitely for the background checks. It says 10 days with the  availability of an additional 10 days for a maximum of 20 days. So it  is not indefinite.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I would just like to point out that having a gun in your home  actually makes you more likely to be a victim of gun violence.   Of the over 40,000 Americans who lost their lives from gun violence  in 2018--the last year we have up-to-date statistics--two-thirds of  those were by suicide. This is one of the big contributing factors to  what are the so-called diseases of despair which happen everywhere in  this country right now in these difficult times, and it has gotten  worse under COVID. But the proximity to the guns actually leads to more  of an opportunity for people to be the victim of gun violence.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 18 Washington Post  editorial titled: ``Maryland just closed a gun loophole. The state is  safer for it.''                 [From The Washington Post, Feb. 18, 2021]      Maryland Just Closed a Gun Loophole. The State is Safer for it.                            (By Editorial Board)         Given America's lurid history of gun violence, it is       confounding that buyers can purchase firearms in some places       without background checks. It's even more astonishing that it       remains the case in a liberal stronghold such as Maryland,       which suffered its own recent trauma owing to a deranged       gunman bent on mass murder.        Lawmakers in Annapolis last week finally closed a loophole       in state law that waived background checks for buyers who       make private purchases of shotguns and rifles. Sales of       handguns as well as shotguns and rifles from licensed dealers       in Maryland have long been subject to mandatory checks       through a federal database, but long guns were exempted when       the transaction took place through private dealers, including       those at gun shows.        The Democratic-controlled legislature pushed through the       change this month by overriding a gratuitous veto cast last       year by Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, who made no public       argument to defend the loophole beyond the fact that he had       not proposed closing it. The change takes effect next month.        Gun rights advocates and their Republican allies in the       legislature characterized the legislation as an assault on       rural Maryland's way of life and a burden for hunters. In       fact, whatever (probably slight) inconvenience some sportsmen       might undergo because of the new law is outweighed by the       obstacle it may pose for buyers who have no business owning       firearms.        It does not take a feat of imagination to foresee an act of       gun violence carried out by someone who, stymied by a       background check conducted by a licensed dealer, turns to a       private seller instead. Less than three years ago, a gunman       nursing a grievance massacred five people and injured two       others on a rampage through the newsroom of the Capital       Gazette newspaper, in Annapolis. He used a shotgun. As it       happens, he passed a background check when he purchased it; a       previous conviction, in 2011, for criminal harassment, was a       misdemeanor, not serious enough to forbid the sale. Yet even       if he had been convicted of a felony, he might still have       obtained a weapon easily by seeking out a private dealer--      through an online inquiry, for instance. The chances that       such a gunman would now succeed are diminished in Maryland.        No legislative measure is foolproof, and none will reliably       defeat a determined gunman. The idea of gun control, rather,       is to build a matrix of laws that deter and detect       individuals who, were they to obtain a firearm, would pose a       threat to themselves or others. Maryland's new law advances       that cause.     Madam Speaker, this isn't about taking away the  rights of law-abiding Americans. Those claims are nonsense. This is  about protecting the lives of all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to my  friends and colleagues that, again, even Justice Scalia, in the Heller  majority decision, said that local and State governments could enact  reasonable gun violence protection laws.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a brief comment. In that same decision of Justice Scalia that I  mentioned earlier, he said that Second Amendment protections are not  unlimited, and that is the point of this bill. They have been done.  They have been done constitutionally, as I said, by 13 States. And they  statistically work.   I, too, have been robbed at gunpoint, but I didn't have to have a gun  to survive. That was providence and the San Francisco Police  Department.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On the last point, I would just say that in California, in  particular, in my district, having had multiple conversations with  teachers, their labor representatives, and superintendents, we are  getting schools back open, but we are doing it in a way to make sure  that it is done efficiently and safely for everyone, the students, most  particularly, their families, and their teachers.   We have come so far in this country, those of us who have listened to  the science and the Centers for Disease  [[Page H1093]]  Control. We just want to make sure it is done right, in the most  efficient, effective way for the kids.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague. Nicely done.   First, on the gun bills, of course, we are all respectful of the  Speaker pro tempore's courage and the experience that she has had. For  those of us who have had family members who have lost their lives  because of gun violence--my dad is buried over at Arlington. He is a  combat veteran from World War II who, a little over 30 years ago, took  his own life.   As we know, the tragedies of homicide, as the Speaker pro tempore  knows personally, and losing a loved one, as I know from losing a loved  one to suicide--suicide is two-thirds of the total of people who die-- both are awful.   All we are trying to do, at least in my mind, is listen to the  research, listen to the examples of other developed countries and other  States, and implement public health policy. It informs us that if we do  it, we will save lives and injuries, and we will save billions of  dollars that all of us pay for.   All of us respect the Constitution. We took an oath to it. All of us  respect the Second Amendment. We might not have all agreed if we were  there, but it is the law. The courts have allowed us to implement these  laws, and they work.   I really don't understand, and maybe it is because of my own personal  belief and also from my experience as a city council member, a mayor, a  member of the California Legislature, and now in Congress, why we don't  follow the research and the evidence that it saves lives, out of  respect for all those people who have lost their lives to gun violence.   Then, on the PRO Act, as a former member of a Teamsters union, that  job helped me to get through college when my dad had lost his job. I  loaded trucks. It was that union that provided me protection and enough  for myself and my coworkers.   When I moved to San Francisco, I didn't have any money. I got a job  in a hotel restaurant business, and I was in that local. Then, I was  able to save enough money to go open my own businesses.   There have been some comments that somehow this bill would hurt small  businesses. The reality is that people organize in environments where  their employer is not treating their employees appropriately.   We know the inequality that Ms. DeLauro talked about, this historic  inequality that is strangling our country and hurting so many working  Americans, destroying the middle income that we have all benefited  from, that opportunity to move up and to give to our kids something  better than we had. That is the legacy of this country, and labor  unions are a big part of that, and entrepreneurs and individual  business owners are a big part of that. But it is the balance between  these two.    As John Kenneth Galbraith said a long time ago, and he wrote a boring  book about this, but it is interesting: Wages and capital have to have  countervailing institutions. They have to balance each other.   As my friend from Minnesota said, it is a balance. Right now, after  50 years of attacks, starting with President Reagan, the working people  in this country don't have the voice they once had. That not only hurts  them and their kids; it hurts all of us.   When you have a robust middle class, and you have workers represented  appropriately and proportionately, the country grows; there is more  money to spend in businesses like mine; and there is a camaraderie,  having teamwork. A good employer knows that, whether they have a  unionized workforce or a nonunionized workforce.   Your employees are what make your business work. That is what gives  you goodwill. That is what Americans took so much pride in, in the  1950s and 1960s, after World War II, after we had come to the great  country we were after World War II, with a middle class that no one has  ever seen on this planet. Since then, we have eroded that middle class.   The one most important thing to improve our economy is to give  working Americans a voice. Let them join together. Let it be fair. A  good employer will respect that and work with that.   As Eisenhower said, as I quoted in my opening, only a fool would try  to keep a working American from organizing into a union.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 188         At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 19. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       682) to encourage local educational agencies to resume in-      person instruction at elementary and secondary schools, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and Labor. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit. If the Committee of the       Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on       the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 20. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
