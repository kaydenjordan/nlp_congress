 Mr. Speaker, I rise here to protest the deaths that  are occurring, protest the horrible situation that our President has  put upon us.   I include in the Record a letter that I have received from the  University of California at Davis, and the Mayor of the City of Davis,  California, who have so clearly laid out the impact that the  immigration ban and the ban on refugees has put upon the university and  the community.    [From Ralph J. Hexter, Interim Chancellor, University of California                Davis, and Robb Davis, Mayor, city of Davis]         We have over 5000 international students and scholars at UC       Davis, many of whom are actively questioning what future       actions by this administration might mean for them. This is       an incredibly disorienting time for all our international       guests.        Here are some specific cases that illustrate challenges       that students and scholars all over the country are facing at       this time. These are specific to our community. (Note: as you       know, F-1 status is for students at any degree level       authorized to study in the US at accredited universities. J-1       can refer either to students or scholars in the US Visitor       Exchange Program)        1. A former J-1 scholar from Iran is in the US arranging       the move of his wife and son, while awaiting green card       processing. He was to have left the US for final interviews       and processing but is now uncertain. He has an appointment in       UC Davis' Plant Sciences Department.        2. An Iranian PhD student who was to have started at UC       Davis this spring (he was accepted), recently obtained his       visa, was to arrive in March, 2017, to start classes April 4.       His ability to start then is now in doubt. In addition, his       proposed roommate, who is already here from Iran, was       counting on him to share expenses. This person now finds       himself in a difficult situation.        3. An Iranian F-2 (spouse of F-1) is concerned about her       ability to change to F-1 status to become a student. She has       been accepted at UC Davis.        4. An Iranian student applying for a Master's program in       Engineering at UC Davis is asking about whether she should       continue her application process.        5. The spouse of an F-1 student (F-2 status) is currently       stuck outside the US and unable to be reunited with her       family.        6. An Iranian F-1 PhD student, who started in Fall 2016       quarter had invited his father to visit. This student has a       sister with two children in the US and she and they are       American citizens. The father/grandfather had a visa       interview scheduled in Yerevan, Armenia for February 8th so       he could come on a tourist visa to visit the student son and       daughter and grandchildren. His visa interview has now been       canceled. Attached are the pictures of the two grandchildren       he will not be able to see. He has not been able to see his       daughter for five years.        7. Scholar advisors at UC Davis are being asked by scholars       of these countries if it is safe to travel within the USA.       The fact that scholars must ask this shows the fear that       exists.        8. Departmental staff is questioning whether to admit       students or invite scholars from these countries for summer       and fall arrivals. There is much confusion.        9. A high profile scholar from one of the countries (his       profile might put him at risk) was set to come to UC Davis to       do research on responses to humanitarian abuses in his       country. Because of the order, UC Davis was not permitted to       provide him with documentation necessary to obtain a visa.       These stories were gathered in the past 5 hours WITHIN the       City of Davis and the University. We are a small city of       65,000.        The fact that Iranians are the main nationality represented       comes as no surprise. UC Davis and the City of Davis are home       to many Iranians and have been for a generation at least. The       fact that the Trump Administration can point to NO attacks by       Iranians on US soil or against US interests makes their       exclusion seem particularly arbitrary and cruel to us.                                   ____                Mayor Davis' Letter to Garamendi on Muslim Ban                        (By Vanguard Administrator)         Representative Garamendi: Thanks for your interest in the       challenges the City of Davis and UC Davis are facing in light       of President Trump's executive order restricting entry for       citizens from 7, predominantly-Muslim nations. UC Davis has       87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with       unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and       workers with permanent residency living in our City.        In addition, the following shows the large numbers of       students and scholars from other predominantly Muslim       countries currently at UC Davis. While these countries are       not covered by the current Executive Order, students and       scholars from them are very concerned about their future       status and ability to travel home or receive visitors from       home.        1. Bangladesh: 14 students, 9 scholars        2. Egypt: 14 students, 7 scholars        3. Indonesia: 147 students, 1 scholar        4. Malaysia: 49 students, 6 scholars        5. Morocco: 4 students, 1 scholar        6. Nigeria: 4 students, 2 scholars        7. Pakistan: 18 students, 14 scholars        8. Turkey: 31 students, 9 scholars        Beyond these numbers we have over 5000 students and       scholars at UC Davis, many of whom are actively questioning       what future actions by this administration might mean for       them. This is an incredibly disorienting time for all our       international guests.

Finally, I wanted to share with you a joint statement from       Interim Chancellor Ralph Hexter and me to our campus and       community. Thanks for helping us get the word out on the       challenges that we are facing in light of the Executive       Order.        A message to the community on the immigration executive order:         Our city and university host over 5,000 international       students, faculty members and scholars, as well as their       families. Many of them come from nations with majority Muslim       populations. These are our neighbors, friends and colleagues.       They have faces and stories we know well. They contribute in       myriad ways to our community and our university. They are       part of us. We are deeply concerned by the impact of the       recent executive order that restricts the ability of       students, faculty, staff and other members of our community       from certain countries to return to the United States if they       are currently traveling or plan to travel abroad. The threat       of the order and the order itself are already having impacts       on people in our town and university, on their academic,       professional and personal lives.  [[Page H929]]         We understand it is the federal government's role to       maintain the security of the nation's borders. However, this       executive order's impact on our friends and colleagues is       inconsistent with the values of our community. It has created       uncertainty and fear that hurts the University of California,       Davis, and the city of Davis.        We have long been deeply enriched by students, faculty,       scholars and health care professionals from around the       world--including the affected countries--coming to study,       teach, research and make our lives richer and better. Any       effort to make these valuable members of our community feel       unwelcome is antithetical to our mission of expanding       learning and generating new knowledge. Nothing, however, will       cause us to retreat from the shared principles of community       we have developed together, and to all of our friends from       here and abroad, you have our commitment to welcome you.            Sincerely,      Ralph J. Hexter,        Interim Chancellor.      Robb Davis,        Mayor, city of Davis.     It is a terrible situation, but I do want to----   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Banks of Indiana). The time of the  gentleman from Maryland has expired.    I will just finish this up very quickly. I think we  need to look to where this problem emanates. It emanates from the  President's adviser, Mr. Bannon. He has been at this for some time  talking about the nature of America being a White nationalist nation.  So if we look beyond the horror that this ban places, we need to look  to where it emanates, Mr. Bannon, clearly this comes from him, and we  need to focus our attention on what he has done to this Nation's  values.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
