 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of announcing the  schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, the House will meet next Monday at noon for morning hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business.  At 9 p.m. the House and Senate will assemble for a joint session to  receive President Biden's address on the State of the Union. Members  should be seated in the House Chamber by 8:25 p.m.   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and 12  p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   We will be considering several bills under suspension of the rules  during the week. The complete list of suspension bills has been posted  on the Clerk's website.   Next week, the House is expected to consider a number of bills under  rules: H.R. 185, to terminate the requirement imposed by the Director  of CMS for proof of COVID-19 vaccination for foreign travelers and for  other purposes.   H.R. 185 rescinds the Biden administration's vaccine requirement on  travelers who are coming to visit the United States.   The House is also expected to consider H.J. Res. 26, disapproving the  District of Columbia's City Council revised Criminal Code Act of 2021.  H.J. Res. 26 makes it clear that Congress does not approve of the City  Council's radical decision to reduce penalties for a variety of crimes,  including many violent crimes.   Finally, we expect to consider H.J. Res. 24, disapproving the action  of the District of Columbia's City Council in approving the Local  Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022. What this resolution  would do is reverse the decision by the D.C. Council that would allow  illegal aliens to vote.   As we all know, our southern border has been wide open under  President Biden. Millions of people have come into our country  illegally, and he continues to keep that border open. We have talked  about bringing legislation to this floor, which we are working on in  committee, to secure America's border.   But, in the meantime, the idea that allowing people that are here  illegally to vote here, not only undermines one of our most sacred  rights in the United States, but it also sends the wrong message to  those who are seeking to come into our country illegally.   We need President Biden to close the southern border, secure the  southern border, get back to a legal process of immigration. That is  what H.J. Res. 24 would do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark), my friend, the new majority--minority whip of the House.    Mr. Speaker, what I would first say to the American  people is, thank you for giving the Republicans the House majority to  finally stop this mad rush toward socialism that we have seen in the  last 2 years by the Biden administration: the taxing; the spending; the  out-of-control policies that have led our country into one of the worst  economic times we have ever seen. Inflation through the roof to the  point where families can't even afford to put gasoline in their car.  Inflation through the roof to the point where families can't even go to  the grocery store and buy all the things that they would want. That is  what the American people surely were fed up with.   The good news is, as I thank them for giving the Republicans the  majority, which they did in the last election, Republicans have already  gone to work delivering for those families. We have actually brought-- it is interesting, as the gentlewoman talks about scoring points, we  have scored a number of points for those American people to the point  where we have actually had a number of Democrats vote with us.    The bills that were called partisan just 2 weeks ago--we brought a  bill to the floor to say, on energy, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  which is supposed to be America's security blanket in case there is  some major disruption with American energy supply. I am not talking  about the disruption we have seen from President Biden's attack on  American energy, which has been so severe that it has made our country  dependent on foreign nations again, which is unconscionable, when we  can produce our own energy, cleaner, better than anybody else in the  world.   But it said, if you are going to raid, Mr. President, that Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, you certainly can't do it  [[Page H653]]  to sell it to China. It was called partisan when we filed it. What is  interesting is a majority of Democrats actually voted for that  legislation, and it is now over in the Senate.   I hope it ends up on President Biden's desk. I hope he signs it. But  if he vetoes it, there was a veto-proof majority that passed that bill.   We just brought a piece of legislation a few minutes ago on to the  floor to reject the ills of socialism; not just what we are seeing here  in the United States socialist movement that has been damaging to our  economy, but all throughout time, so many examples of socialist  dictators killing millions and millions of people.   I am glad to say a majority of Democrats joined with us to vote for  that bill. It is still a little bit shocking that 86 Democrats were not  willing to stand up against the ills of socialism and that, I would  consider, an extreme position, but clearly, there is still work to be  done.   The American people, I am sure, will continue to engage their Members  of Congress on those issues, but we are also going to continue to move  policies to help families who are struggling; energy policies,  obviously, and there is more to come on that.   The Energy and Commerce Committee just got constituted. They are  working now on a good energy security package. The Natural Resources  Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are doing  the same thing.   I had mentioned to the gentlewoman earlier, on the border, as we  would like to see real security from our southern border. I hope  President Biden, when he is speaking from the podium here in just a few  days, will address that problem.   More people have come into our country illegally under President  Biden's watch than the entire population of the State of New Mexico.  Where it has caused real damage is more than 100,000 young kids, our  young kids, have died because of drug overdoses from drugs like  fentanyl because the drug cartels in Mexico now have operational  control of America's southern border. That is disgraceful.   That is all brought on by President Biden's policies. He could end  those today through executive action; reverse the things that he did  that created the problem. He won't do that, so I do think it is  important that this Congress take that action.   We still wait for the President to do it on his own, but we are not  going to stand by. We will take our own action and show the country how  we can get a secure southern border. I hope that would be a bipartisan  vote when we bring that to the floor.   The 87,000 IRS agents--I don't know of any Member of Congress--I  would love to hear from any of them--who have gotten phone calls from  their constituents saying please double the size of the IRS.   Now, what they have said is please get Federal employees back to work  because some people--I have got constituents that have been waiting 2  years for their tax return and, yet, you have still got about half of  the Federal workforce that is working remotely, not coming into work.   I have got veterans who call my office all the time who can't get  their benefits that they earned. They showed up for work, by the way,  they showed up and said I am going to go defend the rights of this  country, and some of them got injured. Some of them are trying to get  their benefits today and can't because some of those people working,  getting their full salary at the VA, are not showing up for work.   People that are waiting for passports to go visit loved ones overseas  can't get their passports processed because some Federal employees feel  they should get their full salary but not show up for work.   So we brought a bill this week to say you should show up for work. It  seems pretty basic. It is unfortunate that there were less than a  handful of Democrats that joined with us to do that.   So we are addressing the needs of those families who are struggling.  Some of those votes have been bipartisan; some haven't. But we are  going to continue to address them because they are bipartisan issues  for America, even if they are not bipartisan in this Chamber and,  hopefully, that improves over time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark).    Mr. Speaker, the good news is, we not only have already  brought some bills to achieve cost savings, we are going to continue to  bring bills to achieve cost savings. In one example, the gentlewoman  referred to a piece of legislation that deals with drug prices, and it  was failed to mention that part of what that bill did was limit about  40 percent of lifesaving drugs to come to market.   We are already seeing right now a reduction in R&D and drugs being  developed to cure new diseases because many of those countries that  have government-fixed pricing also don't have many of the lifesaving  drugs that America has because of that very policy.                                time  1300    I am curious to see which lifesaving drugs they don't want to have on  the market in America anymore. You can go to Canada, you can go to  France, and you can see a long list, unfortunately, of drugs that you  can't get in those countries that you can get in America that save  lives every day.   That bill also raised taxes to the tune of over a trillion dollars on  Americans. It raised spending to the tune of over a trillion dollars in  America. That has increased inflation.   The biggest concern I hear from families who want cost savings is to  stop the mad spending in Washington. It has not only caused them to  have to pay more for everything they buy, it has literally taken a  paycheck a year--at least one month's pay a year--out of their pockets  because of all of the spending we have seen in the last 2 years in  Washington. Our constituents just want Congress to try to rein in that  spending.   In fact, we brought another bill this week. We can talk about D.C.,  we can talk about other places, but all across America, most Americans  are saying, let's get back to our lives, let's end this COVID  emergency. We announced last week that we were going to bring a bill  during this week to end the COVID emergency.   What was interesting was, after we took the lead, President Biden  himself actually acknowledged that it does need to end, but he said he  wants to wait until May to do it. What is interesting about waiting  until May is it allows the Federal Government to continue spending  billions and billions of dollars under the guise of COVID that has  absolutely nothing to do with COVID, like paying people not to work.   Millions of people today are able-bodied, fully capable of working,  but because of the waiving of things, like welfare-to-work  requirements, where people can right now get $25,000, $35,000  [[Page H654]]  a year to sit at home and not work, well, you know what that does. We  want to reverse that policy. If somebody is capable of working, they  should be working.   We believe in a social safety net for people. If somebody comes on  hard times, that is why you have programs there.   We are in America. If you want to stay at home and not work, that is  your right. Just don't ask that hardworking taxpayer, the single mom  who is working two jobs, to pay for you to stay at home.   The Biden administration policies that pay millions of people to stay  at home from work undermines Social Security because those are millions  of people who our seniors are counting on to be in the workforce. These  people are fully capable of being in the workforce paying into Social  Security so that those who work their whole lives and earn that benefit  can have confidence that it will be there for them.   When you have millions of people being paid by the Federal Government  to stay home, of course it adds trillions to our deficit, but it also  takes billions of dollars out of Social Security that we want to put  back in. We want to shore up Social Security, but President Biden has  undermined it with these policies that pay people not to work.   Our bill would end that immediately. Let's get those people back to  work who are fully capable of working. Let's shore up Social Security  immediately. We shouldn't have to wait more and more months like  President Biden said he would want to do. Of course, if we didn't file  that bill, he probably never would have wanted to end that emergency.   Hopefully, as we continue to lead, we will see the President follow  along. We welcome him to join us in saving this country and getting the  country back on track, so we will continue to bring bills to address  those many problems our country is facing.    I earlier pointed out, I reject what President Biden did  to undermine Social Security. In their discussions about the debt  ceiling yesterday, Speaker McCarthy discussed with President Biden what  Republicans are hoping to do. Frankly, I think most Americans have been  hungry for us here in Washington to have the same adult conversation  that they have been having at their kitchen tables for years as to how  we can actually get spending under control in Washington.   We have talked about the problems of paying people not to work. It  not only adds to our deficit and debt; it also undermines Social  Security. Let's get people back to work who are fully able-bodied.   Let's talk about the Nation's credit card. The debt ceiling is a  symptom of Washington's spending problem. According to Treasury, we are  approaching in June the end of extraordinary measures where the Nation  would exceed its debt limit. What that means for a family is: Families  have credit cards. The credit card has a limit, a maximum amount you  can spend. Many families would not like to spend up to that limit. Some  like to pay their credit card off fully at the end of the month. Many  don't have that luxury, so they watch what the maximum is so they know,  okay, if I have got $300 before I hit it, I am not going to spend 300  bucks, because then the card will be declined.   Well, if you max out the card, which Biden has done in his last 2  years, $6 trillion minimum--those are the conservative estimates; some  estimates go as high as $10 trillion that President Biden has racked up  on the Nation's credit card. The $31.3 trillion maximum on the Nation's  credit card has been hit by President Biden and the Democrat majority's  spending the last 2 years.   Interestingly, when they were doing that spending, they didn't  account for raising the cap on spending when they were spending the  money. They pushed that off on us, so now we have to confront this  problem that they created.   The conversation really should be focused on how we stop this from  happening, how we stop maxing out the Nation's credit card. If a family  maxed out their credit card, of course they would pay the minimum  payment; of course they would pay the must-dos.   Again, Speaker McCarthy has made it very clear, we are fully  committed to Social Security and those promises that have been made.   Why is it that the first thing President Biden threatens is Social  Security?   A dollar is coming into the Federal Government; $1.29 is going out.  That is the spending problem. If you really want to break it down in  raw numbers, for every dollar the Federal Government takes in, it  spends $1.29. Very few families sustain themselves on that kind of  trajectory.   What we are saying is why don't we try to figure out, Republicans and  Democrats--by the way, this shouldn't be a partisan exercise. Both  sides should want to say if a dollar is coming in, how do we make sure  that only a dollar goes out? That is not where we are today. Let's have  that conversation. It is a responsible conversation to have.   In the meantime, let's make sure we are paying our debts and talking  about how we can make reforms so we don't keep maxing out the Nation's  credit card. That is what this debt ceiling discussion is about.   If we just give the President a blank check, which he asked for--he  is not going to get it; nobody should just get a blank check, give me  more money so they can just go spend more money--that is not  responsible.  [[Page H655]]    Let's figure out how we can stop the Federal Government from  continuing to max out the Nation's credit card. There is no better time  to have that discussion than after President Biden has maxed out the  Nation's credit card.   We will have that conversation, and I think we can get to an  agreement where both sides come together and say this is a problem we  need to tackle together. Previous Presidents have done that, Republican  and Democrat, working with Congresses of the other party. I think we  can have that conversation.    Again, I think most of America has been saying it is about time  Washington finally starts having that conversation because families  have been having that conversation at their kitchen tables for decades  and generations.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate you bringing up a number of  constituencies that we need to fight to help.   Let's start with the people that have been struggling the most. The  lower- and middle-income families, they have been struggling the most  in the last 2 years. They thrived like never before during those Trump  years that are being decried by the left.   Why did we see such growth from lower- and middle-income families  into the middle class and into higher income categories?   Because we actually cut taxes so that we could be competitive as a  Nation again and create millions of jobs. We actually created millions  of jobs by cutting taxes and making our country competitive, and not  keeping money in Washington, but actually freeing up power so that  people could control their own destiny again. Those people did take  control of their own destiny.   Again, we were losing our middle class during the Obama years. We  were seeing great American companies leave America. You can get the  list of them. It is a long list, unfortunately. Let's reverse that.  Let's fight for those forgotten men and women.   The millionaires and billionaires have their attorneys and their  accountants and all the folks on the left who took care of those  millionaires and billionaires. How about we start fighting for those  people who were left behind--because they were being left behind. We  said, let's make a tax code that is competitive for them.   If you go back and look--and the good news is there is real data now.  You don't have to wonder about it. You can throw away the talking  points about the rich that are always thrown out there.   The income groups that benefited the most from those tax cuts were  the lower- and middle-income groups, and millions of people became part  of the middle class who were left behind. Those are the facts. The data  is out there.   Some people are angry about that because they still want to live in  this false universe where they just decry tax cuts because that takes  power away from Washington. I think that is what scares the left so  much, is when they see people being empowered again to be free to  control their own destiny. Not bureaucrats and autocrats in Washington  taking their money and then telling them what they can get back.  Telling them how high they can go.   How about you break the ceilings and just let people go out and  succeed and give them the tools to do it. If you want to go out and  work and succeed and achieve the American Dream, it is there for  everybody. We restored that again.   By the way, some of those tax cuts expire. I hope the gentlewoman and  their side will join with us in continuing to keep that tax structure  in place so those middle-income folks can continue to grow and thrive,  but also for our seniors.   This is where the President, I think, is looking for ideas on how we  can start living within our means again. As I will refresh, as the  gentlewoman talked about, spending that has already been done and  leverage and full faith and credit to the United States, none of that  would even be a discussion point today, if--as the Democrats, when they  had the House, Senate, and White House for 2 years, and spent over $6  trillion of money we don't have--they also would have addressed the  debt ceiling at that time, we wouldn't be standing in this spot.   We literally took the majority weeks ago and the Nation has already  hit its debt ceiling because of the spending; not by President Trump,  he actually addressed the debt ceiling as we were putting policies in  place that grew our economy and created a middle class again. That was  already done.   Over the last 2 years, over $6 trillion in spending, but no time  seemed to be  [[Page H656]]  available to address the debt ceiling. So here we are. We are willing  to have a discussion about how to get control over spending. There are  really good ideas. In fact, many of these ideas will strengthen Social  Security for our seniors.   I talked a little bit earlier about getting people that are being  paid not to work back into the workforce. That will strengthen Social  Security. How about we restore some of the work requirements that used  to be there?   This goes back to Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who signed those work  requirements. It helped get more people into the workforce. It helped  give them a chance to achieve the American Dream, but it also  strengthened Social Security. When the government is paying people not  to work, they are not paying into Social Security. That undermines the  program. We should be wanting to strengthen it.    By the way, there is also a long list, and we are going to be getting  these lists out. I hope Democrats will go down this menu, and say,  okay, we agree paying people tens, if not hundreds, of billions of  dollars to get tax credits who don't even have Social Security numbers,  who don't even live in America. If a tax credit is there, it is there  for people who pay taxes, not for people who manipulate the system  because, for whatever reason, this administration won't even verify a  Social Security number. Just doing that verification would save tens,  if not hundreds, of billions of dollars--we are talking about real  money.   Those things could all help. These aren't cuts to things, these are  savings for fraud; real fraud, waste, and abuse that equals hundreds of  billions of dollars. We have been outlining these things. I haven't  found any takers yet, but I am not going to give up. I think eventually  we will get a lot of takers on the other side who will recognize this  is something we all need to come together and do because there is no  reason that the families who are working hard should be paying for  somebody else to cheat the system. There are many, many examples.   We will continue to highlight them. We will actually bring bills to  address those exact problems. All of that should be a part of this  discussion so we don't keep maxing out the Nation's credit card.   Again, nobody just says, here, if their kid maxed out the card, they  are not just going to give them a new card and say, go max out the next  one. They are going to sit down and have an adult conversation about  how you don't put the country in this situation again.    Mr. Speaker, I would say on that, you can go look at the  tax cuts. After those taxes were cut, the Federal Government took in  more money than it has ever done in the history of the country because  more people were working, and lower- and middle-income people were  making higher wages, lifting those at the bottom into the middle class,  which was evaporating under the Obama years.   The data is very clear on that. Those tax cuts actually brought more  money into the Federal Treasury. If anybody wants to dispute it, I  challenge them to go to President Biden's Treasury website and find the  numbers because they are there.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  enjoyed our first of many of these colloquies. As we look toward  hearing from the President, which we welcome together into this  Chamber, I look forward to working with the President to address these  problems our country is facing so we can get the country back on track  and focus on the challenges ahead. There will be many more  conversations we will have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on next Monday, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
