 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a woman whose  voice and whose soul truly was larger than life.   Aretha Franklin was known, first and foremost, as a singer, and what  a singer she was. For so many of us, her voice provided a soundtrack to  the highs and lows of our lives.    A couple of things happened on April 29, 1967. For one, it was my  17th birthday. For another, that was the day Aretha Franklin released  ``Respect.'' Let me tell you, that song felt like a gift that day, and  it has felt like a gift every time I have heard it ever since. Her  voice really was a gift, not just to me but to the whole world. She won  18 Grammys, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, was the 1994 Kennedy  Center Honors awardee, and was the first woman inducted into the Rock  and Roll Hall of Fame. She was the recipient of the highest civilian  honor in the United States, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A panel  of music experts convened by Rolling Stone magazine in 2008 named her  the greatest singer of all time--not bad for a preacher's daughter from  Detroit.   All those awards are important; however, they don't begin to measure  how she made us feel. I will never forget the 2015 Kennedy Center  Honors, which saluted my friend and singer-songwriter Carole King.  Aretha strolled onstage in her jewels and her furs, and she was pure  magic. Her soulful rendition of ``Natural Woman'' made Carole King  dance in her seat, and she made President Obama tear up. Those final,  magnificent notes--when she tossed her coat on the stage and raised her  arms in triumph--brought every single person in that audience to their  feet, including me.   Her voice was remarkable--so remarkable, in fact, that in 1986 the  Michigan Legislature declared it to be a precious natural resource.  That remarkable voice of hers wasn't limited to songs, however. Aretha  also used her voice--sometimes loudly, sometimes quietly--to speak up  for justice and to make a difference in Detroit and across the country.  That is probably no surprise, given her roots.   Aretha was the daughter of Pastor C.L. Franklin of New Bethel Baptist  Church in Detroit, and she first found her soulful voice singing and  playing the piano in church and in other places in Detroit. The  Reverend Franklin was active in the civil rights movement, alongside  leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Aretha was there to  fund the work. Her longtime friend, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, shared  his memory with the Detroit Free Press last week:         When Dr. King was alive, several times she helped us make       payroll. On one occasion, we took an 11-city tour with her as       Aretha Franklin and Harry Belafonte . . . and they put gas in       the vans. She did 11 concerts for free.    He added:         Aretha has always been a very socially conscious artist, an       inspiration, not just an entertainer.    We certainly know this in Michigan, where she was named the  Michiganian of the Year in 2003 and was awarded the Detroit News's  Lifetime Achievement Award in June. According to Pastor Robert Smith,  Jr., of New Bethel Baptist, a few times a year, Aretha would send the  church checks--big ones, not small ones. That was in addition to her  annual free concerts featuring famous gospel singers and free holiday  meals.   Speaking of food, Aretha's generous support of food banks in Metro  Detroit was one reason she was named the 2008 MusiCares Person of the  Year. Her generosity literally fed Detroit families, and her music fed  the world's souls.   I was personally honored to have the opportunity to be with Aretha on  many occasions. I was particularly honored to have the opportunity to  introduce her a year ago, in June 2017, when she gave her last concert  in Detroit, MI, at the Detroit music festival. I know I am not the only  person who can say that no matter the song, no matter the temperature,  when I hear Aretha sing, I get chills.   The world has lost a legend; however, the world can take comfort in  the fact that Aretha will always be with us. In her voice, Aretha was  given an amazing gift. Her gift to us was sharing it, and we are very  grateful.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
