 Mr. Speaker, on this day in 1944, at 10:18 p.m., a  cargo vessel exploded at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine located in my  district in California, resulting in the deadliest home-front disaster  of World War II.   All of the men loading ammunition at the site that day were African  American. When the surviving sailors, understandably, hesitated to  return to those unsafe conditions of loading, 50 were discriminately  convicted of mutiny.   Congress and the administration have repeatedly recognized the  injustice these men suffered. Congress directed the creation of a  memorial, the executive branch pardoned one of the 50, and the then- Secretary of the Navy said he strongly supported executive action in  favor of the Port Chicago 50.   To commemorate this anniversary, the House of Representatives passed,  just this week, our measure that directs the Secretary of the Navy to  finally exonerate the Port Chicago 50.   On the 75th anniversary today of the explosion, let us remember the  words of Thurgood Marshall when he traveled to San Francisco to defend  these innocent men. The future first African American Supreme Court  Justice said:         What is at stake here is more than the rights of the Port       Chicago 50. It is the moral commitment stated in our Nation's       creed.                            ____________________
