 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the passage of the  Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act.   Today, the Bonneville Shoreline Trail extends over 100 miles and will  one day go from the Idaho border to Nephi, Utah, over 280 miles.  Unfortunately, the vision is limited in some areas, and my bill would  fix this problem and support its completion.   In particular, my bill would release very small and targeted parcels  of wilderness, often where the trail already has been constructed, and  in turn designate other more deserving lands for protection. This win- win ensures the protection of this area while allowing for the trail to  exist in appropriate areas without wilderness characteristics.   This commonsense approach is why my bill is supported by Utah's  Governor, the entire Utah delegation, multiple surrounding local  governments, Trails Utah, the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Committee,  Outdoor Alliance, The Trust for Public Land, IMBA, and, most  importantly, my grandson Jett, who is an avid bike rider on this trail.   With the rapid growth in and around Salt Lake City, it is more  important than ever to support new recreation opportunities such as the  Bonneville Shoreline Trail.
