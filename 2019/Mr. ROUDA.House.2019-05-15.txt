 Madam Speaker, I rise today to shed light on PFAS  contamination, a crisis affecting water systems that serve upward of 19  million people across our great country.   For decades, manufacturing companies have known that these chemicals  are extremely hazardous to human health, have actively taken steps to  bury unfavorable research, and have used false uncertainty to fight off  regulations that could help ensure public safety.   That is why I introduced H.R. 2570, the PFAS User Fee Act, to hold  chemical manufacturers financially accountable for their role in this  contamination crisis. These manufacturers must take responsibility for  their role in this crisis and contribute to the solution.   Congress must finally hold these polluters accountable for the harm  they continue to cause. The safety of our water systems and the air we  breathe is at stake.                            ____________________
