 Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent to use three  easels rather than the two prescribed in Senate rules.    Mr. President, I am glad that I am rising after my  colleague from Alaska because I am rising on behalf of a group of very  special people and also in commemoration of three very special dates.  The group of people are 364 nominations for military appointments who  have been pending for months and months and months on the floor of the  U.S. Senate; and I rise in their honor with the intention, in a few  minutes, to begin offering unanimous consent motions so that they may  finally be confirmed to the positions they have earned through their  sacrifice in the uniform of this country.  [[Page S5447]]    I also rise to commemorate three special days: November 9, November  10, and November 11. November 9, today, is Military Day in Alabama,  designated by Governor Kay Ivey about 10 days ago, recognizing the deep  connection between Alabama and our Nation's military mission. Governor  Ivey asked all who were veterans or in Active Duty to wear their  uniforms today. She asked employers to encourage that to happen. And  she said that this day--Thursday, November 9, 2023--in the State of  Alabama should be a day where we commemorate our Active Duty and  veterans.   When I saw that today had been designated Military Day in Alabama, I  was interested in that, and I wondered whether that was the case in  other States as well. It turns out, no, that it is not. I hope it might  be a trend that other Governors pick up on in future years.   The second day that I want to acknowledge is tomorrow, November 10,  which is the Marine Corps' 248th birthday. I offer this one with a  little bit of parental pride because my oldest son was a marine  infantry commander who is now a marine reservist.   The Marine Corps was founded on November 10, 1775, when, at the  Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, there was enacted the  creation of this corps of marines. And almost immediately, the effort  began to recruit marines to fulfill the Continental Congress's mandate.  And the recruitment began at a tavern, Tun Tavern, which is still  commemorated in Philadelphia.   And then the final day is Veterans Day, which is set for November 11  every year. We commemorate it, when it is on a weekend, on the nearest  weekday. So Veterans Day this year is going to be celebrated tomorrow,  November 10.   Veterans Day has an amazing history as well. World War I hostilities  ended on the eleventh hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918.  And so, a year later, Congress, President Wilson, acted to declare that  November 11 would henceforth be a day to recognize the heroism of World  War I veterans. It was originally Armistice Day.   Armistice Day then began to be celebrated as Armistice Day beginning  in--it was first commemorated in 1921 with the burial of an unknown  soldier from World War I at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington,  VA. In 1954, by now, Armistice Day had been extended to celebrate all  veterans of all wars, and the name of it was changed by Congress under  President Eisenhower to Veterans Day.   And so we stand here today, on November 9, Military Day in Alabama.  Tomorrow will be the Marine Corps' 248th birthday. And we will  commemorate tomorrow and Saturday Veterans Day all across this country.   I said I was standing on behalf not only of three special days but  also hundreds of special people. My colleague and Armed Services  colleague Senator Tuberville of Alabama has, as is his right as a  Senator, imposed a blockade on consideration in the normal course of  business, pursuant to Senate practice, the confirmation of now 364  high-ranking military officials who have come through the Armed  Services Committee.   Senator Tuberville did not object to them coming through the  committee, but he has placed a hold on these nominees on account of his  disagreement with a Department of Defense policy that provides leave  and travel authorities for military servicemembers and their families  who must travel to seek noncovered reproductive healthcare, including  abortion care, in vitro fertilization services, and others.   As of today, according to the Pentagon, 364 individuals are being  held in this way. Huge numbers of these individuals are either in  Virginia awaiting confirmation for new positions, in other States  awaiting confirmation for positions that would move them to Virginia,  or have had some of their military service in the Commonwealth of  Virginia. I haven't done the math, but I would venture to suggest that  this affects Virginians and future Virginians more than it might any  other State.   And, to be plain, none of these 364 have anything to do with or any  responsibility over the policy with which my colleague from Alabama  finds significant disagreement.   My colleague and I disagree on the policy. That is the norm on the  Senate floor. My colleague has had his opportunity to convince Armed  Services Committee members that the policy is wrong and has failed to  do so, and he has had the opportunity to bring it forward on the Senate  floor and has failed to do so.   But these individuals are in a limbo that is very painful to them,  and it is my hope that because my Senate colleague did not object to  them when they were before the Armed Services Committee, he might see  fit--on Military Day in Alabama and on the eve of commemorating the  Marine Corps' 248th birthday and Veterans Day--to finally allow them to  serve in the positions that they have earned.   And so, with that, Mr. President, I would like to quickly read a  letter that we recently received from the American Legion, also timed  around Veterans Day, and then move into an effort to seek by unanimous  consent the confirmation of all 364 nominees pending before this body.   To begin--from the American Legion--this was a letter that came to us  yesterday, no doubt timed because of the pendency of Veterans Day.         Dear Senate leadership: On behalf of our 1.6 million dues-      paying members, The American Legion respectfully requests       your timely attention to the hundreds of U.S. military       vacancies awaiting confirmation. Your leadership and the       resolve of your conferences to come together and end this       blockade is vital to American national security and to       preserving the lives of our men and women in uniform. Failure       to find a bipartisan solution to the continued political       chess risks the lives of our servicemembers and the safety of       our nation.        Since 1919, The American Legion has emphasized the       importance of a strong national defense. A well-funded, well-      equipped, and well-trained military plays a vital role in       safeguarding the principles our nation holds dear. As U.S.       troops are targeted in the Middle East and global tensions       are on the rise, it is imperative leadership vacancies within       our military are filled now! Our allies and adversaries are       watching closely; inaction risks innumerable consequences.        The personal toll of confirmation purgatory extends far       beyond uniformed candidates with uncertain promotions. U.S.       servicemembers may pay the ultimate price if the perception       of chaos continues to create opportunity for our adversaries.       As we've seen in the past month alone, the Pentagon has       reported more than 38 attacks against U.S. troops in the       Middle East. While politicians continue to play games and use       our servicemembers as pawns, their lives remain in harm's way       and could be left paying the ultimate price.        The American Legion urges both conferences to come together       to end the inaction holding our armed forces hostage. Your       leadership is vital to protect our servicemembers, national       security and our country.        For God and country, Daniel J. Seehafer, National       Commander, American Legion.

Mr. President, before returning to Calendar No. 113, I  want to respond briefly to my colleague from Alabama.   His position on abortion and reproductive rights is well known, but  his claim that the Pentagon policy is unlawful is incorrect. In fact,  there has been a policy in place since the Reagan administration that  impacts directly upon the policy in the Pentagon.   The Senator from Alabama is correct that, except for limited  exceptions, Federal funds may not be used to pay for abortions. That is  true. We commonly call it the Hyde amendment, and I am a Hyde amendment  supporter.   But, in the 1980s, the Reagan administration was confronted with an  issue: What if women in prison--in the Bureau of Prisons--become  pregnant and want to terminate a pregnancy? Could Federal funds be used  to allow that pregnancy to be terminated?   The Reagan administration's Solicitor General analyzed the situation  and said that the Hyde amendment would prohibit funding to procure the  abortion, but Federal funds could be used to enable a prisoner to  travel to medical care where she could make the choice to terminate a  pregnancy.   Later administrations grappled with the same question with respect to  Peace Corps volunteers. If a Peace Corps volunteer in a country that  does not have reproductive rights access gets pregnant and wants to  terminate a pregnancy in a way that is lawful in the United States but  not where she is deployed, would the Hyde amendment allow Federal funds  to be used?   And consistent with the Reagan administration's ruling, Federal  policy has been that Federal funds can be used to enable this Peace  Corps volunteer to travel, but the payment for the abortion itself  would have to be done privately.   When the Dobbs decision was handed down by the Supreme Court in the  summer of 2022, you suddenly had a whole variety of States eliminate a  right that women had been able to count on for half a century--that in  the early phases of pregnancy, they could terminate a pregnancy without  intrusion by the State.   I have a kid in the military. He didn't get to decide where he went.  The women who are in the U.S. military don't get to choose where they  are deployed, and so now, huge numbers of women who serve this country  are deployed either in nations or in States within the United States  where they are no longer able to make their own reproductive choices  because of where they are deployed--possibly against their will. We  want people to be deployed where the military thinks it is best for  them to go. We don't want soldiers to have a veto over where they  should go. They should go where the mission demands.   But in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, the Pentagon grappled  with the same question that Republican and Democratic administrations  had grappled with respect to women in Federal prisons and Peace Corps  volunteers: Should you be able to travel to seek medical care,  including terminating a pregnancy, in a way that is lawful in the State  where you go and could that be paid by the Pentagon?   And with that consistent policy in place under Democratic and  Republican administrations, the Biden administration said we should  treat our servicewomen no worse than prisoners; we should treat our  women servicemembers no worse than Peace Corps volunteers.   Federal funds, pursuant to the Hyde amendment, cannot be used to pay  for an abortion. But if for decades we have allowed Federal prisoners  and Peace Corps volunteers to travel and have the Federal government  pay so that they can make a decision that is theirs to make on their  own dime, we will treat servicewomen no worse.   It is a policy that is not unlawful. It is a policy that is  completely consistent with the way the U.S. Government or Democratic  and Republican administrations have treated similarly situated women  since the 1980s.   Furthermore, the Senator has indicated that the only option a  minority Member has is to place a hold on nominees. To the contrary,  not a single one of these individuals has had anything to do with the  policy that my colleague doesn't like. Why take it out on them? There  is another avenue: Convince your colleagues that you are right.   The Senator and I are on the Armed Services Committee. In June, we  marked up the National Defense Authorization Act, and we sat around the  table. And it is a slight-majority Democratic committee by one member.   And Senator Tuberville offered the amendment saying: Hey, the  Pentagon is wrong. We should rescind the Pentagon policy.   And he didn't get the votes. He was not able to persuade his  colleagues that he was right.  [[Page S5451]]    In the Armed Services Committee, I make amendments all the time that  I am not able to persuade my colleagues to go along with me on. I have  been on the committee for 11 years now. I bet I have offered dozens and  dozens of amendments. I have a pretty good batting average, maybe like  a Ted Williams batting average--like .400, not 1.000.   I lose amendments all the time, never once--never once--have I lost  an amendment, been unable to convince my colleagues that I am right,  and then said I am going to take it out on brave men and women wearing  the uniform of this country, who had nothing to do with the policy that  makes me upset. Instead, I try harder. I come to the floor and make an  amendment to see if I can convince my colleagues here.   Senator Tuberville had an opportunity, when we considered the Defense  bill on the floor, to offer the amendment, to change the Pentagon  policy, and yet he failed to do so. We offered him the opportunity. He  failed to take it. Why? Because he was going to lose on the floor even  worse--even worse.   There are ways to handle a policy disagreement. Persuade your  colleagues you are right or persuade your colleagues in some middle  ground, but don't punish these individuals whose names I am taking time  to read because each one of them has served this country bravely, in  most instances for decades, with multiple deployments, with Purple  Hearts, with Silver Stars, with service in combat zones.   The Senator understands this. His father was a decorated World War II  veteran who received a Purple Heart. I will be at the grave of my  father-in-law tomorrow, a World War II submariner who is buried at  Christ Church, on the Northern Neck of Virginia, to put a flag on his  grave. He was buried less than a year ago.   I will give my dad a call this weekend, an Army veteran who served  immediately after the Korean war in the U.S. Army. I will think about  my son, now a Marine reservist. I will think about my chief military  LA, a Marine veteran. They don't deserve this punishment.   And, Mr. President, I ask that it now be in order to make the same  request with Calendar No. 113. I believe Calendar No. 112 has been  disposed of already. So if I could ask, with respect to Calendar No.  113, Rear Admiral James P. Downey to be vice admiral.

Mr. President, I believe I have now offered UC requests  for all 364 service men and women whose nominations have been pending  on this floor many months. They have waited patiently after serving  their country courageously, and I am sure there are some in the Chamber  wondering why bother to take the floor for a couple of hours when the  outcome of this was pretty well known in advance.   On the evening before Veterans Day, on the evening before the Marine  Corps' 248th birthday, and on the day that the State of Alabama is  celebrating its ties to the military, I wanted to offer these unanimous  consent requests so that I could have a chance to say the name of each  individual as a way of letting them know that there are many in this  body who will not forget about them until they are confirmed.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence  of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Librarian of  Virginia, Dr. Sandra Gioia Treadway, upon her retirement after 45  remarkable years of service to the Library of Virginia. Dr. Treadway  has served as the Librarian of Virginia for the past 16 years and was  deputy librarian 11 years before that. She joined the library in 1978  as an associate editor of publications and served in various positions  before being named the State librarian in 2007. In this esteemed role,  Dr. Treadway was the steward for the most comprehensive collection of  materials on Virginia  [[Page S5457]]  government, history, and culture available anywhere.   Dr. Treadway, with nearly 15 years of teaching experience, has always  had a public servant's heart. Her dedication to education and the  dissemination of knowledge has been a defining feature of her career.  Through her extensive teaching background, she has enriched countless  students' lives and fostered a deep understanding of the value of  learning and libraries. Dr. Treadway has received numerous awards and  distinctions, such as Virginia Tech's Teaching Excellence Award and the  Filby Award for Genealogic Librarianship, in acknowledgement of her  unwavering dedication to the educational process and her commitment to  research.   Throughout her tenure, Dr. Treadway has exhibited a profound  commitment to preserving Virginia's rich cultural heritage and  promoting access to knowledge for all. Her visionary leadership played  a pivotal role in digitizing many rare manuscripts, historic maps, and  government records dating back to the early Colonial period, ensuring  their preservation for future generations. As part of her work in the  library, Dr. Treadway oversaw a statewide records management program,  worked with State agencies and localities to establish retention  requirements for official records, offered records management training,  and monitored compliance with the Virginia Public Records Act.   Her team is known for its innovative focus on helping make history  accessible. I have personal experience with this, as correspondence and  emails from me and my staff during my time as Governor of Virginia were  made available digitally through a groundbreaking and massive  undertaking in digital records preservation and access.   She is also a respected historian and has authored and co-edited  several important historical projects from the history of the Library  of Virginia, which is among the State's oldest agencies to a history of  the Woman's Club in Richmond. She has undertaken particular efforts to  tell a more inclusive history of the Commonwealth, including the  State's commission to design and install a women's monument on Capitol  Square. She has served as a steady and trusted hand at the helm of the  library, guided by a passion for helping individuals unlock and  understand their history through use of the collections. Her abiding  passion stems from a belief that the most inspiring stories come from  illuminating the voices and experiences of the everyday people whose  lives are preserved in a variety of government records and private  papers the library holds.   As she embarks on a well-deserved retirement, Dr. Sandy Treadway  leaves a legacy of tireless public service, innovation, and a profound  love for Virginia's history. In a time where divisiveness can be  alarmingly normal, she garners deep respect and admiration from elected  and appointed officials of all parties, and she has been a model for  leading with grace and kindness. Her service has not only enriched the  Commonwealth's cultural heritage but also set a high standard for  future leaders in the field to aspire to. I extend my heartfelt  gratitude for her years of dedicated service and wish her a retirement  filled with fulfillment and new adventures.                            ____________________     Madam President, in all 50 States, young Americans who  wish to serve their country send in applications for the high honor of  recommendation to a military service academy by their U.S.  Representative or either of their U.S. Senators. However, because the  District of Columbia is not a State and has no Senators, young people  from DC have only a third as many opportunities to be nominated for  these academies as Americans from the 50 States have.   This simple bill would ensure that DC gets the same number of academy  nominations as States do for the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy,  and Air Force Academy. This bill originated with DC's distinguished  Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and I am proud to join her with a  Senate companion ahead of Veterans Day later this week.   Reviewing service academy applications is one of my most fulfilling  duties in the Senate. I cannot help but be optimistic about our  country's future when I see so many talented, dedicated, and patriotic  young people seeking to pursue careers serving their country in  uniform. Any young American should have an equal chance to be nominated  for this honor, whether they come from the District of Columbia or any  of the 50 States. This bill allows them that chance.  [[Page S5461]]                                       ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Markey, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Wyden):   S. 3273. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to  remove the overtime wages exemption for certain employees, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.    Madam President, in all 50 States, young Americans who  wish to serve their country send in applications for the high honor of  recommendation to a military service academy by their U.S.  Representative or either of their U.S. Senators. However, because the  District of Columbia is not a State and has no Senators, young people  from DC have only a third as many opportunities to be nominated for  these academies as Americans from the 50 States have.

I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 3 p.m. on  Monday, November 13; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the de Alba nomination postcloture; further, that all  postcloture time be considered expired at 5:30 p.m. and the cloture  motion filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m.; finally, that  if any nominations are confirmed during Monday's session, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:28 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, November 13, 2023, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
