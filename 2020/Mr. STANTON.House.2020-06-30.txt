 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Moving  Forward Act, a historic investment of more than $1.5 trillion in the  American people, in the American economy.   I thank Chairman DeFazio and Chairman Pallone for their extraordinary  leadership.   This bill includes long-delayed investments in Arizona's roads,  bridges, transit, airports, broadband, clean water, and so much more.  Arizona will receive more than $5 billion for highway and nearly $1  billion for transit.   Importantly, it supports major Arizona projects like I-11, public  transit in cities big and small, and support for our long-overlooked  Tribal communities. It addresses urgent infrastructure needs in my  State, including increased investments through the Clean Water State  Revolving Fund, and support for workforce development initiatives.   It includes $100 billion to make sure every American, whether in  urban, rural, or Tribal areas, has access to affordable high-speed  internet, and it leads the way in tackling climate change, including my  bill, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program. This  will create jobs, help families save on energy bills, and reduce carbon  pollution.   Mr. Speaker, the time for action is now.
