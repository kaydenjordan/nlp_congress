 Mr. Chairman, I claim time to speak in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment perpetuates false arguments  that allowing transgender girls to participate on school sports teams  will undermine the well-being of cisgender girls.   Again, my friends across the aisle are conflating and confusing the  issue here. They want to talk about the struggles and the challenges we  have with determining fair competition in elite sports, but what we are  talking about here is a bill, the underlying bill, which would  completely ban participation of all transgender kids across our  country.   As I said, the example in Utah, 75,000 high school students competing  in high school sports, four transgender kids, one competing as a  female. This seems wholly, wholly, disproportionate to the so-called  problem. What is disproportionate is this proposal to completely ban  transgender students from sports.   Now, I want to say something here. The other side does not even want  to acknowledge that transgender kids exist; that transgender people  exist.   Nevertheless, the legislation and this amendment target transgender  kids, and they do it in a very, very insidious way. They will say, oh,  transgender doesn't appear in this bill. But let's not kid ourselves  that the very intent is to harm and stigmatize, isolate, make them  pariahs, and this is simply wrong.   Look, I am not a scientist. I was an English teacher most of my time  before I got into Congress. I do know the harm that comes with this  insidious use of language, by not even granting the dignity of  existing, not even granting the dignity of the existence of trans kids  and trans people. That is what the other side is doing.   It is going to be harmful. How is it harmful? This mere debate has  traumatized trans kids and their families across the country. Eighty- five percent of transgender and nonbinary youth say that the debates  around anti-trans bills have negatively impacted their mental health.   According to a 2022 survey, nearly one in five transgender and  nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, and 45 percent of  LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year.  These statistics are real. They represent real vulnerable kids. I urge  my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to oppose the underlying  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from South  Carolina for a colloquy to answer some questions.   I know the gentlewoman to be open-minded about LGB people, but I  wonder if she has ever sat down and met with any of her transgender  constituents.    Reclaiming my time. So the gentlewoman does recognize  that transgender kids and transgender people exist.    Reclaiming my time. So it is curious to me that the  gentlewoman has not included even the word ``transgender.'' She uses  the word ``biological male,'' and the study that she has put forward  studies the harm done to cisgender girls by having them compete with  biological males. It does not even provide the guidance to the studiers  to study what may happen with cisgender girls and the competition with  transgender girls. So the results of this study are not going to even  determine what the challenges may be.   Look, the mere fact that the author of this amendment is asking to  study this shows that there is no evidence that there is any harm here.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, again, the assertion that the underlying  bill is about protecting women and girls couldn't be farther from the  truth. We know that in States that have inclusive policies toward trans  girls and women in sports, that the overall participation of girls and  women is greater.   Those States that have enacted bans on transgender participation have  seen a decrease in overall participation. Why might that be?   Well, we know that in Utah, that some parents of cisgender girls who  have seen their girls lose in competition have questioned whether or  not the winner is actually a girl because of nonconformance to  perceived notions of femininity. Authorities in that State have  actually subjected the winner, the girl who was a winner, to an  examination of documents dating back to her kindergarten days in order  for her to prove that she was indeed a female.   Think about the chilling effect that this has had on other women and  girls  [[Page H1893]]  from participating in sports. The teenage years are a difficult time  enough but think about what this ban has imposed.   Let me tell you, Republicans are not satisfied with just banning  transgender girls from competition in athletics. What this amendment  will do is to accomplish full exclusion of transgender people, not only  from athletic programs, but from any other auxiliary programming that a  student would want to participate with their teams.   Not only are they interested in assuring that transgender girls and  women can't enjoy the benefits of the athletic aspects of team sports,  but they also want to make sure that trans students who, statistically  speaking, already face intense marginalization in school environments  are deprived of the opportunity to make friends, to be included, and  just have fun.                                time  0930    No wonder more than half of transgender kids have thought about  suicide or have attempted it.   This amendment is the example that represents the whole. The nature  of this amendment is what is at the heart of this bill. It is not about  competition. It is about participation.   I wish that they would stop using examples of difficulties in elite  competitions as a justification to harm transgender kids all across  this Nation and exclude them not only from sports but also exclude them  from sports banquets or special study halls that may be associated with  athletes.   This is an insidious amendment. It is an insidious bill. It is  contrary to our values as Americans.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just say let's allow, at the very  elite level, organizations like the International Olympic Committee and  the NCAA to make determinations of what constitutes fairness, not  impose the Federal Government where it is not necessary. Transgender  athletes have been welcomed into participation for 20 years now and  only recently has it become a major issue in our country.   Mr. Chair, where have the Republicans' concerns about government  overreach gone? Where have the concerns about allowing States and  voluntary associations to solve problems before the Federal Government  is brought to bear gone?   Certainly, we should not be using one or two examples at the elite  sports level to affect the participation of transgender girls and women  all across our country in high schools and colleges.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would say that organizations like the NCAA  and the International Olympic Committee can resolve these issues about  fairness in competition, but we should not neglect the greater value of  participation, connecting to others in society and welcoming everybody  into the community. This bill and this amendment do not do that, and  they put our transgender kids in harm's way.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
