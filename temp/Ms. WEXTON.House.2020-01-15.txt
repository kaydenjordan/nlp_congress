 Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress, I served for 5  years in the Virginia General Assembly, and the proudest vote I ever  took in Richmond was to pass Medicaid expansion in Virginia.   Today, as a result of that expansion, more than 375,000 Virginians  now have coverage under Medicaid. It has been a win-win for everyone  involved--for those who would otherwise go uncovered and for the  hospitals and healthcare providers who often provide service to the  uninsured without compensation. A recent study has even suggested that  Medicaid expansion has saved thousands from opioid overdoses.   Medicaid expansion saves lives, and the success we have seen in  Virginia is thanks to the Affordable Care Act.   Americans need to know that while my colleagues and I are fighting to  protect and strengthen the ACA, Donald Trump and the congressional  Republicans are in court right now working to strike down the ACA with  no plan or replacement.   Without the ACA, Medicaid expansion, which covers 17 million  Americans, is in jeopardy, and so is coverage for more than 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions. With so much at stake, I urge my  Republican colleagues to end their attacks. In the meantime I will  continue to fight back.                            ____________________
