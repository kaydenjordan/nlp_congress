 Mr. President, I would like to begin with a few words  of tribute to two retired colleagues who passed away since we were last  together.   On Friday, March 23, former Senator Zell Miller departed this life at  the age  [[Page S1994]]  of 86. Those of us who served with Zell knew him as a kind and  honorable man and a committed public servant.   He rose from a childhood without electricity and running water well  into his school years to serve the State of Georgia as Governor and  later as Senator. Zell Miller did so with grit and determination, never  afraid to buck partisanship in favor of his principles.   Also, this past Thursday, Senator Daniel Akaka, our former colleague  from Hawaii, passed away at the age of 93. He worked closely with  Senator Inouye and others to advocate for his State. As the Senator  himself once put it, he always preferred being a workhorse to a show  horse.   The Senate offers our condolences to their families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, we  just welcomed a new colleague to this Chamber today. Senator Cindy  Hyde-Smith was sworn in. She became the 51st Senator and the first  woman to represent Mississippi here in the Senate. Senator Hyde-Smith  brings experience as a State legislator and as the Mississippi  commissioner of agriculture and commerce.   I know I speak for all Senators on both sides of the aisle in  welcoming our new colleague. We look forward to working together and  continuing this record of accomplishment for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, this week the Senate  will turn to one of its most important constitutional responsibilities,  the personnel business. We have a number of nominees to consider in the  next several days.   First is Claria Horn Boom, President Trump's pick to serve as a  Federal district judge for both the Eastern and Western Districts of  Kentucky. Through her work in both the public and private sectors, Ms.  Boom has distinguished herself as a problem-solver, a trusted adviser  to clients and her community.   Letters in support of her nomination share a theme: She has the  skills and experiences to excel as a district judge. ``High standards,  ample preparation, and a fears intellect''; ``unfailingly thoughtful,  gracious, and diligent''--these are just some of the ways Ms. Boom is  described by those she served and worked with in Kentucky. The  Judiciary Committee came to the same conclusion, advancing her  nomination on a voice vote.   Later today the full Senate will vote to advance this talented and  noncontroversial nominee, and then I hope we will be able to quickly  confirm her.   Then, in the coming days, we will consider several more judges and  important nominees for the Department of Labor, the EPA, and the  National Labor Relations Board. These and many other positions remain  vacant nearly a year and a half into the Trump administration.   Qualified nominees stand ready, but Senate Democrats are using the  procedural playbook to obstruct and delay. In many cases, for example,  they are insisting that the Senate exhaust postcloture time even on  unobjectionable district court nominees who have gone on to  overwhelming confirmation--for examples, Walter Counts, who was  confirmed 96 to 0, or Karen Gren Scholer, who was confirmed 95 to 0.   I will have more to say on these partisan tactics in the coming days.  For now, let me make one thing clear. The Senate's workweek will not  end--will not end--until all of these amply qualified nominees are  confirmed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, there is just  one more week until the deadline for Americans to file our 2017 tax  returns. It is not exactly a national holiday, but this year there is a  silver lining. This April is the last time Americans will file taxes  under the old, outdated Tax Code that is on its way out, thanks to  historic tax reform.   A year from now, families will be filing under a simpler and fairer  tax code that lets them keep more of what they have earned and send  less to the IRS. They will benefit from a doubled standard deduction,  from major expansions in key provisions like the child tax credit, and,  of course, from significantly lower tax rates.   All told, the average family of four earning a median income of  around $70,000 could see a tax cut of over $2,000. But let's remember,  the American people do not need to wait until next year to start seeing  the fruits of once-in-a-generation tax reform.   Job creators are already implementing plans to hire, expand, and  invest in their American workers. Millions of workers have already  received word of a tax reform bonus, permanent raise, or other new  benefits, such as paid family leave policies or expanded retirement  assistance. That includes thousands of employees of Southwire, a wire  manufacturer that employs hundreds of Kentuckians at its location in  Hawesville. For hard-working men and women at Southwire, tax reform  means bonuses and expanded educational opportunities.   The benefits of our new 21st century Tax Code are certainly no  secret. As Americans put the finishing touches on their tax returns  under the old, outdated system for the last time, there is good news to  look forward to, and there is good news that is actually already here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask  unanimous consent that at 12:10 p.m. on Tuesday, April 10, the Senate  vote on confirmation of the Boom nomination and that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that  the cloture vote in relation to the Ring nomination occur at 2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Energy  Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  PN1637, PN1653, and PN1680.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.  [[Page S2001]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I would call my colleagues' attention  to the recent 229th anniversary of the first quorum of the U.S.  Congress.   The House of Representatives achieved a quorum on April 1, 1789. Five  days later, on April 6, the Senate marked that milestone.   Each year, the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress,  ACSC, commemorates this anniversary by observing Congress Week during  the first week of April. Commemorative events around the country  encourage students to explore the work of the U.S. Congress and its  constitutional role in our government and promote advanced scholarly  research.   The ACSC was founded in 2003. It includes more than 40 organizations  and institutions that help to preserve and make available the archival  records of Members of Congress.   Each year, the annual meeting of the ACSC brings together Members of  Congress who create the records, archivists who preserve the records,  teachers who incorporate them into their lesson plans, and scholars who  study them in order to advance our understanding of congressional  history and the evolution of the political process. This year's annual  meeting will be hosted by the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at  the University of Kansas.   Thanks to the work of the ACSC and its member organizations, we have  substantially improved the number and research value of congressional  collections being preserved nationwide, producing an educational  resource for legislative branch studies that rivals the presidential  library system.   I am happy to report that the McConnell Center at the University of  Louisville is one such member organization. Created in 1991, the  McConnell Center nurtures ``Kentucky's next generation of great  leaders'' with programs focused on service, leadership, and civic  education. Last spring, at the annual meeting of the ACSC, I had the  pleasure of participating in a fireside chat with the McConnell Center  archivist, Deborah Skaggs Speth. We discussed the importance of Members  preserving their records, which shed important light on what we do on  behalf of the American people, and how we do it.   In 2008, Congress unanimously passed H.Con.Res. 307. It recommended  that Members' records be properly maintained, that each Member take all  necessary measures to manage and preserve their records, that they  arrange for the deposit or donation of their records with a research  institution that is properly equipped to care for them, and that they  make them available for educational purposes at an appropriate time.   Organizations like the McConnell Center and the Dole Institute, in  collaboration with the ACSC, are diligently working to ensure the  preservation of records for generations of students and scholars.   I encourage my colleagues to preserve the records of their service in  a research institution, where they can contribute to this vital,  necessary, and growing component of our Nation's documentary heritage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to remember a man called  Kentucky's greatest hero, who served our Nation in the First World War  and later received our highest military recognition, the Medal of  Honor. SGT Willie Sandlin, a native of Leslie County, KY, single- handedly attacked and disabled three German machinegun nests during the  Battle of the Argonne Forest in 1918. With only a rife, an automatic  pistol, and four hand grenades, Sergeant Sandlin's heroism resulted in  the death of 24 German soldiers and the capture of 200 more.   At that time, Sergeant Sandlin was under the command of General John  J. ``Blackjack'' Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary  Force, who personally recommended him for the Medal of Honor and  presented the award to him in February of 1919.   In a recent edition of the Kentucky Humanities Magazine, Dr. James M.  Gifford, the CEO and senior editor of the Jesse Stuart Foundation,  published a profile on the life of Sergeant Sandlin. Dr. Gifford traced  his journey, from his birth in Appalachian poverty, through his  remarkable service in the Great War, to his campaign to improve  literacy rates in Kentucky. Named for the renowned author and Kentucky  Poet Laureate, the Jesse Stuart Foundation publishes important works  from Appalachian authors to help the region's unique heritage flourish.  I would like to thank Dr. Gifford for his study of this proud son of  Kentucky.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Gifford's article on  Sergeant Sandlin's life be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the Kentucky Humanities Magazine, Fall 2017]                 Sergeant Sandlin: Medal of Honor Recipient                           (By James M. Gifford)         In 1917, after several years of provocation, America       declared war on Germany. By November of the following year,       the United States had sent two million men overseas.        In the bloody fighting that took place in the Meuse-Argonne       Forest in the fall of 1918, thousands of Americans       distinguished themselves, including two young men from       central Appalachia who received the Medal of Honor. On       September 26, 1918, Sergeant Willie Sandlin, acting alone,       attacked and disabled three German machine gun nests. During       his heroic assaults, Sandlin killed 24 German soldiers and       assisted in the capture of 200 more. Less than two weeks       later, Corporal Alvin York led an attack on a German machine       gun nest, taking 35 machine guns, killing at least 25 enemy       soldiers, and capturing 132. Sandlin was from Hyden in Leslie       County, Kentucky, and York was from Pall Mall, Tennessee, a       community just across the Kentucky line. Although York and       Sandlin shared the same military distinctions and emerged       from similar Appalachian communities, their lives after World       War I were remarkably different. York acquired money and fame       and became a national icon and an international celebrity.       Sandlin lived in modest circumstances, ill-health, and       purposeful obscurity until he died of war-inflicted gas       poisoning at age 59.        If war is a rich man's war and a poor man's fight, then       Willie Sandlin represented millions of poor men who became       soldiers during World War I. Born into Appalachian poverty,       on January 1, 1890 on Long's Creek in Breathitt County,       Kentucky, Sandlin's parents were John ``Dirty Face'' Sandlin       (born March 17, 1867) and Lucinda Abner Sandlin (born       December 1870). John and Lucinda had five sons: Willie,       Charlie, John, Elihue (Sonny), and Mathew (Mathy). When       Willie was a boy, his father was imprisoned for murder, and       Willie's mother and father divorced in 1900. Lucinda, who was       half Native American, died in childbirth in 1900, so Willie       and his motherless siblings were divided among relatives, as       was the custom of the day. Willie and his brothers Charles       and John were raised by his father's relatives in Leslie       County.        Sandlin enlisted in the Army on April 16, 1913, and served       under John J. Pershing on the Mexican border. He re-enlisted       in 1917 and was soon on his way to Europe as part of the       American Expeditionary Force. Sandlin arrived on France's       bloody Western Front in time to take part in the Battle of       the Argonne Forest, the massive Allied offensive that finally       defeated Kaiser Wilhelm's war-weary German army. The Meuse-      Argonne Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Argonne       Forest, was a major part of the final Allied offensive of       World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front. It       was fought from September 26, 1918, until the Armistice of       November 11, 1918, a total of 47 days. The Meuse-Argonne       Offensive was the largest in United States military history,       involving 1.2 million American soldiers.        Sandlin and his men were in several battles during the       summer of 1918. Then at Bois de Forges, France, on September       26, 1918, Sandlin emerged as one of the greatest heroes of       World War I. He was in charge of a platoon of 59 men when the       day began. Following an all-night artillery barrage,       Sandlin's platoon was ordered to advance that day toward a       specific, important military objective. The line had been       fighting for hours, advancing slowly, when the doughboys were       stopped by withering fire from  [[Page S2002]]       carefully placed machine gun nests, two guns to each nest. At       7 a.m., orders were given to ``halt and lie down.'' While       others were trying to stay below the hail of deadly gunfire,       Willie Sandlin had a rendezvous with destiny that changed his       life forever. Sandlin observed a narrow lane between the       firing line of the two guns. Arming himself with four hand       grenades, an automatic pistol, and a rifle, he charged the       nests alone. Advancing within 75 yards of the guns, he threw       his first grenade, which fell short and exploded without       effect. He raced forward while the enemy emptied two       automatic revolvers at him. When he was less than 50 yards       away from the intense machine gun fire, he threw his second       grenade, which struck the nest. He then threw two more       grenades, charged the nest, and killed three more German       soldiers with his bayonet, making a total of eight enemy       combatants that he killed there.        Sandlin's platoon advanced and he again took command of his       men. The Americans moved forward and flanked another machine       gun nest and Sandlin dispatched it in the same way, utilizing       grenades. When his grenades were spent, four men still       defended the nest. Sandlin had killed them all with his       bayonet by the time his platoon arrived. The line continued       to advance and at 2 p.m. Sandlin destroyed a third German       machine gun nest and its occupants in similar fashion. His       heroic assaults resulted in the death of 24 German soldiers       and the capture of 200 more German soldiers. Sandlin's       commander, General John J. ``Blackjack'' Pershing, praised       him for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and       beyond the call of duty'' and recommended him for the Medal       of Honor, detailing his heroic actions and praising the 28-      year-old Sandlin's ``splendid example of bravery and coolness       to his men.'' Pershing personally presented the Medal of       Honor to Sandlin in February of 1919 at Chaumont, the general       headquarters of the AEF. Pershing would later describe       Sandlin as the outstanding regular army soldier of World War       I.        When the war ended, Sandlin returned home to Leslie County       for six months. In December, 1919, because of his exemplary       military record, he was appointed special escort for the       bodies of soldiers who had died overseas. Sandlin left for       France in January 1920. Later that year, Sandlin returned       home and married the former Belvia Roberts, a woman he began       courting at a box dinner social after he first returned from       Europe. Their happy marriage produced one son and four       daughters who reached adulthood: Vorres, born in 1921,       followed by Leona, Nancy Ruth, Florence, and Robert E. Lee       Sandlin. Cora and Rose died of childhood diseases before       their fourth birthdays.        Like his more famous counterpart, Tennessee's Alvin York,       Sandlin returned home with a heightened commitment to       education and community service. In the years following WWI,       eastern Kentuckians were working to improve the quality of       life in their mountain homeland. Two of the region's greatest       leaders were Mary Breckinridge, founder of the Frontier       Nursing Service at Hyden in 1925, and Cora Wilson Stewart,       founder of the ``Moonlight School'' program to promote       literacy. Newspapers reported that Willie Sandlin,       ``Kentucky's greatest hero'' had joined the crusade ``to help       stamp out illiteracy in Kentucky.'' Sandlin toured the state       with Stewart and spoke in hundreds of towns and villages. He       was so devoted to Mrs. Stewart and her campaign that he and       Belvia named their second child after her--Cora Wilson       Stewart Sandlin.        Willie Sandlin never presented himself as a celebrity. He       was too modest to seek public adoration and too shy to enjoy       the attention of the media, but he did, on several occasions,       attend local and national meetings where he was recognized as       a Medal of Honor recipient. Throughout the 1920s, Sandlin       continued to attend Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) meetings       in the hope that the VFW could help him receive additional       benefits as a wounded, injured, and disabled veteran.        Like many wounded veterans, Sandlin wasted no time in       pursuing benefits. In 1921, government physicians at a       Veterans Center in Richmond, Kentucky, examined Sandlin and       reported that he was ``suffering a serious lung infection as       a result of gas inhaled'' in the Battle of the Argonne       Forest. To make a claim for increased compensation, in 1925       Sandlin appeared before the United States Veterans' Bureau       in Lexington. Sandlin was only receiving $10 a month       compensation for being a Medal of Honor recipient, a       reduction from the $40 a month he was receiving when he       was ``invalided home.'' In 1928, at age 38, Sandlin should       have been in his physical prime when he moved back to a       house on his father-in-law's property. Instead, according       to some newspaper accounts, he was very ill. Sandlin       ``coughed and wheezed a great deal,'' especially in the       winter. By 1928, Sandlin had spent time in hospitals in       Chillicothe and Cincinnati, Ohio, and ``other places.'' An       old army buddy encouraged Willie to move to Colorado       because he thought ``the dry air and high altitude'' would       help him. But Willie would not leave his eastern Kentucky       homeland, and he didn't have enough money to travel if he       had wanted to. ``I'm not one-third the man I used to be       before the war,'' he observed without complaint. ``If I       take 25 steps up the hill, I'm done for. My wind's gone.''       In 1928, Indiana Senator Arthur R. Robinson and others       presented a bill to Congress which ``would enlist and       retire as a captain Willie Sandlin, Kentucky hero of the       world war, who is now destitute.'' The whole unproductive       process of seeking the benefits he deserved became       exhausting and demoralizing to Willie Sandlin, yet he had       no choice but to continue.        Aware of Sandlin's financial difficulties, Senator Hiram       Brock, who represented Leslie County in the state       legislature, continued his efforts to get funds from the       state government to purchase a farm for Sandlin. Senator       Brock's efforts had been inspired by the American Legion's       efforts to raise money to provide a home for Sandlin and his       family so they could ``live with the common comfort of       life.'' During the 1920s, the VFW had established a ``Hero       Fund'' and called upon ``all patriotic citizens, along with       members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars'' and ``others       throughout the country to mail in their contributions to the       VFW, McClelland Building, Lexington, Kentucky.'' VFW leaders       said there would have been no need to raise funds to buy a       home for the Sandlins if Willie had been willing to ``sell       his birthright for a mess of pottage.'' According to VFW       leaders, a ``celebrated moving picture concern'' had offered       Willie $500 a week to re-enact his heroic deeds, but       ``Sandlin refused to capitalize on his war records'' and       turned down ``other offers to profit from his patriotism.''        Life after the war was just one medical examination after       another for Willie. He was examined at Cincinnati in 1928 and       given a 69 percent disability rating, which would have       entitled him to a fair compensation. But the Louisville       Veterans' Bureau, which had jurisdiction over Sandlin,       appealed that rating to the Bureau of Appeals at Chicago and       the bureau then placed the case before the Veterans' Bureau       in Washington. Bureaucracies do not always yield justice, and       technicalities blocked compensation for him, making a special       action by Congress necessary. Despite his continuing efforts,       Sandlin, who had been wounded twice and gassed twice, never       received any disability compensation from the Veterans       Bureau, and he never received a penny of the money that was       donated by private citizens to purchase a farm for him and       his family.        By the beginning of the Great Depression, Willie Sandlin       realized that he would probably not receive any money from       the Veterans Administration Bureau to compensate him for his       warsustained injuries. So the Sandlins did what tens of       thousands of Appalachian families did: ``they hunkered down''       and ``did the best they could with what they had.'' They       became subsistence farmers. Drawing on practices that were       more than a century old, subsistence farmers, like the       Sandlins, produced almost everything they needed from their       farms and nearby fields and forests. They raised cows, hogs,       and chickens for meat, which was supplemented by food from       vegetable gardens and orchards. During the Depression, Willie       and Belvia both worked extremely hard to make a good life and       a good home for their children. During those years, Willie       also worked as a supervisor on a WPA road project.        Although Sandlin's health continued to worsen, he still had       a large family to support. So, in 1941, for the first time in       his life, Willie sought political office and ran       unsuccessfully as an Independent for Leslie County jailer.        In December 1941, a journalist called on the Sandlins at       their home. Willie, Belvia, and their guest sat comfortably       in ``a long living room'' and talked about ``a number of       things,'' but soon the conversation turned to Japan's attack       on Pearl Harbor and America's entrance into another world       war. Willie refused to talk about his heroics in World War I,       but he told his visitor that if his health were better and if       ``the navy would take [me, I would] join tomorrow.'' In the       early spring of 1942, the old warrior, who was 52 years old       and in very bad health, went to Hyden and registered for the       draft.        Early in May 1949, Willie's breathing problems grew much       worse. Belvia took him to the hospital in Hyden; two days       later he was transported by ambulance to the Veteran's       Hospital in Louisville. Belvia went with him and stayed in       the hospital room for the next three weeks, along with her       daughters, Florence and Vorres. One of them was always in       Willie's room.        In the early morning hours of May 29, Belvia and Vorres had       gone to the lobby to rest while Florence remained in the room       with her father, sitting next to Willie's bed and holding his       hand. Doctors had advised Willie to move to Phoenix. They       thought the climate and environment there might improve his       health. He squeezed his daughter's hand and said, ``We missed       the train [to Phoenix].'' And then he was dead. He went easy,       with a smile and a sigh. He was originally buried in the       Hurricane Cemetery in Hyden; however, in September 1990,       Sandlin's widow had his remains re-interred in the Zachary       Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville. When Belvia died in       1999, at age 98, she was buried next to her husband.        Now he belongs to the ages. He had been raised in poverty       and had grown into a quiet, resolute man of courage and       honor. Willie Sandlin spent a lifetime accepting adversity       and inequity and meeting life's challenges with a smile and a       ``can do'' attitude. All he wanted from life was to serve his       country, build a home, and enjoy his loving family, and he       achieved his goals through hard work. Only death can stop men       like Willie Sandlin.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to join the citizens  [[Page S2003]]  of Pineville, KY, in remembering the life of Mayor Robert Madon. Bob,  who led his community for nearly two decades, passed away earlier this  year at the age of 83. Throughout his life of accomplishment for his  hometown, Bob earned the affection of his neighbors and the gratitude  of the people he served so well.   Graduating from Pineville High School, Bob attended the Millersburg  Military Institute before joining the U.S. Air Force to serve in Korea.  Bob returned to Bell County after his military service and, like so  many of his fellow veterans, was active in his local American Legion  post and other civic organizations.   One of the oldest traditions in southeastern Kentucky is the Mountain  Laurel Festival. Named after the mountain laurel flower that commonly  grows in Appalachia, the annual festival celebrates the region's  heritage through concerts, carnivals, craft and talent shows, a parade,  and a beauty pageant. This May, Pine Mountain State Park will host the  88th annual festival. For many years, Bob was an integral part of the  festival's success, as the general chairman in 1966 and serving on the  advisory board from 1967 to 1972. The pinnacle of the festival's  traditions is the selection of the Mountain Laurel Princess and the  Mountain Laurel Queen. Young women from local high schools compete for  the title of princess, and universities from throughout the  Commonwealth send candidates seeking the queen's crown. Serving as its  emcee, Bob was the voice of the festival and the contest for many  years.   One of Bob's friends remembers his passion for the Mountain Laurel  Festival. ``He was everywhere making sure people were picking up debris  from their yard, mowing the grass, painting the curbs, cleaning up the  city.'' When Pineville was on display for visitors, Bob worked hard to  help it shine. In 1995, the festival honored Bob by including him in  its hall of fame. He would later also receive the festival's  ``Outstanding Service Award'' and the ``Lifetime Honorary Directors  Award'' as well-deserved recognition of Bob's unrelenting work to make  the festival a success every year.   In 1968, at the request of the new governor, Louie Nunn, Bob decided  to leave Bell County and begin a political career in Frankfort. As an  administrative assistant to Governor Nunn in the first Republican  administration in two decades, Bob served the people of the  Commonwealth in State government.   After his time in Frankfort, Bob returned to his hometown to fill a  vacancy on the Pineville City Council in 1971. Later, Bob was named a  city judge and served in that capacity until his election as the mayor  of Pineville in 1977. Beginning his first term as mayor only months  after the devastating flood, Bob certainly had an overwhelming task  ahead of him.   That April, the Cumberland River topped the floodwall and devastated  the community. During the crisis, Bob was integral to ensuring the  safety of these Kentuckians. According to one of his friends, ``Bobby  made sure that everybody got up on the hill.'' Bob led the effort to  rebuild, serving on the flood related projects committee, and as mayor  helped bring millions of dollars to extend the floodwall to prevent  future tragedies. Working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bob  oversaw the project. It was completed in 1988, the year after he left  office.   After a period out of public office, Bob was elected as mayor again  in 1994 and served until the end of 2002. He was again reelected for  his final term in 2007 before leaving in 2008. During his time in  office, Bob oversaw the construction of a new U.S. 25E bypass, which  was later named in his honor.   While leading Pineville as its mayor, Bob also participated in the  Kentucky League of Cities, KLC. This organization is dedicated to  helping cities and their leaders accomplish their goals through  trainings, advocacy, and policy research. For nearly three decades, Bob  was a director of the KLC and served one term as its president.   Bob's passion for his community extended far beyond public service.  He spent years of his life in many other pursuits speaking directly  with the families of Pineville. During a professional career that  included managing a number of radio stations and the Pineville-Sun  Cumberland Courier, Bob was also the voice of the Pineville Mountain  Lions. An avid sports lover, he later became a Kentucky High School  Sports Association official in both boys and girls basketball games.  Bob was also a faithful member of the First Baptist Church in  Pineville, singing in the choir and working as the associate Sunday  school superintendent.   Those who knew Bob--and that seemed to be just about everyone in  Pineville--recalled that he was always talking about his hometown. For  anyone who shared their concerns with him, Bob would do his best to fix  them. His life was one of passion for his neighbors, and the whole  Pineville community benefited from his work. His son Scott even  followed in Bob's footsteps and serves as the current mayor of  Pineville.   Bob's memorial service drew hundreds of people to pay their respect  to the man who made such a significant impact on their lives. The  people's outpouring of support was a fitting tribute to the man who  lived his life for his neighbors. Elaine and I would like to extend our  condolences to Bob's loving family, his friends, and the entire  Pineville community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  congratulate Ted Hampton, of Knox County, KY, who was named the 2017  Man of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce during an event  at Union College's student center. For more than 50 years, Ted has  served as the CEO of Cumberland Valley Rural Electric Cooperative. At  his hiring, Ted was one of the youngest distribution managers in the  country. Now, he has the distinction of being the second longest  serving in the country.   Throughout his tenure leading the organization, Ted has overseen the  building of a new headquarters, a branch office, and the hiring of  hundreds of employees. One of his colleagues spoke highly of Ted's  service, saying his greatest accomplishment has been keeping his  employees as safe as possible.   At the awards ceremony, Ted was joined by his wife, Margie, and their  8-year-old granddaughter Tori. During his remarks to accept the award,  Ted warmly acknowledged all of his coworkers for their work to serve  the area. I would like to join the Knox Country community on  congratulating Ted on this award, and I urge my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 304, H.R. 3445.
