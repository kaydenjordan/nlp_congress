 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and to  applaud the heroism of Clinton Police Officer Ryan Morton, who gave his  life last week protecting the citizens of Clinton, Missouri.   Ryan was beloved by all. He was a veteran who fought in Afghanistan,  an ardent Royals fan, and a dedicated law enforcement officer who  stepped up to serve his community as a full-time police officer after  the tragic death of another Clinton police officer named Gary Michael.  Sadly, Officer Morton lost his life 7 months to the day after Officer  Michael was killed.   Officer Morton embodied what we all should emulate: dedication,  patriotism, service, and a willingness to lay down one's life for  others.   We mourn the loss, but we celebrate Ryan's life.   May the Lord comfort his family and the Clinton Police Department,  and may his example inspire us all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and Representative  LaMalfa for hosting tonight's Special Order to draw attention to the  wonderful benefits of crisis pregnancy centers.   I would like to share the story of two women. Summer is a smart 17- year-old who is in love with her first love, John. Although their  parents are concerned about how serious they have gotten, they spend as  much time together as possible. They soon find out that their college  plans are in jeopardy when they discover that they are pregnant.   Tanya is a 40-year-old single mom with three kids. She works at a  local restaurant as a server, and she gets by with the help of Federal  welfare programs. She has been seeing Sam off and on for the past  several months, but they recently broke up. Now she finds out that she  is pregnant. She can't handle one more mouth to feed. Abortion seems to  be the only option.   Summer's and Tanya's situations are different, yet they both can find  help and hope through their local crisis pregnancy centers. Like over  2.3 million women and men across America, they can receive pregnancy  tests; ultrasounds; parenting classes; and other basic necessities,  such as maternity and baby clothing, through these centers. These vital  centers are making a huge difference for so many.   Pregnancy care centers provide a safe haven for women in crisis. In  other words, they provide a safe haven for pregnant moms who need love  and support as they welcome their babies into the world. There are more  than 2,300 pregnancy care centers throughout America. Some of these  clinics provide medical care, housing for expectant moms and their  children, and adoption referrals.   I am thankful for the Shiloh Center in Harrisonville, Missouri, my  hometown. The Shiloh Center welcomes moms in difficult circumstances,  offering hope and help, enabling each mother to choose life for her  baby. Like many other centers, the Shiloh Center provides free  pregnancy testing, ultrasound services, counseling, and educational  resources.   The Shiloh Center also provides prenatal care for pregnant moms, and  ensures that new moms are equipped with baby clothes, diapers, and  formula for their little ones.   There are thousands of these centers across America. I would like to  highlight the wonderful pregnancy care centers in my district:  Crossroads Pregnancy Resource Center in Warsaw, Missouri; My Life  Clinic in Columbia, Missouri; Pregnancy Health Center Lake of the  Ozarks in Camdenton, Missouri; Door of Hope Pregnancy Center in  Clinton, Missouri; New Beginnings Women's Center in Warrensburg,  Missouri; Pregnancy Support Center in Lebanon, Missouri; Birthright of  Sedalia in Sedalia, Missouri; Free Women's Center of Pulaski County in  Waynesville, Missouri; Birthright of Moberly in Moberly, Missouri;  Birthright of Nevada in Nevada, Missouri; and Choices Pregnancy Center  in Marshfield, Missouri.   I am grateful to each of these centers for the countless hours of  community service and client care lovingly offered to women like Summer  and Tanya and thousands in similar circumstances experiencing  challenging life circumstances. They are bringing practical help and  hope, and that is the best story of all.
