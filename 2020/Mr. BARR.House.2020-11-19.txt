 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of mom-and-pop retail  investors who benefit from sound corporate governance to promote free  enterprise and to warn against the risks of politicizing corporate  leaders' responsibilities to their shareholders.   The primary job of a corporation is to maximize shareholder value,  not to engage in social engineering or politically correct causes  simply to satisfy detractors of corporate America. Corporate leaders  have a fiduciary responsibility to their owners which, I fear, is  getting lost as leaders try to play the politics of the day.   Last year, leaders of America's largest corporations, through the  Business Roundtable, issued an updated ``Statement on the Purpose of a  Corporation'' in which they elevated so-called stakeholders above  shareholders in their responsibilities. I take issue with this change  because it dilutes the accountability leaders have to their owners  [[Page H5939]]  and reflects an empty gesture intended only to surrender to the  pressures of political correctness.   In order to do right by its employees, customers, suppliers, and  communities, a business must first be successful and profitable. A  business that mistreats its employees or shuns its responsibilities to  its communities would not survive in today's market environment.   So why the change? This is nothing more than a public relations  exercise designed to preempt any charges from the opponents of free  enterprise who suggest businesses should be advancing specific partisan  causes.   Unfortunately, the changes resulted only in more ire and attention  from officials it was likely intended to satisfy. Charges from the far  left suggest that businesses haven't done enough to help their  communities. One Senator even used the restatement of a corporation to  suggest that she ``expects'' business leaders to support her far-left  corporate governance bill that would take our free-enterprise system on  a path toward socialism.   The lesson here is this: If you give them an inch, they will take a  mile.   Recent developments suggest this remains true. In September, the  Business Roundtable called for ``market-based solutions'' to fight  climate change and urged businesses to work together on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I have no issues with businesses setting public goals  that mitigate risk and promote long-term growth if they are in the best  interest of their shareholders and business goals, but it wasn't enough  for the business community's strongest opponents.   Earlier this month, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth  Warren, sent a letter to the chairman of the Business Roundtable and  the chair of its Energy & Environment Committee. The letter alleged  that they were not doing enough and suggested that they should be  required to publicly document how companies are supporting emissions- reducing public policy.   Instead of prioritizing their firms' response to the economic and  health crisis, keeping their employees safe during the pandemic, and  ensuring their customers' needs are met, these CEOs of major U.S.  corporations must allocate time and resources to responding to calls  from politicians on the far left to be more green.   Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the classic children's book, ``If You  Give a Mouse a Cookie,'' in which a boy gives a mouse a cookie and the  mouse keeps asking for more and more and more and more. In this  analogy, the radical left is the mouse, never satisfied, and corporate  America is the young boy, bleeding resources to fulfill the mouse's  ever-expanding demands.   By ceding shareholder primacy, the Nation's business leaders began  down a slippery slope. The radical left will not be placated until they  remake free enterprise to align with their misguided, socialist goals.   Mr. Speaker, the business leaders of this country would be well  served to heed the admonishment of Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman when  he wrote:   ``When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the `social  responsibilities of business in a free-enterprise system,' I am  reminded of the wonderful line about the Frenchman who discovered, at  the age of 70, that he had been speaking prose all his life. The  businessmen believe that they are defending free enterprise when they  declaim that business is not concerned `merely' with profit but also  with promoting desirable `social' ends; that business has a `social  conscience' and takes seriously its responsibilities for providing  employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever  else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers. In  fact, they are--or would be if they or anyone else took them  seriously--preaching pure and unadulterated socialism. Businessmen who  talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that  have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades.''   Mr. Speaker, this is a stark warning to those who lead America's  largest companies that attempts to appease socialists and radical  environmentalists are on a fool's errand. The agenda of the far left is  fundamentally incompatible with free enterprise and a free society. The  sooner that America's CEOs realize this and the sooner they return to a  focus on shareholder value maximization, the sooner we will liberate  the American people from the dangerous and morally bankrupt ideas of  the socialist far left.   I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, with a final admonishment from Milton  Friedman, when he said:   ``There is one and only one social responsibility of business--to use  its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits  so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say,  engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.''   Profitable businesses help society. Profitable businesses increase  employment. Profitable businesses are good for America.                            ____________________
