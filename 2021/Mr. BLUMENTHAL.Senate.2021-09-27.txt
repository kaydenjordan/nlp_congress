 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  Very Reverend Father George Poulos, a deeply admired community leader,  who turns 100 on September 30.   Born in Massachusetts to Greek immigrants in 1921, Father George  joined the priesthood in 1943. He began his studies in Connecticut at  the Holy Cross Seminary in Pomfret. Upon graduating in 1948 from the  Holy Cross Seminary in Brookline, MA, Father George served as a pastor  of the Holy Trinity Church in Norwich, CT. Then, in 1956, he was  assigned to the Church of the Archangels in Stamford, CT. In 2009,  after over six decades of remarkable service, Father George retired. He  still plays an active role at the Church of the Archangels, serving as  pastor emeritus.   I have been privileged to know Father George as a leader of courage  and conviction, whose great work has touched countless lives. His  vision and dedication enabled the Church of the Archangels to build an  amazing, 11th Century Byzantine-style Greek Orthodox Church, which was  consecrated in 1959. Later, in 1976, the church campus opened the Greek  Cultural Center, which offered athletic amenities for church youth and  banquet facilities for the entire community. In 1995, this center  became the Stamford Athletic Club, providing invaluable services to the  public.   Father George oversaw the creation of Ionian Village, a summer camp  youth program in Greece. Since 1970, it has hosted thousands of Greek- American campers, giving them the opportunity to further explore their  cultural history, religious roots, and language. Father George also  established ``Byzantine Fellowship'' in America, and in his 30-year  tenure as executive director, helped sponsor Greek cultural events in  the United States and pilgrimages.   Father George's tireless dedication to helping others has earned him  enormous respect and affection, as well as official recognition. He was  appointed as vicar general of the churches in Connecticut by the Greek  Orthodox Archdiocese, and in 2017, he received an honorary doctorate of  divinity from Holy Cross Seminary. Father George is a prolific author  and is actively involved in community service, as chaplain of the  Stamford Fire Department, vice president of the local Council of  Churches and Synagogues, and a major in the U.S. Air Force Civil  Patrol.   I am honored to know Father George and his family for many years-- indeed, decades. I can attest firsthand to his wonderful generosity and  loyalty as a friend and his love for humanity, as well as the warm and  welcoming spirit of his congregants. I hope my colleagues will join me  in congratulating the Very Reverend Father George Poulos, his wife,  Christine, their five sons, and their six grandchildren on this  milestone of Father George's 100th birthday.                            ____________________
