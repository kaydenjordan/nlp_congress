 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kiley for  hosting this Special Order to oppose Deputy Secretary Su as the next  Secretary of Labor.   The Biden administration's radical Department of Labor attempted to  unconstitutionally fire 84 million Americans unless they took the COVID  vaccine and handed over their personal medical files to prove it.   Under Joe Biden's leadership, the Federal Government has been  weaponized to go after American workers, causing permanent damage to  small businesses and the lives of working Americans.   As vice chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce,  I support a full oversight investigation to hold the Biden  administration and Deputy Secretary Su accountable over OSHA's  unconstitutional and illegal COVID vaccine mandate.   My constituents miss having a booming economy full of good jobs and a  President who supports working families. In Congress, I will always  defend hardworking Americans from leftists who want to strip away our  freedoms and our ability to provide for our families.
