 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the  Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or CAPAC, I rise today to  honor our former colleague, the Honorable Eni Faleomavega of American  Samoa, who passed away last month.   Eni was a true patriot, leader, and friend who dedicated his life to  serving our country. His unwavering commitment to improving the lives  of all Americans was integrally woven into the fabric of his  distinguished military and public service career.   As a founding member of CAPAC, he was also a strong champion for the  Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community across  the country.   Throughout his nearly three decades in Congress, he led notable  efforts to secure critical funding for American Samoa and worked  tirelessly to cultivate stronger U.S. relations throughout the Asia- Pacific region.   It was a privilege to work with Eni, and I will never forget his  warmth and strong dedication to bettering our community and our  country.   I thank Eni for his lifetime of leadership and service and send my  thoughts to his family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
