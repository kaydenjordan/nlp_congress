 Madam President, I spoke yesterday about President  Trump's decision to remove the chief architect of Tehran's terrorism  from the battlefield, and I discussed the Senate's obligation to  approach this in a manner that is serious, sober, and factual.   It is right for Senators to want to learn more about the President's  major decision. Once again, I encourage all of our colleagues to attend  the classified briefing which the administration will provide tomorrow.  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the CIA Director will give a classified  context behind the President's decision, and they will discuss the  administration's strategy to protect our personnel and defend our  Nation's interests in the new landscape. I would ask every Senator on  both sides to bring an open mind to this briefing.   In particular, we should all remember that the history of Iranian  aggression began long, long before this news cycle or this Presidency.  In the decades since the Islamic revolution of 1979, as the White House  has changed parties and our administrations have changed strategies,  Tehran's simmering anti-American hatred, proxy violence, and steady  support for terrorism worldwide have remained entirely constant through  all of these years.   In effect, Iran has been at war with the United States for years.  While it has taken pains to avoid direct conflict, Iran's authoritarian  regime has shown no compunction about kidnapping, torturing, and  killing Americans since its earliest days--or Iraqis or fellow  Iranians, for that matter. From the 52 diplomatic personnel held  hostage in Tehran for 444 days back in 1979, to the hundreds of U.S.  servicemembers killed in bombings carried out by Iran's proxies--Beirut  in 1983, Riyadh in 1995, Khobar in 1996--to the hundreds more killed or  maimed in Iraq by the explosives and indirect fire attacks ordered by  General Soleimani himself, to the constant flows of resources and  equipment that prop up despots and terrorist organizations throughout  the region, Iran's game plan has been an open book: Use third-party  terrorism to inflict death and suffering on its enemies while avoiding  direct confrontation.   The threat Iran poses is, certainly, not new. Its violence is not  some unique reaction to President Trump or to Prime Minister Netanyahu  or to any other current leader. Violence runs in the bloodstream of  this evil regime.   In particular, our colleagues who apparently want to blame President  Trump for Iranian provocative foreign policy should reflect on the  previous administration's recent history.   Iran exploited President Obama's withdrawal from Iraq. Soleimani and  his agents filled the void and dramatically expanded Iranian influence  inside Iraq. They were able to impose a sectarian vision on Iraq that  disenfranchised the Sunnis, fueled the rise of ISIS, and plunged the  region into chaos.   Over in Syria, more weakness from the Obama administration opened yet  another door for Iran. The Democratic administration failed to confront  the Iranian-backed Assad regime as it slaughtered literally hundreds of  thousands of Syrians and displaced millions more. Once again, amid the  chaos, Soleimani worked and thrived.   Of course, all of this was the backdrop for the brazen, legacy- shopping  [[Page S32]]  nuclear arrangement that sent billions of dollars to fuel Iran's  further violence.   Even my friend the current Democratic leader knew it at the time.  Before he himself voted for a resolution of disapproval on President  Obama's deal, Senator Schumer said: ``After 10 years, if Iran is the  same nation as it is today, we will be worse off with this agreement  than without it.'' That was the Democratic leader, who opposed  President Obama's Iran nuclear deal, and the Democratic leader was  prescient, for that is exactly what happened.   The previous administration failed to confront Iran when necessary.  So the mullahs used their windfall from the disastrous nuclear deal to  double down on hegemonic aspirations all across the Middle East. A  Democratic administration just had 8 years to deal with the growing  threat posed by Iran, and it failed demonstrably. Iran was stronger and  more lethal at the end of the Obama Presidency than at the beginning.   So I would ask my Democratic colleagues today not to rush to lash out  at President Trump when he actually demonstrates that he means what he  says--when he enforces his redlines, when he takes real action to  counter lethal threats against Americans.   Wishing away tensions with Iran is really not an option. The Iranians  have spent decades making that perfectly clear to all of us. The  question is whether we as a body would prefer the administration to  stand by as Iran kills Americans or whether we are prepared to work  with the President to stand up to Tehran's terrorism and shadow wars.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, every day that the  House Democrats refuse to stand behind their historically partisan  impeachment, it deepens the embarrassment for the leaders who chose to  take our Nation down this road. You can't say we didn't warn them. You  can't even say they didn't warn themselves.   It was less than 1 year ago that Speaker Pelosi said: ``Impeachment  is so divisive . . . unless there's something so compelling and  overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that  path.'' That was the Speaker a year ago.   Back during the Clinton impeachment, it was Congressman Jerry Nadler  who said: ``An impeachment substantially supported by one of our major  political parties and largely opposed by the other . . . will lack  legitimacy.'' Chairman Nadler was right 20 years ago.   At this point, they may wish they had taken their own advice.   Instead, what the country got was the most rushed, least thorough,  and most unfair Presidential impeachment in American history, and now  the prosecution seems to have gotten cold feet. Nearly 3 weeks after  the rushed vote they claim was so urgent, they are still debating  whether or not they even want to see the trial proceed. They voted for  it 3 weeks ago.   The House Democrats say they are waiting for some mythical leverage.  I have had difficulty figuring out where the leverage is. Apparently,  this is their proposition: If the Senate does not agree to break with  our own unanimous, bipartisan precedent from 1999 and agree to let  Speaker Pelosi hand-design a different procedure for this Senate trial,  then, they might not ever dump this mess in our lap.   It is one cynical political game right on top of another. It was not  enough for the House to blow through its own norms and precedents and  succumb to the partisan temptation of a subjective impeachment that  every other House had resisted for 230 years. Now it needs to erode our  constitutional order even further. Those in the House want to invent a  new, sort of pretrial hostage negotiation wherein the House gets to run  the show over here in the Senate.   Meanwhile, they are creating exactly the kind of unfair and dangerous  delay in impeachment that Alexander Hamilton specifically warned  against in the Federalist Papers. This is already the longest delay in  American history between the impeachment vote and the delivery of the  House's impeachment message. It is almost as though this House Democrat  majority systematically took all of the Framers' warnings about  partisan abuses of the impeachment power--took everything the Founders  said not to do--and thought: Now, there is an idea. Why don't we try  that?   Impeaching a President is just about the most serious action that any  House of Representatives can ever take. How inappropriate and how  embarrassing to rush forward on a partisan basis and then treat what  you have done like a political toy. How contemptuous of the American  people to tell them, for weeks, that you feel this extraordinary step  is so urgent and then delay it indefinitely for political purposes. How  embarrassing, but also how revealing.   Speaker Pelosi's actions over the past 3 weeks have confirmed what  many Americans have suspected about this impeachment process all  along--that the House Democrats have only ever wanted to abuse this  grave constitutional process for partisan ends right from the  beginning.   Well, here is where we are. The Senate is not about to let the  Speaker corrode our own Senate process and precedents in the same way.  The first organizing registration resolution for the 1999 Clinton trial  was approved unanimously, 100 to nothing. It left midtrial questions to  the middle of the trial where they belong.   If that unanimous bipartisan precedent was good enough for President  Clinton, it should be our template for President Trump. Fair is fair.  The Speaker of the House is not going to handwrite new rules for the  Senate. It is not going to happen.   Look, these are serious matters. At some point in time, the  Democrats' rage at this particular President will begin to fade, but  the sad precedent they are setting will live on. The American people  deserve a lot better than this.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, at 11 a.m. tomorrow, the  Senate vote on the motions to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar Nos.  329, 462, and 525, in the order listed; further, that if cloture is  invoked on the nominations, all postcloture time be expired at 5 p.m.  tomorrow and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations with no  intervening action or debate; finally, that if confirmed, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 554.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, January 8; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Solomson nomination, under the previous  order.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Brown.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
