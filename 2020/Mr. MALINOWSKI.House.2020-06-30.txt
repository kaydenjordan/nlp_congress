 Mr. Speaker, this week 64 years ago, Dwight  Eisenhower signed the interstate highway bill; and as our chairman  keeps reminding us, we have been living off of that ever since.   Actually, in New Jersey, we consider ourselves lucky to get to work  on something built as late as the 1950s. Many of our bridges and  tunnels are over 100 years old and falling apart.   This bill will repair and replace that infrastructure. It invests in  projects important to the whole country, including our Gateway tunnel,  and includes provisions I wrote to ensure that those funds cannot be  held up for political reasons.   And, yes, it is a different infrastructure bill. It is something new,  and that is a good thing. We are encouraging smart highways and  materials. We are building mass transit that more people will want to  use, modernizing our electrical grid, deploying national  infrastructure, all of which will help us win the race with China to  build the clean energy economy of the future.   And we are doing all of this with the first true economic stimulus  bill of the coronavirus era, one that actually creates jobs rather than  simply preserving them.   I urge my colleagues to embrace the future and support this bill.
