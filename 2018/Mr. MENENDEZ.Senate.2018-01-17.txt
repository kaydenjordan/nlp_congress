 Mr. President, let me start off by thanking my  colleague from Colorado, who got here earlier than I and is giving me  the opportunity to move ahead. My daughter is in town. I would like to  see her, but this is important, and I appreciate his courtesy.   I am thankful for Senator Durbin. As someone who has been involved in  immigration reform for the better part of the 26 years that I have been  in the House and the Senate, his passion on this singular issue within  the overall immigration question is unquestionable in how we take care  of these young people--young people who, in every respect except for  birth, are Americans. It has been extraordinary. It couldn't have a  better champion, and I appreciate that.  [[Page S261]]    To my friend and colleague Lindsey Graham, I appreciate his courage  because it is not one of those things he really has to tackle. I  appreciate his understanding of the institution as to how to get there  and his knowledge in bringing people together. I don't always like what  I hear from him, but by the same token, he doesn't always like what he  hears from me, particularly on this issue. Nonetheless, he is an  extraordinary American.   To the rest of my colleagues and certainly Senator Bennet, who was  part of the Gang of 8, when we went through this a couple of years ago,  it passed in this very same body with 68 votes--comprehensive  immigration reform. Unfortunately, it just languished in the House of  Representatives or we wouldn't be talking about any of this, largely,  today. We would be well on our path to border security, well on our  path to future flows, well on our path to what immigration would look  like in the future, and, of course, a pathway for all of those who have  worked hard in this country and obeyed the law in every other respect.   To Senator Flake, who was part of that group, I really appreciate  him. We don't always agree on everything. On foreign policy, we have a  disagreement or two, but on this, we have been locked in laser-like. I  appreciate his willingness, especially in the final year he has decided  to serve here, to take on this challenge.   Look, we are about working on finding common ground on some of the  most pressing immigration issues that really go to so many things-- national security, the national economy. I cannot secure America if I  don't know who is here to pursue the American dream versus who is here  to do it harm. For that, one has to bring people out of the shadows and  into the light and have them go through criminal background checks to  know. I cannot thrust that economy even beyond--into warp drive unless  we have everybody fully participating in an open, above-the-ground  economy. One of the most urgent of these issues is the uncertainty  faced by 800,000 Dreamers across America who qualify for protective  status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which  we call DACA.   It is no secret that I deeply disagree with the President's decision  to end DACA. In my view, nothing good could come out of a decision that  jeopardizes the lives of 800,000 DACA recipients, including 22,000 in  my home State of New Jersey who are living lawfully under DACA and  working and studying across our country. This is a program for which I  advocated with the previous administration, with President Obama.  Congressman Gutierrez and I and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were  there and actually gave him legal memos written by attorneys from  across the country--experts in this field--as to why we thought he had  the power to do what he did. I still think that is true. Regardless of  that point, we are beyond that.   DACA was never a perfect program, nor was it a replacement for truly  comprehensive immigration reform--an effort to which I remain committed  today, as I was in 2013 when we passed those historic reforms to our  immigration system--the greatest pass in the Senate since the days of  President Ronald Reagan.   DACA still did tremendous good for this country. It allowed 800,000  upstanding, undocumented, bright young people who came to this country  as children, through no decision of their own, to come out of the  shadows, step into the light, and pursue their dreams without fear of  deportation, without fear that the knock at the door was not a member  of their family coming back home from work or their neighbor but an  immigration agent.   When we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about young men and women  who have grown up in America in every sense of the word. The only  country they know as home is the United States of America. The only  flag they pledge allegiance to is that red, white, and blue with the  stars, the flag of the United States. The only national anthem they  know and want to sing is ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' The only country  they know is America. They are not undocumented immigrants, they are  undocumented Americans who have proven themselves to be a great asset  to this Nation.   Dreamers are studying in our colleges, they are playing on our sports  teams, they are teaching in our schools, and they are wearing, as  Senator Graham talked about our military and the need to respond to the  economics of our military needs--many of these young people are wearing  the uniform of the United States, putting themselves at risk to defend  the only country they know. They are innovating in our economy,  enriching our communities, and otherwise obeying our laws, and most of  all loving this country because it is their country too.   Yet the administration has slapped an arbitrary expiration date on  their dream. In doing so, the President created a national emergency  and one that only Congress can solve. So this is what I and the Gang of  6 set out to do. Is this proposal ideal to me, the son of immigrants  representing one of the most diverse States in the Nation? I can tell  you, absolutely not. Is it ideal for my friend Lindsey or Senator  Flake? I would expect they would say no, but that is the reality of  compromise. That is what governing is all about. It is about making  tough decisions in order to advance the greater good. This deal is not  ideal to any of us, but it is acceptable to all of us. If more of our  colleagues join us, I believe it will be ultimately acceptable to the  President as well.   Despite the mixed messages sent by the administration, I have to  believe, in order to keep on going, the President meant what he said  when he called our Dreamers remarkable kids. I have to believe the many  times I heard him speak about the Dreamers with compassion, about  treating these bright young people with heart, I have to believe that  when I sat around that conference table with my colleagues at the White  House, the President meant what he said when he spoke of an immigration  system that encourages people to do a good job and to have a resolution  that is one of love. Well, I will tell all of my colleagues what I told  President Trump that day, once the cameras turned off and we had the  room to ourselves. I told him he had the political capital to spend;  that President Nixon was the ultimate anti-Communist, yet he was the  one who opened up China; that President Reagan was the most antitax  Republican ever elected, yet he ultimately saw the need to increase  rates. No one questions this President's harsh views on immigration,  which is precisely why he has the opportunity to do something big.   During last week's bipartisan summit, the President said that if  Democrats and Republicans reached a deal, he would sign it. He told us  to develop a proposal, one that resolved the DACA challenge and  protected America's Dreamers and addressed tough issues like border  security, family reunification, and diversity visas. He gave us that  charge, and we came together and ran with it. A lot of hours were  spent--many more by our staff--hashing out the issues in search of  common ground, and finally we arrived at an agreement that I believe  Congress can and must send to the President's desk before it is too  late.   Now, let me be clear. Striking this deal was no picnic. To my  Republican colleagues who say this bill isn't tough enough, I encourage  you to take a closer look. Look at the hard choices I had to make as  the most senior Hispanic American in the U.S. Congress, as the son of  immigrants whose parents' thirst for freedom brought them to these  shores, as the senior Senator for New Jersey, one of the most racially  and ethnically diverse States in the Nation.   Never could I have imagined, for instance, accepting fundamental  changes to the Diversity Visa Program because diversity, in my view, is  one of America's great strengths, and New Jersey is living proof. In my  State, it is hard to find any community that hasn't been touched in a  positive way by the Diversity Visa Program. I remind my colleagues,  every night in the darkest corners of the world, there are people who  pray with all of their might for the opportunity to win a diversity  visa--which, by the way, you have to pass all of the background checks,  criminal and otherwise, in order to still come to this country. It  isn't a grab bag. You still have to go through a series of background  checks. They aren't even looking to win $1 million, but they want to  win a one-in-a-million chance to come to America.  [[Page S262]]    I have never supported building a wall at our southern border--any  type--even when the President told us that Mexico was going to pay for  it, but the President must know this proposal includes billions of  dollars for his border security priorities, from barrier construction  and development to southwest border technology acquisition.   Then, of course, there are the restrictions on family reunification.  I don't believe in this chain migration. When you want to dehumanize  people, you talk about chain migration, family reunification, but  whatever you call it, the restrictions of family reunification are what  our Republican counterparts insisted upon--new limits on what some  divisively call chain migration.   For example, legal permanent residents in the United States will no  longer be able to sponsor their adult children to join them in America.  That is a big deal. For me, this was a tough decision as it imposes a  limitation on our legal system of family immigration, one I only  accepted after we secured other measures to streamline reunification  for spouses and young children.   That is not the only hard choice we had to make when it came to  family. Yes, this legislation gives Dreamers the opportunity to earn a  12-year path to citizenship, but the price we pay for that earned  pathway to citizenship is that we provide no such path for the parents  who brought the Dreamers here illegally. As a result, Dreamers will not  be able to petition for their parents, but their parents will be  eligible for temporary legal status and work permits. That is an  incredibly difficult choice for me, but we did it. Ultimately, I  accepted it because it keeps families together, which I have always  thought both parties were always about--family values, the family unit,  the family as the center of American life. So this proposal protects  parents from deportation. It leaves open the possibility to fight  another day to provide a pathway for parents to earn citizenship.   The President spoke of taking heat for a compromise on Dreamers. Let  me tell you this, as the most senior Hispanic American in Congress, I  will get a whole lot--and have already--of heat on these concessions,  but I will gladly take that heat in order to protect Dreamers who  deserve to stay in the only home--the only home--and the only country  they have ever known.   Look, we all know there will be voices on the far left and voices on  the far right that say this deal makes too many compromises. To my  friends in the immigration advocacy community as well as my Democratic  colleagues, I remind you that legislating is the art of the possible-- something I know we don't necessarily always get into our psyche, and  hopefully it will not be for much longer, but we are in the minority in  both Chambers of Congress. The opposing party occupies the White House.  We may not enjoy that reality--I certainly don't--but it is the reality  nonetheless. In this reality, sometimes stopping something bad from  happening is our best shot at making something good happen. The best we  can do is to stop something bad from happening in order to try to make  something happen, but, eventually, to make that something happen, we  are going to have to have a compromise that brings others to this  effort as well as we have here tonight. Without it, we fail the 800,000  Dreamers counting on us to reach the finish line.   To my Republican colleagues, I ask you to remember the tough  concessions we had to make so Dreamers have a chance to earn  citizenship in the countries they know and love. In short, this deal  was negotiated in good faith, with both sides making tough decisions in  service of the greater good. What good could be greater than keeping  American families together?   Consider the fact that 25 percent of DACA recipients are the parents  of a U.S.-born child. I refuse to believe we are a country that tears  young mothers and fathers away from American children to send them back  to countries they don't even know.   Let me close by reminding us that we all, I am sure, held  celebrations on Monday for remembering the life of Dr. Martin Luther  King. It was he who said:         We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We       are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this       unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a       thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief       of time.    My friends, the fierce urgency of now, as my colleagues have talked  about, is confronting us yet again. We cannot let the clock run out on  the American dream, we cannot keep tearing families apart, and we  cannot pass up this opportunity to make history right. Let's honor Dr.  King's legacy by treating this crisis with the urgency it deserves.   Join us, and together we can send this legislation to the President's  desk without delay. There is no time left to spare. If we want  America's Dreamers to have a future in this country, we must act as if  tomorrow were today.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleagues.   I yield the floor.
