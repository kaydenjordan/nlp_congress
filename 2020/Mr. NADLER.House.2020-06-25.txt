 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of the bill  (H.R. 7036) to amend the Anitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and  Reform Act of 2004 to repeal the sunset provision, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call  up the bill (H.R. 7120) to hold law enforcement accountable for  misconduct  [[Page H2440]]  in court, improve transparency through data collection, and reform  police training and policies, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7120.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the tragic and brutal death of George Floyd has been a  wake-up call for millions of Americans. Across the Nation and around  the world, the streets are lined with protesters demanding fundamental  change in the culture of law enforcement and meaningful accountability  for officers who commit misconduct. Today, we answer their call.   We value and respect the many brave and honorable police officers who  put their lives on the line every day to protect us and our  communities. We know that most law enforcement officers do their jobs  with dignity, selflessness, and honor, and they are deserving of our  respect and gratitude for all they do to keep us safe.   But we must also acknowledge that there are too many exceptions. Too  many law enforcement officers do not uphold the ethic of protecting and  serving their community. Instead, the reality for too many Americans-- especially for too many African Americans--is that police officers are  perceived as a threat to their liberties, to their dignity, and, all  too often, to their safety.   To those who do not believe it, look at these tragic statistics.  African Americans are more than twice as likely to be shot and killed  by police each year, and Black men between the ages of 15 and 34 are  approximately 10 times more likely to be killed by police than other  Americans.   This is not a new problem. Our country's history of racism and  racially motivated violence is rooted in the original sin of slavery,  lynchings, and Jim Crow, and systemic racism continues to haunt our  Nation. We see it in the rates of COVID deaths, in our system of mass  incarceration, and in the vast chasm of economic inequality, all of  which fall disproportionately on the backs of African Americans. We see  it in the harassment and excessive force that people of color routinely  face by far too many of our police officers.   An unmistakable message has been sent to African Americans in this  country that they are second class citizens and that their lives are  somehow of less value. Well, let me state clearly and unequivocally  that Black lives matter.   George Floyd mattered.   Breonna Taylor mattered.   Eric Garner mattered.   Amadou Diallo mattered.   Tamir Rice mattered.   Walter Scott mattered.   Laquan McDonald and so many others mattered.   Rayshard Brooks mattered, and the countless other people who have  lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement mattered.   For far too long, pleas for justice and reform have fallen on deaf  ears in Congress. But that changes today. The George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act would finally allow for meaningful accountability in cases  of police misconduct, and it would begin the process of reimagining  policing in the 21st century.   This legislation makes it easier for the Federal Government to  successfully prosecute police misconduct  [[Page H2454]]  cases. It effectively bans chokeholds, ends racial and religious  profiling, encourages prosecutions independent from local police, and  eliminates the dubious court-made doctrine of qualified immunity in  civil rights lawsuits against law enforcement officers.   At the same time, it works to prevent police violence and bias  through a series of front-end approaches aimed at encouraging  departments to meet a gold standard in training, hiring, de-escalation  strategies, bystander duty, use of body cameras, and other best  practices.   The bill also ends no-knock warrants in drug cases, stops the  militarization of local policing, and requires the collection of data  on a number of key policing matters which would be made public,  including the first ever national database on police misconduct  incidents to prevent the movement of dangerous officers from department  to department.   It also creates a new grant program for community-based organizations  to create local commissions and task forces on policing innovation to  reimagine how public safety could work in a truly equitable and just  way in each community.   I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), for her tremendous work in crafting a bill that  is at once bold and transformative, while also taking a responsible and  balanced approach to the many complicated issues associated with  policing.   I also want to thank the activists across the country who are leading  the protests. It is because of you that we are here today considering  the most significant reforms to policing in a generation. It is because  of your energy, your determination, and your demands for justice that  the Nation has awakened to the need for action.   I know that everyone in this Chamber mourns those who have lost their  lives at the hands of law enforcement. But today is our opportunity to  offer more than just sympathy. Today is our opportunity to show the  world that we are listening and that we will respond with real and  lasting reforms.   Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Pledges to study the problem are  not enough. Half measures are not enough. Pretend sham measures are not  enough.   We must not let this moment slip away. If we do, it will be a  terrible stain on our legacy.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning section       365 of H.R. 7120, the ``Justice in Policing Act of 2020.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that section 365 of the bill       contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Armed Services. I acknowledge that your       Committee will not formally consider H.R. 7120 and agree that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in H.R. 7120 which fall within your Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       7120, the ``Justice in Policing Act of 2020.'' There are       certain provisions in this legislation that fall within the       Rule X jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       we will not formally consider H.R. 7120. We do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Armed Services does not waive any future       jurisdictional claims over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.        Please ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have       worked regarding this matter and others between our       respective Committees.            Sincerely,                                                        Adam Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 24, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you concerning       section 362 of H.R. 7120, the ``Justice in Policing Act of       2020.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that section 362 of the bill       contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce. I acknowledge that your       Committee will not formally consider H.R. 7120 and agree that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in H.R. 7120 which fall within your Committee's       Rule X jurisdiction.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I write concerning H.R. 7120, the       ``Justice in Policing Act of 2020,'' which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce (Committee).        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 7120, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter       into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of       H.R. 7120.            Sincerely,                                                 Frank Pallone, Jr.                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, Mr. Jordan is correct. The Democrats in  the Senate did indeed oppose the Republican bill because that bill is a  sham designed to look as if it is doing something, designed to look as  if it is having some reform while, in fact, doing nothing, just more  sham and just more sham histrionics designed to make sure that nothing  real passes and that nothing changes.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  You have heard a lot of errant nonsense on the floor. But it must not  go unrebutted.   Ms. Bass, the chairperson of the Black Caucus and the chairperson of  our subcommittee talked personally to the Republican leader, Mr.  McCarthy, and got nowhere. The Committee on the Judiciary's staff  talked to the Republican staff of the Committee on the Judiciary and  got nowhere. The Republican amendments that Mr. Jordan advanced at the  markup, his wonderful amendments, included antifa, the Seattle  autonomous zone, stripping out the entire underlying legislation,  defunding police departments, and adding a death penalty to  antilynching legislation passed by the House.   Of course, we wouldn't accept these amendments. They couldn't utter  the phrase ``Black Lives Matter,'' and could barely engage the subject  of police reform. Instead, their amendments--and I have given you about  half of them just listed here--were errant nonsense, off-topic, dealing  with imaginary things like antifa, and completely negating the entire  purpose of the bill. They weren't interested in ``Black Lives Matter.''  They weren't interested in police reform. They were interested in pure  demagoguery. Of course, we would not accept their amendments.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline).                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we agree on some things; nothing meaningful. The  Republicans agree on studies, not on action. They agree on nothing that  will add accountability to the police, nothing that will prevent police  brutality, nothing that contributes in any way to Black Lives Matter.   They will not agree to banning chokeholds. They will not agree to  changing the mens rea statutes so we can hold brutal officers  accountable. They will not agree to banning no-knock warrants in drug  cases. They will not agree to ending qualified immunity.   They will agree to studies. They will agree to gestures. They will  agree to shams. Their whole approach is a sham, because they agree to  nothing meaningful, and they claim to be meaningful.   Their claim is a sham. They will do nothing that will add  accountability, nothing that will save one life, nothing that will put  one brutal policeman in jail. Nothing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman who just spoke referred to  the collective bargaining provision. He apparently hasn't read the  bill. That provision is in the bill. I suggest he read the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, the gentleman stated a moment ago, I think  he said 60 or 65 percent of police officers who got qualified immunity  did not violate the constitutional rights of the victims. Well, he is  conceding, in other words, that in 40 or 30 percent, or whatever it is,  of the time when qualified immunity is granted and holds officers  unaccountable, they have violated the constitutional rights of the  victims. That is one of the reasons why we must change the doctrine of  qualified immunity.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Richmond).                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Louisiana an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the assertion that we have  not been willing to work with the Republicans on this important  legislation. Allow me to set the record straight in detail on where we  are and how we got here.   We introduced a comprehensive policing reform bill 18 days ago. We  explained to our colleagues in the minority that we initiated the  process by developing comprehensive legislation with Senators Booker  and Harris as well as with members of our caucus. We also explained the  importance of moving quickly given the moment we were in as a Nation.   Since that time, we have indicated to the minority that if they are  interested in developing legislation that they could support, we needed  to understand how they wanted to change the bill and whether those  changes would lead them to support the bill.   Chair Bass has reached out to the minority leader and to Senator  Scott, and we have reached out to the minority over the course of the  last 10 days.   We held a hearing 2 weeks ago in which the minority invited three  witnesses.   The minority did not share a single amendment with us before last  week's markup. The minority refused our offer to review and work with  them on specific amendments they offered, that we indicated we could  support if we had the opportunity to review and discuss before we go to  the floor.   That is their right, of course, but in my experience, when a Member  would like the majority to support their amendments, they would  ordinarily share the text with us in advance. That did not happen here.   I would also note that some of what we saw is in the bill now, and we  have not received a single outreach regarding this important matter  from either the Trump White House or the Trump Department of Justice.   Again, in my experience, if there were a serious and good-faith  effort to enact legislation, the White House would seek to work with  both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol. That has not  happened thus far.   Chair Bass and I and the others on our side of the aisle have  remained open to a full and frank discussion with the minority about  their possible support of real and meaningful policing reform  legislation. That has not happened thus far.   But it is my hope that the Senate will take up meaningful  legislation--the legislation that Senator Scott has offered was hardly  meaningful--but I hope they will take up meaningful legislation and I  hope that we can work with them to pass meaningful legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, what do we hear from our Republican  friends? ``Marxism,'' ``antifa;'' anything but dealing with the  problem.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished majority whip of the  House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just today, we heard the following: ``We are just going to go out and  start slaughtering them.'' North Carolina cops fired after racist talk  of killing Black residents. ``Wipe them off the F'ing map. That will  put them back about four or five generations.''   That is why we say it is systemic racism.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), chair of the Crime, Terrorism,  and Homeland Security Subcommittee and sponsor of this important  legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that she may control the time  on the majority side.
