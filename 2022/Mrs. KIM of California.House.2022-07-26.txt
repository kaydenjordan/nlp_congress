 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, French  Hill, for yielding.   Families, workers, and small businesses are hurting from the highest  inflation in over 40 years, and in Southern California where I am from,  everything is more expensive.   Inflation doesn't discriminate. It impacts every American and hurts  small businesses and workers with less income the most.   For example, Raul and Rosalina Davis, owners of Tlaquepaque  Restaurant in Placentia, in my district, told my office: ``Higher gas  prices and issues with our supply chain are leading to increasing costs  from everything from beverages to meat for ingredients, to workforce  shortages. As a restaurant, we run our small business with very tight  revenue margins, and a small change in prices can really hurt our  bottom line. If we have to pass on higher costs to our customers, it  puts us in a tough place when we are competing against bigger  restaurants that can absorb higher costs.''   While the Biden administration calls inflation temporary and seeks to  redefine the long-established meaning of a recession, I have introduced  bills to combat inflationary spending, lower taxes on Californians, and  support job creators.    Policies from Congress should make life more  affordable, not less.
