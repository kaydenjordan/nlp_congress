 Madam Speaker, over half a million Americans have  been killed by a merciless virus. That is about the population of New  Haven, Connecticut. Now, also picture wiping out Grand Rapids,  Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; or McAllen, Texas.   Ten million Americans are unemployed right now. Nearly one in four  households have experienced hunger this year. These are horrible  statistics, but there is good news building on this floor right now.   President Biden promised help is on the way, and here it comes, the  American Rescue Plan, a real plan to crush the virus, put money into  people's pockets, allow our States and counties and cities to continue  to provide the services that are necessary.   No wonder up to 80 percent of Americans want all of us--all of us--to  vote ``yes'' tonight. Let's give it to them.
