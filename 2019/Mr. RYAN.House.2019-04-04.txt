 Mr. Speaker, due to a conflict on Thursday, April 4, 2019,  I was not present to cast my vote on the Republican Motion to Recommit  on H.R. 1585 and Final Passage of H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2019.   As a cosponsor of H.R. 1585, I wholeheartedly support reauthorization  of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Had I been present my vote  would have been NAY on Roll Call 155 and YEA on Roll Call 156.                            ____________________
