 Madam Speaker, yesterday's National  Prayer Breakfast brought to my mind the quote by President Lincoln: ``I  have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming  conviction that I had nowhere else to go.''   I, like Lincoln, feel inadequate to my task at times. I, like  Lincoln, seek strength and discernment from prayer. I need prayer.   It is not just Members of Congress that should be allowed to call  upon prayer. Students, like my three sons, and millions more, deserve  this powerful tool. That is why I thank the administration for their  recent decision to protect the right to pray in schools.   The freedom to seek strength from someplace other than ourselves  enriches this Nation, just as it enriched President Lincoln.                            ____________________
