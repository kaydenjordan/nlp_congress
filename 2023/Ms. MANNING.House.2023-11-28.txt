 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 793,  calling on Hamas to immediately release hostages taken during the  October 7 gruesome and savage attack on Israel. I am grateful for my  dear friend and colleague from Michigan, Representative Haley Stevens,  for introducing the resolution together with my friend, Representative  French Hill.   Representative Stevens' extraordinary leadership on hostage and  wrongful detention issues has given a voice to families of hostages and  detainees and helped ensure that we never relent in our pursuit of  bringing wrongfully detained Americans home.   The Hamas terror attack on October 7 resulted in the abduction of  more than 240 innocent civilians and the heinous murder of more than  1,200 people.   In specifically targeting a civilian population, Hamas' abductions  are among the greatest crimes against humanity. The sheer scale of the  casualties and murder is the greatest attack against the Jewish people  since the Holocaust.   Hamas has compounded the unimaginable human suffering it has caused  through the use of its own people and the hostages as human shields,  something we should never forget.   The hostages abducted by Hamas include civilians, soldiers, women,  children, grandparents, and Holocaust survivors. Many are Israeli. Some  are foreign or dual nationals, including American citizens.   Dozens of hostages have finally been released, thanks to the  painstaking, difficult, and necessary negotiations assisted by the  United States, including President Biden, and Qatar. I hope that, after  this latest round of releases, we will continue to work to bring home  all the remaining hostages.   This resolution calls attention to these abductions perpetrated by  Hamas. Hamas specifically captured these innocent people so they could  be used as bargaining chips and human shields while Hamas attempts to  wipe Israel off the map.   Yet, while the situation is dire, there is hope. There are  experienced public servants across the United States Government who  have already helped secure the release of some Americans and dozens of  other hostages from Hamas'  [[Page H5922]]  clutches. These dedicated officials in the White House, the Office of  the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, the Hostage  Recovery Fusion Cell, and elsewhere across our government continue  their tireless work to bring all the remaining American hostages and  all the hostages home.   This resolution is simple and straightforward. It condemns the  horrific actions of Hamas, correctly notes that hostage taking is a  violation of international humanitarian law, expresses solidarity with  the victims, and demands Hamas release all hostages immediately.   It is incredibly important that we give it our full support to send a  clear message about the need to bring them home. We must stand with the  hostages and their families in Israel and all over the world until they  come home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues and, in particular, Representative  Stevens for her tireless efforts on behalf of these Americans and their  families and all Americans taken hostage or wrongfully detained  overseas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the great State of Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I have spent the past 6 weeks meeting with families of  innocent civilians who were taken hostage by Hamas.   Just like the stories of Holocaust survivors, each story is unique.  Each story is heartbreaking because each of these hostages has loving  family members whose lives have been torn apart, who are living with  the agony of not knowing what has become of their loved ones. Are they  okay? Are they healthy? Are they injured? Are they alive? Will they  ever see them again?   I have heard stories that have brought me to tears, that haunt my  dreams, that should make all of us redouble our efforts to bring those  hostages home.   Mr. Speaker, the past few days have seen significant breakthroughs in  attempts to bring the hostages held by Hamas home to their families.  Dozens of hostages, including a few Americans, have been released,  especially over the past few days.   I applaud the efforts of this administration, Israel, Qatar, and  others who have worked to ensure that the temporary cease-fire holds  and that the agreed-upon hostages are released, but there is much more  work to be done.   Even after these last rounds of releases, dozens of hostages still  remain imprisoned by Hamas. This is unacceptable.   We cannot afford to go back to the status quo. It is imperative that  the United States, Israel, and our other allies and partners continue  to press forward with efforts to secure the release of all the  remaining hostages, including Keith Siegel from my State of North  Carolina, including Yarden Roman who made the excruciating decision to  hand her daughter, Geffen, to her husband, Alon, because he could run  faster to escape the terrorists and save their daughter.   Yarden herself is the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor whose  great-grandparents made the same excruciating decision to sacrifice  themselves for their daughter.   There are more than 150 more young people, mothers, fathers,  civilians, soldiers, Americans, Israelis, Thai, and others. We must  continue to work so that they can be brought home and reunited with  their families.   I strongly support this resolution. Again, I thank Representative  Stevens for all her work on this issue and on this resolution, and I  urge all my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 888 introduced by my  friends, Representatives Mike Lawler and Jared Moskowitz.   Mr. Speaker, on many occasions this House of Representatives has  reaffirmed Israel's right to exist, and it is important that we do so  again today. It is incomprehensible to me that after Hamas' horrific  terrorist attack on October 7, the largest attack on the Jewish people  since the Holocaust, we are seeing a growing wave of anti-Semitism rear  its ugly head at home and around the world.   Since Israel's independence in 1948 and its admission into the United  Nations the following year, international law has mandated Israel's  right to exist. Yet, as of this year, 28 of the 193 United Nation  member states still do not recognize Israeli sovereignty.   The terrorist organization, Hamas, has declared that Israel has no  right to exist and for decades has targeted Israel for destruction with  suicide bombs, with missiles and rockets, and most recently, with  gruesome and savage terror attacks targeting civilians.   The destruction of Israel and the killing of Jews is Hamas' sole  focus. They have murdered babies, raped women, executed parents in  front of their children, and massacred 260 young people at a music  festival. They have taken 250 innocent civilians, including American  citizens, hostage.   They are not working to help the Palestinian people who elected them.  Indeed, the Palestinian people are shamelessly used and abused by Hamas  as human shields.   As a proud, lifelong supporter of a two-state solution, I know that  with Hamas in control of 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, real progress  on a two-state solution cannot being achieved. Hamas has always only  ever played spoiler. The same is true of Iran's other regional proxies,  Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and others, who also exist only  to destabilize and destroy Israel, not to strive for a two-state  solution.   There cannot be peace when a party to a conflict doesn't recognize  the other parties' right to exist. With recognition comes peace and  mutual prosperity, security, and innovation. That is why efforts to  facilitate and expand the Abraham Accords are so historic and  important. The Abraham Accords countries, along with Egypt and Jordan,  all recognize this fact and are advancing their nations in the spirit  of regional cooperation and peace.   Here at home, whether it is on public streets, on college campuses,  or online, we have seen a deeply disturbing and aggressive increase and  despicable call for Israel to cease existing as a Jewish State.   The phrase, ``from the river to the sea,'' a sickening call for the  destruction of the State of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish  people, has become a rallying cry for those hoping for Israel's  destruction. Calling for total Palestinian control of all Israeli  territory from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea is a call to  eliminate the Jewish State of Israel.   This resolution states that denying Israel's right to exist is a form  of anti-Semitism. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. To be  clear, it is not necessarily anti-Semitic to criticize the State of  Israel or its leaders for particular policies. That is free speech, and  no country is above criticism for its policies, including our own. It  is absolutely anti-Semitic to treat Israel as a pariah based on the  claim that Jews alone should be denied the right to define themselves  as a people and to exercise any form of national self-determination.   This is the crucial difference. It is anti-Semitism, and we must  totally reject it.   In 2015, former President Barack Obama stated the following in an  interview: I think it would be a moral failing for me as President of  the United  [[Page H5925]]  States, a moral failing for America, and a moral failing for the world  if we did not protect Israel and stand up for its right to exist,  because that would negate not just the history of the 20th century, it  would negate the history of the past millennium.   Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with that statement. For thousands of  years, Jews have suffered persecution and lack the safety and stability  of a homeland. Today, the modern Jewish State of Israel thrives in the  ancient Jewish Holy Land where it is a robust democracy and productive  and treasured member of the international community of nations.    Israel has signed peace treaties with two of its most important  neighbors and has come to the table for many rounds of peace  negotiations with the Palestinians. Israel is a country that wants  peace, whereas Hamas and its Iranian patron do not.   Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people and will always remain a  place of refuge where Jews can be truly safe and control their own  destiny. Israel is certainly worthy of the support of this House and  the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Moskowitz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Amo), the newest member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the Jewish people have connections to the State of  Israel that go back thousands of years. Indeed, the Jewish people are  indigenous to that land.   Yes, Israel has a right to exist. This multicultural, multiethnic,  multireligious nation, a nation of laws, a nation with free speech and  free press, a nation of innovation, and a vibrant, thriving democracy,  an incredible country, has much to teach the world and will continue to  do so. This country, our only democratic ally in the Middle East, is  here to stay.   This resolution puts the House of Representatives on record as  affirming the State of Israel's right to exist. It recognizes that  denying Israel's right to exist is a form of anti-Semitism. It rejects  calls for Israel's destruction and the elimination of the only Jewish  state and condemns the October 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on the  State of Israel and its people.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge all my  colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  rise in strong support of H. Res. 683, introduced by my colleague,  Representative Monica De La Cruz.   I had the opportunity to support this resolution as it made its way  through the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage here.   Mr. Speaker, climate change has led to more prevalent and severe  climate events across North America and has affected us all. Lack of  rain, for example, has caused severe drought, impacting farming  communities and businesses that provide critical crops and jobs. Rising  temperatures have affected the volume and distribution of rainfall and  snowfall over time. Without water, farmers have had to make difficult  choices about whether to plant their crops, resulting in major losses  all around.   In these challenging times, I recognize the importance of engaging  constructively with our neighbors to resolve issues that may seem local  but have broad global implications and downstream effects. One instance  where we must improve our international cooperation concerns the share  of water between the United States and Mexico from the Colorado and the  Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande.                                time  1830    Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 683 recognizes that, as farmers in south Texas  experience greater water shortages, we must work with the Government of  Mexico to ensure its deliveries of water to the U.S. are made more  consistent and timely and encourages new commitments to be made for  that purpose.   I am particularly impressed by the International Boundary and Water  Commission's engagement this year to advance the goals of the 1944  treaty relating to the utilization of the waters of the Colorado and  Tijuana Rivers and the Rio Grande.   The Commission's work to ensure that commitments made to distribute  water are upheld in a timely manner and in the right quantities have  not gone unnoticed. No doubt these changes in regular access to water  will have a positive impact on those who grow the food and livestock we  depend on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  dialogue and diplomacy necessary to confront this urgent issue.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution recognizes that, as farmers in south  Texas are suffering from water shortages, dialogue and diplomacy will  be critical to ensuring that water deliveries from the Government of  Mexico, per the 1944 treaty, are made in a timely and consistent  manner.   H. Res. 683 supports the negotiations being undertaken to secure  water deliveries on an annual basis that would allow farmers to have  predictable quantities of water for their crops and their livestock.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution and urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
