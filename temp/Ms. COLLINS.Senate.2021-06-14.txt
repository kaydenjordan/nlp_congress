 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No PFAS in  Cosmetics Act. I am pleased to be partnering with Senator Blumenthal on  this important legislation. Our bipartisan bill seeks to ban the  inclusion of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in cosmetics  products, such as make-up, moisturizer, and perfume.   PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals, which includes PFOA, PFOS,  and GenX. These chemicals can bioaccumulate in our bodies over time and  have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease, liver damage, decreased  fertility, and hormone disruption. First developed in the 1940s, PFAS  are traditionally found in food packaging, nonstick pans, clothing,  furniture, and firefighting foam.   Unfortunately, Maine has experienced considerable PFAS contamination,  which has not only threatened our water supply, but adversely affected  the livelihoods of farmers. Several dairy farms in Maine recently  discovered serious levels of PFAS in their operations, with milk  containing as high as 1,420 parts per trillion. This is more than  twenty times EPA's established health advisory level for drinking  water.   In addition to these agricultural and water supply contaminations, we  now also know that PFAS appear in products across the spectrum-- including cosmetics. A new peer-reviewed study led by the University of  Notre Dame published in Environmental Science and Technology Letters  found high fluorine levels--indicating the probable presence of PFAS-- in just over half of 231 makeup products tested, including waterproof  mascara, liquid lipsticks, and foundations.   A subset of 29 samples was studied further to identify specific PFAS  chemicals. Between four and 13 specific PFAS were identified in each of  the 29 samples, some at high concentrations. Remarkably, only one of  these 29 products listed any fluorochemical ingredients on the  product's label. While some of these PFAS may be present in trace  quantities as impurities in the manufacturing process, those found at  high concentrations are likely being used intentionally to impart  performance characteristics to the product. Since fluorinated chemicals  are not disclosed on the labels, this study suggests that consumers  unknowingly are being exposed to PFAS in their cosmetics.   The findings of this study are particularly alarming, as many of  these products are subject to direct human exposure. For example,  lipstick is often inadvertently ingested, and mascara is sometimes  absorbed through tear ducts. In addition, during the cosmetic product  manufacturing process, workers are exposed to the chemicals that are  used, and discarded products with PFAS can cause the potential for  additional human exposure if drinking water sources are contaminated.   PFAS pose an unnecessary and avoidable risk to human health and do  not belong in our cosmetic products. The Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as ``articles intended to be rubbed,  poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied  to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting  attractiveness, or altering the appearance.'' This definition includes  skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and  facial makeup preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair  colors, and deodorant, as well as other similar products. Our  legislation would direct the FDA to issue a proposed rule banning the  intentional addition of PFAS in cosmetics, as defined by the FDA,  within 270 days of enactment, and require a final rule to be issued 90  days thereafter.   The FDA should act now to ban the addition of PFAS to cosmetics  products to help protect people from further contamination. I urge all  of my colleagues to join me in supporting the No PFAS in Cosmetics Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No PFAS in  Cosmetics Act.
