 Mr. President, I wish to express concern with section 709  of H.R. 2430, concerning over-the-counter, OTC, hearing aids.   I have a daughter who has worn hearing aids since she was a toddler.  I have firsthand experience with the kind of expertise needed by  providers to ensure that those who require a hearing aid have their  specific and unique medical needs met.   I believe that everyone on all sides of this issue desire the same  thing, and I appreciate Chairman Alexander working with me to get a  study relating to this matter. I believe that we are all working, in  sincerity, towards a goal of providing those who would benefit from  hearing aids with access to safe and effective products that will help  them live the kinds of lives which they choose and desire. That being  said, I am concerned about a policy which will create a division  between a healthcare provider and a patient who needs that provider's  expertise.   Thank you.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.
