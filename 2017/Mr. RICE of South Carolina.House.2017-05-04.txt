 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the  American people today who are being dragged down by this failing  disaster called ObamaCare. Since I first got to Congress, I have  consistently heard from people across the Seventh District of South  Carolina who have been negatively affected by ObamaCare.   We were told: If you like your plan, you could keep it.   We were told: Your premiums would go down by $2,500 per family.   We were told it would provide more choice. But what we have seen is  exactly the opposite. 232,000 South Carolinians' plans were canceled,  premiums have increased by double digits every year and are up by 28  percent this year. There is only one insurer left in South Carolina,  and they are threatening to pull out. The law is failing miserably and  getting worse.    This bill repeals harmful ObamaCare taxes across the board that drove  up healthcare costs and transitions health care to a more competitive,  patient-centered insurance market. There are still fixes that need to  be made to further improve health care, but this is a dramatic move  forward from where we are today and the first step in moving America's  health care from an unsustainable system to a sustainable one.
