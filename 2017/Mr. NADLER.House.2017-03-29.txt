 Madam Speaker, there is an obvious cancer at the heart of  the credibility, perhaps even of the legitimacy, of the Trump  administration. That cancer consists of questions pertaining to the  relationship of this administration with Russia.   We know that the Russians intervened in the last election with the  goal of advantaging Trump's campaign over Hillary Clinton. We know that  there were numerous Trump campaign transition team and administration  officials in contact with the Russians--prior to, during, and after the  campaign.   We know that there is a pattern of these individuals at first denying  such contacts but later, after being forced to come clean, admitting  them.   Examples to date include: former National Security Adviser Michael  Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roger Stone, who admitted  that he was in contact with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker that the CIA says  is a Russian front for military intelligence.   We know that the Attorney General gave false testimony, deliberate or  otherwise, to the Senate regarding meetings with Russian officials.   We know that President Trump has financial ties with Russia. Although  he denies it, we now know that there are large Russian investments in  The Trump Organization. The President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., said a  few years ago that money was ``flowing in'' from Russia. That obviously  can have a major influence on the President and on the decisions of his  administration.   We know that there was a change in the Republican platform dealing  with Ukraine to favor Russia, a change that was engineered by the Trump  campaign.   We even know who in the Trump campaign gave the instruction to make  this change.   We know that there is an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI of  possible collusion by the Trump campaign in the admitted Russian  intervention in the attempt by Russia to subvert the 2016 Presidential  campaign.   Knowing all this, it is impossible to ignore or to dismiss questions  concerning the credibility of the administration, and, certainly, we  must ask questions regarding its legitimacy as well, if there is  persuasive evidence that crimes were committed in colluding with Russia  to subvert the election.                                time  1730    We have a duty to resolve this question, to get answers, to pursue  the truth, and to remove any cancer that we may find.   A few weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee considered a resolution of  inquiry that I introduced dealing with a number of issues, including  the President's conflicts of interests, his possible violations of the  Constitution's Emoluments Clause, and any information about possible  criminal or counterintelligence investigations related to the President  and/or his associates. Yet, to date, the Republicans have opposed our  amendments and voted down our resolutions of inquiry, in effect,  abdicating their constitutional obligation to provide oversight and  enforce the law.   Now we have the spectacle of the chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee conducting an obvious coverup, failing to share important  information with members of the committee--information, I would add,  that revealed President Trump's allegations against former President  Obama as completely false--while inappropriately briefing people at the  White House on the committee's investigation, the very same people who  are the subjects of the investigation.   This is so absurd, so inappropriate, and beyond belief that it is  tough to accept the reality of the situation. Sadly, this isn't a  television drama we can turn off or walk away from. The integrity of  our democratic system of government is at stake.   What we need is honesty. The American people must have faith in the  integrity of our government, and it is our job to ensure it. It is time  for answers.   If there is no evidence of misconduct, then we should move on. But if  the truth reveals a conspiracy, if there is proof of criminal conduct,  Donald Trump must be held accountable, and the people around him must  be held accountable, and we must act.   There is no superior way to get at the truth and to fulfill our duty  to the people of this country than to have an independent investigatory  commission established beyond any partisan control. So I urge that that  be done so that the people of this country can have confidence once  again in their government.
