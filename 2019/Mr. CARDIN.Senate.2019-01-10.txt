 Madam President, as Leader Schumer has pointed out,  starting today, 800,000 Federal workers are going to be missing their  paychecks. In this region, there are 140,000. Senator Van Hollen and I,  representing Maryland, and Senators Warner and Kaine, representing  Virginia, have made the point of what this is going to mean for  families in our communities.   This shutdown is outrageous and dangerous--caused by President Trump.  Workers are not going to be receiving their paychecks and are going to  be at risk. Our whole country is at risk. Let me put this in  perspective, if I might. It is like AT&T, General Motors, Apple,  Lockheed Martin, Google, and ExxonMobil laying off their entire  workforce at one time. That is the impact we have now with 800,000  workers not receiving their paychecks. Kevin Hassett, who is the Chair  of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, points out that this  will cause a $1.2 billion-per-week hit on our economy.   America is being held hostage by President Trump--held hostage over  his desire to have a wall built. It is not about border security. We  have already appropriated funds for border security, and we are  prepared to continue to protect our borders. This is about President  Trump and his wall. We should open government and work together for the  American people.   There are seven appropriations bills that have not yet been acted  upon. With six of those appropriations bills, there is no controversy.  They have nothing to do with the border wall. They have nothing to do  with homeland security. These are six appropriations bills that this  body has already acted on in one way or the other. They include  Financial Services and General Government, Agriculture, Interior and  Environment, and Transportation-HUD. Those four appropriations bills  passed this body by a vote of 92 to 6. Then, there are State-Foreign  Operations, which passed the Appropriations Committee unanimously, and  Commerce-Justice-Science, which passed by a vote of 30 to 1.   These six appropriations bills have already been acted on under  Republican leadership in a bipartisan manner in this body. That is  exactly what H.R. 21, which is pending before this body, incorporates.  It is not a Democratic effort; it is to reaffirm what this body has  already done and allow these six appropriations bills to pass and for  those workers and those Agencies to be fully operable without the  hostage-taking by the President of the United States.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 5, H.R. 21,  making appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, if I could, very briefly.   I am extremely disappointed. I can assure you, the majority leader,  this is not a show vote issue with 800,000 Federal workers being denied  their paychecks. The last time I checked the Constitution, we are a  coequal branch of government, and we should act as a coequal branch of  government and pass legislation that is overwhelmingly supported by  this body.    Madam President, I might return the question and ask the  distinguished majority leader whether his objections to reopening the  government with action we have already taken previously is absolute. I  can assure the majority leader that it is my commitment to our Federal  workers and to our country that the first order of business here should  be the reopening of government. There are other important issues we  need to do that I strongly support. I, quite frankly, do not understand  the majority leader's position as to why he would deny us a vote on  reopening government that passed this body unanimously in the past.    Madam President, of course I would repeat my request of  the distinguished majority leader whether his objections are absolute.   Let me just point this out. We passed the bill that I asked unanimous  consent--basically that has been passed nearly unanimously by this  body--92 to 6 for these appropriations to pass. The last time I checked  the Constitution, that is enough even for a veto override. I don't  think anything has changed. These bills have nothing to do--zero to do  with the Homeland Security wall issue. Zero. So why doesn't our  distinguish majority leader, as the leader of a coequal branch of  government, allow us to speak on behalf of our responsibilities under  article I of the Constitution? Let us take our action that we can take  right now, today, at this very moment, and pass six appropriations  bills where there is no controversy whatsoever in this body.    My first order of priority right now, since we can do  this at this very moment, is to reopen the government. It is outrageous  that the government is closed. People's lives are being affected every  minute. I heard just yesterday of a layoff of another 180 jobs in my  State because the Department of Agriculture is closed. We have an  important economic development program in Baltimore, and HUD can't act  on the papers right now. That is being delayed.   To me, that is something we can get done right now. As a Senator from  Maryland, I am going to use every opportunity I can to reopen  government in a responsible manner. I am disappointed that the majority  leader is not using the opportunity we have right now to pass six  appropriations bills that are not in controversy.   If the majority leader could answer for me, why are we holding up  these six bills that have nothing to do with the central debate  argument? We can put enough votes on the board to show the President of  the United States that he doesn't have the support in the Senate, and  we have the votes to override his veto. To me, that should be our first  order of business.    Madam President, I will express my views on issues. I  don't need the majority leader trying to express how I will vote on  future issues. I will answer to the people of Maryland on how I will  act on issues that are up before the Senate.   My top priority right now is to reopen the government, and I am very  disappointed that the majority leader will not allow us to act as a  coequal branch of government.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a few moments I am going to yield the  floor to Senator Kaine to make a unanimous consent request that has  been cleared by both sides, and I am very pleased about that. This is  in regard to S. 24, legislation that I have filed with several of my  colleagues.   I particularly thank Senator Kaine, but I also want to thank my  colleagues Senator Van Hollen and Senator Mark Warner for their work,  as well as Senator Collins and others in this body who cosponsored that  legislation. It is legislation very similar to what we passed in the  last hours of the 115th Congress by unanimous consent. It does what I  think all of us have said we want to make sure is done; that is, when  we reopen government, those who have been working without pay and those  who are on furlough without pay will get their backpay. I think that is  at least some assurance to our government workforce that when we  finally reopen government, they know they will be getting their  paychecks. I think it is a very important point to give them at least  that comfort.   I don't want to minimize the risk factors that we have for the  800,000 Federal workers who are not getting their paychecks. Just  today, I found a letter from a constituent. I am going to read it very  briefly.   ``Dear Senator Cardin, As an Air Traffic Controller and Maryland  constituent, I want you to know how the partial government shutdown is  affecting me and my family. Today, I received my Earnings and Leave  statement from the Department of Transportation, indicating I received  $0 for my last 2 weeks of working at the FAA-Washington Enroute Air  Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, VA. I have proudly gone to work for  this job that I love, and always maintain the highest level of safety.  My husband Brad is also a controller with me at Washington Center, and  his Earnings and Leave Statement was for $1.34. We cannot sustain our  financial obligations on a total of $1.34 for our last two weeks of  work! We recently were able to build a new house to try to start a  family, and we still have increased financial obligations because of  that and all that entails. In addition, my family, my brother and  father, has minimal income now, and we are supporting them. My father  is 69 years old and currently has an enlarged hernia that requires an  operation, he has no health insurance, and no income. He lives in NH,  and is on even more medication now. The side effects are greatly  affecting him. He needs my help, and I don't have the resources now to  help him. He is suffering so much, and I love him greatly. My brother  recently had to weather a separation from his wife, and has been unable  to find affordable housing in MD on a single income for him and my  niece and nephew--Ayden 10 years and Ava 7 years old. They have been  living in our basement since August 2018, and we have been supporting  them in every way we can until he can get back on his feet. I love them  so much, and now I can't continue to help them. This hurts so much, we  need our pay checks to support our family now!''   It ends by saying: ``Please help in any way you can to END THIS  SHUTDOWN NOW!''   I couldn't agree more. I urge our colleagues, hopefully in the next  couple of days--even before that--to end the shutdown. But at least, as  a result of the unanimous consent request that will be made very  shortly, which has cleared both sides, we can tell them that the pay is  coming.   I see the distinguished majority leader is here. We had some words  earlier. I want to thank the majority leader for accommodating this  unanimous consent. It is consistent with what the leader has said in  the past, that we will make sure our workers get paid when the  government is open.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to  thank Mae Stevens, a member of my legislative staff, for her service on  my behalf to the people of Maryland and the Nation. Mae Stevens has  served as my environmental policy adviser since 2015. In this role, she  has advanced my priorities as the ranking member of the Transportation  and Infrastructure Subcommittee on the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee. She has dedicated much of her time as a member of my  staff to formulating and advancing sound policies at the intersection  of drinking water, wastewater, stormwater, source water protection,  equity, and affordability. I very much appreciate all that we achieved  during her tenure in my office. Mae has spent more than 7 years on  Capitol Hill and, 9 years prior to that, at various nonprofit  environmental organizations.   Mae enrolled at Columbia University's School of International and  Public Affairs to earn a master of public administration from  Columbia's Earth Institute. After Mae received her MPA, she worked as a  policy adviser in the clean energy program at Third Way. From there,  she joined the office of Representative Russ Carnahan, who represented  Missouri's Third Congressional District. Later, she worked for  Representative Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, who represented the  17th Congressional District at the time.   Mae learned about hard work from her parents. Her father Raymond  ``Art'' Stevens owned an ice cream parlor in Royal Oak, MI, and her  mother Jaky Van Dox dressed mannequins in clothing stores in the metro  Detroit area. They spent every extra penny they had on ice skating  lessons for their daughter, teaching her the grit, dedication, and  perseverance she uses every day in my office. I know they are extremely  proud of the good work she has done in my office and will continue to  do in private sector.   Mae believes that people in every community across America--urban,  rural, and suburban--have a right to expect that the water coming from  their tap is safe to drink and that Congress will do everything within  its power to ensure that happens. Mae helped me to ensure that, for the  third Water Resources Development Act--WRDA--in a row, Congress  included updates to our Nation's drinking water, wastewater, and  stormwater infrastructure to meet our water infrastructure backlog  demands, while addressing the needs of our communities and our  environment.  [[Page S139]]    Mae also fought for Maryland priorities in the Senate's 2018 WRDA,  including helping me double the amount of Federal funding spent on  drinking water infrastructure, nationally and at the State level, and  reauthorize the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, WIFIA,  a low-cost financing mechanism for large water infrastructure projects.  Baltimore, MD, is one of 12 projects in nine States that will receive  the first of the WIFIA grants in 2019. This will help the 1.8 million  people served by the Baltimore Department of Public Works continue to  have some of the cleanest, safest, and more reliable drinking water in  the country.   Clean water is not a partisan issue, and Mae worked with her  colleagues on both sides of the aisle and Capitol Hill to develop  legislation that will benefit our aging water resources and  infrastructure. The Senate passed the 2018 WRDA reauthorization by a  vote of 99-1, a testament to the hard, bipartisan work of the majority  and minority staff on EPW, personal staff like Mae, and the committee  members. I was proud to be involved.   Mae conscientiously strives to reduce her personal carbon footprint.  One way she does this is by commuting to and from work on her bike. She  helped me to increase funding for the Transportation Alternatives  Program, TAP, and ensure that cities and counties continue to have a  voice in how Federal dollars are spent on these important programs in  the Fixing America's Surface Transportation--FAST--Act.   As the British primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall has  said, ``"You cannot get through a single day without having an impact  on the world around you. What you do makes a difference and you have to  decide what kind of a difference you want to make.'' I want to thank  Mae Stevens for the difference she has decided to make--and will  continue to make--and wish her the best of luck in her future  endeavors. Of course, even though she is leaving the Hill, she will  always be a member of Team Cardin.                            ____________________
