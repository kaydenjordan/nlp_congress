 Madam Speaker, I wish to recognize and congratulate the  Folsom High School football team on winning the 2023 CIF Division 1A  State football championship, beating St. Bonaventure this weekend 20- 14. This is Folsom's fifth State championship since 2010, their first  since 2018. Head coach Paul Doherty got his team to buy in, and  together they were able to achieve remarkable things, with Defensive  Coordinator Sam Cole taking the reins and making life for the St.  Bonaventure offense rather difficult.   Sophomore quarterback Ryder Lyons opened the score in the first  quarter, and Folsom held the lead at halftime. St. Bonaventure battled  back and led 14-13 with less than 3 minutes left. Then Folsom's defense  stopped the St. Bonaventure offense and took over with a little more  than 2 minutes to go.   Lyons led his team downfield and completed a touchdown pass to  Jameson Powell with 20 seconds to go.   Coach Doherty and Coach Cole's defense held from there, and the  Folsom High School football team won the championship, capping off an  amazing 12-2 season.   Coach Doherty and the Folsom Bulldogs should be congratulated on  winning the championship of the entire State. We know how hard they  have worked. This team brings so much pride to the city of Folsom, and  I congratulate all the players on a very well-deserved victory and  amazing end to your season.                       Free Speech on College Campuses     Madam Speaker, Harvard University's leadership today  announced that they will be retaining President Claudine Gay, despite  acknowledging President Gay's repeated failures to adequately condemn  terrorism and anti-Semitism.   Now, the university will have to answer for why it takes these  matters less seriously than the University of Pennsylvania, which  recently forced out its president. As disappointing as this is, the  refusal of one university to make a needed personnel change is not  going to stop the momentum for far-reaching reform that we are seeing  in higher education. This is a moment of reckoning for higher education  in this country, where the true character of our universities has been  laid bare for the world to see.   Even before last week's shocking testimony by the presidents of  Harvard, MIT, and Penn, many in this country were asking the question:  How is it that our leading academic institutions have been gripped by  such an ancient and retrograde prejudice as anti-Semitism? How is it  that institutions that have been suppressing free speech for years  suddenly discovered the First Amendment as a reason not to condemn  terrorism or to stop Jewish students from being bullied and harassed?  How is it that university leaders who have waded into every political  issue of the day suddenly felt bound by institutional neutrality when  it came to the  [[Page H6856]]  murder of children? How is it that bureaucracies devoted to diversity,  equity, and inclusion turned a blind eye to the targeting the Jewish  students and, in some cases, even contributed to that hostile  environment?   Yes, this is a moment of reckoning. Our universities cost too much,  their degrees deliver too little value, and they have become among the  most intolerant places in American life. This is a time to rediscover  the purpose of higher education so that our universities are once again  leading lights in American life, are national assets, are places of  community and belonging and truly higher learning.   Tonight, I would like to take a moment to suggest a path forward by  identifying 10 principles for a fundamental cultural change at our  universities. I want to say first that this is a process, a  conversation, that should be taking place at universities themselves  with alumni, with students, with faculty, with administration, with all  stakeholders.   Congress does have a role to play. The Education and the Workforce  Committee has already announced a congressional investigation into the  three universities that we heard from last week and others about their  failure to adequately address anti-Semitism on campus.   In a broader sense, Congress has a role to play because of the large  amounts of Federal funding that go to even private institutions. The  founder of OpenTheBooks reported that Harvard and Penn are now more  Federal contractor than educator, collecting more on government  contracts and grants than undergraduate student tuition. The group  discovered that between 2018 and 2022, Harvard received $3.13 billion  in total Federal payments, which includes Federal grants and contracts,  while Penn received $4.38 billion in payments.   Yes, Congress has a clear interest in what is happening at our  universities and not just from the perspective of oversight of our  funds but also because universities are incubators for our broader  culture.   So many of the problems in our country today--censorship, the  explosion of DEI, a redefinition of merit as something unaligned with  excellence or even at odds with it--had their origins on campus, which  brings us back to the present crisis of anti-Semitism.   By now, the world has seen the shocking testimony of President Gay  and her counterparts at Penn and MIT, refusing to condemn a call for  genocide against the Jewish people as a violation of campus policies.   Even prior to that testimony, over the last 2 months, President Gay's  inaction created an environment on Harvard's campus where at the time  of our hearing, she could not even say if Jewish students will feel  safe and welcome. I asked her that several times, and she refused to  answer: Could you look the family of a prospective Jewish student in  the eye and tell them that their son or daughter would feel safe and  welcome on your campus? She refused to even answer the question.   In the aftermath of October 7, President Gay's carefully parsed  statements, her silence, her Orwellian use of the passive voice, made  it very clear that she sees the forces of anti-Semitism as a  constituency that needs to be catered to--that sends a signal on her  campus. It sends a signal that was clearly received by the forces of  anti-Semitism on her campus, that reverberated across American higher  education and seeped into our broader culture.    We can't simply say that this problem has only taken hold in the last  couple of months. The reality is that anti-Semitism has been growing on  college campuses and prior to October 7 had reached an all-time high.  Many have been speaking about this issue with a growing sense of alarm.   For me, the extent of the problem, and the extent to which the  universities themselves are serving to exacerbate the problem, really  hit home for me in early 2020 when California released a proposed  ethnic studies curriculum. This was a 550-page curriculum that was  designed by ethnic studies leaders from various school districts and  universities appointed by the State's board of education. It received  support from 22 California State ethnic studies departments and  education leaders throughout the State.   The curriculum was broadly, universally condemned on both sides of  the aisle, from people of all points of view. Indeed, Governor Gavin  Newsom said at the time that it was offensive in so many ways and would  never see the light of day. Among the problems with the curriculum, the  biggest, the most deeply problematic, was the many instances of anti- Semitism.   This is what was written by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus,  a group of legislators in our State legislature, in response to the  proposed curriculum. They wrote that the curriculum: Erases the  American Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces  negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and  would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our  public schools.   The letter goes on: Jews are essentially excluded from the  curriculum. We have been advised that this exclusion appeared to be  intentional and reflected the political bias of the drafters. They  called it deeply insulting, fundamentally inconsistent with the  purposes of ethnic studies, harmful to Jewish and non-Jewish students,  and indicative of an anti-Jewish bias in the curriculum that would be  dangerous to institutionalize.   The letter goes on: In the few instances where the curriculum  acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory  manner. For example, it recommends song lyrics that inappropriately  delve into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a strong bias and  little nuance. The curriculum asserts that Israelis ``use the press so  they can manufacture'' a classic anti-Semitic trope about Jewish  control of the media.   The letter states: It is difficult to fathom why the State of  California would want to actively promote a narrative about Jews that  echoes the propaganda of the Nazi regime.   This was a few years ago where you had a panel of university leaders  proposing, at the behest of the California State legislature, a  curriculum that, by the way, was going to be a graduation requirement  for every high school student in the country, and the State's own  Legislative Jewish Caucus said that it echoes the propaganda of the  Nazi regime.   This has been a problem growing at our universities for some time,  and the failures of President Claudine Gay the last 2 months, and her  shocking testimony at our hearing last week, simply put the deeply  anti-Semitic currents in our universities on stark display.   Now, at the same time that we have seen this rise in anti-Semitism on  college campuses, there have been many other deeply troubling trends.  Indeed, what made President Gay's tolerance for anti-Semitism all the  more morally abhorrent was that this was coming from a president whose  university ranked dead last, 248 out of 248, in free speech rankings  released earlier this year. Yet, here she was at our committee hearing  talking about her university's ``commitment'' to free expression.   The rankings that found Harvard to have come in dead last--in fact,  Harvard got the worst score in the history of the rankings--cited  surveys of Harvard students where just over a quarter of students  reported that they are comfortable publicly disagreeing with their  professor on a controversial political topic--just over a quarter  comfortable disagreeing with a professor on a political topic. Only a  third of students said it is very or extremely clear the administration  protects free speech on campus. Even 30 percent said using violence to  stop a campus speech is at least acceptable on some occasions. Truly  shocking statistics.   These problems have both been getting worse. As anti-Semitism has  risen, so has the suppression of free speech. Indeed, even President  Obama, several years ago, spoke about this issue. In 2016, Obama said:  There has been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to  disinvite speakers with a different point of view or disrupt a  politician's rally. Don't do that, Obama said, no matter how ridiculous  or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths.  There will be times when you shouldn't contradict your core values,  your integrity, and you will have the responsibility to speak up in the  face of injustice. But listen. Engage. If the other side has a  [[Page H6857]]  point, learn from them. If they are wrong, rebut them. Teach them. Beat  them on the battlefield of ideas. That is what President Obama said in  2016.    That same year, the head of the University of California, Janet  Napolitano, discussed this in an editorial where she wrote that the  sanctity of free speech in our country is hardly guaranteed, at least  not on our college campuses. Napolitano, by the way, was a member of  President Obama's cabinet and the Democrat Governor of Arizona.   She went on to warn how far we have moved from freedom of speech on  campuses to freedom from speech. She said we have moved from freedom of  speech on campuses to freedom from speech.   Indeed, the rise of anti-Semitism and the suppression of free speech  on college campuses has gone hand in hand. I saw the degree of this  when I was a State legislator and proposed the Free Speech on Campus  Act. That legislation got support from dozens of Jewish-American groups  who had seen how the suppression of free speech was used to exclude  people, to shut down speakers who represented their point of view or  were of their background.   In fact, earlier this year, we saw California university student  groups actually say they were not going to allow speakers based upon  their views on the State of Israel.   This is a very important point. It is the same university culture  that has given us speech code, safe spaces, microaggressions, bias  reporting systems, and all of the other threats to free speech and free  inquiry that we see on campus today. That same university culture has  also given us widespread prejudice of a kind we never would have  expected to see in America in the 21st century.                                time  1930    Something has gone terribly wrong with higher education in this  country. There is a particular culture in higher education that is in  many ways detached from reality, a world unto itself, divorced from the  norms of frankly either political party, as we saw in the bipartisan  condemnation of the university presidents last week, or even basic  American institutions.   Now is the time to uproot that culture and to reform higher education  in America, to return our universities to their guiding purposes.  Figuring out the path forward is going to take a lot of different  perspectives.   I want to list, very briefly, 10 basic principles that I think can  guide that process. If pursued in earnest, it can return our  universities to being national assets rather than institutions that are  accelerating our country's decline.   The first principle, of course, is a commitment to freedom of speech.  This should be codified in a statement like the University of  Chicago's. It should be aligned with the principles of the First  Amendment with narrowly defined exceptions, as the Supreme Court has  defined. Importantly, one of those exceptions is bullying and genuine  harassment.   A second guiding principle is academic freedom so that students and  professors alike do not have to fear negative repercussions based upon  the type of research they choose to undertake or the points of view  that they choose to express.   A third principle is institutional neutrality. Fareed Zakaria, in a  widely shared clip from CNN, has said: ``The American public has been  losing faith in these universities for good reason.'' He said there has  been a ``broad shift'' as universities have gone from ``being centers  of excellence to institutions pushing political agendas.''   Universities themselves should not be political actors but rather  should be forums where ideas can be debated and discussed and where  students can be exposed to a wide variety of views and come to their  own conclusions.   A fourth guiding principle is upending the DEI bureaucracy, which has  given us safe spaces and trigger warnings. It has taught students to  look at each other through the lens of distrust, which has bred hate  and division and taught students to hate our country.   A recent op-ed in The Washington Post by Danielle Allen said this:  ``I was one of three co-chairs of Harvard's Presidential Task Force on  Inclusion and Belonging, which in 2018 delivered a strategic framework  for the campus.'' She said, ``Many are chalking up current  controversies to diversity, equity, and inclusion work, and the task  force's report was a contribution to that field broadly understood.''  But, she said, ``Across the country, DEI bureaucracies have been  responsible for numerous assaults on common sense.''   A fifth guiding principle is to allow for ideological diversity among  administrators, students, and faculty. One report showed that 1 percent  of Harvard professors identify as conservative. That is not a healthy  environment for the flourishing of a free exchange of ideas.   A sixth guiding principle is eliminating foreign influence at our  universities so that our universities are not being funded by China and  other adversaries of the United States.   A seventh guiding principle is to return to core and real academic  disciplines and to get rid of those that do not have any academic value  or merit or adhere to the traditional norms of scholarship. This would  include redefining core curriculums in such a way that students have a  common set of knowledge that they come out of universities with.   An eighth guiding principle is to revive trade schools and the  teaching of practical skills, crafts, and professions at our  universities as well as, by the way, in our secondary and primary  schools. This is so every student doesn't feel like they have to go to  university in order to get the skills and qualifications to get a good- paying job.   A ninth guiding principle is to make our universities more affordable  so that tuition does not continue to skyrocket in a way that the  Federal Government has fueled and so that students are not left  hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in some cases.   A final principle, which in many ways encapsulates all the others, is  to return to excellence as the real, true, overarching guiding  principle of our universities--excellence in all of its forms.   This would mean getting rid of grade inflation. It would mean  revisiting admissions standards. It would mean restoring standardized  tests, which have given people from all walks of life an opportunity to  choose their excellence. It would mean having a culture of debate and  discussion on campus where the better idea wins, and each student can  make that decision for themselves.    If our universities truly come to value excellence again, then that  will be the characteristic of their graduates and the future leadership  of our country, as well.   This is a moment of reckoning in higher education. It is a moment to  rediscover the purpose of a university as a center for research, as a  place to explore cutting-edge ideas, and as a place to prepare young  people for the task of citizenship, which goes to the heart of what our  country is all about, this great experiment that our Founders started  in self-government.   Rethinking our institutions of education and higher learning is going  to be vital to making sure that that experiment continues to flourish  in the years and decades ahead.
