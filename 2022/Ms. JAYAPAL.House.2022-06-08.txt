 Madam Speaker, the Protecting Our Kids Act is about  saying no more to mass shootings, no more to children murdered in  schools, no more to Black people murdered at the grocery store, no more  to doctors being murdered in hospitals, no more to losing our children,  our fathers, mothers, siblings, and friends in this uniquely American  epidemic of gun violence.   The families who have lost loved ones know that these deaths are not  inevitable. We need to act now.   This bill has simple but effective solutions: Raise the minimum age  to 21 to buy a semiautomatic rifle, prohibit gun trafficking and high- capacity magazines, require safe storage, and crack down on ghost guns  and bump stocks.   Had these protections been enacted in 1999, they would have stopped  at least 35 recent mass shootings and saved over 400 lives.   Today, we can choose to mean it when we say ``never again.'' Vote  ``yes.'' Save lives. Save children. Save our communities.
