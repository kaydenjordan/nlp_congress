 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No.  85.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment No. 85.   My amendment imposes important limits on any Department of Energy  plan so that our adversaries, including Iran, Russia, China, and North  Korea, can't capitalize on American domestic energy production.   We must take steps to ensure any plan involving a drawdown of our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve and any increase in energy production does  not benefit those doing business with or under the influence of nations  like China, Russia, terrorist Iran, or North Korea.   My amendment would put our national security first, ensuring that any  plan created under this bill would not financially benefit companies  owned by or contracted with these foreign entities.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  commonsense provision.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman may not reserve the balance of his  time.   Mr. GOTTHEIMER: Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chairman, I believe my amendment is germane. It  narrows the scope of the bill. I ask for the ruling of the Chair,  please.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Amendment 86. As  Russia's war on Ukraine continues and the brutality of the Iranian  regime remains on full display, I am concerned that H.R. 21 does not  properly protect from the terrifying prospect of oil from our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve ending up in the wrong hands.   My amendment requires the Secretary of Energy consults with the  Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior on a plan for  Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawdown and ensures that any strategic  reserve drawdown does not result in a sale to Iran, North Korea, China,  or Russia.   This amendment would allow for the Defense Department and other  relevant agencies to have a say in any plan, given the national  security implications.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
