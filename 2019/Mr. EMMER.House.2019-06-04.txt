 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Royce Nelligan for  his 41 years of public service.   Earlier this month, Royce retired from his position as Minnesota's  Small Business Administration district counsel after a 37-year career.  Prior to Minnesota's SBA, he served in the U.S. Air Force and the  National Park Service.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Royce for all of his years of service. I thank  him for the work he did to help small businesses grow and prosper all  across Minnesota. For all the opportunities he helped create and  promote, he left our State and our communities better than when he  started. I congratulate him on a job well done, and I wish him luck on  his next chapter.                    Congratulating Andover Fire Department     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Andover Fire  Department for being awarded the 2019 Fire Department of the Year by  the Minnesota State Fire Department Association.   This award recognizes the department's efforts to provide outreach to  seniors in the community, to recruit women, and for maximizing the use  of available resources.   The department's Remember When fire safety program brings  firefighters into Andover's senior communities to replace smoke alarms  and mitigate any tripping hazards that exist.   The department has made significant strides to recruit women  firefighters. In fact, Andover is one of the few departments to have a  waiting list.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the women and men of the Andover Fire Department  for keeping our community safe. Special congratulations to Chief Jerry  Streich, Deputy Chief Mark Winczewski, and Battalion Chief John Wallace  on earning this important recognition.                 Congratulating Elk River Municipal Utilities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Elk River Municipal  Utilities for being a finalist for the 2019 Source Water Protection  Award.   We often hear when government fails to protect our water, but today,  I want to recognize a local utility for going above and beyond to  protect our community's water quality.   Every year, the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota  Rural Water Association award community facilities for their work to  protect community drinking water. This year, Elk River Municipal  Utilities, also known as ERMU, of Sherburne County, Minnesota, was  chosen as a finalist because of their diligence in prioritizing water  quality.   ERMU sealed an abandoned well that could have posed a danger to the  community's water supply. They consistently examine stormwater ponds  and their effects on the treatment of drinking water. They issue  rebates for more efficient fixtures.   We are proud that this Sixth District utility is an example for our  entire State.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Elk River Municipal Utilities for  their selection, and I thank them for protecting the health and welfare  of their residents and our drinking water.                                time  1030               Thank You for Your Leadership, Michael Hemesath     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Michael Hemesath,  President of St. John's University in St. Cloud, Minnesota, for his  commitment to education and his service to the St. John's community.   Recently, President Hemesath announced he intends to retire at the  end of the academic year. Including his time as a student, President  Hemesath has belonged to the St. John's family for 42 years.   As President, Michael Hemesath continued and built upon the College  of St. John's reputation for developing great talent and strong faith  that is reflected in the alumni and Johnnie tradition.   In addition, President Hemesath leaves his alma mater with a balanced  budget, a renovated Alcuin Library, and new buildings, like the  Dietrich Reinhart Learning Commons and the St. John's Bible Gallery.   Mr. Speaker, I thank President Hemesath for all he has done for the  College of St. John's. While he is moving on to the next chapter of his  professional life, he will always be part of the Johnnie family.                            ____________________
