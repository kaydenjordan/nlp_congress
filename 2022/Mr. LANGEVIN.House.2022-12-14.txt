 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with mixed emotions, as this  will likely be the final time that I speak in front of this Chamber as  a Member of Congress.   For the last 22 years, I have had the great privilege of serving the  people of Rhode Island's Second Congressional District. It has been the  honor of my lifetime to represent the voice and vote of my  constituents, and I am so humbled by the faith and the trust that they  have placed in me all these years.   After my accident, it was my community that was there for me when I  needed them the most, and it was their constant love and support, along  with my family, which ultimately inspired me to run for office as a way  of giving back.   My journey to recovery was not always an easy one, but thanks to my  family, my faith, and my community, I was able to move forward and  become the first quadriplegic ever elected to the United States  Congress.   For the last 36 years, I have woken up every day with one goal in  mind: giving good public service to the people of Rhode Island. That  focus has held true since my early days in public service, beginning  when I was elected as a delegate to Rhode Island's Constitutional  Convention, continued through my time in the General Assembly and as  the Nation's youngest secretary of state, and it has remained strong  throughout my final days as a United States Congressman.   I will forever be grateful for the enduring friendships and lifetime  memories that I have forged here in this body. But most of all, I am so  proud of all that we have been able to accomplish for the people of  Rhode Island and the United States.   I have fought to protect and advance the rights of Americans with  disabilities, moving our society closer to becoming fully inclusive and  accessible for all.   On the Committee on Armed Services, I have led the efforts to  strengthen our national security, and cybersecurity, in particular, and  I have been proud to support the hardworking men and women of my  district who build the world's finest nuclear submarines at Electric  Boat.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative  Technologies, and Information Systems, I  [[Page H9741]]  have sought to procure the finest, cutting-edge technologies for our  soldiers, sailors, airmen, guardians, and marines, so that our women  and men in uniform never enter a fair fight.    Moreover, I have spoken up for our Nation's foster youth, who are too  often forgotten and left behind, and I have worked across the aisle to  invest in job training, apprenticeships, and career and technical  education.   Looking back, I will always be proud of my vote for President Obama's  Affordable Care Act, which lowered healthcare costs and secured  coverage for millions of uninsured Americans.   I will never forget the moment that I became the first Congressman in  a wheelchair to preside over the U.S. House of Representatives as  Speaker pro tempore as we marked the 20th anniversary of the Americans  with Disabilities Act. I thank Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the greatest House  Speaker of the modern era, for making that day possible.   Likewise, I thank Majority Leader Steny Hoyer for his decades of  friendship and leadership in passing the Americans with Disabilities  Act and for his unrelenting efforts to make sure that the Capitol  complex is accessible to Americans of all abilities.   I also express my gratitude to my colleagues in the congressional  delegation, Jack, Sheldon, and David, for their friendship and support.  I could not have asked for better colleagues to work with on behalf of  our great State.   Finally, I thank the dozens of dedicated staff members who have  served in my office over the years, as well as my friends and my entire  family, especially my mom, my late dad, my brothers, and my sister for  standing by my side every step of this journey.   Choosing not to seek reelection to Congress was one of most difficult  decisions of my life. But after two decades of living in two places at  the same time and weekly air travel, I am ready to chart a new course.   Although I will no longer be in Congress come beginning of next year,  I am not going away. I am just coming home.   I love my State, and I love the people who live there. So most of  all, I want to say thank you, Rhode Island, for the opportunity to  serve the community which has given me so much. I will always cherish  the time that I was blessed to represent you.                            ____________________
