 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 473, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1187) to provide for disclosure of additional material  information about public companies and establish a Sustainable Finance  Advisory Committee, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Member may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on H.R. 1187 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance  Improvement and Investor Protection Act.   H.R. 1187 is a package of bills designed to strengthen investor  protections and require companies to provide environmental, social, and  governance disclosures, known as ESG. I thank my colleague,  Representative Juan Vargas, for his leadership on this package.   This bill provides investors with critical information on ESG matters  by requiring public companies to disclose key information to  shareholders regarding corporate political spending, worker pay, CEO  compensation, climate risk, and country-by-country tax reporting; and  provides issuers with clear, consistent standards to disclose this  information.   This is key information that investors have been demanding in order  to make the best decisions on the short- and long-term viability of the  companies they are investing in.   It is surprising that, to this day, there are no explicit ESG  requirements and investors are left to piece together the story of a  company's material risk with insufficient information. This is  unacceptable.   So I am pleased that this package of bills will improve investor  protections by holding public companies accountable and providing  greater transparency.   This package includes a number of bills authored by several  hardworking members of the Financial Services Committee, specifically:  Representative Juan Vargas, Representative Bill Foster, Representative  Nydia Velazquez, Representative Sean Casten, and Representative Cindy  Axne.   Specifically, Mr. Vargas' bill, the ESG Disclosure Simplification  Act, requires public companies to disclose certain ESG information to  shareholders, as well as the impact of the ESG policies on their  strategies.   Mr. Foster's bill, the Shareholder Political Transparency Act,  requires public companies to submit quarterly reports to the SEC on any  and all political expenditures, including dark money.   Ms. Velazquez's bill, the Greater Accountability in Pay Act, sheds  light on pay disparities, helping to close the gender and racial pay  gap.   Ms. Axne's bill, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Act,  requires disclosures that discourage companies'  [[Page H2835]]  use of tax havens and encourages repatriation of taxes to the United  States.   Mr. Casten's bill, the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, requires  disclosures that encourages companies to plan for the impact of climate  change on their company.   Each of these bills passed the Financial Services Committee with  unanimous Democratic support. I thank all these Members for their work  on these bills, their contributions to the legislative package, and  their leadership on these important reforms to protect investors and  hold corporations accountable.   This package is the right thing to do for investors and our markets.  It is past time that Congress make ESG requirements explicit. For these  reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas), our leader and the real sponsor on this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from  California Public Employees' Retirement System, Public Citizen, the  North American Securities Administrators Association, and Principles  for Responsible Investment.           California Public Employees' Retirement System, Executive             Office,                                                     June 14, 2021.      Subject: H.R. 1187, The Corporate Governance Improvement and           Investor Protection Act.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, I       write to express support for the overall direction of H.R.       1187, the ``Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor       Protection Act,'' which would require public companies to       disclose material information on the link between       environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics and their       long-term business strategy, as well as political       expenditures, compensation practices, climate-related risk       and tax expenditures, among other issues. This bill will       improve and enhance corporate disclosures essential to       maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. financial markets.        As the largest public defined benefit pension fund in the       United States, we manage approximately $465 billion in global       assets on behalf of more than two million members. Our       fiduciary duty requires that we take a long-term view in       assessing whether the companies that we hold in our portfolio       are effectively managed and able to provide the sustainable,       risk-adjusted returns that allow us to meet our commitments       to pay benefits earned by these dedicated active and retired       public servants for decades to come.        We fundamentally depend on the integrity and efficiency of       financial markets to meet these commitments and rely upon       financial reporting to provide transparent and relevant       information about the economic performance, conditions, and       operations of the  [[Page H2841]]       companies in which we invest. We believe corporate disclosure       of material financial information is a precondition to       maintaining effective and consistent corporate accountability       and sustainable economic growth. As the Securities and       Exchange Commission (``SEC'') has said in the past:        ``Only through the steady flow of timely, comprehensive,       and accurate information can people make sound investment       decisions. The result of this information flow is a far more       active, efficient, and transparent capital market that       facilitates the capital formation so important to our       nation's economy.''        Critically, CalPERS and other pension funds are inhibited       from adequately exercising their fiduciary duty without such       disclosures. Disclosure of material financial information is       necessary to close the information gap that occurs when       management of a company is aware or should be aware of       certain risks, yet such information is not available to       shareowners. We believe H.R. 1187 will address critical areas       in which more high-quality, consistent, and comparable       disclosures by public issuers are necessary, and build a more       robust reporting regime that enhances shareowner value over       the long-term. We are pleased that the following measures,       which CalPERS has been on the record in supporting, are       included in the Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor       Protection Act:        H.R. 1187, the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, which       would, among other things, require issuers to disclose       certain ESG metrics to shareholders, the connection between       those metrics and the issuer's long-term business strategy,       and the method by which the issuer determines how ESG metrics       impact its long-term strategy. We believe the current quality       and quantity of relevant ESG reporting does not meet       investors' needs and support the SEC playing a prominent role       in standardizing and assuring the accuracy of ESG data       reporting, and that it is reflected in company financials.        H.R. 1087, the Shareholder Political Transparency Act,       which would require public companies to disclose detailed       information about their political spending to the SEC and       shareholders in specified quarterly and annual reports. The       CalPERS Governance & Sustainability Principles call for       responsible board oversight, including disclosures of       corporate charitable and political activity to ensure       alignment with business strategy and to protect assets on       behalf of shareowners. As fiduciaries, we need to know how       our capital is being used, including if and when political       expenditures are made. SEC rulemaking would bring clarity and       consistency in the format and scope of disclosures and       provide a cost-effective alternative to private ordering.       Furthermore, political expenditure disclosure is consistent       with the SEC's requirement for public companies to disclose       meaningful financial information and would encourage prudent       use of corporate shareowner resources for political       activities.        H.R. 2570, the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, which would       require public companies to report financial risks posed to       them by climate change, the processes they use to identify       those risks, and the actions they take to mitigate those       risks. Our investment strategy is to make sure our portfolio       is resilient to short-term and long-term risks, both of which       include some dimension of climate change. We seek to find the       investment opportunities that the energy transition brings,       and to bring down emissions that contribute to global       warming. We believe it is vital that companies identify,       manage, and disclose material environmental risks and       opportunities relevant to their short-term and long-term       success. We support the establishment of a uniform reporting       regime for climate change risk disclosures that would address       key issues that impact shareowner value, including minimizing       risk, maximizing returns, and ensuring accountability from       all those involved.        H.R. 3007, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Act,       which would require public companies to annually disclose       information on their subsidiaries and specified country-by-      country financial information including total pre-tax       profits, total amounts paid in State, Federal, and foreign       taxes, employees, and tangible assets. As an investor in many       of the largest public companies in the world, we are acutely       aware of the complexities of international taxes, and the       increasingly important role that taxes play in corporate       profitability. However, current tax disclosures in the United       States do not provide investors with sufficient tax-related       information to adequately assess companies' valuations and       risks. We believe increasing transparency and requiring the       disclosure of overly aggressive international tax planning       arrangements helps to reduce systemic risk that threatens       global markets and ensure stronger long-term outcomes.        In addition, we are supportive of including additional       provisions in the Corporate Governance Improvement and       Investor Protection Act, such as the following disclosures       related to human capital management, board diversity, and       cybersecurity:        H.R. 3471, the Workforce Investment Disclosure Act, which       would require public companies to disclose information about       their Human Capital Management (HCM) policies, practices, and       performance in their annual reports. CalPERS expects fair,       accurate, and timely reporting on how companies identify and       manage risks related to the three forms of capital:       financial, physical, and human. The fact that there are few       standards for measuring and reporting on human capital topics       makes it difficult for investors to truly understand related       risks and opportunities when assessing individual companies.       We believe that rules-based disclosures with numeric metrics       provide crucial information to long-term investors, like       CalPERS, who are concerned about sustainability over time. We       have made recommendations in our comment letter on the SEC's       proposed rulemaking under Regulation S-K for metrics that       should be disclosed by all registrants, including the number       of full-time, part-time, and contingent workers; employee       turnover rates; health and safety, employee engagement and       diversity statistics.        H.R. 1277, the Improving Corporate Governance Through       Diversity Act, which would require public companies to       annually disclose the voluntary, self-identified racial,       ethnic, gender, and veteran status of their board of       directors, nominees, and senior executives, and establishes       an advisory group to recommend strategies to increase       diversity in these leadership positions. We support       initiatives that promote talent diversity--including a broad       range of education, experience, thoughts, perspectives, and       competencies--to help enable effective board leadership. We       view board diversity in terms of skill sets, sex, age,       nationality, race, sexual orientation, gender identity,       disability, and historically underrepresented groups, and       believe requiring public companies to annually disclose the       self-identified racial, ethnic, gender, and veteran status of       their board of directors, nominees, and senior executives is       an important step toward challenging ``group think'' in       corporate boardrooms and C-suites, which can severely limit       companies' ability to innovate and effectively engage with       shareowners and other stakeholders.        H.R. __, the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, which would       require companies to disclose in their annual reports to the       SEC, or in their annual proxy statements, whether any member       of their board of directors, or similar governing body, has       expertise or experience in cybersecurity and the nature of       such expertise or experience. If there are no members of a       company's governing body that have experience or expertise in       cybersecurity, it would require the company to describe what       other cybersecurity aspects were taken into account by       persons responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees       for the company's governing body. We believe requiring the       disclosure of cybersecurity expertise--or lack thereof--on       corporate boards will increase transparency for investors and       help to ensure that public companies are appropriately       prioritizing cybersecurity and data privacy matters. It       represents a reasonable and timely response to the increasing       prominence of cybersecurity threats in our financial markets       and the broader economy.        In sum, CalPERS believes that clear, consistent, and       substantive disclosures of climate risk, charitable and       political expenditures, human capital management, and board       diversity are critical to the long-term success of capital       markets and, more critically, of investors. Disclosures of       such information will help investors allocate capital and       exercise stewardship at companies to ensure long term       sustainable value creation. Such disclosures will also       encourage corporations to be more mindful of these risks that       could impact their financial success over the long term, and       will provide for greater transparency regarding cash flow,       corporate expenditures, and public policy engagement.        Thank you for considering our views. We look forward to       working with Congress to advance initiatives that will       improve corporate disclosures in both the public and private       markets. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, or       your staff can contact Danny Brown, Chief of our Legislative       Affairs Division, if we can be of any assistance as this       measure proceeds.            Sincerely,                                                      Marcie Frost,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                                   Public Citizen,                                    Washington, D.C., June 14, 2021.      Re Public Citizen urges a YES vote on H.R.s 1187, 1087, 1188,           2570, 3007 and amendments.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Representatives, On behalf of more than       500,000 members and supporters of Public Citizen across the       country, we ask you to vote yes on a suite of bills designed       to improve corporate disclosures regarding climate,       compensation, political spending, taxes, human capital and       other important issues. These bills were approved by the       House Financial Services Committee and arc expected to come       before the full House shortly.        H.R. 1087, the Shareholder Political Transparency Act (Foster)         This bill requires firms that are traded on public       exchanges to disclose in quarterly public reports filed with       the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the amount,       date, and nature of the company's expenditures for political       activities. Importantly, this includes indirect political       spending, or money given to trade associations or non-profits       that play in politics.        In Citizens United v. the Federal Elections Commission in       2010, the U.S. Supreme Court found that political spending is       protected speech and therefore corporations, unions,  [[Page H2842]]       and other groups are permitted to make unlimited political       expenditures, as long as they are not directly given to       candidates or parties. The Court assumed, however, that this       spending would be disclosed to investors so they could have       input. Not addressed by the Court, however, was the fact that       shareholders might not be aware of this spending or specific       details of where the money might be going. In response, a       bipartisan group of securities law experts filed a petition       with the SEC to require corporations to disclose their       political spending activities, and drew more than 1.2 million       comments, the most in SEC history. The SEC has not yet       addressed this decade-old petition, and passage of this       legislation would jumpstart the rulemaking.        Public Citizen has long championed this important       disclosure requirement. Political spending exposes a company       to reputational risk when it involves itself controversial       issues. Many corporations recognize this problem. For       example, a number of companies ceased campaign contributions       to certain lawmakers associated with the January 6; 2021       insurrection at the Capitol and in connection to the voter       suppression bills moving through statehouses.        While some corporate political spending is already       voluntarily disclosed, a considerable amount is funneled       through trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber of       Commerce, which deploys large numbers of agents to meet with       members of Congress. Often, the Chamber advances or promotes       policies that an individual company may find uncomfortable       were they associated with it openly, such as opposition to       climate reform or worker safety measures. If companies'       spending on backward issues became known to the public, it       could lead to material, reputational harm and ultimately       subtract from shareholder value.        Public Citizen heartily endorses this measure.         H.R. 1188, the Greater Accountability in Pay Act (Velazquez)         This bill would require public companies, excluding       emerging growth companies, to disclose certain employee pay       raise information, comparing the CEO with the median-paid       employee at the firm. This measure builds on a reform in the       Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act       that first required identification of the median-paid worker       at a firm. This requirement meant that firms were required to       add one more item regarding employees to the sole requirement       existing, namely, the number of employees.        For a half-century, the fruits of productivity gains have       clotted in the C-suite, with average workers receiving little       or no increase in real compensation. This has led to income       and wealth inequality. During the pandemic, this played out       in the need for trillions of dollars in emergency relief, as       average people lacked the savings to survive a temporary loss       of employment. Disclosures of these pay gaps can help       lawmakers devise more ambitious reforms to address the       widening gap between those workers who truly drive the       economy and elites.        Public Citizen urges you to support this bill.   H.R. 2570, the Climate Risk Disclosure Act (Casten) and H.R. 1187, the                 ESG Disclosure Simplification Act (Vargas)         Both of these bills deal with the increasing demand from       investors and the public for information related to       environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. H.R. 2570       would require public companies to disclose in their annual       reports information relating to the financial and business       risks associated with climate change. The bill also requires       the SEC to establish, in consultation with other relevant       financial agencies, climate-related risk disclosure metrics       and guidance, which will be industry-specific, and will       require companies to make both quantitative and qualitative       disclosures. H.R. 1187 requires the SEC to define what ESG       metrics means and requires firms to disclose those metrics       along with how ESG metrics accord with a firm 's long-term       strategy. It also requires the SEC to establish a committee       that would provide advice to the commission on sustainable       finance issues.        Given the physical and transition risks inherent to the       ongoing climate crisis and the shift away from fossil fuels       and carbon-intensive industry, investors need more       information about companies' growing climate financial risk,       their contribution to climate change, and their plans for       remaining viable in a low-carbon future economy. Requiring       the SEC to establish climate-related risk disclosure metrics       falls squarely within the agency's mission to protect       investors; ensure fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and       facilitate capital formation. Indeed, the agency has       expressed its intention to explore a climate disclosure rule.       Adopting this legislation would explicitly clarify the       SEC's authority to adopt such a rule in the face of       potential legal challenges from issuers and ideological       opponents alike.        At the same time, it is important to remember that climate       change is not just an environmental crisis, but one of social       justice, wealth distribution, equity and human rights. It is       vitally important that disclosures from issuers include       elements of environmental and climate justice, as well as       other ESG issues like political spending; tax; lobbying;       diversity, equity, and inclusion; and human capital       management practices to allow investors to make a holistic       assessment of an issuer's overall sustainability and make       more informed investment decisions.        Despite many firms reporting some ESG data, the available       information has not satisfied the needs of investors because       it essentially allows firms to self-determine and report       which climate risks are material. Many firms provide only       vague, boilerplate disclosures or do not address climate risk       at all. Management is often overly optimistic about a firm's       climate resilience, may not fully understand what investors       actually believe is material or want to know, and may have an       interest in obscuring parts of the picture, leading to       drastic under-reporting of risks. The provisions in this bill       represent a major step forward in terms of the quality of       information that would be available to investors.        We strongly encourage you to support these bills.      H.R. 3007, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Act (Axne)         This bill would require public companies to disclose their       total pre-tax profits, and total amounts paid in state,       federal, and foreign taxes on a country-by-country basis. The       bill would also require companies to disclose a number of       specific tax-related items for each of its subsidiaries, as       well as on a consolidated basis, such as total accrued tax       expenses, stated capital, and total accumulated earnings.       This legislation would ensure investors and the public at       large are provided with enough information to discern if the       companies they are invested in are participating in risky       behavior like corporate tax avoidance. Many U.S.       multinational companies use accounting maneuvers to book       their profits in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, or ``tax       havens.'' This legislation to mandate public country-by-      country reporting would indeed aim to discourage and curb the       trend of corporations' profit shifting to tax havens as these       public reports would shed light on corporations that       aggressively use avoidance practices to shirk their tax       responsibilities, which creates both reputational and       financial risk.        We urge you to approve this bill.        We also ask your support for amendments expected to be       offered to this suite of bills, including:        H.R. 3471, the Workforce Investment Disclosure Act (Axne):       this bill would require the SEC to implement petitioned       rulemaking that would require public companies to disclose       human capital management policies, practices, and       performance. While corporations often claim that employees       are their most valuable asset, shareholders know too little       about investments in these assets.        H.R. 1277, the Improving Corporate Governance Through       Diversity Act (Meeks): This bill would require public       companies to annually disclose the voluntarily, self-      identified gender, race, ethnicity and veteran status of       their board directors. This measure helps corporations better       identify how they are promoting diversity in the highest       ranks.        H.R. __, the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act (Himes): This       bill would require the SEC to issue rules to require       companies in their annual reports to the SEC or in their       annual proxy statements to disclose whether any member of       their board of directors, or similar governing body, has       expertise or experience in cybersecurity and the nature of       such expertise or experience. If there are no members of a       company's governing body that have experience or expertise in       cybersecurity, the bill would require the company to describe       what other cybersecurity aspects were taken into account by       persons responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees       for the company's governing body.        With high-level hacks recently grinding important companies       to a halt and cybersecurity affecting all walks of life,       investors should be aware of how well corporations are       prepared to defend themselves against attack.        Public Citizen strongly urges you to vote yes on these       important pieces of legislation and amendments to provide       greater information to investors, watchdog organizations, and       the public at large.

Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.       (``NASAA''), I am writing to express NASAA's support for       several provisions of H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance and       Investor Protection Act, which the House is scheduled to       consider this week, as amended and favorably reported by the       House Committee on Rules on June 14, 2020. As further       detailed below, NASAA also strongly supports two amendments       to H.R. 1187 that were made in order by the Committee on       Rules. The first such amendment addresses disclosure of       information related to the diversity on the boards of       directors of U.S. public companies, while the second       amendment addresses disclosure of cybersecurity expertise at       the leadership level of such companies. I sincerely       appreciate your attention to NASAA's views.  [[Page H2843]]                  (1) The ESG Disclosure Simplification Act (Title I)         Increasingly, investors view a company's environmental,       social, and governance, or ``ESG'' practices, as a material       metric for determining whether to invest. To date, however,       there are no uniform standards for the reporting of       environmental and certain other ESG factors in the United       States. In the absence of such standards, public companies       lack clarity when making disclosures relating to ESG       considerations. In some cases, they may have incentives to       make selective or potentially misleading disclosures about       the benefits of their practices, products, or services. Title       I of H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance and Investor Protect       Act, seeks to remedy that problem.        The ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, as embodied in Title       I, would require public companies to disclose in filings with       the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') and any       proxy or solicitation materials that describe the ``views of       the issuer regarding links between ESG metrics and the long-      term strategy of the issuer'' and any process the issuer uses       to determine the long-term business strategy of the issuer.       Further, the bill would express the nonbinding ``Sense of       Congress'' that ``environmental, social, and governance [ESG]       metrics'' are ``de-facto material'' for the purposes of       disclosure under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The       bill would also create a new permanent ``Sustainable Finance       Advisory Committee'' within the SEC, that would, within 18       months of its first meeting, be required to submit       ``recommendations about what ESG metrics'' the SEC should       require to be disclosed.        The time has come to provide investors seeking to       understand factors relating to a company's ESG profile with       the ability to accurately understand and weigh ESG risks in       their investment decisions, and Congress can play an       important role in this regard. NASAA has previously called       for Congress to enact legislation that would direct the SEC       to develop a uniform standard for ESG reporting by public       companies so that investors can understand companies' real       practices and impact, and ``make `head-to-head' comparisons       between competing investments.'' NASAA has also urged that       Congress consider legislation that would direct the SEC to       establish a task force to consolidate, to the extent       possible, themes from existing reporting frameworks and       standards in order to catalyze faster progress toward       standardization.'' Title I of H.R. 1187 marks an opportunity       to ``move the ball forward'' on both of these       recommendations; therefore, NASAA is pleased to support its       passage.             (2) The Cybersecurity Disclosure Act (Amendment #1)         The Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, as filed as an amendment       to H.R. 1187, is identical to stand-alone legislation       recently introduced in the Senate as S. 808. NASAA was       pleased to support this important legislation at the time of       its introduction, and we are pleased to support its inclusion       in H.R. 1187.        The Cybersecurity Disclosure Act would require publicly       traded companies to include in their annual disclosure       filings with the SEC information detailing whether any member       of their governing body, such as their board of directors or       general partner, possesses expertise or experience in       cybersecurity. If no member has such expertise or experience,       companies would be required to detail what, if any, other       cybersecurity considerations were considered by the persons       responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for the       governing body.        For nearly a decade, the list of public companies and       financial institutions targeted by organized cyber-attacks       has continued to grow with ever-increasing frequency. Over       the past year, moreover, this threat has accelerated further       due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because many millions       of Americans are conducting much or most of their lives       online--and because an unprecedented number of U.S. employees       arc working remotely--cybercriminals and scammers have an       abundance of opportunities to infiltrate business security       networks to install malware, steal personally identifiable       information (``PII'') of customers and clients, and create       other problems.        Incentivizing publicly traded companies to consider whether       they have appropriate cybersecurity expertise on their       governing body is a common-sense way to promote greater       attention to cybersecurity risk by public corporations.       Investors and customers are well-served by policies that       encourage companies to consider such risks proactively, as       opposed to after a data breach has already occurred when       investors and customers have already been harmed.       Importantly, the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act does not       require companies to do anything beyond disclosing       information; the bill encourages companies to act in their       own best interests by creating an incentive for them to       prioritize cybcrsecurity expertise at the senior levels of       leadership.        NASAA shares Congress's interest in addressing the threat       cybersecurity risk has on public companies and investors. We       are pleased to support Amendment #1, and we urge its passage.   (3) The Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act (Amendment                                    #11)         The Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act,       as filed as an amendment to H.R. 1187, is identical to stand-      alone legislation entitled H.R. 1277, the Improving Corporate       Governance Through Diversity Act. NASAA was pleased to       support H.R. 1277 was it was considered and approved by the       House Financial Services Committee in April 2020 and is       pleased to again support the bill as an amendment to H.R.       1187.        The Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act       would require public companies to disclose annual information       on the voluntary self-identified racial, ethnic, gender, and       veteran composition of their boards of directors and       executive officers. The bill would also require that such       companies disclose whether their boards of directors have       adopted any ``policy, plan or strategy'' to promote diversity       among these bodies, and would instruct the SEC's Office of       Minority and Women Inclusion to develop and publish ``best       practices,'' in order to help public companies comply with       the new diversity reporting requirements. In addition, the       Act would establish a new ``Diversity Advisory Group'' within       the SEC, which would be exempt from the Federal Advisory       Committee Act, and be comprised of representatives from the       Federal government, state and local governments, academia,       and the private sector. Under the Act, the Advisory Group       would be tasked with identifying strategies to ``increase       gender, racial and ethnic diversity among members of the       board of directors of the issuer,'' and be required to report       periodically to Congress and the public.        NASAA has repeatedly called for Congress to examine the       current state of corporate board composition with an eye       toward encouraging greater diversity. In doing so, NASAA has       noted that leading research indicates that greater board       diversity correlates with sound corporate governance and       enhances the performance of public companies. We have also       noted evidence that shows that investors themselves       increasingly regard corporate board diversity to be an       indication of good governance, which improves both corporate       performance and investor relations. Most recently, in NASAA's       Legislative Agenda for the 117th Congress, state securities       regulators called for Congress to pass legislation ``to       require public companies to disclose information that       demonstrates the diversity on their boards, or the lack       thereof, as well as information regarding the diversity of       their corporate operations.''        NASAA congratulates the House for its decision to consider       including the Improving Corporate Governance Through       Diversity Act as an amendment to H.R. 1187, and we urge its       passage.        Thank you for your consideration of NASAA's views. If we       may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Michael Canning, NASAA's Director of Policy and       Government Affairs.            Sincerely,      Lisa Hopkins,        NASAA President, General Counsel and Senior Deputy       Commissioner of Securities, West Virginia.     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman  from Michigan yields back.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.  [[Page H2845]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this bill provides urgently needed investor  protections by requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to  adopt clear, consistent standards for ESG metrics. Without the  information requirements in this bill, investors are left with  inconsistent information across companies and are ultimately unable to  fully assess their investment decisions.   Investors deserve to know the risks they are exposed to with relation  to climate change, political expenditures, and other important factors.  We must make this right and take action to bring accountability to  public companies.   Some or all of the provisions of this package have been supported by  Public Citizen, AFL-CIO, SEIU, California Public Employees' Retirement  System, Americans for Financial Reform, Council of Institutional  Investors, United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment,  Americans for Tax Fairness, North American Securities Administrators  Association, FACT Coalition, Oxfam America, Ceres, and Sierra Club,  among others.   For years, investors and market participants have been demanding more  and better disclosures regarding ESG matters, which research shows can  have significant impacts on the short- and long-term values of  companies.   For example, a report issued by the BlackRock Investment Institute  found that companies that score high on ESG measures are better able to  adapt to environmental and societal changes, use resources more  efficiently, have more productive employees, and tend to face lower  risk of reputational damage and regulatory action.   Matters related to climate risk, the ways companies invest in their  workers and further diversity, spend their cash on political  expenditures, their global human rights records, their tax avoidance  strategies, and how they invest in crucial corporate infrastructure  such as cybersecurity are all significant and material factors in  companies' short- and long-term viability.   Investors, who are the true owners of our Nation's public companies,  recognize the importance of this information to their decisionmaking  and have been demanding this information for years.   For example, in 2018, a coalition of public pension funds asset  managers and others representing over $5 trillion in assets petitioned  the SEC for rulemaking on mandatory ESG disclosures. Over 2,300  investment managers, asset managers, and service providers representing  over $80 trillion in assets under management have become signatories to  the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which commits  to incorporating ESG factors into their investment decisions.   A group of 35 institutional investors representing over $6.6 trillion  in assets form the Human Capital Management Coalition has petitioned  the SEC to adopt rules to require issuers to disclose information  related to their human capital management policies, practices, and  performance.                                time  1330    When the SEC solicited comments on political spending disclosures in  2011, it received over one million comments; by far more comments than  any other SEC rulemaking petition, and the vast majority of which were  overwhelmingly favorable. Yet the SEC's efforts were stymied because  the Senate minority leader has personally insisted on statutorily  prohibiting the SEC from even studying the issue.   However, we are currently without clear, consistent standards for  this information to be disclosed. Investors will continue to be left in  the dark. It is time we give investors and markets the information they  have been demanding for so long.   And let me be absolutely clear about who we are fighting for. The  other side has taken up the issue, as it tends to want to protect these  big public corporations from disclosures.   It is for the American workers, the retirees, who worked their whole  lives to save for retirement, for the public pension funds investing on  behalf of our Nation's teachers and our firefighters, and other  frontliners. We are fighting to ensure they have been given the tools  they need to protect what they have worked so hard for, to achieve the  American Dream.   So I would urge all of my colleagues who are concerned about not only  the retail investors, but concerned about the institutional investors  who are responsible for these teachers and these firefighters and these  others that I have alluded to, and their ability to feel safe and  comfortable that decisions are being made that are in the best interest  of the people who are invested in them.   So I would ask for an ``aye'' vote on this very, very comprehensive  and serious legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose Mr. Burgess' amendment.  This amendment is interesting to me because Republicans have, without  fail, consistently cited the materiality standard both here on the  House floor and in the Financial Services Committee as a basis to  oppose very important disclosures.   Republicans have argued over and over again that we do not need to  enact any new disclosures because companies are already required to  disclose any and all material information. But, with this amendment, it  seems their purported commitment to materiality has gone out the window  so that they can bring attention to their massive tax cuts for the  rich.   In 2018, when the United States Government should have been focused  on growing the real economy for American workers, the former President  pushed forward the largest tax giveaway to our country's largest  corporations and executives in history. This government handout  provided corporations and executives with $2 trillion in tax cuts and  giveaways, saddling the United States Government with debt.   Make no mistake, these tax cuts did not go primarily to workers, but,  instead, they went overwhelmingly to the top 1 percent. The year after  the Trump tax cuts were implemented, public companies spent nearly $1  trillion in stock buybacks, rather than investing in research and  development, increasing worker wages, or shoring up their bottom lines  to make sure they could weather times of crisis.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Trump's tax  plan gave the top 400 highest income taxpayers an additional $15  million per year. Compare this to the $2.8 million the average college  graduate will earn in their lifetime.   This amendment absolutely and completely ignores the harm done to  hardworking Americans and focuses on alleged harm to the large  corporations. This amendment suggests our Nation's largest companies  should not be paying their fair share, while American workers are  forced to pay for Republicans' corporate handouts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Burgess' amendment is a gimmick intended to distract from the  important goals of this package. It insinuates that corporations should  not be paying their fair share, while hardworking taxpayers foot the  bill. So I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting Mr. Burgess'  amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2847]]     Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 4 of House Resolution  473, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendments en  bloc, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this en bloc package of  Democratic amendments to H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance  Improvement and Investor Protection Act.   These amendments include critical provisions offered by my  colleagues, Representative Himes, Representative Axne, Representative  Phillips, Representative Wexton, Representative Frankel, and  Representative Meeks.   These provisions strengthen H.R. 1187 by requiring public companies  to disclose key information related to cybersecurity, corporate board  diversity, human rights abuses, human capital management, and the ways  companies are investing in and protecting their workforce.   Investors, the true owners of public companies, need this information  because of the significant effects they can have on the bottom lines  and operations of the companies they are investing their hard-earned  money in. Investors need this information to hold companies  accountable.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these important  measures, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our Nation's  investors and workers to vote ``yes'' for these Democratic amendments.   I do believe that Mr. Huizenga correctly described who they are  working for. He just talked about how big these corporations are and  how much they have to manage.   Of course, prior to him, Mr. Burgess talked about, yes, the tax  breaks that they receive, and they should receive more tax breaks.  However, they are worried about these corporations and their ability to  comply, despite the fact they have all of the accountants they need,  they have all of the personnel they need, they have all of the  management they need. They have everything that they need to be in  compliance.   We are simply saying it is time for them to disclose information that  the investors have been asking and begging for.   And, of course, they often refer to the retail investors. But the  institutional investors must be included in this decision because they  are the ones that are in control of the teachers and the firefighters  and the workers on the front lines and all of that money that they are  investing for them, and they have got to protect them. The way that you  protect them is making sure that the investors understand how to make  good decisions based on information.   If the big corporations, with all that they have to be able to  operate, do not give them this information, do not have this  information, do not share this information, they are at a great  disadvantage.   And so I would simply ask my colleagues to understand whose side we  are on. We are on the side of the retail investors and the  institutional investors who are handling all of the money of our  frontline workers who are investing for their retirement.   I would ask for a ``yea'' vote on these en bloc amendments.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by  Mr. Hill. This amendment would gut the entirety of H.R. 1187.  Bizarrely, this amendment offered by my colleague has an odd focus on  climate change, suggesting that we need more study about the financial  risk of climate change. Let me be very clear: climate change is real.  We cannot alter the Earth's orbit or the Moon's orbit or click our  heels three times and wish for climate change to magically disappear.   In fact, the impacts of climate change are already apparent and are  affecting global financial markets. Unfortunately, studies show that  market prices currently fail to factor in the risks of climate change  to the tune of trillions of dollars.   Mr. Hill's amendment would also allow companies to continue to engage  in legally risky tax-avoidance schemes to funnel limitless amounts of  corporate dark money into politics and to enrich CEOs while worker  wages remain stagnant. This is precisely the information that investors  want to know about the companies that they own.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Hill's amendment would completely gut H.R. 1187 and would prevent  investors from accessing critical environmental, social, and governance  information that they need to make the best investment decisions  possible and hold the companies they own accountable.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on Mr. Hill's amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment offered by Representative  Schrier requires the SEC to work with the Office of the Advocate for  Small Business Capital Formation and the Office of the Investor  Advocate to study the issues smaller public companies may face in  reporting ESG disclosures, and to make recommendations for the SEC to  consider.   Disclosures of ESG-related matters are critical to investors in  markets, and it is imperative that public companies provide investors,  the true owners of these companies, with this important information.  However, it is just as important for us to ensure that public companies  of all sizes are able to comply with these disclosure requirements.   To address this, my colleague, Representative Schrier, has introduced  an amendment that requires the SEC to work with the Office of the  Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation and the Office of the  Investor Advocate to study the issues that smaller public companies  face in disclosing ESG matters, and to make recommendations for the SEC  to tailor these disclosure requirements to assist smaller public  companies.   Ms. Schrier's amendment, along with Mr. Vargas' provision in H.R.  1187, will help smaller public companies by ensuring that the SEC is  factoring in the unique issues that smaller public companies face while  also creating clear, consistent regulatory standards that reduce  regulatory uncertainty, all while providing investors and markets with  this critical information.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.                  Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Plaskett.     Mr. Speaker, I understand that my friend and colleague,  Ms. Plaskett, has raised some concerns about the treatment of  territories in this bill, and I want to assure her that the staff has  done everything possible in the bill text to ensure that territories  are included in this bill and not treated disparately.   The language in this bill is consistent with regulations promulgated  under the Obama administration regarding country-by-country tax  reporting, which were carefully written to ensure territories were not  excluded.   I want to make clear that nothing in this bill should be intended to  suggest that territories are tax havens. In fact, I have worked with my  colleague, Mr. San Nicolas, on this bill text. We believe that the  enhanced disclosures in this bill, which will include territories,  should help encourage investment in the territories and hold  corporations accountable for lack of investment in territories.   I want to ensure Ms. Plaskett that I take her concerns seriously, and  I intend to work with her to make sure that what she is identifying as  perhaps incorrectly being defined as tax havens is an issue that I will  deal with.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I rushed to the floor to be a part of  absolutely indicating my support for this important legislation, the  Juneteenth National Independence Day. I am so pleased that we take this  step today to honor the day and the month that the information of the  signing of the Emancipation Proclamation reached enslaved people in  Texas. It took more than 2 years before the news reached them.   Juneteenth is a State holiday in the State of Texas. It was authored  by my friend, Al Edwards, who is since deceased. I wish he was alive  today to witness this debate that is taking place on the floor of the  Congress of the United States that will lead to the passage of the  legislation that will make Juneteenth a national holiday.   I was a little bit concerned when I heard some of the Members be  opposed to the way that the bill is titled. They didn't like the word  ``independence'' that is in there because these are patriots and they  want to protect Independence Day and not have it mistaken in any way.   But where were these patriots when the Capitol was being violated?   Where were these patriots when the noose was hung, in plain view, for  everybody to see, where slaves and people of color had lost their lives  because they were hung, et cetera, et cetera?    I want you to know that patriotism should be demonstrated all of the  time. If you cannot demonstrate your patriotism when your Capitol is  invaded, when the insurrection took place, then I question your  patriotism.
