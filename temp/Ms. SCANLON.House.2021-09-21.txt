 Madam Speaker, this weekend, I ran into a constituent  whose story is a model for what we plan to deliver for more Americans  through the Build Back Better Act.   I met a mom in Media, from a solid middle-class family, and she was  so excited to share the news about her son's new job. After completing  the new maritime career development program at Delaware Community  College, he attended a job fair and landed one of the new jobs at the  Philadelphia shipyard, where he will be making $27 an hour and  receiving full benefits.   The Build Back Better Act will expand these kinds of opportunities  and make them available to more Americans. It will expand job training  programs and lower the cost of higher education by funding 2 years of  tuition-free community college and increasing the value of Pell Grants.   Using our Nation's network of community colleges as the pipeline,  this bill will help connect more Americans to good paying jobs.   The policies in the Build Back Better Act are urgently needed, they  will strengthen our economy, and they are popular. It is time to deal  working people back in.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and  its underlying legislation. Specifically, I want to highlight H.R.  3755, the Women's Health Protection Act.   The passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg just a year ago removed the last  major impediment to an all-out assault by conservative extremists on  the freedom of American women to make their own reproductive choices.  With the culmination of a decades-long campaign to pack the Supreme  Court with far-right abortion foes, championed by The Federalist  Society and Mitch McConnell, we have seen a tidal wave of legislation  and court cases designed to overturn the constitutional protections  outlined in Roe v. Wade.   Those efforts have included S.B. 8, the Texas bill outlawing abortion  after 6 weeks and offering a bounty to vigilantes who seek to enforce  that ban; the Supreme Court's refusal to block implementation of the  Texas law; and the Court's scheduling of a December argument in a case  that seeks to overturn Roe v. Wade. They all demonstrate a clear and  present threat to women's reproductive rights in this country.   The decision to have, or not to have, a child is deeply personal and  may profoundly impact a woman's mental, physical, and financial health  and, in some instances, her very life. Women should have the freedom to  make personal healthcare decisions with those they love and the doctors  they trust, free from undue State interference and invasion of the  woman's privacy.   With increasing attacks on women's reproductive freedom, we are once  again seeing the urgent need for Federal legislation to codify Roe v.  Wade. To ensure that Roe's protections remain, we must absolutely pass  the Women's Health Protection Act and protect a woman's freedom to  choose a safe and legal abortion, no matter where she lives.
