 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today in  support of H.R. 972, the Reconstruction Era National Historical Park  Act.   I joined Majority Whip Clyburn in reintroducing the Reconstruction  Era National Historical Park Act, which expands the Reconstruction Era  National Monument in Beaufort, South Carolina, and makes it a national  park.   This bill also creates a national network of reconstruction era  historical sites so they can receive the recognition that they deserve.   The Lowcountry's vibrant reconstruction history is often overlooked  or misunderstood, and this act would seek to correct that.   I am honored to work with Majority Whip Clyburn to preserve, protect,  and promote reconstruction history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 972.
