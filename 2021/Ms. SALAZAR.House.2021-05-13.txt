 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention on the  crisis in Nicaragua in Central America.   SOS Nicaragua is our motto. SOS Nicaragua is the rallying cry of  millions of Nicaraguans yearning for freedom, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, just like what we have.   Managua is closer to Miami than Miami is to D.C., as Ronald Reagan  once said on national television. What happens in Central America has a  direct impact on my community in south Florida, home of hundreds of  thousands of Nicaraguans.   Since April of 2018, Daniel Ortega's Sandinista regime has carried  out a repressive crackdown and killed over 325 peaceful protesters,  while thousands of Nicaraguans have fled to neighboring Costa Rica and  to the United States, escaping Ortega's reign of terror.   This November, Nicaragua is scheduled to have Presidential elections,  yet Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, are actively  undermining the electoral process and persecuting opposition candidates  to outright steal the upcoming Presidential election.   The Nicaraguan people have liberated themselves from the shackles of  socialist tyranny once before, and they can do it again.   For that reason, the United States must stand with the people of  Nicaragua in their struggle for freedom by demanding a free and fair  election this November. For that reason, Congressman Albio Sires and  myself have introduced my bipartisan RENACER Act, and I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor this bill and stand with the people of  Nicaragua.                            ____________________
