 Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for  yielding and for her hard work and leadership during this entire  legislative process.   The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  division of the bill highlights our continued commitment to our  servicemembers and their families and to our veterans.   Constructing the barracks, bases, and facilities that our military  needs and ensuring safe, adequate housing for military families is  crucial to our Nation's military readiness.   Properly funding the Department of Veterans Affairs is how we deliver  on the promise of medical care and other benefits that our veterans  have earned through their service to our Nation.   The Related Agencies division, including the American Battle  Monuments Commission and Arlington National Cemetery, demonstrate to  the world how we honor the contributions and sacrifice of those who  served.   That is why I am proud that this bill includes $108.4 billion in  discretionary funding, $10.4 billion above the FY19 enacted level. For  military construction, it provides $10.5 billion; and, for the  Department of Veterans Affairs, the bill provides $94.3 billion in  discretionary funding, a $7.7 billion increase above the FY19 enacted  level and $1.3 billion above the FY20 budget request.   The bill we are considering today makes smart investments in critical  projects and programs that make a real difference in the lives of  servicemembers, veterans, and their families.   The bill includes an additional $140.8 million to address housing  issues that have come up recently and have really festered for far too  long, like mold, vermin, and lead, that really have devastated our  military families and that must be corrected. This bill ensures there  are the resources and the language in our report to ensure that the  military makes sure that they are not leaving our military families to  deal with the fallout over this disgusting situation on their own.    It provides $2.3 billion in emergency funding to address hurricane  damage in North Carolina and my home State of Florida.   We have also put an additional $40 million toward energy resilience  at our military bases and provided an additional $60 million to clean  up PFOS and PFOA contamination at installations across the country.   For the VA, the bill will improve the quality of veterans' healthcare  by making significant investments in women veterans' health.   I am proud to be the first woman in American history to chair this  appropriations subcommittee, making sure that our women veterans  actually know that they are veterans. And, in fact, I know it will come  as a shock to most, as it was to me, that some women veterans don't  even realize that, if they serve a couple of years, even if they didn't  actually fight in a war zone or were deployed to a war zone, they are  actually veterans, entitled to services at the VA.   Carving out, for the first time, gender-specific funding to make sure  that we can provide healthcare services to our women veterans, do the  proper outreach, and make sure that we bring our women veterans into  the VA system and take care of them as they took care of representing  our country, is essential.   The fastest rising group of veterans who are committing suicide are  our women veterans, and we have to make sure that we are doing right by  them.  [[Page H4803]]    We have a ``whole health'' model that we have funded, mental  healthcare and suicide prevention, homelessness assistance, rural  health, and, of course, opioid abuse prevention.   The bill also provides $1 billion for infrastructure improvements to  ensure that the VA has modern, safe facilities to treat our veterans,  as well as supporting continued implementation of the electronic health  record and efforts to reduce the disability claims backlog.   Madam Chair, I am very proud of what this bill does, but I am also  proud of what it does not do.   It does not fund a border wall, nor does it allow the President to go  against clearly stated congressional intent and divert vital military  construction funding from previously approved national security  projects.                                time  1630    There is a lot of talk, Madam Chair, about commitment to our military  in this body. There should be no question that funds should not be  taken from vital, previously requested and approved military projects  that are absolutely a higher priority than any border wall. In fact,  Congress agreed to that very point on a bipartisan basis earlier this  year after the longest shutdown in our Nation's history.   I will close by thanking all of my colleagues for their input on this  bill. We are very proud, Judge Carter and I, that we were able to fund  in our bill nearly all the bipartisan requests that we received. It  made the bill better.   Before I yield back, I do want to thank my ranking member, Judge  Carter, and Ranking Member Granger and Chairwoman Lowey. We worked very  well together on the issues facing our military and our veterans.   While we may not always agree, I am proud to have Judge Carter as my  partner. We have a lot of work left to do, and I appreciate the  gentleman's insight into these issues.   I would also like to thank the staff of both the subcommittee and our  personal offices whose expertise and commitment to our servicemembers  and our veterans is evident every day. I won't name them because I am  out of time, but they know who they are. We appreciate them so much.   Madam Chair, this is a good bill. I urge the Members' adoption of it.
