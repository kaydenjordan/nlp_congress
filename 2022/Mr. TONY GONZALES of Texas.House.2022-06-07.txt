 Madam Speaker, on May 24, 2022, 19  children and 2 teachers were killed by a gunman at Robb Elementary  School in Uvalde, Texas, my district but a reflection of every small  town in America.   As I rise today with my fellow Texans to honor the victims, I am  reminded of Matthew 5:4, ``Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall  be comforted.''   I mourn with the Uvalde community and pray for healing and comfort  for the families and the community for the loss of:   Alexandria Rubio;   Alithia Ramirez;   Amerie Garza;   Annabelle Rodriguez;   Eliahana Torres;   Eliahna Garcia;   Jacklyn Cazares;   Jailah Silguero;   Jayce Luevanos;   Jose Flores, Jr.;   Layla Salazar;   Makenna Elrod;   Maite Rodriguez,   Maranda Mathis;   Nevaeh Bravo;   Rojelio Torres;   Tess Mata;   Uziyah Garcia;   Xavier Lopez;   Eva Mireles; and   Irma Garcia.   These were our daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, and mothers who  have become innocent victims of senseless violence.   Please join us in a moment of silence to honor the victims.   May they rest in peace, and may they always be remembered.
