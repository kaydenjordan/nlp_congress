 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding me time.   I thank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for working  with us on that unanimous consent, which I think is important. It is  important for us to have a full debate and a full airing of the use of  war powers in the United States.   As James Madison pointed out, it was critically important that we put  that power in Congress. We should have this debate. If we are going to  have troops in Syria, this body, this House of Representatives, this  Congress ought to speak to it; and we shouldn't hide behind a 2001  authorization of the use of military force and not update that  authorization of the use of military force.   I am not here to say whether we should or should not be in Syria. I  am here to say that Congress should speak to it. We should debate it.  We should decide. We should have an actual conversation in this body,  on this floor, when we are going to place our men and women in uniform  in harm's way. That is the point that we should be considering.   I very much believe that the gentleman from Florida has brought  something forward using privileged tools that we have here in the body,  and that we should take that under consideration. We should support the  resolution the gentleman has brought forward, and if we have concerns,  we should then have a debate, a full-throated debate, about the use of  military force and our men and women in uniform in Syria.
