 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of ending  Russian oil imports into our land.   Liberty is the shining jewel in America's crown. As Vladimir Putin  unleashes his murderous fury on the people of Ukraine, we have a  responsibility to stand up for liberty's defense, to inflict further  pain on Putin and his war-related price hikes.   Now is the time to recommit ourselves to ensuring America's energy  independence for the 21st century. We must take a stand and invest in  our workers and our companies as U.S. oil and gas production is  approaching all-time highs.   To Wall Street and the big corporate CEOs, now is the time to  prioritize liberty and the well-being of hardworking Americans and  their families, not just corporate profits and shareholder dividends.   Let's use this moment to develop a robust energy future to unleash  across our land, across all energy technologies, our competitive edge.   Russian oil is the past. American energy innovation, ingenuity, and  U.S. energy independence are within our grasp.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Jackie  Speier of California for her leadership on so many issues, including  women. Not just women but for people everywhere, in our country, those  who have been abused, those who serve in our military, and those who  serve in our intelligence services. I thank her for her great  contributions to our country, how she has lived her life and has served  so nobly. The people of California have really sent a jewel here, and  they know it. I shall miss her greatly when she makes her decision to  leave us at the end of this session of Congress. She is truly a friend  and a friend to the American people.   I am very honored this evening to join her and rise on this  International Women's Day to call out the damaged and really bestial  soul of Vladimir Putin. His torturous treatment of the women, children,  and elderly of Ukraine is a war crime.   He is about genocide in a country that 30 years ago voted to be  independent. When the Soviet Union fell, 90 percent of the people of  Ukraine, about 42 million people, voted that they wanted to be free. It  was an extraordinary moment in world history.   But yet, we hear from this--what do I call him--Russia's tyrant--last  year on International Women's Day, he issued a statement. Here is what  he said: Congratulations to women--calling the day a ``holiday filled  with joy, warmth and goodness.'' And he talked about mothers,  granddaughters, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, saying how they  represented love and tenderness and how good this was. Yet, if we look  at the pictures that are here, he is killing them.   There are pictures of the people. Look at this woman. He says  tenderness and love and that women are taking care of countries and  they are raising children. He is killing them.   The elderly and the disabled--I received a letter today, and two  individuals were killed in a car because a Russian bomb came down in a  civilian area. The woman who was driving was elderly, and the person  she had in the car with her was disabled. He is massacring civilians.  He says he loves women. Really? They are dead. They didn't have a  chance. They are civilians.   In terms of the disruption of life in Ukraine, God bless them. Over 2  million have now fled from their tiny, little homes. It is one of the  poorest Nations in Europe, but it wants its freedom.   Here is a picture of the numbers of people fleeing. You can see, if  you look at the number of headscarves, these are women with their  children. Many at the Ukraine-Poland border are kissing their husbands  goodbye, they fear for the last time. The children are crying.   In the westernmost city of Ukraine, Lviv, there is a sea of displaced  people. Europe has not seen this since the Second World War, nothing  like it. Free people everywhere have to pay attention. These are good  people.  [[Page H1366]]    Seventy-five percent of the food raised in that country that is eaten  by the people there is raised by those women in their family plots, in  their gardens. Putin is killing them. He is killing the mothers and  grandmothers of Ukraine.   What do his statements matter in the Kremlin, when he comes out of  his cave, wherever that is. We see the butchery on the news every  night. We see it on our iPhones. Our visceral feelings of horror pale  in comparison to the lived reality of those who now know deep fear,  anxiety, and loss.   The reality is that Putin is sending his troops in those tanks and  those jets up in the air to shoot and bomb hospitals and maternity  wards and kindergartens and schools. He has already killed, from 2014  to the present, when he first invaded Ukraine, 14,000 people who aren't  known to the world, and now more. He has no heart.   In his statement last year, on International Women's Day, he said:  Thank you to the women doctors, the paramedics, the medical nurses, and  all of those who are saving lives and nursing patients back to health.  What a lie.   These women in Ukraine today, without proper bandages, without  medical equipment, are caring for women who are pregnant and delivering  in the subway systems of the capital city, in Kyiv. If they need a C- section and they are cut, there is no thread to sew them up. How about  that, Putin? How about that?   How many children have you killed since your invasion of Ukraine? The  misery among these people.   This abominable creature is now spilling the blood of those he once  heralded. Ukraine's medical professionals and their patients are being  murdered. The people trying to help are being murdered.   On a day Putin recently proclaimed as the triumph of love and  admiration and gratitude. This two-faced liar is committing war crimes  against an innocent people.   Can Putin be human? A human could not celebrate women on one day and  then annihilate them and their families on the next. He simply couldn't  be human. He is a killer of Lucifer proportion. He considers human life  not sacred.   So on this International Women's Day, a day dedicated to honoring  women around the globe, let us recognize the brave, courageous women of  Ukraine.   From every walk of life, they have endured centuries of oppression.  Now, with this window on liberty, this moment in history, they have a  chance to take their young democracy forward, and they are fighting for  it.   They are sewing camouflage material to try to prevent the planes from  seeing where they live. They are defending their homeland with every  ounce left in them. There is not enough food, and there is not enough  water.   As co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus and as someone who  has visited Ukraine since the 1970s countless times, I know these women  and their bravery. There is nothing you can teach a grandma in Ukraine  that she hasn't been through. We call them babusyas. They are the  world's strongest women. They have endured so much. Ukraine's women are  truly engaged in a battle to slay Goliath.   Ukraine's passionate, generous, and courageous women are on the front  lines. There are some who are serving in the military itself, on the  home front, in their neighborhoods.   I don't know if anybody saw the babusya, a grandma, who had a pan,  and she hit an armed drone out of the air. How about that? They are  learning how to use guns, to do anything to help their people in  beating the savage attacks of Kremlin's Putin.                                time  2110    The entire world sees the bold spirit of these women. Here in  America, we see that spirit in Ukraine's remarkable Ambassador Oksana  Markarova, who has such dignity, dignity under pressure, real courage,  rallying our Nation and our leaders for the aid of her country. We must  hear her. We must hear the pleas of the people of Ukraine.   In the midst of unceasing atrocity, Ukraine's women are pouring their  hearts and souls into the righteous cause of defending the bright  shining light of liberty. They can see it.   I will tell you one experience I had when I first went to Ukraine,  and I watched how the people walked with their heads down, and they  didn't want to be noticed. They tried to be almost disappeared while  they were walking down the sidewalk. They didn't want to make eye  contact with anybody.   Today, when you go to Ukraine, the new generation, they look at you,  they have hope in their eyes, there is possibility. They want to access  West. There is no more noble duty than defending liberty and letting  others enjoy its bounty.   When envisioning the vanguards of democracy, don't think of some  mythical beings. Instead, think of the flesh and blood of Ukrainian  women who are protecting and defending the precious blessings of the  bit of democracy and liberty that they have been able to taste. These  women are the real heroines among us.   Today, America and the world rise up in solidarity with Ukraine's  women. Let us salute their valiant fight against the darkness and the  murderous behavior of Vladimir Putin. We stand with them, and we stand  with Ukraine. No country in the world has done more for Ukraine than  the people of our great country.   Today, on International Women's Day in the year of 2022, America  exclaims to Ukraine's women: Slava Ukraini. Thank you, we love you, we  know you are going to be victorious. It is going to take a bit more  time, but know that we in the free world stand with you and are doing  everything possible to save you, to save your beloved families, to save  your communities, to save your country. You so deserve the liberty that  you have earned.   I say in many of my speeches back home, there is no more sacred soil  than the soil of Ukraine because of what its people intergenerationally  have endured through no fault of their own. They deserve to be free.  They have earned it.
