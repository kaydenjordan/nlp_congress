 Madam President, let me first acknowledge my good friend  and my colleague Chuck Grassley, who has just paid tribute to a member  of his staff who has served for more than 30 years. I don't know her  personally, but we can tell his words were heartfelt and could tell of  his appreciation for her public service.   On behalf of the Senate, I want to thank her and all of the staff  people who make our careers possible. As talented as we may think we  are, we wouldn't be anywhere without staffers who are determined to  serve the people and serve us.   His tribute to his chief of staff--chief of everything, as he  described her--was certainly heartfelt from a man I know is a very  sincere and positive individual. I just wanted to say those words.                           Tribute to Joe Donnelly     Madam President, I also wanted to add my comments to what  was said earlier by the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, about our  departing colleague Joe Donnelly. We are really going to miss him. We  are going to miss all four who are not going to be back with us.   Joe is my neighbor in the State of Indiana. There is hardly a meeting  of  [[Page S7742]]  Democratic Senators where you don't hear some laughter and look at the  center of the meeting and see that it is Joe Donnelly. He makes us all  feel good about who we are and what we do, even when some of these  assignments we receive are pretty tough.   I want to join Chuck Schumer in saying thanks to Joe Donnelly for  serving Indiana and for being such a great colleague during these last  6 years. We will miss him.    Madam President, on a separate subject, this bill, S.  3747, is a bill which is historic. It is 149 pages, and the first 60  are pages that address prison reform. This bill in its entirety has  been endorsed by the political spectrum of America. I would say to  Senator Grassley that I can't remember another bill that had this kind  of support, left and right, liberal, conservative, Republican,  Democrat. It is all there, supporting this legislation.   To have a bill that Senator Grassley and I worked on with Senator Lee  and Senator Booker tells a story in and of itself--the four leaders on  this legislation--but then to consider the fact that President Trump  has endorsed it, that Vice President Pence has come to the Republican  conference lunch saying he is behind it and urging the Republican  caucus to support it as well, really speaks to the political  bipartisanship that we rarely, if ever, have seen in Washington.   The groups who are behind it are equally amazing. To have the  support, on an important criminal justice reform bill, of the Fraternal  Order of Police is a great starting point, as far as I am concerned.  Then to have the leading prosecutors--the leading criminal prosecutors  association--join with the police really tells us that on the law  enforcement side, we have the major players. On the other side,  incredibly, we have the American Civil Liberties Union supporting this  and most of the major civil rights organizations.   I think we have really struck a good point here where we have worked  and compromised for 5 or 6 years to reach this moment. It is possible  that as early as today, this bill will be up for us to vote on, but  before we reach that point, there is the possibility of amendments that  are going to be offered--three amendments, as we understand it, under  the current procedure. I would like to address generally the amendments  that will be offered.   Senator Cotton of Arkansas is the lead sponsor of these amendments.  There are three amendments because Senator Cotton took his original  amendment and literally divided it into three pieces, which is his  right under the Senate Rules of Procedure. I have taken a look at  those--a very close look, I might add--and I want to put on the record  some facts that I hope Members of the Senate on both sides will  consider when the Cotton amendments come before us on the floor.   One of the major elements in Senator Cotton's amendment is  ``notification of victims.'' In other words, if we are going to change  the status of a person in Federal prison to the point where they may be  released early, Senator Cotton suggests that we must--we must--notify  crime victims. It sounds reasonable on its face, and it is. In fact, it  is so reasonable that we currently have a law that guarantees that.   The Crime Victims' Rights Act is the Federal statute, and under the  Crime Victims' Rights Act, we say to victims: You have the right to  know if a criminal defendant who perpetrated a crime against you is  going to have a change in their status as a prisoner. We spell out many  other things in about 10 different provisions giving rights to crime  victims.   This isn't the only guarantee of crime victims learning what is  happening to the criminal defendant who perpetrated the crime. It turns  out that the Bureau of Prisons does the same thing. They notify crime  victims of change in status of the criminal defendant.   What is the difference? What is Senator Cotton trying to add to this?  He is adding to it an element that is very worrisome, and I am afraid  he hasn't thought it through clearly.   You see, under the Crime Victims Act, it is up to the crime victim to  determine whether they want to be notified. It turns out that over the  last 5 years, 10 percent of the crime victims, when given the offer of  being notified about a change in status of the criminal defendant, 10  percent of them--about 160,000--have said: No, we don't want to be  notified. We have consciously decided. Don't notify us.   Why? Why would a crime victim say: Don't notify me. Well, there are a  myriad of reasons. Consider the possibility that the victim is an  infant or a child who has gone through the horrible experience involved  in this crime, and the guardians or parents of that crime victim, who  is a child, have decided that they don't want their child to be exposed  to all of this information about some criminal defendant, for whatever  reason. It could be as a result of psychological counseling. It could  be that they don't want them to face retraumatization by going  through--reliving that horrible criminal experience.   Think of an adult who decides as a crime victim: I want to put this  behind me. I don't care to hear anything more about this. My life is  going to go on on a separate track, and this is the past. I want to  look to the future.   So a crime victim--even an adult--can decide, don't notify me. It is  their decision. It is not a government decision; it is an individual  decision. We give to crime victims the respect and the freedom to  decide if they will be notified. Senator Cotton does not. Senator  Cotton mandates notification, requires notification of the change in  status. That is serious, and it could have a serious impact on someone  who has already been victimized, forced into some horrible condition in  their life that they would be forced again to revisit again when they  do not want it, when they consciously do not want it.   What have the crime victims associations said about the Cotton  amendment? It is universal--they have said it is wrong, and they have  said that in very explicit terms. Let me tell you one group that I  think is important for us to consider: the Crime Survivors for Safety  and Justice. We believe it is the leading, largest crime victims  organization in America. Over 30,000 crime victims are part of this  organization to stand up for the rights of those who have been  victimized by crime. What do they have to say about the Cotton  amendment that would force notification on people who do not want it?  Here is what they say:         A mandatory notification requirement is contrary to the       victim-centered approach of avoiding re-traumatization.       Current law and DOJ policy permit a victim to determine       whether he or she wants notification of release. A mandate--    The Cotton amendment--       like this requires notification for those who may not want it       and could trigger trauma for thousands of victims many years       later after the crime.    They go on to say:         [Bureau of Prisons] data on the release date of any       prisoner is publicly available on the [Bureau of Prisons]       website. Victim notification is already required by law if       victims choose to receive the notice. The Crime Victims'       Rights Act provides the right to timely notice of any       release.        Victim notification already occurs through the [Department       of Justice's] Automated Victim Notification System if victims       opt to receive the notice. This system is a partnership with       the [Bureau of Prisons], the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection       Service, and the United States Attorney's Office. It is a       free, computer-based system, which provides victims with       information on scheduled court events, the outcomes of       events, custody status and release dates.    In other words, all of the information about the disposition of a  criminal defendant is currently available online, easily accessible by  crime victims if they choose to receive it. Ten percent of them--1 out  of 10--say: No, we don't want to receive it. Senator Cotton, with his  amendment, does not respect that decision by the 10 percent and says  they will be required to receive it. That is not good for crime  victims. It certainly violates the spirit of the Crime Victims' Rights  Act, where we leave that decision, when it comes to minors and even  adult victims, to the families affected. Why would we override that  provision in the law?    There is another group who has come forward, a woman by the name of  Tricia Forbes, a regional training manager with the Texas-based Crime  Survivors for Safety and Justice. In The Hill newspaper that was  published this morning, she has a lengthy article opposing the Cotton  amendments. Here is what she says:         Cotton and Senator Kennedy claim they are trying to protect       victims with an amendment to force the Federal Bureau of       Prisons  [[Page S7743]]       to notify victims of a crime when the perpetrator is being       transferred to pre-release custody, but their real goal is       simply to delay, dilute, and derail the bill. The existing       draft of the FIRST STEP Act was the result of careful,       bipartisan and bicameral negotiations. By adding their last-      minute amendments, Cotton and Kennedy want nothing more than       to break up the broad bipartisan coalition that has come       together to support this bill.    There is also a letter from Anne Seymour, project director for  Fairness, Dignity & Respect for Crime Victims & Survivors. This letter,  which she sent to all Members of the Senate, says:         I write today to urge you to vote No on Senators Cotton and       Kennedy's ``Victim Notification'' Amendment. It is clear that       Congress can and must do more to support the needs and rights       of crime victims and survivors. I am disappointed that almost       no elements of the FIRST STEP Act are tailored specifically       to the needs of victims. However, Senators Cotton and       Kennedy's proposed amendments neither comply with best       practices in trauma-informed victim services, nor improve       this bill.    She closes by saying:         I urge you to vote No on Senators Cotton and Kennedy's       amendments, and encourage you to offer solutions that are       better tailored to identify and address the critical needs of       crime victims and survivors in a manner that is survivor-      centered and trauma-informed.    So crime victims groups have come forward and said that the Cotton  amendments would be harmful to crime victims.   Those who wish to be notified have every right to be, and they are  provided that notification under statute and under existing policy of  the Bureau of Prisons. Those who opt out and say ``I don't want to be  notified'' should be respected. We should not force this on them.   I encourage my friends--those who are considering this bill and  discussing it with their staffs--to look closely at what the crime  victims organizations say about the Cotton amendments and understand  that if we are going to be respectful of these people who have been  victimized by crime, we have to vote no on those amendments.   The second element that has been raised by Senator Cotton in the  amendments relates to the crimes that are listed as making someone  ineligible for prison reform programs or early release programs. Our  bill is 60 pages long. More than a third of the bill is filled with a  list of over 60 different Federal crimes, and we say: If you committed  this crime, you are not eligible as a Federal prisoner for the  rehabilitation program in this bill. There are 60 different ones that  we have added.   Members would come up to us--Senator Grassley, myself, Senator  Booker, Senator Lee--and say: We think you ought to add such-and-such  crime. We would take a careful look at it, and in most cases, we agreed  to do it. Let me give an example.   Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative Republican from Texas--and I think  he wears that label proudly--said he would consider voting for our bill  if we would consider adding a number of crimes to the list of crimes  that would make a criminal defendant ineligible to ask for help under  this bill. We looked at it carefully. There were about six or eight of  these that we thought were acceptable. We asked if we could add those  to the list--a list of already 60 crimes. Unfortunately, Senator Cotton  objected. He did not want that added to the bill. Now it turns out he  is going to argue in his amendment that he wants part of the Cruz list  to be added at this point.   Well, we had a chance to do it, and it was a bipartisan measure, but  he objected to our adding it. However, he has one provision in his  amendment that goes far beyond Senator Cruz's list or the enumerated  crimes that we said make you ineligible. He has created a new category  of crime. I have read a lot of definitions over the years, but it is  really hard to follow what he is trying to achieve here because, in  addition to the enumerated crimes that would make you ineligible, he  adds the following: any offense that is not otherwise listed in the  subsection for which the offender is sentenced to a term of  imprisonment of more than 1 year and ``has as an element, the use,  attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person  or property of another.'' I have never seen that definition--``physical  force against the person or property of another.''   We went to the Sentencing Commission and said: How many crimes would  that include? They said: It is impossible to calculate. But we think  that at least 30,000 people would be ruled ineligible--by those words  that I have just read--who might otherwise be eligible for earlier  release.   So what he has come up with is his own definition of criminal  standard, one which we have never seen before, and he wants that to  apply to this bill, which we worked on for 6 years.   So I would say, when it comes to the Cotton amendments, Members of  the Senate really have a very clear and stark choice: They can support  a bill that has been worked on on a bipartisan basis and enjoys the  support of police, prosecutors, and those groups which protect our  constitutional rights--all together, right and left, supporting; they  can support a bill that has bipartisan support here on the floor of  colleagues and Members who rarely come together, but we have come  together on this bill because we found a good compromise; they can  support a bill that has the support of survivors and criminal victims  organizations; or they can vote for the Cotton amendments.   Supporting the Cotton amendments that are being offered--opposed by  crime victims' rights groups across the board, by the leading crime  victims' rights groups--is basically saying to these crime victims: We  are going to force this information on you whether it is in the best  interests of your family, whether you want it or not. That is not  respectful of crime victims.   I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the Cotton amendments.    I thank the Senator.   Yesterday, our colleague Senator Cornyn, a Republican from Texas,  came forward and said that his State of Texas and other States are  showing that they can reduce recidivism--in other words, committing  another crime after you are released--by treating prisoners differently  in their State prisons. As I said on the floor, you may be shocked to  think that Texas would be a leader in this, but they have been, and  they have seen a reduction in the incidence of crime and a reduction in  the incidence of incarceration--things we like to see happen. Reduce  the cost to taxpayers of the prisons, but reduce crime on the streets  too. Make sure you do both.   He believes they have achieved it. What they did was they looked at  programs that work. So what we did was the same thing. Senator Grassley  and I, as well as, as you mentioned, Senator Cornyn and Senator  Whitehouse, looked at these prison reform programs in the States and  said: What can we learn from them?   What we did was to establish the obligation of the Attorney General-- this  [[Page S7744]]  is not the obligation of social workers but the obligation of the  Attorney General of the United States to take a hard look at the  programs that work for prisoners. What can we do to make sure they  don't commit another crime, create another victim, and come back to  prison?   We spell out exactly what we are looking for: the most effective and  efficient, evidence-based recidivism-reduction programs. That is a long  title. What that basically means is that we don't want to waste any  more time here. We want to focus tax dollars on programs that have  proven results, and unless they commit one of the crimes that make them  ineligible, we offer these to prisoners. By participating in them, they  can reduce the time they serve or be released to a halfway house or  something similar to that. That is what this is all about, start to  finish, and we believe this will work.   What if they mess up in the course of being enrolled in the program?  We have a provision in here that says: You are done. You are either  going to do this in good faith, positively, without any violations of  your responsibilities as a Federal prisoner--we will give you a chance  for less time but no nonsense.   Good program. Good participation. We hope good results, and we are  going to measure it. We are going to come back. The General Accounting  Office is going to give us a report on our success--of those who are  released, how many turned around and committed another crime? So we are  going to take a hard look at this--an honest look, I might say. I  believe this is the best way to do it. Make sure it is evidence-based.  Make sure it is a fair opportunity for those who want to participate  and turn their lives around to do just that.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wanted to thank the Senator from Florida  for his kind words of encouragement on this criminal justice reform  bill that is pending before the Senate. I thank him. I know his  personal interest in this subject. I am going to miss his service and  his friendship here in the Senate Chamber. I want to thank him for his  many years of serving the people of Florida and for standing by me in  many causes. It is rare that one of these causes is so bipartisan, and  this one is.   I heard the testimony or the statement earlier by the Senator from  Louisiana, Mr. Kennedy. I count him as a friend. We have cosponsored  bills together, and I like him. We disagree on some issues, but we do  it in a very positive way, and in the comments I am about to make, I  want to be as positive as possible.   Senator Kennedy brought a chart to the floor and suggested that there  was no support by national law enforcement for the bill that is before  us, and he said that most of the State and local law enforcement groups  were opposed to it as well. I beg to differ with him.   I would like to submit for the record that currently we have the  support on this Grassley-Durbin bill from the American Correctional  Association, the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL- CIO, and the Council of Prisons. The very prison guards whom Senator  Kennedy referred to on his chart are in support of our position. The  Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, the Association of State  Correctional Administrators, and the Fraternal Order of Police supports  our bill, and, in addition, the International Association of Chiefs of  Police.   I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record the remainder of  these law enforcement, corrections, and government groups.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         First Step Act Supporters                  Law Enforcement, Corrections & Government          American Correctional Association;         American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,       Council of Prison;         Association of Prosecuting Attorneys;         Association of State Correctional Administrators;         Fraternal Order of Police;         International Association of Chiefs of Police;         International Community Corrections Association;         International Union of Police Associations AFL-CIO;         Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration;         National Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers;         National Black Prosecutors Association;         National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives       (NOBLE);         National District Attorneys Association;  [[Page S7757]]          National Governors Association;         United States Chamber of Commerce;         United States Conference of Mayors;         Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States;         172 former federal prosecutors and senior government       officials including former Attorneys General Michael B.       Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales.     Mr. President, at the heart of the amendments being  offered by Senators Cotton and Kennedy is an effort to provide  notification to crime victims. I spoke to this early this morning, and  I think it bears repeating.   It is interesting to note that they are arguing that their amendments  are necessary for the sake of crime victims. At the same time,  virtually every leading organization in America representing crime  victims supports our bill and opposes the amendment being offered by  Senators Cotton and Kennedy. Why do they oppose it? Because we already  have a law. The law says if you are a victim of crime, you have certain  rights written into the statute--some 10 specific areas where you have  the right to be consulted or notified if you are a victim and you want  to know what is going to happen to the person who is accused of the  crime of which you were a victim. It is only right that we do that, and  we have done it for a long time.   We also have regulatory provisions where the Bureau of Prisons will  not release someone without notification to the crime victims. So there  is a healthy pattern established by law that victims of crime in the  United States have the right to receive all of this information and, in  some cases, can actually participate in the proceeding. We voted on  that on a bipartisan basis years ago. That is the way it should be.   So what does the Cotton-Kennedy amendment add when it comes to crime  victims? It adds something that the crime victims organizations oppose.  Let me tell you what it is. You have a right as a crime victim to be  notified, but you are not mandated and required to be notified. That is  your call. It turns out that 10 percent of crime victims over the last  5 years--over 160,000 American crime victims--have chosen not to be  informed. They don't want to be notified. Why? Why would they not want  to be notified? What if the victim is a child in your family who was  the victim of a crime at an early age and you have decided, for the  sake of that child or our family, that you want to put this behind you?  Don't put me on the list, then, to notify me about what happens with a  criminal defendant. We want to put that chapter behind us. We want to  move forward as a family.   Or perhaps as a crime victim you are dealing with psychological  trauma--understandable. You are going through counseling, and you  believe that constant reminders about the criminal defendant don't help  you get well and don't help you move forward. You can make an  individual personal decision--you have the right to make it--that you  don't want to be notified.   Then, comes the amendment that will be on the floor tonight or  tomorrow. The amendment by Senators Cotton and Kennedy says: Forget  that; you are going to be notified whether you want to or not.   I think that is wrong.   Don't take my word for it. Go to the crime victims organizations and  ask them what they think. They think this mandatory notification will  retraumatize many crime victims. They respect the right for a crime  victim to say: I don't want to learn this. I don't want to know about  it. Don't send me these notifications.   They respect the crime victims and the circumstances, and the Cotton- Kennedy amendment does not. So at the heart of their amendment process,  in an effort to ``help crime victims,'' they have drafted a provision  that the leading crime victims organizations oppose. No Senator of  either party should vote for the Cotton-Kennedy amendments in this bill  and believe they are helping crime victims. They are not. The existing  law gives all crime victims the right to know and the right to be  informed, as well as the right to say: I don't want to know. Don't  contact me anymore. I want to put that behind me.   That is up to the individuals. The Cotton-Kennedy amendment,  unfortunately, moves into new territory and forces this information on  people who are not looking for it.   In addition to that, they have a list of crimes, if you have  committed these crimes and have been convicted--a list of crimes that  would be ineligible. You couldn't get the prison reform package that we  are talking about, the possibility of early release, if you commit  certain crimes. Well, we tried to take care to create a process that  was sensitive to this, and we started with a challenge. There were  5,000 Federal crimes. You wouldn't believe how many there are. We had  to go through and pick those that clearly should disqualify you from  getting any special treatment when it comes to your prison sentence. We  came up with a list that was 20 pages long of specific crimes--over 60  crimes--and after we produced the list, Members would come to us and  say: Well, what about this crime? Well, if we thought it was a  legitimate concern, we added it to the list. So we tried to be as  inclusive as possible and to cover the most serious crimes, whether  they involve violence or harm to an individual, and to be sensitive to  them.   Along the way, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas produced a list that he  wanted included. We took a good-faith look at it, and we agreed with  him on about 8 or 10 of the provisions he made. We said: We will  include these in our list. If you committed the crimes that Senator  Cruz came up with, you would be ineligible for this prison recidivist  program.   So we started to put it in the bill, and we thought it was in the  bill, incidentally, and we learned it had not been included. We asked  for unanimous consent to amend our own bill to include these new  categories and, unfortunately, the Republican leadership and Senator  Cotton objected. They wouldn't let us include a new list of crimes  which would make a person ineligible. That is unfortunate.   Sadly, the provision of one of the amendments from Senator Cotton is  now attempting to include some of those crimes in his list. We made a  good-faith effort to do this on a bipartisan basis, and we will  continue to do that.   I see the Senator from Pennsylvania has come to the floor.   The last point is that there is a provision in one of the Cotton- Kennedy amendments that redefines the crimes that would make you  ineligible to participate in this program. It is a new definition. It  includes a reference to something that you don't see often--violence to  property. I am not sure what that means. The use of physical force on  property is in the law in many places, but the terms ``violence against  property'' is something that I am not sure what Senator Cotton is  trying to achieve with this. It is going to create confusion.   Unfortunately, if you add every crime that might involve some damage  to property, you can see that it would expand the list dramatically and  go way beyond what we are trying to achieve. We are trying to give  those incarcerated who truly want to turn their lives around and who  truly want to have training and be ready to move forward the  opportunity to do just that.   So at this point I am going to conclude my remarks.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, when I  spoke to Senator Toomey about this issue, it personally struck a chord  with me. I recognize that we have had this same debate in the  Appropriations Committee. Its champion in the committee is Senator  James Lankford of Oklahoma, who has at least for 2 years, or maybe  longer, suggested the change the Senator from Pennsylvania brings to  the floor. I think he made a compelling argument, and I voted with him  for the change he wished to see in the law. We did not prevail in the  Appropriations Committee--at least didn't prevail in changing the  budget rules--but Senator Lankford, with his effort in the committee,  has prevailed in changing the allocation of funds.  [[Page S7759]]    The amendment Mr. Toomey, the Senator from Pennsylvania, offers  creates a new point of order against any CJS appropriations bill if it  doesn't spend at least the 3-year average of collections in the Crime  Victims Fund. There is good news. Because of Senator Lankford's effort  and the support of Senator Shelby, which the Senator from Pennsylvania  noted, the amendment is not necessary. Since fiscal years 2015 through  2018, the CJS appropriations bill has spent at least the 3-year average  of collections--a total of $12.4 billion--which has been returned to  crime victims. So we have, in fact, changed the budget policy that  governs how the Crime Victims Compensation fund is distributed.   What I would suggest, though, is that this good, worthy issue and  battle, which I would be happy to join, does not belong on this bill.  In fact, the result could complicate this bill and its passage. We have  been working to put this measure together for 6 years, Democrats and  Republicans. There were some 82 or more Senators--I know the Senator  from Pennsylvania was not one of them--who voted for cloture on this  bill because we felt we should move forward in this debate.   I might say, some of the amendments the Senator from Pennsylvania  said he is going to support for this bill are not helpful. They are  opposed by those who are behind the bill. Let's save this budget debate  for another day. On behalf of myself and the ranking member of the  Senate Appropriations Committee, I object.    Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statements  made by the Senator from Arkansas in terms of the pending business  before the Senate. We are close to reaching agreement to bring the  underlying bill--the criminal justice reform bill--for a vote this  evening. It is a bill that has been literally years in the making. I  believe we have discussed it at great length, and we are prepared to  make a decision in the Senate.   There will be three amendments offered by the Senator from Arkansas,  Mr. Cotton. After those amendments are offered, then we will launch  into another consideration of a change to the bill which has been  characterized as a Cruz-Lankford amendment. For the record, we reached  an agreement with Senator Cruz about this amendment. We reached an  agreement with Senator Lankford about his amendment on a bipartisan  basis, and I included a provision in there which required annual  reports on the success of this program, so we can measure it carefully  and see if it is working as we hoped it would.   There were three pieces to this for Senator Cruz, for Senator  Lankford, and a piece I offered for this annual report. We accepted  that language which will be considered in the Senate. I certainly hope  that when the request is made to include that language, the annual  report will be included in it so we can move forward very quickly on  the three Cotton amendments, as he suggested this evening.   We can agree on the Cruz, Lankford, and Durbin amendment. I think  that would not create any burden to move on that, and we are in a  position to consider final passage this evening. That seems to be the  lineup.   As I said to Senator Grassley and Senator Lee, my partners in this  effort, as well as Senator Booker, worked long and hard on this. We  have had police groups, prosecutors, civil liberties groups--all have  carefully reviewed this. No one is getting what they wanted completely.  This is a product of compromise. That is how you pass a bill in the  Senate--at least, that is my experience.   This is the strongest bipartisan bill I have seen in terms of  Democrats and Republicans working for final passage. It will be  significant and historic if we  [[Page S7777]]  are successful, but I will not presume that until we go through the  process of the amendments this evening.   I, again, thank my colleagues who have patiently waited for us to  reach this moment, but I think we have a chance to even move forward  this evening if we reach a basic agreement.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 3776         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring       Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, 4,000,000 women       give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications during       pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum       period, and 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related       complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other developed nations. The       estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births)       for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC increased       from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6       percent in 2018. This estimated rate is on par with such rate       for underdeveloped nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.        (3) International studies estimate the 2015 maternal       mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 per 100,000 live       births, which is almost twice the 2015 World Health       Organization estimation of 14 per 100,000 live births.        (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared       to non-Hispanic White women.        (6) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (5)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetrical       continuum represented by organizations such as March of       Dimes, the Preeclampsia Foundation, the American College of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-      Fetal Medicine, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric,       and Neonatal Nurses, the California Maternal Quality Care       Collaborative, Black Women's Health Imperative, the National       Birth Equity Collaborative, Black Mamas Matter Alliance,       EverThrive Illinois, the National Association of Certified       Professional Midwives, PCOS Challenge: The National       Polycystic Ovary Sundrome Association, and the American       College of Nurse Midwives.        (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are 12.7 deaths per       100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000       live births for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per       100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While       maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American       women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, mental health       conditions, preeclampsia and eclampsia, polycystic ovary       syndrome, infection and sepsis, and anesthesia complications       are the predominant medical causes of maternal-related deaths       and complications. Most of these conditions are largely       preventable or manageable.        (9) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (10) The United States has not been able to submit a formal       maternal mortality rate to international data repositories       since 2007. Thus, no official maternal mortality rate exists       for the United States. There can be no maternal mortality       rate without streamlining maternal mortality-related data       from the State level and extrapolating such data to the       Federal level.        (11) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on  [[Page S7792]]       death certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported       by States in an organized and standard format across States       such that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is       able to identify causes of maternal death and best practices       for the prevention of such death.        (12) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths. While the addition of       pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have       likely improved States' abilities to identify pregnancy-      related deaths, they are not generally completed by       obstetrical providers or persons trained to recognize       pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital forms may be       missing information or may capture inconsistent data. Due to       varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of       reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal       mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad       medical and socially determinant factors that contribute to       such high maternal mortality rates within the United States       compared to other developed nations. Lack of standardization       of data and data sharing across States and between Federal       entities, health networks, and research institutions keep the       Nation in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths.        (13) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths be investigated at the State level first, and       that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding       maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortality and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, pregnancy-      related or pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity.        (15) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not fully       available, the United States does not have an official       maternal mortality rate.        (16) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain       Maternal Mortality Review Committees (referred to in this       section as ``MMRC''). On the State level, MMRCs have lagged       because States have not had the resources to mount local       reviews. State-level reviews are necessary as only the State       departments of health have the authority to request medical       records, autopsy reports, and police reports critical to the       function of the MMRC.        (17) The United Kingdom regards maternal deaths as a health       systems failure and a national committee of obstetrics       experts review each maternal death or near-fatal childbirth       complication. Such committee also establishes the predominant       course of maternal-related deaths from conditions such as       preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom has been able       to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia to less than one in       10,000 women--its lowest rate since 1952.        (18) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States       have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal       wellness. For example, the State of California has worked       extensively with their State health departments, health and       hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,       including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative       and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to       establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most       prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and       shared data with providers and researchers, who have       developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols       related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol. To date, the State of California has       reduced its maternal mortality rate, which is now comparable       to the low rates of the United Kingdom.        (19) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetrical protocols       before, during, and after delivery. Consequently, many       providers are delayed in recognizing critical signs       indicating maternal distress that quickly escalate into fatal       or near-fatal incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an       obstetrical emergency that does not consider both clinical       and public health approaches falls woefully under the mark of       excellent care delivery. State-based maternal quality       collaborative organizations, such as the California Maternal       Quality Care Collaborative or entities participating in the       Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have formed       obstetrical protocols, tool kits, and other resources to       improve system care and response as they relate to maternal       complications and warning signs for such conditions as       maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and preeclampsia.        (20) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the       immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a       pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of pregnancy-related       or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still       pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on       the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the       end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.        (21) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive racism, can over-activate the body's stress-      response system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of       high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy       neurological development, which can have cascading physical       and mental health consequences, as documented in the Adverse       Childhood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention.        (22) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with one's       race--the stress of racism--and one's birthing outcomes. The       stress of sex and race discrimination and institutional       racism has been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk       of maternal mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age,       maternal age, socioeconomic status, or individual-level       health risk factors, including poverty, limited access to       prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health (although       these are not nominal factors). African-American women remain       the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-      related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for       example, which is related to obesity, African-American women       of normal weight remain the most at risk of dying during the       perinatal period compared to non-African-American obese       women.        (23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of African-American maternal mortality.        (24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from pregnancy or maternal-related distress than are       White women, yielding one of the greatest and most       disconcerting racial disparities in public health.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, African-American women across the socioeconomic       spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       racial and gender discrimination, contributing to higher       rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight       babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-      factor for these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative       stress often extends across the life course and is situated       in everyday spaces where African-American women establish       livelihood. Structural barriers, lack of access to care, and       genetic predispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate       African-American women's likelihood to experience poor or       fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the       great disparity.        (26) African-American women are twice as likely to       experience postpartum depression, and disproportionately       higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that patients       respond more warmly and adhere to medical treatment plans at       a higher degree with providers of the same race or ethnicity       or with providers with great ability to exercise empathy.       However, the provider pool is not primed with many people of       color, nor are providers (whether student-doctors in training       or licensed practitioners) consistently required to undergo       implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy training on a       consistent, on-going basis.

(2) Authorization of appropriations.--For purposes of       carrying out this subsection, there is authorized to be       appropriated $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through       2023.        (c) Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health Grant       Program.--        (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services, acting through the Associate Administrator of the       Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and       Services Administration, shall establish a grant program to       be known as the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health       Grant Program (referred to in this subsection as ``AIM'')       under which the Secretary shall award grants to eligible       entities for the purpose of--        (A) directing widespread adoption and implementation of       maternal safety bundles through collaborative State-based       teams; and        (B) collecting and analyzing process, structure, and       outcome data to drive continuous improvement in the       implementation of such safety bundles by such State-based       teams with the ultimate goal of eliminating preventable       maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the       United States.        (2) Eligible entities.--In order to be eligible for a grant       under paragraph (1), an entity shall--        (A) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in       such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary       may require; and        (B) demonstrate in such application that the entity is an       interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder national organization       with a national data-driven maternal safety and quality       improvement initiative based on implementation approaches       that have been proven to improve maternal safety and outcomes       in the United States.        (3) Use of funds.--An eligible entity that receives a grant       under paragraph (1) shall use such grant funds--        (A) to develop and implement, through a robust, multi-      stakeholder process, maternal safety bundles to assist States       and health care systems in aligning national, State, and       hospital-level quality improvement efforts to improve       maternal health outcomes, specifically the reduction of       maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity;        (B) to ensure, in developing and implementing maternal       safety bundles under subparagraph (A), that such maternal       safety bundles--        (i) satisfy the quality improvement needs of a State or       health care system by factoring in the results and findings       of relevant data reviews, such as reviews conducted by a       State maternal mortality review committee; and        (ii) address topics such as--         (I) obstetric hemorrhage;        (II) maternal mental health;        (III) the maternal venous system;        (IV) obstetric care for women with substance use disorders,       including opioid use disorder;        (V) postpartum care basics for maternal safety;        (VI) reduction of peripartum racial and ethnic disparities;        (VII) reduction of primary caesarean birth;        (VIII) severe hypertension in pregnancy;        (IX) severe maternal morbidity reviews;        (X) support after a severe maternal morbidity event;        (XI) thromboembolism; and        (XII) maternal oral health; and         (C) to provide ongoing technical assistance at the national       and State levels to support implementation of maternal safety       bundles under subparagraph (A).

This Act may be cited as the ``Forever GI Bill Housing       Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) On August 16, 2017, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans       Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48) (known       by some as the ``Forever GI Bill'') was enacted into law.        (2) Such Act makes certain improvements to the Post-9/11       Educational Assistance program for veterans, including       improvements relating to how the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs calculates the amount of payments for monthly housing       stipends under that program.        (3) Section 107 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 33 U.S.C.       3313 note) requires the Secretary to calculate the amount of       payments for monthly housing stipends based on the location       of the campus of the institution of higher learning where the       individual attends classes, a change from the previous       direction to make such calculation based on the location of       the institution of higher learning.        (4) Section 501 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 37 U.S.C.       403 note) repeals the inapplicability of a modification of       the basic allowance for housing for members of the uniformed       services to benefits administered by the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (5) The amendments made by section 107 and 501 of such Act       became effective on August 1, 2018, and January 1, 2018,       respectively.        (6) Representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs       have stated that the Department will not be able to determine       proper payment amounts based on the amendment made by section       107 of such Act until December 1, 2019.        (7) Representatives of the Department have also stated that       outdated information technology systems have stymied efforts       to update necessary information that enable proper housing       payments as required by the provisions of law amended by       sections 107 and 501 of such Act.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) as soon as possible, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       should end the making of improper payment amounts for monthly       stipends under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code;        (2) by January 1, 2020, the Secretary should make whole the       individuals entitled to payments of monthly stipends under       section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, who have been       underpaid as a result of the difficulties encountered by the       Department of Veterans Affairs in carrying out such section       after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of the  [[Page S7796]]       Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017       (Public Law 115-48); and        (3) no individuals entitled to payments of monthly stipend       under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, who have       been overpaid as a result of the difficulties encountered by       the Department in carrying out such section after the       enactment of sections 107 and 501 of such Act should have       overpayments recuperated by the Department.       SEC. 3. TIGER TEAM FOR HOUSING STIPENDS.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than one day after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall establish a tiger team (in this section       referred to as the ``Tiger Team'') dedicated to addressing       the difficulties encountered by the Department of Veterans       Affairs in carrying out section 3313 of title 38, United       States Code, after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of       the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of       2017 (Public Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37 U.S.C.       403 note).        (b) Composition.--Not later than 15 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to       Congress the names and titles of the employees of the       Department who compose the Tiger Team established under       subsection (a), including the name and title of the senior-      level employee of the Department who serves as the lead       accountable official of the Tiger Team.        (c) Duties.--        (1) Submission to congress.--Not later than 90 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Tiger Team shall       submit to Congress the following:        (A) A plan describing the following:        (i) How the Secretary will obtain the information necessary       to determine the correct payment amounts for monthly stipends       under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, made       after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of the Harry W.       Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public       Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37 U.S.C. 403 note), from       officials responsible for the certification of payments of       monthly stipends made under section 3313 of such title.        (ii) How the Secretary will modify the relevant information       technology systems of the Department to correct the payment       amounts for monthly stipends under section 3313 of such title       made after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of such Act       (Public Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37 U.S.C. 403       note) that were deficient.        (iii) How the Secretary will identify all of the       individuals who received payments of monthly stipends under       section 3313 of such title that were not in compliance with       such section, after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of       such Act (Public Law 115-48; 38 U.S.C. 3313 note and 37       U.S.C. 403 note).

(d) Termination.--On the date that is 60 days after the       date on which the Tiger Team submits the final report       required by subsection (c)(3), the Secretary shall terminate       the Tiger Team established under subsection (a).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 3776         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring       Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, 4,000,000 women       give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications during       pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum       period, and 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related       complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other developed nations. The       estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births)       for the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC increased       from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6       percent in 2018. This estimated rate is on par with such rate       for underdeveloped nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.        (3) International studies estimate the 2015 maternal       mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 per 100,000 live       births, which is almost twice the 2015 World Health       Organization estimation of 14 per 100,000 live births.        (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared       to non-Hispanic White women.        (6) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (5)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetrical       continuum represented by organizations such as March of       Dimes, the Preeclampsia Foundation, the American College of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-      Fetal Medicine, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric,       and Neonatal Nurses, the California Maternal Quality Care       Collaborative, Black Women's Health Imperative, the National       Birth Equity Collaborative, Black Mamas Matter Alliance,       EverThrive Illinois, the National Association of Certified       Professional Midwives, PCOS Challenge: The National       Polycystic Ovary Sundrome Association, and the American       College of Nurse Midwives.        (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are 12.7 deaths per       100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000       live births for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per       100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While       maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American       women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, mental health       conditions, preeclampsia and eclampsia, polycystic ovary       syndrome, infection and sepsis, and anesthesia complications       are the predominant medical causes of maternal-related deaths       and complications. Most of these conditions are largely       preventable or manageable.        (9) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and low birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (10) The United States has not been able to submit a formal       maternal mortality rate to international data repositories       since 2007. Thus, no official maternal mortality rate exists       for the United States. There can be no maternal mortality       rate without streamlining maternal mortality-related data       from the State level and extrapolating such data to the       Federal level.        (11) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on  [[Page S7792]]       death certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported       by States in an organized and standard format across States       such that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is       able to identify causes of maternal death and best practices       for the prevention of such death.        (12) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths. While the addition of       pregnancy checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have       likely improved States' abilities to identify pregnancy-      related deaths, they are not generally completed by       obstetrical providers or persons trained to recognize       pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital forms may be       missing information or may capture inconsistent data. Due to       varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of       reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal       mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad       medical and socially determinant factors that contribute to       such high maternal mortality rates within the United States       compared to other developed nations. Lack of standardization       of data and data sharing across States and between Federal       entities, health networks, and research institutions keep the       Nation in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths.        (13) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths be investigated at the State level first, and       that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding       maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortality and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, pregnancy-      related or pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity.        (15) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not fully       available, the United States does not have an official       maternal mortality rate.        (16) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain       Maternal Mortality Review Committees (referred to in this       section as ``MMRC''). On the State level, MMRCs have lagged       because States have not had the resources to mount local       reviews. State-level reviews are necessary as only the State       departments of health have the authority to request medical       records, autopsy reports, and police reports critical to the       function of the MMRC.        (17) The United Kingdom regards maternal deaths as a health       systems failure and a national committee of obstetrics       experts review each maternal death or near-fatal childbirth       complication. Such committee also establishes the predominant       course of maternal-related deaths from conditions such as       preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom has been able       to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia to less than one in       10,000 women--its lowest rate since 1952.        (18) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States       have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal       wellness. For example, the State of California has worked       extensively with their State health departments, health and       hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,       including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative       and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to       establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most       prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and       shared data with providers and researchers, who have       developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols       related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and the like.       In this way, the State of California has been able to       leverage its maternal mortality review board system, generate       data, and apply those data to effect changes in maternal       care-related protocol. To date, the State of California has       reduced its maternal mortality rate, which is now comparable       to the low rates of the United Kingdom.        (19) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetrical protocols       before, during, and after delivery. Consequently, many       providers are delayed in recognizing critical signs       indicating maternal distress that quickly escalate into fatal       or near-fatal incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an       obstetrical emergency that does not consider both clinical       and public health approaches falls woefully under the mark of       excellent care delivery. State-based maternal quality       collaborative organizations, such as the California Maternal       Quality Care Collaborative or entities participating in the       Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have formed       obstetrical protocols, tool kits, and other resources to       improve system care and response as they relate to maternal       complications and warning signs for such conditions as       maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and preeclampsia.        (20) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the       immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a       pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of pregnancy-related       or pregnancy-associated deaths occur while a person is still       pregnant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid program on       the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the       end of the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands.        (21) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive racism, can over-activate the body's stress-      response system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of       high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy       neurological development, which can have cascading physical       and mental health consequences, as documented in the Adverse       Childhood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention.        (22) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with one's       race--the stress of racism--and one's birthing outcomes. The       stress of sex and race discrimination and institutional       racism has been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk       of maternal mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age,       maternal age, socioeconomic status, or individual-level       health risk factors, including poverty, limited access to       prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health (although       these are not nominal factors). African-American women remain       the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-      related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for       example, which is related to obesity, African-American women       of normal weight remain the most at risk of dying during the       perinatal period compared to non-African-American obese       women.        (23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of African-American maternal mortality.        (24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times more likely to       die from pregnancy or maternal-related distress than are       White women, yielding one of the greatest and most       disconcerting racial disparities in public health.        (25) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, African-American women across the socioeconomic       spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       racial and gender discrimination, contributing to higher       rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight       babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-      factor for these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative       stress often extends across the life course and is situated       in everyday spaces where African-American women establish       livelihood. Structural barriers, lack of access to care, and       genetic predispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate       African-American women's likelihood to experience poor or       fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the       great disparity.        (26) African-American women are twice as likely to       experience postpartum depression, and disproportionately       higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White women.        (27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that patients       respond more warmly and adhere to medical treatment plans at       a higher degree with providers of the same race or ethnicity       or with providers with great ability to exercise empathy.       However, the provider pool is not primed with many people of       color, nor are providers (whether student-doctors in training       or licensed practitioners) consistently required to undergo       implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy training on a       consistent, on-going basis.
