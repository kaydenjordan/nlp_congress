 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  effort to pass the National Defense Authorization Act. It is a strong  bipartisan, bicameral compromise to address many of the quality-of-life  needs of our servicemembers and their families.   The conference report that I signed reiterates America's commitment  to supporting a diverse force that reflects our Nation and protects the  reproductive rights of servicemembers by keeping DoD's travel policy  for noncovered medical care intact.   The bill includes a well-deserved pay raise for our servicemembers  and expands eligibility for the basic needs allowance program so our  military families can have more money in their pockets. These and  several other provisions, like improvements to barracks and housing  facilities and other issues, will address recruitment and retention of  our military, which is vital.   Our servicemembers and their families make incredible sacrifices for  us. By passing this bill, we are reinforcing our commitment to them.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues in both parties to support and  pass this important piece of legislation.                            ____________________
