 Mr. Speaker, let me just start by saying  thank you to our leader for his moral clarity and leadership for all of  us.   As Memorial Day weekend approaches and we remember those who gave so  much, the last full measure of devotion, Republicans are adjourning the  House and scurrying out of town, leaving behind the mess of their own  making, walking out on paying our bills, turning their backs on gun  violence crises, walking away from a broken immigration system.   Democrats are ready to work. It is clear Republicans are not.   Empty promises and messaging bills for the purpose of getting on FOX  News or Newsmax is not real work. The real work is legislating  solutions for America's families.   We need leaders, not someone afraid of his own caucus, not folks who  punch out in the middle of an unfinished workweek, but leaders willing  to serve the American people, not a corrupted base.   That is what I signed up for when I ran for office.   I challenge the Republican majority: Be public servants.   When Republicans adjourn, I am not going home. No, I am heading to  the border with many of my colleagues right here in this Chamber to see  how we can best develop a more humane, secure border. Democrats are not  walking away from the hard issues.   Republicans, come on back and do your job.                            ____________________
