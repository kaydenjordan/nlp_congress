 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an educator  from the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas who has dedicated  her life to teaching the next generation. Kay York, principal of  Ashdown High School, was named the 2018 Arkansas Principal of the Year,  and it is an honor that is well earned.   Ms. York began her career as a kindergarten teacher and then  librarian before going to Ashdown Elementary in 1989 as a school  counselor. During a meeting this week, she explained how she has worked  to introduce more career and technical education.   Partnering with a local community college, students receive  instruction in trade skills and concurrent college credit in order to  be college- and career-ready when leaving the halls of high school. It  is this innovation in the local school that is helping Ashdown students  prepare for a growing economy.   Mr. Speaker, Kay York is a leader in education, and I am grateful for  the work she is doing in the Fourth Congressional District.                            ____________________
