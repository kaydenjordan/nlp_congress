 Madam Speaker, last night, in this Chamber,  we heard President Trump call on the 115th Congress to repeal and  replace ObamaCare with reforms that expand patient choice, increase  their access to substantive health care, lower costs for our friends  and neighbors, and, at the same time, provide better quality health  care.   I am here today to say that my colleagues and I are doing just that.  We have listened to the families who have lost income and access to  their doctors. My own corner of northeast Georgia is full of  individuals who work tirelessly to care for their families, and  ObamaCare has made it harder for them to see their doctors.   The first promise that ObamaCare broke was that if people liked their  insurance, they could keep it. As the insurance market continues its  death spiral, we see insurance providers offering less coverage for  more money.   Now, my colleagues and I have a choice to make: rescue our failing  healthcare system by repealing ObamaCare and returning competition and  innovation to the healthcare landscape, or go down in history as  leaders who did not keep their promises; as leaders who allowed their  neighbors to suffer under what may be the most misguided, destructive  policy of our generation.   The choice is clear. The choice is urgent. The choice is simple:  Republicans are leading in healthcare reform that will bring relief to  Americans who have only experienced the broken promises of ObamaCare.  We are offering affordable, flexible healthcare options that prioritize  patients over bureaucrats, and we are doing it together.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back. It is  good to be back on the floor, as we have been now, for the last few  weeks doing the people's business, and we will continue to move  forward.   I appreciate the last speaker discussing pharmaceutical prices. I  think it is another issue, but we are going to go straight to really  what I believe is the bigger cause of problems in our communities, and  that is the pharmacy benefit managers and their monopolistic, terrorist  kind of ways that they are dealing with our community pharmacies and  independent pharmacies and actually causing problems in health care.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material in the Record on this Special Order  hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material in the Record on this Special Order  hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, as we get started now, we have a  lot of speakers. This is something that has been on my heart for a  while, and I know that it is something we have been getting more and  more comments and questions about, especially when you are dealing with  the pharmaceutical prices and the Pharma industry.   When they begin to look into it, they began to see that there was  actually a bigger issue. It was not just big pharmacy and the problems  that we do see in drug pricing. It was the end delivery that is going  to the pharmacies and how the independent community pharmacists are  being beaten down in a way that is really unseemly in our society. They  are taking that healthcare line tonight.   I have a lot of speakers, and I have a lot of stuff that I am going  to be talking about.   Just as an important reminder: A community pharmacist is an important  niche in our healthcare system, serving as the primary healthcare  provider for over 62 million people. Especially in our rural and  suburban areas, this is a vital lifeline. Roughly 40 percent of the  prescriptions nationwide and a higher percentage in rural Georgia-- especially in northeast Georgia--are filled by our friends in the  independent community pharmacy system.   Look, the problems that we have and we are going to be discussing  even further tonight, we are going to delve into some issues that we  want to see taken care of. We want to see this industry, especially in  dealing with pharmacy benefit managers, put into proper perspective so  that we can actually take care of our constituents.   A gentleman who has been a fighter and a leader with me on this from  day one since I have been in Congress and dealing with this issue,  especially with transparency, is the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Loebsack). This is a fight that we are going to continue to keep  fighting. I know he is as well, and we have a lot of friends tonight to  help us out.   I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack) as he continues to  try  [[Page H1450]]  to tell the story that we have been trying to tell here for a long  time.    I appreciate the gentleman being here. I know  there are others from across the aisle that are joining us in this  fight, and we are looking forward to continuing.   Mr. Speaker, I am just going to highlight a few things as we go  through, and we are going to move through some of our speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight something that pharmacy benefit  managers, PBMs, for those watching, may not know about, and they don't  want you to know about it, and it is called spread pricing. Really,  what happens there is PBMs have the maximum allowable cost, which is  what Mr. Loebsack was just talking about, that determine the maximum  amount a pharmacy will be reimbursed for certain generic drugs.   However, the PBMs' reimbursement price determinations are hidden.  There is no transparency in the process. That is the bill that we are  going to be putting out.    PBMs commonly manipulate the pricing by something called spread  pricing. PBMs charge employers a higher price for drugs than necessary,  and reimburse pharmacies at the MAC, or the maximum allowable cost,  which is typically lower.   Spread pricing allows PBMs to skim money from the difference between  the high rate they charge for a prescription and the low rate they  reimburse pharmacies. Spread pricing is artificially raising the  acquisition cost of pharmacy drugs by overcharging at the expense of  retail pharmacies, consumers, and health plans. And that is probably  one of the better things they do. This gets worse. We are going to  continue to talk about it.   Tonight I look forward to hearing some more from my friend. I yield  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin). Welcome to the show.    I think the gentleman is hitting on something  and, Mr. Speaker, I think this is really something we need to discuss.  We are not discussing simply a business model that was designed in a  vacuum, that was designed to help.   Early on I stated this, and I state it every time we have this. PBMs,  in their first iteration, as they first came about, were a good  mechanism to provide pricing and between the pharmacies and the  wholesalers.   The problem was when they became vertically integrated, when they  started owning distribution chains, when they started owning their  actual end-result pharmacies. When they started doing this, it became  then that they are negotiating for themselves. And this is where the  end-user--at the end of the day, the person who pays is the Federal  Government, but also the customer, our constituents. This is what  happens here, and we are losing community and independent pharmacists  every day. This is just not right.   When three companies control 80 percent of the market and they use  tactics like gag orders and other things, where they don't want their  pharmacists to talk about it, where they send out letters saying that  the pharmacist is not on their plan anymore when clearly the pharmacist  is, but then refuse to send a retraction letter, this is just--I have  said this, and I have had people call me after we have talked about  this, Mr. Speaker, where they basically said it is amazing this is  happening. And all I say is it is true, and it has never really been  refuted.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and  welcome him here to the floor to talk more about this important issue  for our communities.    The gentleman couldn't have laid it out any  better. That is exactly what we are talking about. If every Member of  our body would go home and just go to their community pharmacy, they  would hear this all over the country. This is not new.   I have been on this floor now for almost 2\1/2\ years talking about  this, and I have not had PBMs come to me and say: Well, no, that's not  really true.   Because they do it. So I thank the gentleman for being a part and  lending your voice in your community.   We are also very blessed in this body to have someone who doesn't  have to come to it like I did in having to deal with it from a family  perspective or from my community. We have someone who has actually done  this for a living. He is my friend from southeast Georgia. He is a  pharmacist. He has made this his life.   I saw he was up at his alma mater the other day, and, President Cathy  Cox, I would have to say he is a Young Harris man.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Before the gentleman goes, you told the story  about getting a call from your own pharmacist. You and I were here  together, I think, sometime 6 months ago. We were doing this and  talking about this issue of mail order. We were talking about this.   I had a Member who was watching us on the floor talk about the  pharmacy and the PBM problem and got a call from the PBM because they  had gotten a prescription for their child. Yes, the day before they are  getting a call in their office from the PBM saying: If you just switch  from your local pharmacist, we will do it better. That is why we are  sitting here.   An interesting thing you brought up on DIR fees. What we have right  here sort of describes what you were talking about. I am putting it  here so people can see it.   There is an interesting part of this DIR fee issue. It forces  Medicare part D beneficiaries to pay inflated prices at the point of  sale that are higher in actual cost than the drugs. The cost of the  drug will be recouped in DIR fees, which is retroactively assessed  later.   Many beneficiaries are moving past their part D benefit faster and  hitting the doughnut hole sooner, forcing them to pay out-of-pocket  costs. This is particularly true with lifesaving or specialty drugs.  These are things that we are seeing.   Patients forced to pay out of pocket might be forced to cut back or  abandon treatment. According to the Community Oncology Alliance,  pharmacists lose $58,000 per practice, on average, to DIR fees each  year. This makes it difficult for independent community pharmacists to  keep up.   When patients pass through the doughnut hole into catastrophic  coverage, guess who picks it up? CMS takes on the cost-sharing burden.  This is why this matter is in Congress. These costs have increased from  $10 billion in 2010 to $33 billion in 2015. This is just dealing with  this issue.   We have got to have greater transparency on this. This is why Morgan  Griffith's bill is good and we are going to continue to fight about  this.   Again, I have yet to have a PBM tell me I am wrong here. I know from  your experience you are seeing it as well.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), our other  friend from south Georgia who has been outspoken on this. He comes to  the floor to talk about his experiences with this as well.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Collins, I had several parents in my  office today. I thought I would talk about a couple of the meetings  that I had.   I had a father there talking about his son Gabe. He had a T-shirt on  with ``H4G,'' which stands for ``Hope for Gabe.'' I listened to him  talk about his son and the life-threatening disease that his son has  and the threat that his son is under because of a U.S. pharmaceutical  manufacturer named Marathon. I would like to read part of an email that  I have from him:         Hope you are well. I just wanted to let you know that my       son Gabe takes a drug called Deflazacort. He has since he was       5 years old. He is now 11. We currently pay $116 for a 3-      month supply of 15-milligram dose for Deflazacort. We were       getting this drug from Europe, as it was not available here       in the United States, and have had no problem with access to       date.    Now, many of you heard about this story. The FDA approved the same  drug for sale in the United States. What did the drug manufacturer do  with the price of it? Well, Marathon took the price from $116 a quarter  to approximately $87,000 a year.   Now, this is what is happening. For drugs that are available  everywhere  [[Page H1455]]  else in the world, it is not that they are being developed with  extensive research and expensive research in our country. People are  simply buying the right to sell the drug in the United States. As soon  as approved and available in the U.S. marketplace, it is no longer  legal for people to import that drug from Europe. Marathon priced the  drug at $89,000 per year.   Reading again from his email, in bold letters:         It is the same drug we are getting today from Europe for       $450 per year, the exact same drug. We need your help here.       The Duchenne community needs your help, and specifically Gabe       needs your help.                                time  1930    As I sit here and look at the American flag, you know, there is no  other country in the world that allows their citizens to be treated  like this. None. I am embarrassed that this Congress hasn't done  anything about this abuse to the American citizens from the  pharmaceutical and the PBM industry.   I know our President, and I am glad that we have a President with the  courage and the boldness that our President has, had the executives to  the White House. I would suggest that a good meeting also would be to  have the parents--have the father of Gabe, have the mother of Gabe come  to the White House. Sit down in the same room with the TVs on with the  executives from those companies that are cheating these people. Let's  let the executives explain on TV in front of the parents, in front of  the child who needs that lifesaving drug why it costs $450 in another  country but should cost $87,000 in America.   Another group of parents that was in my office today was there  representing juvenile diabetes. I had a heart-wrenching discussion with  a mother in my office in Warner Robins about her daughter, insulin- dependent. She has got to have it or she dies. This mother had a job,  actually, in another country and talked about what she paid in another  country to receive that same drug, insulin, for her child. It cost a  fraction of what it cost in America.   I think it would be great for our President to have that mother and  that daughter or the mother who was in my office today talking about  her daughter come and sit down at the White House, and maybe the  president of Eli Lilly could come and sit down. Maybe we could put the  TV on, the cameras on so everybody in America could see the CEO explain  why insulin, which has been around for decades, costs as much in this  country as it does when it doesn't cost anywhere near that in any other  country.   Something has got to give. Something has got to give. The American  families have given enough. I am hopeful that we will move sooner  rather than later. American families can't take it anymore. A drug that  costs $450, that can be imported from Europe, shouldn't cost $87,000 in  America.   On top of the issues with what is happening with the manufacturers,  we have got the issue with the PBMs.   Why shouldn't you know what the PBMs are getting in a kickback?   Everywhere else you go, you get a price sticker. You know what the  rebates are when you go to your local car dealer. They are readily  advertised.   Why shouldn't you know as the American citizen?   My friend Mr. Collins and I have been working on it for years. We  worked on it back in the State legislature. In fact, we passed a bill  back in, I think, 1987, the first transparency act that we passed in  the State legislature in Georgia. I hope that governors and members of  the State legislatures will go back and address this issue as well. The  transparency issues can be done at the State level. That bill came to  the Georgia House floor, and it passed 150-0. Not a single Democrat,  not a single Republican voted against that bill. Every single member  who was there that day voted for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, we know something has got to be done. I just hope that  we take action sooner rather than later.   I would just like to make one last request. Mr. President, I hope you  will invite these parents and their children to the White House. I hope  you will invite the CEOs of these companies to come and sit down at the  same table, and I hope you will even invite the press to come and  publicize the meeting.   I thank Mr. Collins so much for standing up for the American  citizens. I am honored to be a friend of his, and I thank him for  allowing me to be in the fight.    Representative Scott brings out this issue  with passion. That is exactly what we need as we go forward in this  discussion.   This is exactly what the PBMs don't want to have. They don't want to  have transparency. They don't want to talk about it. We have been  talking about it now for years on this floor. It just continues to get  worse.   In fact, the Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act that we are  getting ready to introduce--and Mr. Scott and others are part of it-- just the other day they were trying to undercut this bill.   I recently saw an interview with Mark Merritt. He is the CEO of PCMA,  the trade group for PBMs. The article misrepresented PBMs' role in the  marketplace. Now, that is a shocker, really. Distorting the facts to  protect PBMs' ability to continue profiting at the expense of  beneficiaries and taxpayers.   So tonight let's have a little fact check. Let's look at the claims  by Mr. Merritt versus the truth.   First, Mr. Merritt claimed that PBMs play an important role in  negotiating price discounts in order to pass those savings along to  customers. In fact, what he said was:         We have an interest in lower price or bigger discounts . .       . and we're going to negotiate the most aggressive discounts       we can.    Well, it is true that PBMs do effectively negotiate huge discounts.  However, the patients never see this discount or rebates reflected in  their prices or out-of-pocket costs. These rebates and discounts merely  pad PBMs' profit margins. They do not increase patients' well-being.  This lack of transparency allows PBMs to receive massive rebates and  refuse to pass those savings along to consumers or customers.   In fact, what is interesting, there is proof that transparency in MAC  pricing saves more money than the PBMs are willing to admit.   You want an example?   Let's look to Texas. Texas has one of the oldest MAC-style laws.  Texas passed MAC transparency legislation similar to the Prescription  Drug Price Transparency Act in June of 2013.   Now, here we go, Mark, explain this one.   Since Texas passed their law, their Medicaid fee-for-service  prescription drug expenditures for the top 100 drugs fell from $219.54  per prescription to $91.32. Yep, you are doing a good job negotiating  for your bottom line.    What else does he say?   Number two, Merritt tries to distort the purposes of the Prescription  Drug Transparency Act by drawing concern to transparency in the drug  marketplace. Let's see what he says. He says:         The kind of transparency to be concerned about is where       competing drug companies and competing drugstores can see the       detailed arrangements that we have with all of their       competitors.    Well, seeing as how they own part of the competitors, not really a  lot of things going on there.   Our legislation simply would not allow competing drug companies to  see detailed arrangements that PBMs have with competitors.   Mark, quit lying.   This statement is a misrepresentation of what the Prescription Drug  Transparency Act does. Competing pharmacies would not be able to see  the arrangements their opponents have with PBMs because they would not  be publicly disclosed. Transparency measures and contractual agreements  include confidentiality clauses preventing public disclosure.   May I remind Mark that he has gag orders in some States where the  pharmacists can't even talk about these issues.   By the way, they send letters to pharmacists saying: Oh, don't go  talk to your elected officials, because if you do, we will cut your  contract off.   Wow, that is concern, Mark.   Furthermore, the disclosure of sources of drug pricing determinations  remains confidential and is only disclosed to pharmacies and their  contracting entities. PBMs distort transparency to mean only public  transparency in an attempt to protect the profitability that comes with  keeping their corrupt business practices in the dark. I wish he would  have stopped there. He didn't.  [[Page H1456]]    Let's go on to the third. Mark Merritt says:         We want to make sure that wholesalers who sell to the       drugstore aren't trying to sell the most expensive thing and       pass the cost onto consumers.    All right. Here we go again. This is getting familiar. It has little  to do with wholesalers. PBMs design the formularies--yes, we understand  this, Mark--that dictate what drugs are covered by insurers. Because  there is no transparency, PBMs are able to receive drugs at discounted  prices but refuse to tell employers. PBMs are then able to still charge  employers the full amount for the drug, even though they are receiving  it cheaper. PBMs often receive large rebates to incentivize them to  include expensive brand name drugs in their formularies, even though  cheaper generics are available.   Mr. Speaker, listen. They receive large rebates to incentivize them  to include the expensive brand name drugs on their formularies. I had  an issue just like that with my own mother just recently. She needed  medication. She had been on it for 8 months. They had to reauthorize it  after the first of the year.   I asked: Well, is there another issue she could have?   They said: Well, this is the only one on the formulary.   PBMs don't control pricing; PBMs don't control what drugs come to  market. Another falsehood. PBMs substitute expensive drugs and  overcharge Medicare part D, TRICARE, and FEHB programs. This means they  are lining their pockets with money from the taxpayers.   Fourth thing:         If drugstores like those terms, they can sign a contract;       and if they don't, they can join with some other plan or PBM.    Oh, I love this. This is classic, Mr. Speaker. PBMs hold a  disproportionate share of the marketplace. We have already talked about  three of the largest PBMs own 80 percent of the market--80 percent.  Because PBMs have a stranglehold on the market, community pharmacists  cannot stay in business without being forced to contract with them. It  forces community pharmacists to sign take-it-or-leave-it contracts with  anticompetitive and unfair provisions, and from transmitting it without  written consent. These are just crazy.   I had--one of my pharmacists who was on their plan actually had a  letter sent to their customers who said: You are no longer on the plan.   He called the PBM. The PBM said: No, you are still on the plan.   He said: Then why did you send a letter out?   PBM said: Oops, must have been a mistake.   He said: Well, why don't you send a letter out telling them that they  are wrong?   PBM said: Oh, we don't do that. That is on you.   Yeah, because all you want to do is keep the money, follow the money.  Mark, it is easy. I understand running a trade association is tough,  but at least be honest about it.   The last thing. Community pharmacists typically get paid more by  plans because there is not as much competition. Well, five for five.  Community pharmacists in northeast Georgia and across the United States  are under constant threat of going out of business because of PBMs.  PBMs exploit the market, prey upon community pharmacists, using spread  pricing and retroactive DIR fees. PBMs also use a disproportionate  share of the market to steer patients to pharmacies they own  themselves.   The Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act is vitally important to  improving fairness and transparency in the healthcare system. Community  pharmacists must be kept in business and patients should have the  choice to receive care from their local pharmacists. Community  pharmacists might be afraid to stand up to PBMs. Community pharmacists  many times are basically scared into submission.   I have stood on the floor of this House many times. My pharmacists  can't speak, but I can, and I will remind the PBMs one more time: You  can't audit me. You can go audit for profit, which you do every day.  You can go hit them, but you can't hit me.    I will continue to be a voice for community pharmacists. These  Members are being a voice for community pharmacists. Our numbers are  rising every day. The President himself has actually begun to look at  those middlemen and those pricing.   Tonight ends another night of telling the truth when the truth needs  to be told. Mr. Speaker, we end another time of standing up for the  American people and the community pharmacists.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
