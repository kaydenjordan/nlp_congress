 Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic is devastating my  community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties. I talk to these families  every day.   As our Nation continues to grapple with the deadly effects of the  opioid epidemic, it is crucial we take every step possible to stop  prescription medication from falling into the wrong hands. We need to  ensure that our medical professionals possess the latest best practices  for preventing prescription medication abuse, including nonopioid pain  management. This is why I am proud the House is considering my REACH  OUT Act, H.R. 5796.   By facilitating outreach to outlier opioid prescribers, the REACH OUT  Act seeks to educate physicians on their prescribing behaviors without  limiting their ability to deliver patient care. It will be an effective  step toward reducing the amount of unnecessary prescription opioids in  communities across the Nation.   The Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy Outcomes for  Users' Treatment Act, the REACH OUT Act, H.R. 5796, will direct the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to work with eligible  entities, including quality improvement organizations, to engage in  outreach with prescribers identified as clinical outliers to share best  practices to evaluate their prescribing behavior.                                time  1500    H.R. 5796 would build on the lessons learned from CMS special  innovation projects, by spreading best practices for preventing  prescription drug abuse, providing outreach and education about  nonopioid pain management, and reducing the number of opioids  prescribed by outlier prescribers.   An outlier prescriber is identified by the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, in consultation with professional stakeholders, as one  who prescribes an excessive number of opioids as compared to other  prescribers in their medical specialty or geographic area.   Our Nation's drug epidemic is a complicated issue, and our response  must be multifaceted. This means giving providers the tools they need  to prevent opioid abuse.   I want to thank my colleagues Carlos Curbelo and  Mike Thompson for  their support in authoring this bill. And I want to thank our chairman,   Greg Walden, and his Energy and Commerce Committee for their  relentless effort to combat the opioid epidemic across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to  support the passage of our REACH OUT Act.
