 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2227) to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to  authorize spouses of servicemembers who incur a catastrophic injury or  illness or die while in military service to terminate leases of  premises and motor vehicles, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2227         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Spouses and       Spouses of Injured Servicemembers Leasing Relief Expansion       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF TERMINATION OF LEASES OF PREMISES                     AND MOTOR VEHICLES OF SERVICEMEMBERS WHO INCUR                     CATASTROPHIC INJURY OR ILLNESS OR DIE WHILE IN                     MILITARY SERVICE.         (a) Catastrophic Injuries and Illnesses.--Paragraph (4) of       section 305(a) of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50       U.S.C. 3955(a)), as added by section 545 of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law       116-92), is amended to read as follows:        ``(4) Catastrophic injury or illness of lessee.--        ``(A) Termination.--If the lessee on a lease described in       subsection (b) incurs a catastrophic injury or illness during       a period of military service or while performing covered       service, during the one-year period beginning on the date on       which the lessee incurs such injury or illness--        ``(i) the lessee may terminate the lease; or        ``(ii) in the case of a lessee who lacks the mental       capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs       (including disbursement of funds without limitation) due to       such injury or illness, the spouse or dependent of the lessee       may terminate the lease.        ``(B) Definitions.--In this paragraph:        ``(i) The term `catastrophic injury or illness' has the       meaning given that term in section 439(g) of title 37, United       States Code.        ``(ii) The term `covered service' means full-time National       Guard duty, active Guard and Reserve duty, or inactive-duty       training (as such terms are defined in section 101(d) of       title 10, United States Code)''.        (b) Deaths.--Paragraph (3) of such section is amended by       striking ``The spouse of the lessee'' and inserting ``The       spouse or dependent of the lessee''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2227, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2227, as amended, the Gold  Star Spouses and Spouses of Injured Servicemembers Leasing Relief  Expansion Act of 2019.   This bill was introduced by Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois.  I thank her for her work with the committee. It expands on the work the  committee did last Congress with Representative Bustos to improve the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   This bill ensures that active and reserve component servicemembers  and their spouses or dependents who are catastrophically injured while  in service to this Nation have the ability to break their home and  vehicle leases up to a year after their injury so that the family can  modify their living situation to what best suits their new needs.   Servicemembers and families undergo difficult life transitions  because of catastrophic injuries. Families should have the flexibility  to be at their servicemember's side during recovery and the ability to  easily move closer to family, friends, or other support networks.   Families dealing with the catastrophic injury of their loved ones  should not have to worry about leases and cancellation fees.   Madam Speaker, this bill is an outgrowth of the bill Mrs. Bustos led  last Congress and was the suggestion of the Paralyzed Veterans of  America. It also clarifies similar legislation that passed in the  National Defense Authorization Act last year.   H.R. 2227, as amended, would make it clear that catastrophically  disabled servicemembers who have the mental capacity to terminate a  lease may do so. It is not only spouses and dependents who are  protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Wenstrup, a former member of this  committee, for his focus on the issue  [[Page H1175]]  and for working with Mrs. Bustos on this bill. I also thank the  Paralyzed Veterans of America for highlighting the need to include  catastrophically disabled veterans and families in our work to improve  the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   Finally, I applaud the bipartisan work of Congressmen Levin and  Bilirakis on this bill and their work on the Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 2227,  as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member. A  catastrophic medical condition associated with someone who has worn the  uniform of our Nation in service of our Nation should not also be  accompanied by his family or her family needing to worry about paying  off a lease on a home or a car.   The law of the United States should reflect the gratitude that the  people have for a servicemember's service to our country. This is the  right thing to do, and I encourage all of my colleagues to, again, join  me in passing H.R. 2227, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4852) to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make available to veterans certain  additional information about postsecondary educational institutions,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4852         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Additional Information To Be Provided.--Subsection (c)       of section 3698 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)(C)--        (A) in clause (xi), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in clause (xii), by striking the period and inserting a       semicolon; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new clauses:        ``(xiii) whether the institution is listed on the College       Navigator website as affiliated with a religion and, if so,       which religious denomination;        ``(xiv) whether the Secretary of Education or other head of       a department or agency of the Federal Government has       determined that the institution is a minority serving       institution and, if so, which one or more types of minority       serving institutions; and        ``(xv) whether the institution is gender specific.''; and        (2) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following       new sentence: ``To the extent practicable, the Secretary       shall ensure that such information is provided in a       searchable format.''.

(c) Application.--The amendments made by this section shall       apply with respect to the information provided under section       3698 of title 38, United States Code, beginning on the date       that is two years after the date of the enactment of this       Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4852.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4852, the G.I. and Veterans  Education Empowerment Act, also known as the GIVE Act.   H.R. 4852, introduced by Representative Torres, provides veterans  with more information about educational institutions prior to their  enrollment. Too often veterans find their educational institutions are  not good fits for their educational goals and drop out or transfer to  other institutions after wasting time and benefits.   After transferring, veterans lose credits from their transferring  institutions or simply give up on acquiring a new skill set altogether  because an institution does not meet their needs.   Madam Speaker, the GIVE Act addresses an overlooked cause for  veterans dropping out or transferring to other institutions: cultural  incongruence.   I have observed countless instances where veterans begin their  studies only to find out that they are not comfortable on the campus of  their educational institution.   Congress created the GI Bill Comparison Tool to provide veterans with  more information when they consider where they will pursue a  postsecondary education. While the GI Bill Comparison Tool provides  veterans with data on tuition and costs, accreditation, and cautionary  information, there are gaps in the information regarding campus  culture.   For example, the GI Bill Comparison Tool does not inform a Catholic  veteran, who may be interested in attending a Catholic institution, if  an institution is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.   Madam Speaker, small pieces of information like that are critical to  helping veterans assimilate to life on campus.   Data on campus culture are collected by the Department of Education  but are not currently displayed on the GI Bill Comparison Tool website.  Now, if enacted, the GIVE Act will require VA to provide prospective  student veterans with information on whether an institution is minority  serving, gender specific, or has a religious affiliation.   Madam Speaker, this bill will simply require the GI Bill Comparison  Tool to display information to help veterans choose the right school  the first time.                                time  1630    This bill will also help veterans choose a campus that is aligned  with their values and reduce the number of transfers due to cultural  incompatibility.   We owe it to our veterans to give them the most accurate and relevant  information that will allow them to efficiently obtain a new skill set  so they can reenter the labor force and find meaningful opportunities.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Torres for her work on this  important issue.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 4852, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I again urge all of my colleagues to pass  H.R. 4852.   Our veterans deserve to have the most accurate information available  to them as they are making their choices about the institutions where  they would like to use their GI Bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3749) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make grants to entities that provide  legal services for homeless veterans and veterans at risk for  homelessness, and for other purposes, as amended.

(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       complete an analysis of programs of the Department of       Veterans Affairs that provide assistance to women veterans       who are homeless or precariously housed to identify the areas       in which such programs are failing to meet the needs of such       women.        (b) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on the analysis completed under       subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3749, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3749, as amended, the Legal  Services for Homeless Veterans Act.   Over the past decade, Congress and the Obama and Trump  administrations have prioritized ending veteran homelessness. However,  while rates of veteran homelessness have fallen, even one veteran  without shelter is unacceptable.   This committee is committed to providing services to prevent  homelessness and to assist veterans who become homeless by providing  them housing and access to healthcare and social services.   According to the Project CHALENG, otherwise known as Community  Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups, and VA  survey, legal services are one of the top unmet needs for homeless  veterans. H.R. 3749 directly addresses that need.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3749, as amended, is sponsored by Congressman  Panetta and includes legislation authored by Congresswoman Beatty,  Congresswoman Wild, and Congressman Levin. It authorizes VA to provide  grants or enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities that  provide legal services to homeless veterans and veterans at risk for  homelessness.   The VA would be required to consult with organizations that have  experience providing services to homeless veterans when establishing  these criteria and requirements, and these grants or cooperative  agreements would only be available to highly rated public or nonprofit  entities.   Additionally, at least 10 percent of the funds made available each  fiscal year for this grant program must be reserved for providing legal  services to homeless women veterans. As we know, women veterans are the  fastest growing population of homeless veterans.   Finally, this legislation authorizes $20 million of the funding for  the Supportive Services for Veteran Families grant program to go to  organizations that assist homeless veterans with children. The SSVF  program has been one of the most effective tools to address veteran  homelessness since its creation by President Obama, and I thank this  administration and Congress for supporting it.   Madam Speaker, southern California is ground zero for addressing  veteran homelessness. Riverside, California, in my own district,  reached functional zero veteran homelessness, but many communities  surrounding my district need additional resources and programs  [[Page H1178]]  to reach functional zero. Providing legal services to veterans who need  them also prevents those veterans who are at risk of becoming homeless.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Panetta, Congresswoman Beatty,  Congresswoman Wild, and Congressman Levin, the chair of our Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee, for their advocacy and work to pass  legislation that will end veteran homelessness.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3749,  as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), my good friend and also the author of H.R.  3749, a veteran himself.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to echo the sentiment of my colleague, Ranking  Member Roe. We have both said in public and acknowledged the tremendous  progress the VA has made in reducing homelessness. It began with the  commitment under President Obama and has been continued under President  Trump.   We have not done enough, I fear, to celebrate the tremendous  reduction in homelessness across our country with respect to veteran  homelessness. It still persists in my home State of California. We have  a number of initiatives teed up, which, I trust, we are going to  cooperate on.   The VA gets knocked around a lot for its shortcomings, but I have to  say that this is one of the accomplishments that we have to celebrate  more.   Mr. Panetta's bill, H.R. 3749, is a continuation of this work. I urge  all of my colleagues to join me in passing it, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4613) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish and maintain a website of the Department that allows the  public to obtain electronic copies of certain legislatively requested  reports of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4613         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Legislatively requested report.--The term       ``legislatively requested report'' means a report to be       submitted by the Secretary to either house of Congress or any       committee of Congress or subcommittee thereof pursuant to--        (A) an Act of Congress enacted not more than eight years       before the date of the enactment of this Act; or        (B) a conference report adopted not more than eight years       before the date of the enactment of this Act.        (2) Open format.--The term ``open format'' means a file       format for storing digital data based on an underlying open       standard that--        (A) is not encumbered by any restrictions that would impede       reuse; and        (B) is based on an underlying open data standard that is       maintained by a standards organization.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4613, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4613, as amended,  which would require the posting of congressionally mandated reports of  the Department of Veterans Affairs on the Department's public website.  The VA Reporting Transparency Act, introduced by Representatives Rose  and Cisneros, will ensure easy public access to these reports.   Surprisingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs does not currently  provide public access to many of its reports that are mandated by  Congress. Rather than place its reports on its website, VA will often  only transmit its reports to a few congressional committees, such as  the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs. By contrast, the  VA Office of Inspector General posts its reports online within 3 days  of completion.   This legislation would allow veterans and the public to access these  reports online, which contain critical information about agency  activities and the effectiveness of services.   It would also improve accountability. For example, in 2019, VA  provided reports to Congress on the activity of the Office of  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection and on veterans being the  target of Social Security fraud.   Americans should know what actions the VA should be taking to protect  VA whistleblowers and what VA has done to prevent the fraudulent use of  veterans' Social Security numbers. These  [[Page H1180]]  reports contain valuable information that should be made available to  the public.   Madam Speaker, the bill is supported by the American Legion, Veterans  of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans. I urge all of my  colleagues to support H.R. 4613, as amended, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Rose), my good friend and member of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, and also a member of the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee and author of H.R. 4613.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4613, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 561) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  oversight of contracts awarded by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 561         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Business       Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTS UNDER CONTRACTS WITH                     SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Section 8127 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (k) as subsection (l); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (j) the following new       subsection (k):        ``(k) Limitations on Subcontracting.--(1)(A) The       requirements applicable to a covered small business concern       under section 46 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657s)       shall apply with respect to a small business concern owned       and controlled by veterans that is awarded a contract under       this section.        ``(B) For purposes of applying the requirements of section       46 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657s) pursuant to       subparagraph (A), the term `similarly situated entity' used       in such section 46 includes a subcontractor for a small       business concern owned and controlled by veterans described       in such subparagraph (A).        ``(2) The Secretary may award a contract under this section       only after the Secretary obtains from the offeror a       certification that the offeror will comply with the       requirements described in paragraph (1)(A) if awarded the       contract. Such certification shall--        ``(A) specify the exact performance requirements applicable       under such paragraph; and        ``(B) explicitly acknowledge that the certification is       subject to section 1001 of title 18.  [[Page H1181]]         ``(3)(A) The Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business       Utilization for the Department, established pursuant to       section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)),       and the Chief Acquisition Officer of the Department,       established pursuant to section 1702 of title 41, shall       jointly implement a process using the systems described in       section 16(g)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       645(g)(2)), and any other relevant systems available, to       monitor compliance with this subsection.        ``(B) The Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business       Utilization and the Chief Acquisition Officer shall jointly       refer any violations or suspected violations of this       subsection to the Inspector General of the Department.        ``(C) If the Secretary determines, in consultation with the       Inspector General of the Department, that a small business       concern that is awarded a contract under this section did not       act in good faith with respect to the requirements described       in paragraph (1)(A), the small business concern shall be       subject to any or all of the following consequences--        ``(i) referral to the Debarment and Suspension Committee of       the Department;        ``(ii) a fine under section 16(g)(1) of the Small Business       Act (15 U.S.C. 645(g)(1)); and        ``(iii) prosecution for violating section 1001 of title 18.        ``(D) Not later than November 30 for each of fiscal years       2021 through 2025, the Inspector General shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of       Representatives a report for the fiscal year preceding the       fiscal year during which the report is submitted that       includes, for the fiscal year covered by the report--        ``(i) the number of referred violations and suspected       violations received under subparagraph (B); and        ``(ii) the disposition of such referred violations,       including the number of small business concerns suspended or       debarred from Federal contracting or referred to the Attorney       General for prosecution.''.        (b) Application.--Subsection (k) of section 8127 of title       38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall       apply with respect to a contract entered into after the date       of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 561, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 561, as amended, the Protecting Business  Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2019, is sponsored by General Bergman  and Congresswoman Kuster. It establishes important oversight for VA  small business contracting.   Under current law, a small business contractor cannot give a  subcontractor more than 50 percent of its contract work. The  legislation requires veteran- and service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses to certify that they are performing at least half of the  work. It also requires VA to refer contractors violating or suspected  of violating the law to the VA Inspector General for investigation.   Madam Speaker, in addition, the legislation establishes an oversight  process and penalties for fraudulently claiming to comply with the law.   Congress strongly supports creating business opportunities for  veteran-owned small businesses and enforcing government contracting  set-asides so that veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned  businesses can compete with larger government contractors.   It is unfair to veteran small business owners who play by the rules  to lose out on business opportunities to bad actors who do not follow  the rules and pass on most of the work to subcontractors, especially  when those subcontractors are not veteran owned.   Madam Speaker, this bill is supported by the American Legion. Last  Congress, the House passed identical legislation sponsored by my  colleagues, General Bergman and Congresswoman Kuster.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 561, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate my support  for H.R. 561. I want to appreciate the work with the minority. We have  worked together to pass these five pieces of legislation on the floor.  It is another demonstration of our commitment to put veterans above  partisanship and to put the interests of America above partisanship.   Madam Speaker, I can't tell you what a privilege it is to chair this  committee. I urge all my colleagues to pass H.R. 561, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
