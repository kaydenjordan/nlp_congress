 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Carbajal moves to recommit the bill H.R. 23 to the       Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Add at the end of title IV, the following:       SEC. 406. WILDFIRE READINESS.         Nothing in this Act shall impair the ability of the       National Interagency Fire Center to ensure that there is an       adequate supply of water to fight wildfires, utilizing water       from reservoirs or other surface waters.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.   My request today is simple: to provide our firefighters with the  water they need to effectively fight wildfires. As we speak, two large  wildfires are burning in my district on the central coast of  California. So far, over 40,000 acres of land have burned between the  Alamo fire and the Whittier fire.   With more than a dozen homes and structures of central coast  residents destroyed, we cannot overstate the important and effective  work of hundreds of local, State, and Federal firefighters to contain  these blazes and prevent more damages.   I spoke with incident commanders and toured both burn sites in Santa  Barbara County, witnessing firsthand the incredible damage wreaked by  these fires to our region.   I was grateful for the opportunity to address our firefighters and  first responders and to thank these brave men and women for willing to  risk their own safety to protect infrastructure and save lives.   In one harrowing instance, a firefighter cleared a path, driving a  bulldozer through flaming brush to rescue dozens of Boy Scouts trapped  at a campground at Lake Cachuma.   Today, we have a duty as appropriators to provide these men and  women, working tirelessly in difficult conditions, with the resources  they need to effectively combat these frequent and devastating  wildfires across our country, and especially in my home State.   Ignoring our wildfire response when dealing with water allocation is  irresponsible and will put American lives in danger.   In addition to adopting this simple amendment to ensure our  firefighters' access to water, I urge my colleagues to work to end the  disruptive practice of fire borrowing.                                time  1900    We cannot continue to rob funds designated for wildfire prevention to  pay for fighting fires and simultaneously expect agencies to carry out  effective land management practices to reduce the impact of  catastrophic wildfires in the future.   Our Federal land management agencies are overwhelmed by the dramatic  increase in fires on public lands in recent years, and we cannot in  good conscience continue to ignore their urgent need for both  prevention and firefighting funding.   I am deeply concerned that this underlying bill today does nothing to  address the issues of limited water resources for our agencies charged  with fighting wildfires.   I call upon my colleagues to adopt this common-sense amendment and  show our firefighters that Congress not only appreciates their efforts,  but acts to support them as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5532]]        Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized  for 5 minutes.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, my friends' concerns are well placed;  his amendment is completely misplaced.   The fact is that, for 45 years, our environmental laws have made the  management of our forests virtually impossible. After 45 years of  experience with these laws, imposed with the explicit promise they  would improve our forest environment, I think we are entitled to ask:  How is our forest environment doing? And the answer is damning; our  forests are dying.   Timber harvests of surplus timber have fallen 80 percent in those  years. The result is severe overcrowding in our forests. An acre  normally supports between 20 to 100 trees, depending upon the  topography; but because of these laws, average density in the Sierra  has now ballooned to 266 trees per acre.   In this crowded condition, these trees fight for their lives against  other trees trying to occupy the same ground. And in this crowded and  stressed condition, they fall victim to disease, pestilence, drought,  and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire.   The answer is not this amendment that seeks to derail this needed  water storage; it is to restore scientific management to our forests to  restore them to a healthy condition.   When I visited the command center of the Rim Fire several years ago  that threatened Yosemite Valley, I asked the firefighters: What answer  can I take, in your name, back to Congress? And the answer was:  Treatment matters. We need proper forest management.   The good news for my friend from Santa Barbara is he will soon have  the opportunity to vote on just such a bill, the Resilient Federal  Forest Act, by Mr. Westerman of Arkansas. It treats this problem  comprehensively. It passed the House Natural Resources Committee. We  hope to bring it soon to the floor of the House. It will address the  problems that plague our forests by restoring proper scientific  management to our public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

Recorded Vote     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, before I proceed, I wanted to take a quick  few seconds to thank and recognize Chairman Thornberry and Ranking  Member Smith as a freshman member of the 115th Congress. It has been  refreshing to see such bipartisan tone in leadership, so I just wanted  to recognize them for those qualities and skills.   With the Department of Defense struggling to rein in spending while  keeping our military strong and our country protected, it is amendments  like Mr. Conaway's that are unnecessarily impeding cost competition and  reductions that come with public-private partnerships.   This amendment limits competition between alternative fuel sources  and may even force DOD to pay more by explicitly prohibiting purchases  of cheaper fuel. That is not only inefficient, it is irresponsible.   The Department of Defense is the single largest energy consumer in  the world. We should be incentivizing the diversification of liquid  fuels as an option to bring down costs and reduce regulatory burden.   Not only does this amendment risk increased costs for DOD  procurement, but it also stunts potential economic growth in the  rapidly expanding biofuel field, a billion-dollar industry worldwide.   Yet another troubling result of this amendment, if passed, is its  potential to impede military operations where an alternative fuel may  be the only option available.   It is unethical to endanger our men and women in uniform with this  ban, and, at the very least, a waiver should be included for national  security matters.   Military leaders and experts have told Armed Services Committee  members time and time again about the direct threat that climate  change, particularly sea level rise, poses to our military operations  and installations both at home in places like Norfolk and abroad.   My colleague, Mr. Langevin, included language in this year's NDAA  that specifically acknowledges this threat. It directs the Defense  Department to study the impact of climate change and prepare an  effective strategy to address its effects.   We have long known that carbon pollution and fossil fuels are heavily  contributing to a changing climate and the extreme weather patterns  that accompany this phenomenon. It is irresponsible for this Congress  to ignore this reality and not even consider cost-effective and more  clean energy sources for our military.   Finally, I would like to point out that this amendment is completely  unnecessary. Current law already prohibits DOD from purchasing  alternative fuel in large quantities unless it is cost-competitive with  traditional fuel. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided  amendment that does far more harm than good to our Defense Department  and to our servicemembers.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will point out that those figures are  incorrect as stated by my colleague.   In 2015, the DOD paid $2.03 for 77,660 gallons of fuel at a 10  percent blend. I just wanted to correct the record because those are  the accurate figures, and I think those figures speak volumes.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Conaway).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed.   It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of  House report 115-212.                     Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Polis    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212.
