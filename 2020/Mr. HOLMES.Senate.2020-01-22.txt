 In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if       it was true that the President did not give a [expletive]       about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland agreed the President did       not give a [expletive] about Ukraine. I asked, why not, and       Ambassador Sondland stated, the President only cares about .       . . ``big stuff.'' I noted there was . . . ``big stuff''       going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia. And Ambassador       Sondland replied that he meant . . . ``big stuff'' that       benefits the President, like the . . . ``Biden       investigation'' that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. The       conversation then moved on to other topics.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Those three days in July--the 24th, the 25th, and  the 26th--reveal a lot about President Trump's effort to solicit help  from a foreign country in assisting his own reelection.   On the 24th, Special Counsel Mueller testifies that Russia interfered  in our 2016 election to assist the Trump campaign, which knew about the  interference, welcomed it, and utilized it. That is the 24th.   The 25th is the day of the call, when President Trump, believing he  had escaped accountability for Russian meddling in the first election  and is welcoming of it, asked the Ukranian President to help him  undermine the special counsel's conclusion and help him smear a  political opponent, former Vice President Biden.   And then, the third day in a row in July, President Trump sought to  ensure that Ukraine had received his request and understood it and  would take the necessary steps to announce the investigations that he  wanted.   Three days in July. In many ways those 3 days in July tell so much of  this story. This course of conduct alone should astound all of us who  value the sanctity of our elections and who understand that the vast  powers of the Presidency are reserved only for actions which benefit  the country as a whole, rather than the political fortunes of any one  individual.   President Trump's effort to use an official head-of-state phone call  to solicit the announcement of investigations helpful to his reelection  is not only conduct unbecoming a President, but it is conduct of one  who believes that the powers of his high office are political tools to  be wielded against his opponents, including by asking a foreign  government to investigate a United States citizen, and for a corrupt  purpose. That alone is grounds for removal from office of the 45th  President.   But these 3 days in July were neither the beginning nor the end of  this scheme. President Trump, acting through agents inside and outside  of the U.S. Government, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani,  sought to compel Ukraine to announce the investigations by withholding  the head-of-state meeting in the Oval Office until the President of  Ukraine complied.   Hosting an Oval Office meeting for a foreign leader is an official  act available only to one person--the President of the United States.  And it is an official act that President Trump had already offered to  President Zelensky during their first phone call on April 21 and in a  subsequent letter to the Ukranian leader.   Multiple witnesses testified about the importance of a White House  meeting for Ukraine. For example, Deputy Assistant Secretary George  Kent explained that a White House meeting was ``very important'' for  Ukrainians to demonstrate the strength of their relationship with  ``Ukraine's strongest supporter.''   Dr. Fiona Hill of the National Security Council explained that a  White House meeting would supply the new Ukranian Government with ``the  legitimacy that it needed, especially vis-a-vis the Russians'' and that  the Ukrainians viewed a White House meeting as ``a recognition of their  legitimacy as a sovereign state.''   This White House meeting would also prove to be important for three  handpicked agents whom President Trump  [[Page S450]]  placed in charge of U.S.-Ukraine issues: Ambassador Sondland,  Ambassador Volker, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the so-called three  amigos. They hoped to convince President Trump to hold an Oval Office  meeting with Zelensky.   During a meeting of the three amigos on May 23, President Trump told  them that Ukraine had tried to ``take [him] down'' in 2016. He then  directed them to ``talk to Rudy'' Giuliani about Ukraine.   It was immediately clear that Giuliani, who was pursuing the  discredited investigations in Ukraine on the President's behalf, was  the key to unlocking an Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky.   Giuliani by then had said publicly that he was actively pursuing  investigations President Trump corruptly desired and planning a trip to  Ukraine. Giuliani admitted: ``We're not meddling in an election, we're  meddling in an investigation.''   On May 10, however, Giuliani canceled the trip to Ukraine to dig up  dirt on former Vice President Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory,  just as President Zelensky won elections for the Presidency and  Parliament.   Faced with a choice between working with Giuliani to pursue an Oval  Office meeting--understanding it meant taking part in a corrupt effort  to secure the political investigations--or abandoning efforts to  support our Ukranian ally, the President's agents fell into line. They  would pursue the White House meeting and explain to Ukraine that  announcement of the investigations was the price of admission.   As Ambassador Sondland made clear:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Also on June 28th, while President Trump was       still not moving forward on a meeting with President       Zelensky, we met with--he met with Russian President Putin at       the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, sending a further signal of       lack of support to Ukraine.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Volker did not dispute other  witnesses' testimony that President Trump conditioned an Oval Office  meeting on President Zelensky's willingness to announce investigations.  Indeed, Ambassador Volker helped matters along. Ambassador Volker  testified that at a conference in early July, he suggested that  President Zelensky speak to President Trump on the phone to discuss the  investigations.   During his testimony, Ambassador Volker described that encounter.          Our long-standing policy is to encourage them       to establish, build rule of law institutions that are       capable, that can pursue allegations. That's our policy.       We've been doing that for some time with some  [[Page S482]]       success. Focusing on particular cases, particularly where       there is interest of the President, just not part of what       we've done. It's hard to explain why we would do that.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Unfortunately, we do know the explanation. We  know why President Trump wanted President Zelensky to announce  investigations--because it would help him in his election.   On September 18, approximately a week before he was supposed to meet  with President Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New  York, President Zelensky spoke by telephone with Vice President Pence.   During her deposition, Jennifer Williams testified. She was Vice  President Pence's assistant. She had testified that Vice President  Pence basically reiterated that the hold on aid had been lifted and  asked a bit more about how Zelensky's efforts were going.   Following her deposition and while preparing for her testimony at the  open hearing on November 19, Williams reviewed the documents--they had  not been produced to us by the White House--and those documents  refreshed her recollection of Vice President Pence's call with  President Zelensky. The White House blocked Williams from testifying  about her refreshed recollections of the Vice President's call when she  appeared at the open public hearing. They claim that certain portions  of the September 18 call, including the information that Williams  wanted to tell us about, were classified.   On November 26, she submitted a classified addition to her hearing  testimony where she provided additional information about the Vice  President's September 18 telephone call with President Zelensky. The  Intelligence Committee provided this classified addition to the  Judiciary Committee. It has been sent to the Senate for your review.  Now, I have read that testimony. I will just say that a coverup is not  a proper reason to classify a document.   Vice President Pence has repeatedly said publicly that he has no  objection to the White House releasing the actual transcript of his  calls with President Zelensky. Yet his office has refused many requests  by the committee to declassify Williams' addendum so the American  people could also see the additional evidence about this call.   We urge the Senators to review it, and we again ask that the White  House declassify them. As the House wrote in two separate letters,  there is no basis to keep it classified. Again, in case the White House  needs a reminder, it is improper to keep something classified just to  avoid embarrassment or to conceal wrongdoing.   We have been through a lot of facts today. We have seen the  President's scheme. A shakedown of Ukraine for his personal benefit  was, I believe, an obvious abuse of his power. But this misconduct and  scheme became exposed. Congress asked questions. The press reported.  Nonpolitical officers in the government expressed concern. The  whistleblower laws were activated.    As this happened, there was an effort to create an after-the-fact,  misleading record to avoid responsibility for what the President had  actually been doing. These were not the only efforts to hide  misconduct, and misconduct continued. Congressman Schiff will review  some of those items.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We have about 20 minutes left in the presentation  tonight.   I would like to now go through with you the President's efforts to  hide this corrupt scheme even as it continued well into the fall of  last year.   On August 12, a whistleblower in the intelligence community submitted  a complaint addressed to the congressional Intelligence Committees.  This explosive document stated that President Trump had solicited  foreign interference from Ukraine to assist his 2020 reelection bid.   The complaint alleged a scheme by President Trump to ``us[e] the  power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in  the 2020 U.S. election.'' The complaint stated that the President had  applied pressure on Ukraine to investigate one of the President's main  domestic political rivals and detailed the involvement of the  President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The complaint also stated  that the whistleblower believed the President's activities ``posed  risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government's  efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in the U.S.  elections.''   Under the law, the whistleblower was required to file the complaint  with the inspector general of the intelligence community, which was  then required to vet and assess the complaint and determine if it  warranted reporting to the Intelligence Committees. The law gives the  inspector general 14 days to conduct an initial review and then inform  the Director of National Intelligence about his findings.   On August 26, the inspector general sent the whistleblower complaint  and the inspector general's preliminary determination to the Acting  Director of National Intelligence. The inspector general wrote that  based on his review of the complaint, its allegations constituted an  ``urgent concern'' and appeared ``credible'' under the statute. The  inspector general confirmed that the whistleblower acted lawfully in  bringing the complaint and credibly raised a legitimate concern that  should be communicated to the Intelligence Committees of Congress.   The Director of National Intelligence quickly informed the White  House about the complaint.   Under the law, the Acting Director of National Intelligence was  required to forward the complaint and the inspector general's  determination to the congressional Intelligence Committees no later  than 7 days after he received them. The legal requirement is extremely  clear. Upon receipt of the transmittal from the ICIG--that is the  inspector general of the intelligence community--the Director shall,  within 7 calendar days of such receipt, forward such transmittal to the  congressional Intelligence Committees, together with any comments the  Director considers appropriate. Yet, despite the clear letter of the  law, the White House mobilized to keep the information in the  whistleblower complaint from Congress, including by inviting the  Department of Justice to render an opinion as to whether the complaint  could be withheld from Congress.   The statutory deadline of September 2, when the Director of National  Intelligence was required to turn them over to Congress, came and went,  and the complaint remained hidden from Congress.   Finally, on September 9, a full week after the complaint was required  to be sent to Congress--and once again, an urgent concern--the  inspector general wrote to the leaders of the Intelligence Committees  to inform them that the Director of National Intelligence was  withholding a whistleblower complaint, in direct contravention of past  practice and the law.   On September 24, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that  ``the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official  impeachment inquiry.''   The next day, the House of Representatives passed a resolution  calling on the Trump administration to provide the whistleblower's  complaint immediately to the congressional Intelligence Committees.   Later that day, the White House publicly released the summary of the  July 25 call between President Trump and President Zelensky and  permitted the Acting Director of National Intelligence to provide the  whistleblower's complaint and related documents to the congressional  Intelligence Committees.   The President himself was happy to discuss the motivations for the  scheme in public. That day, in a joint press availability with  President Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly, President  Trump reiterated that he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. No, I want him to do whatever he can. This       was not his fault. He wasn't there. He's just been here       recently. But whatever he can do in terms of corruption       because the corruption is massive. Now, when Biden's son       walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and he       knows nothing, and they're paying him millions of dollars,       that's corruption.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Finally, the day after President Trump explained  to the public that he wanted Ukraine to investigate former Vice  President Biden, on the morning of September 26, the Intelligence  Committee publicly released declassified redactions of two documents:  the whistleblower's August 12 complaint and the inspector general's  August 26 transmittal to the Acting Director of National Intelligence.  [[Page S483]]    Even after the impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine matter began,  President Trump and his proxy, Rudy Giuliani, had continued to publicly  urge President Zelensky to launch an investigation of Vice President  Biden and alleged 2016 election interference by Ukraine.   On September 30, during his remarks at the swearing-in of the new  Labor Secretary, President Trump stated this.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. Now, the new President of Ukraine ran on       the basis of no corruption. That's how he got elected. And I       believe that he really means it. But there was a lot of       corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us.       And we want to get to the bottom of it, and it is very       important we do. Thank you, everyone.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here he is. He is meeting at the United  Nations, September 30, and he is still pursuing this bogus CrowdStrike  conspiracy theory with the President of Ukraine.   On October 2, in a public press availability, President Trump  discussed the July 25 call with President Zelensky and stated that  ``the conversation was perfect; it couldn't have been nicer.'' He then  linked his notion of corruption with the Biden investigation.   On October 3, in remarks before he departed on Marine One, President  Trump expressed his hope that Ukraine would investigate Vice President  Biden and his son. President Trump actually escalated his rhetoric,  urging not only Ukraine to investigate the Bidens but China too.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Question. Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky       would do about the Bidens after your phone call?        President TRUMP. Well, I would think that, if they were       honest about it, they would start a major investigation into       the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. They should       investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that's       newly formed--and all these companies, if you look at--and,       by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation       into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about       as bad as what happened with--with Ukraine. So I would say       that President Zelensky--if it were me, I would recommend       that they start an investigation into the Bidens.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The same day, President Trump tweeted that he has  an absolute right to investigate corruption. That really means he feels  he has an absolute right to investigate or get foreign countries to  investigate his political opponents. The President sent a similar tweet  the next day, once again linking corruption with the Biden  investigation:         As President, I have an obligation to end corruption, even       if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or       countries. It is done all the time. This has nothing to do       with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens.       This does have to do with their corruption.    Give him credit for being so pompous. ``This has nothing to do with  politics or a political campaign against the Bidens,'' but you have got  to investigate the Bidens. I guess that is just a coincidence.   President Trump continued to demonstrate his eagerness to solicit  foreign assistance related to his personal interests: ``Here's what's  okay,'' he said. ``If we feel there's corruption like I feel there was  in the 2016 campaign--there was tremendous corruption against me. If we  feel there's corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.''   President Trump added that asking President Xi of China to  investigate the Bidens ``is certainly something we can start thinking  about.''   Even last month--even last month--the President and Giuliani's scheme  continued. During the first week of December, Giuliani traveled to  Budapest, Kyiv, and Vienna to meet with former Ukrainian Government  officials as part of a continuing effort to dig up dirt, political  dirt, on Vice President Biden and advance the theory that Ukraine  interfered in the 2016 election.   Asked about his interviews of former Ukrainian prosecutors, Giuliani  told the New York Times that he was acting on behalf of his client,  President Trump: ``Like a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to  defend my client against the false charges being leveled against him.''  Indeed, evidence obtained by the House from Giuliani's associate  confirms that he had been representing himself in as early as May 2019  as President Trump's personal lawyer, doing Donald J. Trump's personal  bidding in his dealings with Ukraine.   This letter of May 10, 2019, from Giuliani to Zelensky says, among  other things:         However, I have a more specific request. In my capacity as       personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge       and consent, I request a meeting with you on this upcoming       Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I will need no more than       a half-hour of your time, and I will be accompanied by my       colleague Victoria Toensing, a distinguished American       attorney who is very familiar with this matter.        Please have your office let me know what time or times are       convenient for you, and Victoria and I will be there.    This is evidence recently obtained showing his effort to get that  meeting in May with Zelensky. Giuliani told the Wall Street Journal  that, when he returned to New York from his most recent trip on  December 7, President Trump called him as his plane was still taxiing  down the runway: ``What did you get?'' he said President Trump asked.  ``More than you can imagine,'' Giuliani replied. Giuliani claimed that  he was putting his findings into a 20-page report and that the  President had asked him to brief the Attorney General and the  Republicans in Congress. Shortly thereafter, on the same day, President  Trump told reporters before departing on Marine One that he was aware  of Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine and that Giuliani was going to report  his purported findings to the Attorney General and Congress.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. Well, I just know he came back from       someplace, and he's going to make a report, I think to the       Attorney General and to Congress. He says he has a lot of       good information. I have not spoken to him about that       information. But Rudy, as you know, has been one of the great       crime fighters of the last 50 years. And he did get back from       Europe just recently, and I know--he has not told me what he       found, but I think he wants to go before Congress and say--      and also to the Attorney General and the Department of       Justice. I hear he's found plenty, yeah.    Three days after those remarks on December 10, Giuliani confirmed to  the Washington Post that President Trump had asked him to brief the  Justice Department and Republican Senators on his ``findings'' from his  trip to Ukraine.   Giuliani stated:         He wants me to do it. I'm working on pulling it together       and hope to have it done by the end of the week.    That Friday, December 13, Giuliani reportedly met with President  Trump at the White House, and on December 17 Giuliani confirmed to CNN  that President Trump has been very supportive of his efforts to dig up  dirt on Vice President Biden and Ukraine and that they are on the same  page.   The following day, on December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives  approved the two Articles of Impeachment you are considering in this  trial. Since the House voted on these articles, evidence has continued  to come to light related to the President's corrupt scheme. Among other  things, Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, press reporting, and  documents provided to Congress from Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas  further corroborate what we already know about the President's scheme.   As Giuliani again said on December 17, President Trump has been  ``very supportive'' of his efforts to dig up dirt on Vice President  Biden and they are ``on the same page.''   Parnas further corroborated what we already know about President  Trump's scheme; that he was responsible for withholding military aid  and sustaining that hold and that his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani,  was working at the direction of President Trump himself.   On December 20, new emails were released showing that, 91 minutes  after President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, a top  Office of Management and Budget aide asked the Department of Defense to  hold off on sending military aid to Ukraine. So those were new  documents that came on December 20.   On December 29, revelations emerged from OMB Director and Acting  Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's role about them--about that role in the  delay of aid and efforts by lawyers at OMB, the Department of Justice,  and the White House to justify the delay and the alarm that the delay  caused within the administration. Those records just became available  on December 29.   On January 2, newly unredacted Pentagon emails which raised serious  concerns by Trump administration officials about the legality of the  President's hold on aid became available.  [[Page S484]]    On January 6, former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton  announced that he would comply with a Senate subpoena compelling his  testimony. His lawyers stated that he has new relevant information.   On January 13, reports emerged that the Russian Government hacked the  Ukrainian gas company Burisma, almost certainly in an effort to find  information about Vice President Joe Biden's son in order to weaponize  that information against Mr. Biden and in favor of Mr. Trump, just as  Russia did against Secretary Clinton in favor of then-candidate Trump  in 2016.   That brings us up to January 13 of this year. Last week, House  committees received new evidence from Lev Parnas that further  demonstrates that the President was a central player in this scheme to  pressure Ukraine for his political gain. Also last week, the Government  Accountability Office found that President Trump violated the law when  he withheld that aid.   Last night we had further development when more redacted emails from  the Office of Management and Budget were produced. I think  Representative Crow showed you these. These are among the documents  that were just released. I am sure that, if we could read under those  redactions, it would be a very perfect email, but you have to ask: What  is being redacted here? What is so important to keep confidential  during the course of an impeachment inquiry?   As you can see, right up until last night, evidence continues to be  produced. The truth is going to come out. Indeed, the truth has already  come out, but more and more of it will. More emails are going to come  out. More witnesses are going to come forward. They are going to have  more relevant information to share.   The only question is, Do you want to hear it now? Do you want to know  the full truth now? Do you want to know just who was in the loop? It  sounds like everyone was in the loop. Do you want to know how broad  this scheme was?   We have the evidence to prove that President Trump ordered the aid  withheld. He did so to coerce Ukraine to help his reelection campaign.  He withheld a White House meeting to coerce the same sham  investigations. We can and will prove President Trump guilty of this  conduct and of obstructing the investigation into his misconduct, but  you and the American people should know who else was involved in this  scheme. You should want the whole truth to come out. You should want to  know about every player in this sordid business. It is within your  power to do so, and I would urge you, even if you are prepared to vote  to convict and impeach and remove this President, to find out the full  truth about how far this corruption goes because I think the public has  a right to know.   Now, today--well, yesterday we made the case for why you should hear  this additional evidence and testimony. This morning, I introduced you  to the broad sweep of the President's conduct, and then, during the  course of today, we walked you through a factual chronology in realtime  about how this plot unfolded. During that factual chronology today, you  saw that, in March of this year, Giuliani began that smear campaign  against Ambassador Yovanovitch in order to get her fired by President  Trump, something he would later admit was necessary to get her out of  the way because she was going to be in the way of these two  investigations.   This is the supposed anticorruption effort by the President: to get  rid of a woman who has dedicated her career to representing the United  States, often in dangerous parts of the world, to fighting corruption,  and to promoting the rule of law. This plot begins with getting her out  of the way, with the President saying that ``she is going to go through  some things.'' This anticorruption reformer, this U.S. patriot--this  plot begins with getting her out of the way.   This says so much about the administration. Tellingly, it wasn't  enough just to recall her or fire her. The President could have done  that anytime. No. They wanted to destroy her because she had the  audacity to stand in their way.   So we heard in March about the effort to get rid of her, and it  succeeded. And guess what message that sent to the Ukrainians about the  power the President's lawyer has. The Ukrainians were watching this  whole saga. They were hearing his interviews. They were seeing the  smears he was putting out. And this attorney for the President, working  hand in hand with these corrupt Ukrainians, was able to get a UN  ambassador yanked out of her job. Proof positive--you want a window to  this President, you want entre to this President, you want to make  things happen with this President, you go through his lawyer. Never  mind the State Department, never mind the National Security Council,  never mind the Defense Department--you go through his employer. That is  March.    In April, Zelensky has this huge victory in the Presidential  election. He gets a congratulatory call from the President. The  President assigns Vice President Pence to go to the inauguration.   In May, Giuliani is rebuffed by Zelensky, cancels the trip to  Ukraine--the one where he wanted to go, remember, and meddle in the  investigation because, Giuliani says, enemies of Trump surround  Zelensky. I guess that means he didn't get the money, and they must be  enemies of the President. Of course, the Ukrainians know why he wants  that meeting.   In May, Trump disinvites Pence to the inauguration. Pence is going,  Giuliani is rebuffed, Pence isn't going. That is May.   Instead, May 23, we have this meeting at the White House, and there  is a new party in town: the three amigos. They are going to be handling  the Ukraine portfolio. They are told: Work with Rudy, work with Rudy.  Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, work with  Rudy.   As you saw in June, Rudy is pushing for these investigations, and  they are trying to arrange these meetings and trying to make this  happen. Also in June, the Defense Department announces they are going  the release the military aid. The President reads about this, and then  he stops it. He stops the aid.   In July--July 10--you heard in the chronology, there is a meeting at  the White House, the meeting in which Sondland blurts out in this  meeting between the Ukrainians and Americans: Hey, they have a deal.  They are trying to get this meeting, and there is a debate whether the  meeting is going to happen and when it is going to happen. Sondland  says: Hey, we have a deal with Mulvaney here. We are going to get this  meeting, and you are going to do those investigations.   Bolton stiffens and abruptly ends the meeting. That was the first  meeting that day. Then Sondland brings the delegation to a different  part of the White House, and they have the followup meeting where he  makes it even more explicit--this drug deal is made even more explicit.  Dr. Hill is told by Ambassador Bolton: You need to go talk to the  lawyers; I don't want any part of this drug deal they are cooking up.  That is July.   July is the month where that email goes from Sondland to Pompeo and  others, and everybody is in the loop. July is the month where the hold  is implemented with no explanation. July is the month where Mueller  testifies about Russia's systemic interference in our affairs. July is  the month after Mueller testifies that the President believes he has  escaped accountability.   The next day in July is, of course, the July 25 call in which the  President asks for his favor. July 26 is the date of the call between  President Trump and Ambassador Sondland. You know the one: ``Zelensky  loves your ass,'' and he will do anything you want.   Is he going to do the investigation? Yeah, he is going to do the  investigation.   July is the month of that conversation between Sondland and David  Holmes, where Holmes says: Can you tell me candidly here what the  President thinks of Ukraine? Does he give a ``blank'' about Ukraine?  No, he doesn't give a ``blank'' about Ukraine. He only cares about the  big stuff.   Well, it is kind of big stuff here in Ukraine, like a war with the  Russians.   No, no, no. Big stuff that affects him personally, like the Biden  investigation that Giuliani wants. That is the month of July.   In August, we have that meeting between Giuliani and Yermak in  Madrid. In August, we have the back and forth about the statement: No,  you go first,  [[Page S485]]  and you commit and publicly announce investigations, and then we will  give you a date.   No, you go first. You give us the date, and then we will announce the  investigations.   Well, we will give you a statement that doesn't mention the  specifics.   No, no, you give us a statement that mentions the investigations.   That is the month of August.   August is also the month where it becomes clear that it is not just  the meeting anymore. It is everything. Everything is conditioned on  these investigations--the relationship, the money, the meeting.  Sondland and Holmes testify it is as simple as two plus two equals  four. That is all.   In September, Sondland says to Yermak: Everything is conditioned on  public announcements.   Message delivered, no ambiguity: The Ukrainians are told quid pro  quo.   Taylor texts: This is crazy to withhold aid.   September is the month--September 7 in particular, Trump and Sondland  talk on the phone, and the President has that conversation where he  says: No quid pro quo--except, here is the quid pro quo.   Zelensky has to go to the mike, and what is more, he should want to  do it.   September is also the month where the investigations begin in  Congress. September is the month where, after those investigations  begin, after the President knows he has been caught, the aid is finally  released. September is the month where Pence and Zelensky are on the  phone and Jennifer Williams has classified information to share with  you that I hope you will take a look at because it is relevant to these  issues.   That is September.   In October, Trump admits: Yes, if it wasn't obvious enough, he wants  Ukraine to investigate his political opponent. October is the month  where he invites another nation, China, to investigate his opponent.   This is the broad outline of the chronology that we went through  today.   Tomorrow, we will go through the law, the Constitution, and the facts  as they apply to article I. That is the plan for tomorrow.   We have introduced the case. We have gone through the chronology, and  tomorrow, we will apply the facts to the law as it pertains to the  President's abuse of power.   Let me just conclude this evening by remarking again on what brought  us here. What brought us here is that some courageous people came  forward, courageous people that risked their entire careers. One of the  things that has been striking to me about that, as I watch these  witnesses like Maria Yovanovitch and Ambassador Taylor and David Holmes  and others--Dr. Hill--is how much these dedicated officials were  willing to risk their career, the beginning of their career, the middle  of their career, or late in their career, when they had everything to  lose, but people senior to them, who have every advantage, who sit in  positions of power, lack that same basic commitment, lack that similar  basic willingness to put their country first and expose wrongdoing.   Why is it that Colonel Vindman, who worked for Fiona Hill, who worked  for John Bolton and Dr. Kupperman, were willing to stick their neck out  and answer lawful subpoenas when their bosses wouldn't? I don't know  that I can answer that question, but I just can tell you, I have such  admiration for the fact they did.   I think this is some form of cosmic justice that this Ambassador that  was so ruthlessly smeared is now a hero for her courage. There is  justice in that. But what would really vindicate that leap of faith  that she took is if we show the same courage. They risked everything-- their careers--and, yes, I know what you are asked to decide may risk  yours too, but if they could show the courage, so can we.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 243 of the  100th Congress, a single, one-page classified document identified by  the House managers for filing with the Secretary of the Senate, that  will be received on January 22, 2020, shall not be made part of the  public record and shall not be printed, but shall be made available  pursuant to the Standing Order for the 100th Congress.
