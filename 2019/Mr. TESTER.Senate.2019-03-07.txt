 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service  and career of veteran and dedicated advocate Matthew Shuman.   The American Legion is a cornerstone in countless American  communities, helping our veterans get the care, benefits, and  recognition they earned while giving back through  [[Page S1732]]  youth programs, scholarship assistance, and grassroots efforts. The  American Legion's membership is robust and active, and they have been  well-served by Matthew.   Matthew has been a tireless legislative advocate for American Legion  members and the veteran community as a whole. In his role overseeing  the American Legion's legislative efforts, Matthew has been  instrumental in improving VA healthcare and benefits for our more than  22 million veterans, including 2 million Legionnaires around the world.   Matthew served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2012. He served as a  military police officer and concluded his military career as a member  of the Arizona Army National Guard Honor Guard, memorializing our  fallen soldiers by providing military funeral honors.   Following his military service, Matthew attended Grand Canyon  University and participated in the Reserve Officer Training Corps,  ROTC, at Arizona State University. He graduated from Marymount  University in Arlington, VA, with a B.S. in criminal justice. He  established his passion for public service by working for two different  Members of Congress, as well as working on the 2012 election cycle.   Matthew's career with the American Legion began in 2015, when he  started as an assistant legislative director focused on veterans'  employment and education in their Washington, DC, headquarters. In  January 2017, Matthew began his tenure as the director of the American  Legion's national legislative division. In that role, Matthew has been  the American Legion's chief advocate before Congress, the White House,  and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Matthew has helped lead an  organization that has always been at the forefront of advocating for  veterans and securing the resources, healthcare, and benefits veterans  have earned.   As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, it has  been a joy to work with Matthew and the American Legion on important  legislation like the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization  Act, the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, the Harry  W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--also known as the  Forever G.I. Bill--several reforms and subsequent overhaul of the VA's  healthcare system, and the current implementation of the VA MISSION  Act. All the while, I have been impressed with Matthew's charisma,  kindness, and humor.   These bipartisan bills, all of which were signed into law, serve as a  testament to Matthew's dedication and leadership on behalf of veterans.  Future generations of veterans will be able to look at these bipartisan  reforms as examples of Matthew's advocacy on behalf of all veterans.   It is my honor to recognize Matthew's outstanding military service  and continued service to our servicemembers, veterans, and their  families. As Matthew begins a new chapter, I have no doubt that he will  continue to be a voice for those in need.   To Matthew, on behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I extend my  greatest appreciation to you for your enduring bravery, service,  sacrifice, and advocacy.                            ____________________
