 Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                    Russia     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                    Russia     Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon  following my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Cardin, to speak to  the legislation that I am cosponsoring and that they have introduced to  ramp up sanctions on Russia. I think it is important to emphasize that  this is a strongly bipartisan legislative effort.   Indeed, for more than seven decades, Congress has stood strong on a  bipartisan basis, first against the Soviet Union and now against  Russian threats against the United States and our European allies.  Working across the aisle in Congress, we have supported the NATO  alliance. Beginning after World War II with the Marshall Plan and  continuing to this day with the European Reassurance Initiative, we  have helped to build the richest economies and the most robust  democracies the world has ever seen, protected in large part in Western  Europe by NATO.   Today we face new and unprecedented threats from an increasingly  aggressive Russia. Russia continues to illegally occupy territory in  Georgia and Ukraine. It is on the march in Syria, and it is building up  its military presence and making threatening moves toward the Baltic  States and in the Balkans.   There is growing evidence that it is actively interfering to spread  disinformation and manipulate the outcome of elections this year in  France, Germany, and across Europe. In fact there is evidence to  suggest that they were involved in the Brexit vote and in the Dutch  referendum last year.   Right here in our own country, Russia has used brazen cyber attacks  and other measures to aggressively interfere in our Presidential  election last fall. This was an attack on our sovereignty, on our  democracy, and on the American people, and it was unprecedented. It  requires the strongest possible response, short of armed force, to  demonstrate to Vladimir Putin that this behavior will not be tolerated  and it must not happen again. That is exactly the purpose of these  comprehensive sanctions.   I agree with Senator Cardin, the ranking member on the Foreign  Relations Committee, that the Foreign Relations Committee should play a  pivotal leadership role in both our legislative and oversight  capacities in pushing back against Russia's aggression in all its  forms. By all means, this includes making the case that the skills and  experience of our State Department and USAID professionals are more  important than ever.   In Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, and all across  the world, they are working to increase the resilience of our allies by  strengthening democratic institutions, fostering the rule of law, and  fighting corruption. These initiatives have played an indispensable  role in helping the United States prevail in the Cold War, and they are  every bit as important today as we oppose Russian aggression.   We had the opportunity in the Armed Services Committee to hear from  an expert talking about Russia and about Russia's strategy. One of the  things he pointed out is that, just as Russia is building up its  military might, just as it is expanding its propaganda initiatives  through television broadcasts like ``Russia Today'' and ``Sputnik,'' it  is also looking at how it can undermine Western democracies as a way to  interrupt the transatlantic alliance--the alliance between the United  States and Europe that has been so important to stability in the world  for the last 70 years.   That is Russia's real goal. They want to undermine Europe. They want  to undermine the West and the United States. One of the ways they are  trying to do that is by disrupting our elections. We can't allow this  kind of aggression to go unpunished. If we do, we will surely face  further attacks from an emboldened Russia looking to disrupt our  democracy. Indeed, I think this attack should be answered with the most  punishing economic and financial sanctions that we can muster, and we  need to work even harder to  [[Page S1683]]  shore up our European allies who are facing Russian aggression and  interference.   As we look at the upcoming French and German elections, there is no  doubt that Russia is trying to interfere with those elections, as well,  with the goal of undermining our democracy. When one begins to mess  around with our elections, they strike at the heart of a democracy that  is the foundation of this country.   I commend Senator McCain and Senator Cardin for introducing this  bipartisan sanctions legislation, and I hope that Senators on both  sides of the aisle will join us in passing these comprehensive  sanctions against Russia.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, on this International Women's Day, we  celebrate the remarkable social, economic, and political achievements  of women around the world, but we also take stock of the barriers that  continue to prevent hundreds of millions of women from contributing  their talents as equal members of the human family.   As in years past, this year I am again joining with Senator Susan  Collins in submitting a bipartisan resolution commemorating  International Women's Day and highlighting its goal of advancing the  equality and empowerment of women all across the globe. I especially  appreciate Senator Collins'  [[Page S1696]]  unwavering support in working with me on this resolution.   It has been said that no nation can get ahead if it leaves half of  its people behind, and in the 21st century, wherever women are  respected and treated as equals, we excel, as the Presiding Officer  knows, as legislators, as scientists, as entrepreneurs, artists,  inventors, warriors, and in every other field. But the harsh reality  remains that women make up some 51 percent of the world's population,  yet we account for an estimated 70 percent of those living in poverty  and two-thirds of those denied even a basic education.   So on this International Women's Day, we celebrate women's  achievements, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving an equal voice,  equal participation, and equal rights for all women. We also  acknowledge that we still have much difficult work ahead of us.   Research tells us that women and girls' equality can be  transformational for their communities and for entire countries, yet in  some of the poorest parts of the world--and even in some wealthier  countries--women and girls continue to be held back by injustices such  as child marriage, sexual and domestic violence, denial of education,  and lack of access to contraception and maternal healthcare.   In recent years, we have learned more about the intersection of so  many of these issues that affect women. When girls are forced into  early marriage, when women are denied contraception and have children  at a very young age, this typically ends any chance to gain an  education and income-earning employment. This lack of economic  influence means that women remain powerless within their families and,  too often, within their communities. And this, in turn, can lead to  violence against women and the denial of women's most basic human and  civil rights.   The good news is that this same interconnectedness can work to  empower women and to lift up communities. When women and girls' rights  are respected, when we have access to education and family planning  services, this unleashes women's ability to participate equally in the  community, in the workplace, and even in the political arena.   Indeed, we can now quantify so many of the positive ripple effects.  For example, each additional year of education increases a woman's  income by 25 percent. We know that children born to educated mothers  are twice as likely to survive past the age of 5. By mobilizing the  talents of the previously neglected half of the population--in too many  places--we create more stable societies and more rapid economic  development.   For decades, the United States has been a world leader in advancing  and protecting the rights of women and girls around the world,  including their access to contraception and family planning. In  particular, I want to applaud the excellent work of the State  Department's Office of Global Women's Issues. I am sponsoring  legislation in this session to give this office permanent  authorization, with an ambassador leading it.   However, on this International Women's Day, we must also acknowledge  actions to abdicate America's leadership role in advancing women's  rights. Indeed, both at home and abroad, the Trump administration has  exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive  rights. President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices  who will overturn Roe v. Wade. He has joined with some of the  Republican leaders in Congress in pledging to terminate funding for  Planned Parenthood.   In one of his first official acts, the President signed an Executive  order reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy, also known as  the global gag rule. This rule prohibits U.S. financial aid to many  international organizations that offer contraception and comprehensive  family planning services to women.   As if the reinstatement of this policy weren't bad enough, the  administration's Executive order dramatically expanded the policy to  apply to all U.S.-funded global health programs--so not just family  planning and counseling programs. But we believe that this expansion  will include our HIV/AIDS program, known as PEPFAR, which has been so  positive in saving so many lives in Africa. It was started by George W.  Bush. We also think it will affect initiatives that fund the fights  against the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, and this puts at risk 15 times  more funding and millions more women and their families around the  world.   Taken together, all of these actions by the new administration I  believe amount to an assault on the safety and well-being of women and  girls across the globe.   I have joined with Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and  45 other Senators in introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently  repeal the global gag rule. I believe--and it is well documented--that  this is a misguided policy that ignores decades of research.   We shouldn't allow extreme ideology to triumph over the urgent  practical needs of women across the world. The facts make clear that  when family planning services are accessible and contraceptives are  affordable, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions go down.   According to the World Health Organization, there is an estimated 225  million women in the world who would like access to family planning  services, and we know that makes a difference. Here in the United  States, the abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level since 1943, a  success that is directly attributable to the reduced cost sharing for  contraception under the Affordable Care Act. I can attest to that  because in New Hampshire, we have one of the lowest incidences of teen  pregnancy in the country.   In January, we saw millions of women, men, and children, turn out for  marches in Washington, New York, London, Nairobi, Tokyo, in my home  capital of Concord, NH, and in dozens of other cities across the  country and around the world. I think we can look at that as an early  celebration of International Women's Day because what we heard from  those marching was that we were marching in defense of the rights of  American women, of Muslim women, of women of color, and of all women  and girls across the globe.   The world heard our message loudly and clearly. We will not allow our  reproductive rights and our human rights to be taken away. We will not  allow women to be targeted for discrimination. We will not be taken  backward.   That was our message in January, and it is our message on this  International Women's Day. We have fought long and hard for equal  rights and equal treatment here in the United States.   We are also celebrating women here in the United States. We have many  women who have taken the day off to recognize the role that women play  that is so significant in our society, and many of us are also wearing  red to demonstrate that. So on this day of celebration and solidarity,  we are determined to go forward to build on the progress of recent  decades, and we rededicate ourselves to achieving respect, equality,  and justice for every woman in every community and every country across  the globe.
