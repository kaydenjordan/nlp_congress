 Mr. Speaker, this time last year, President Biden told  the American people that inflation was just temporary, just transitory,  not a real big deal. The truth is hitting harder than a Mayflower  moving van escaping California.   Yesterday, the Consumer Price Index for June came in and the results  are even worse than expected, at least by some. To real Americans, it  is probably not a real surprise.   The Biden administration's economic policies have produced record  inflation, a 41-year record, at 9.1 percent, and that is probably low  to most Americans.   As inflation continues to skyrocket, wages have actually decreased.  In fact, since President Biden took office, real wages have decreased  by about 5 percent.   Across the Nation, Americans are dipping into their savings to stay  on top of their increasing grocery and gas bills.   Multiple polls show that Biden's economic crisis is the top issue for  Americans, and the vast majority of Americans agree that the economy is  in crisis directly due to the administration's failed policies.   In fact, I held a telephone townhall last night with 70,000 callers  from around my district joining in. Ninety percent responded in the  poll saying that the economy is their top concern. The Biden  administration needs to get with it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Kelly's leadership that he  is providing for us here tonight and all through the year and all  through your tenure here on this key moral issue.   I am glad also to join the rest of my pro-life colleagues here to  reaffirm our dedication to protecting the innocent unborn.   Indeed, we have cause for celebration, something that has been  corrected, over nearly 50 years and over 50 million lives taken, the  unconstitutional Roe decision has been rightfully overturned and the  power put back to the States to a legislative process, not one decided  by seven of nine on a Supreme Court.   Indeed, now we can have debate and people can be accountable for  their votes. The public can have input on what they think about this  topic. The public is much more educated at this point than they were 50  years ago and what this really means.   Every pregnancy actually results in a human life in that pregnancy.  It is not something else. It is not a blob. It is not a tissue mass. It  isn't going to be some other form of life or an animal--this is a human  life we are talking about, and we value that and we protect that. It is  constitutional to protect life in this country.   Though that decision does not outlaw abortion, it puts the  responsibility and accountability back to legislatures, whether it is  going to be States or here in the U.S. Capitol.   They still pushed forward anyway with a determination to go even  farther than Roe v. Wade--their abortion on demand bill that they are  going to take up tomorrow. It provides for discretionary abortions at  any point in a pregnancy on the basis of a baby's sex, race, or  possible disability.   What are we doing here?   We must stop the left's radical, extreme, immoral abortion agenda and  uphold the value and dignity and potential of every person's life.   We even see now that corporations want to pay for travel for  abortions for their employees. Amazing. They think this is helping  women--$4,000 is possible for your travel.   We have States that also want to be abortion tourism centers. My home  State of California, shamefully, is trying to draw people in, pay for  their stay, pay for their travel--even for illegal immigrants.   How immoral can you be?   Each one of these innocent souls was created by God. We see this  immoral decay of our country, and it is really coming to fruition right  in bright colors in front of all of us.   There is no denying that what we are talking about is a human life.  As early as 5 weeks in the womb babies have a heartbeat; 10 weeks,  arms, legs, fingers and toes, and they can jump and kick even inside  the womb; 15 weeks, fully developed hearts, they can taste, yawn, and  hiccup. Indeed, they are real.   It is not some blob. It is not something to be dismissed. What we are  seeing here with the overturning of this decision, is the  responsibility is back in front of the people to have this debate, and  it is going to be a serious debate with all the States that are going  to take this up, and here in Congress.   My hat is off to all the people that have worked so hard all these  years--those pro-life folks out there--making the case, pleading,  praying, and working so hard to educate about the miracle that is life.
