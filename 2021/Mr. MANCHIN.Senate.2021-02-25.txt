 Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that upon  the disposition of the Granholm nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Cardona nomination.    Mr. President, first of all, I am delighted to speak  today on the nomination of Jennifer Granholm to be Secretary of Energy.   I have known Jennifer since we were Governors together more than a  decade ago. She served two terms as Governor of Michigan from 2003 to  2010. That was a particularly challenging time in her State's history,  and I saw how she handled the difficult challenges facing her during  the Great Recession and when the bottom dropped out of the auto  industry in her State.   She was up to those challenges. She helped save the domestic auto  industry. She diversified Michigan's economy. She brought in new  investment and new industry, and she created new jobs, leaving no  worker behind.   I know she will continue to apply the mindset at the national level.  She has the leadership skills, the vision, and the compassion for  people that we need at the helm of the Department of Energy to face the  climate challenge and, at the same time, preserve our energy security,  protect our national security, clean up the Cold War legacy, and  preserve our scientific and technological prowess.   Moreover, she is someone you can talk to and work with. She listens,  and she is an honest broker. She may not always agree with you, but she  will listen to your concerns and will try to address them.   Finally, she is just simply a good person. That is a quality that I  value and expect all of my colleagues would benefit from.   I believe she is extremely well qualified to lead the Department of  Energy, and I urge--I truly urge--all of my colleagues to show in this  bipartisan vote to confirm her nomination today.   I also yield back the remaining time of our presentation.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
