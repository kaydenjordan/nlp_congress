 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to hold  this Special Order on the Republican Study Committee's GEAR Task Force.   I thank   Mike Johnson, chairman of the Republican Study Committee,  for his leadership to make this task force possible.   We started GEAR, which stands for Government Efficiency,  Accountability, and Reform, to develop a playbook of commonsense,  nonpartisan solutions for improving our government. We came up with  more than 100 improvements. They are all recorded in our report, which  is now available, and I am excited to yield to my colleagues to talk  about them here today.   We will start with my good friend from North Dakota, Representative  Kelly Armstrong, who was a member of the task force and really led our  efforts to find these areas where we could reform.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr.  Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Armstrong for his work.  Permitting is an area where we can really make advances to make the  process more deterministic so we can get projects on the ground going.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership there.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan's Seventh  District, Representative Tim Walberg,  [[Page H1040]]  and I want to recognize him for his work on the Taxpayers Right-to-Know  effort. I thank the gentleman for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership on this.   Taxpayers do have a right to know, and hopefully as that bill moves  to the President's desk, it will actually happen.   At this time, I welcome the gentleman from Texas' 27th Congressional  District, Representative Michael Cloud, here today. He was a member of  the GEAR Task Force and really brought a number of ideas to the table,  and he is here today to reflect on a number of those.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership here in highlighting some of these wasteful programs.  Clearly, we can do better, and I thank him for bringing them forward.   At this time, I will yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona's Eighth  Congressional District, Representative Debbie Lesko. She has brought to  us some of the reforms related to improving our immigration system, and  I look forward to her sharing that with us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, especially for  bringing attention to this issue of immigration. It is top of mind for  so many Americans, and having the judges necessary to pursue these  cases to final outcome is so important.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), from the 12th  Congressional District, a task force member who helped bring forward  many of the ideas that are in this collection of commonsense government  efficiency ideas just published recently.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I  particularly appreciate his business experience here in the House and  his participation on this task force.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Timmons), from the Fourth Congressional District. He has also been a  task force member, and his fingerprints are on this report.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South  Carolina for his leadership on the GEAR Task Force.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), from the First Congressional District, for his thoughts on  government efficiency and reform.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  for his remarks.   I agree we have seen the impacts of an overly lengthy NEPA process  that just ties projects in knots, and the weaponization of the  Endangered Species Act has allowed it to drift away from its original  intent of protecting species. So I appreciate the gentleman's  leadership on this.  [[Page H1043]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the 21st District of  Texas (Mr. Roy) for his thoughts on government efficiency and reform  and also his leadership on national emergency reform.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas,  particularly for reminding us of the need to rebalance and reclaim our  Article I authority from the runaway bureaucracy that we have here in  Washington.   Madam Speaker, we started the Government Efficiency Accountability  and Reform Task Force for one simple reason: only 17 percent of  Americans today say they can trust the government in Washington. We  have to get the government working for the people again.   Madam Speaker, I was in Billings, Montana, and a gentleman who has  been drilling natural gas wells for 30 years told me a story. He said  30 years ago when he wanted a permit to drill a well, he would go into  the field with a clipboard, a single piece of paper, and a ballpoint  pen. He would fill out that application. The government official would  review it in the field and say: That will be all right.   Today, Madam Speaker, that same form is 48 pages long, requires an  engineer and a lawyer to fill it out, tens of thousands of dollars, and  months to process.   Clearly, we can do better.   Our three branches of government have drifted from their original  purpose to cultivating a culture of waste. That is why we have produced  this playbook of 100 commonsense, nonpartisan solutions for efficiency,  accountability, and reform of our Federal Government.   Over this last year, the Republican Study Committee GEAR Task Force  has been meeting with outside experts and the administration and  internally to produce a playbook of commonsense solutions for  efficiency, accountability, and reform of our Federal Government.   I want to thank the task force members, the chairman of the RSC,    Mike Johnson; Barry Loudermilk; Doug Collins; Bruce Westerman; Rick  Allen;   John Curtis;   Michael Cloud; Kelly Armstrong; William  Timmons; and Denver Riggleman for their engagement and their leadership  in pulling together this playbook through which we hope to run these  commonsense ideas.    The report is broken into three sections. The first section refers to  the comments made by my colleague who just finished on the Article I  power in the Constitution to restore the people's control over an  unchecked bureaucracy by returning the constitutional balance between  the branches of government.   Our Founding Fathers never anticipated the size of the bureaucracy we  have today. That is why we need provisions like the REINS Act, so that  the statutes passed in this House get reflected in rules consistent  with our intent.   The second section of the report has to do with government practices  to streamline Federal programs and operations to promote efficiency and  eliminate waste.   Madam Speaker, in 2015 the Social Security Administration told us we  had sent benefit checks to over 6 million Americans who were over the  age  [[Page H1044]]  of 112. Now, either they are drinking some special elixir of life or  they are not with us anymore. That is why I have introduced a piece of  legislation titled stop paying dead people. I think that would be a  good reform. It would save American taxpayers and make sure the  benefits are there for those who do need Social Security.   The third section of the report is on personnel, to transition  government personnel accountability and compensation toward more of a  merit-based system. I operated a number of businesses in the private  sector, and there are many HR practices in the Federal Government which  are very different than they are in the private sector, things like  merit-based pay, the way we do performance reviews, and making sure we  have market-based pay for our good, dedicated Federal workers. Those  are contained in the third section.   In total, there are over 100 commonsense ideas in this report that we  will run as plays here in the House to make the government start  working for the people again.   I appreciate the opportunity for the Members of the task force and  others who have engaged on this issue to come today and share their  commonsense ideas. I look forward to partnering to put these ideas into  practice to get government working for the people again.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, February 12, 2020, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
