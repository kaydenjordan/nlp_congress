 Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to recognize Dennis  Williams as he retires from United Auto Workers after more than 40  years of service to the union and to our country.   I have known Dennis for many, many years. Throughout his career, he  has led the fight to protect the right to collective bargaining and to  ensure that all workers, not just those in the union, have fair pay and  safe working conditions.   Like the UAW itself, Dennis has always been committed to securing  economic and social justice for workers. His experience has carried him  through the diverse sectors of the UAW, giving him expertise across the  spectrum.   He started at UAW Local 806 as a salvage welder, served in many  positions--bargaining chairman, international representative, region 4  director--before becoming international president in 2016.   Dennis Williams' service and success at the bargaining table led to a  better quality of life for the UAW's more than 400,000 workers and  580,000 retirees, many of whom I am proud to represent in my home  district.   I am grateful to work with leaders like Dennis who have changed our  communities for the better, and we will miss Dennis Williams' voice and  his leadership in the union, but we know it won't be lost to the  country as he begins this next chapter in his life.   Congratulations, Dennis, on work well done.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan amendment. It is very  simple. It would expand the House Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program so  that more wounded servicemembers have the opportunity to continue  serving our country by working in congressional offices.   We need more veterans in public service. They bring unique  perspectives and experiences, unlike any other. The veterans that I  have been fortunate enough to hire in my office have given me  invaluable support and allowed me to consider issues that are important  to veterans in an important and much more enlightened fashion. Their  voices are important in this body, more now than ever.   By investing in the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program, more veterans  will get a chance to serve. Expanding this program will enhance the  professional development opportunities for those fellows.   We in Congress do talk a lot about ways to help veterans transition  following their service in the military. This is an opportunity for us  to actually do something about that and model what we think all  employers ought to be doing.   It is a simple way to expand opportunities for veterans. It increases  the number of veterans in public service. Again, in my office, I have  benefited greatly from the veterans that I have hired. It is a  bipartisan effort to continue to expand this program.   I ask my colleagues to pass this amendment. It is a small way to not  only improve the function of our own offices but also say thanks to the  brave men and women who have given so much for the freedom that we all  enjoy.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is intended to highlight the  lack of urgency by the Air Force to address an ongoing drinking water  emergency across the country, including one in my home district. I am  not talking about Flint; I am talking about Oscoda, Michigan, at the  northern end of my district, the home of the former Wurtsmith Air Force  Base.   My constituents living there have had their drinking water  contaminated by PFAS, perfluorinated chemicals, from the Air Force's  use of firefighting foam. Exposure to PFAS has been linked to harmful  health issues like cancer as well as thyroid, kidney, liver, heart, and  reproductive problems. It is not just servicemembers but community  members there.   Unfortunately, the more we learn about this dangerous class of  chemicals, the more we are finding it in drinking water across the  country. In my district alone, thousands of people have cancer-causing  chemicals in their drinking water due to the Air Force's use of this  material.   The Air Force does not seem to want to recognize this ongoing  drinking water crisis. I have been pushing the Air Force to clean up  the contamination in Oscoda and other communities. In fact, the entire  Michigan delegation, Democrats and Republicans, wrote to appropriators  asking for more funding for PFAS contamination.   While Members are prevented from earmarking legislation to send  resources directly to clean up contamination in Oscoda, it is an urgent  problem that I wanted to call attention to. This community is near this  former Air Force Base. It is facing very serious water contamination  issues.   You would think that the Air Force would request additional resources  to clean up contamination, but, frustratingly, the Air Force has so far  refused to request additional resources.   The Appropriations Committee even asked the Air Force if they needed  more money. Let me repeat that. The Appropriations Committee even asked  the Air Force if they needed more money to address this problem, but  the Air Force responded that they did not need any additional funds.   I offer this amendment for the purpose of raising the issue. I know  that it is not possible for us to designate these funds, so it is my  intention to withdraw this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Florida, the ranking  member of the subcommittee, for her commitment to work on this.   This is a serious issue. I know Congress takes it seriously. I just  would ask that the Air Force take it equally as seriously and request  the funds necessary to clean up this really difficult problem.   With that, I know that this amendment could present some problems in  terms of the way this legislation moved forward, but the commitment  that I have that this will be getting the attention it deserves from  Congress, I think, is important.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would provide just over $2  billion to the vocational rehabilitation and employment account. This  account invests in programs to help veterans successfully transition to  civilian life.   Our country has been at war for nearly two decades. While these  conflicts are still ongoing, the number of veterans in this country is  going to continue to grow. We have to invest in programs that support  this generation of veterans as they seek to reintegrate into the  civilian workforce.   I just want to highlight a couple of important programs in this  account.   The Special Employer Incentives program connects veterans with  opportunities where the VA reimburses the employer for up to half of a  veteran's salary. This is a program that matches veterans with  apprenticeships, with the expectation of being hired upon completion.   I know from experience that our veterans bring unique perspective and  skills to the workplace. I have hired, as I have said in previous  conversations, multiple veterans working in my office, including a  Wounded Warrior fellow and a HillVets fellow. We should ensure that we  are supporting programs that connect veterans with employers.   My amendment would also ensure funding for the VA to expand its  Veterans Economic Communities Initiative, a program in which nonprofits  and educational institutions build supportive networks for veterans.  This is exactly the kind of long-term support that we should have had  in place years  [[Page H4974]]  ago before launching into these conflicts.   For many Americans, the American Dream is owning your own business  and being your own boss. The vocational rehabilitation and employment  account includes programs that help veterans do just that.   The vocational rehabilitation and employment account also includes  the VetSuccess on Campus program, which places vocational rehab  counselors in partner schools.   This amendment would give the VA the opportunity to expand these  programs, reaching even more veterans.   Unfortunately, as this process has moved forward, we have come to  understand that the VA would intend to reduce the account for direct  support for tuition and other supplies for veterans under their rights  under the GI Bill.   I will ask that this amendment be withdrawn, but I want to make sure  to make the point that we ought to have a specific carveout for these  vocational programs, for these transition programs. It is my hope that,  as we move forward, we will be able to work with the VA to be able to  identify a source that would not reduce the other benefits that are  available to veterans seeking to better themselves.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time   Mr. Chair, I withdraw this amendment.
