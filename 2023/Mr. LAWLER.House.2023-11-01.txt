 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3774) to impose additional sanctions with respect to the  importation or facilitation of the importation of petroleum products  from Iran, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3774         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Harboring Iranian       Petroleum Act'' or the ``SHIP Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to deny Iran the ability, by limiting Iran's export of       petroleum and petroleum products, to--  [[Page H5194]]         (A) engage in destabilizing activities;        (B) support international terrorism; or        (C) fund the development and acquisition of weapons of mass       destruction and weapons delivery systems;        (2) to deny Iran funds to oppress and commit human rights       violations against the Iranian people assembling to       peacefully redress the Iranian regime;        (3) to fully enforce sanctions against those entities which       provide support to the Iranian energy sector; and        (4) to counter Iran's actions to finance and facilitate the       participation of foreign terrorist organizations in ongoing       conflicts and illicit activities due to the threat such       actions pose to the vital national interests of the United       States.       SEC. 3. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO IRANIAN                     PETROLEUM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here today as we gather to pass the  Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum Act, or the SHIP Act, which I  introduced earlier this year with my colleague from Florida,  Congressman Jared Moskowitz.   In the wake of the appalling terrorist attacks against Israel on  October 7, it is clear that we must work to confront Iran and its  proxies in the region with a strong sanctions regime. Iran is the  largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world and, unfortunately, has  the coffers to back this up. Iran spends its money on terror, on  developing nuclear capabilities, on taking hostages to use for  bargaining purposes, and on funding the criminal IRGC.   We must cut off Iran's funding and stop these illicit activities at  their source, and that is where Iranian oil comes in.   Iran currently engages in a massive global oil trade, exporting its  blood-stained petroleum in exchange for money and influence abroad. In  the past year alone, Iran has made tens of billions off of their  illicit oil trade, and this August, China imported a staggering 1.5  million barrels per day.   China is the largest importer of Iranian oil and, in doing so, has  become complicit in the nefarious acts carried out with that funding.  While the U.S. already sanctions Iranian petroleum, it is absolutely  critical that we expand our sanctions regime to not only target Iran  but Iran's enablers that are complicit in the nefarious acts committed  with that money.   The SHIP Act specifically expands these sanctions to cover foreign  ports and refineries that process Iranian oil. Individuals and entities  that knowingly accept shipments of Iranian oil, refine Iranian oil,  transport or offload Iranian oil, or otherwise transact with Iranian  oil should be held accountable for their actions, for their willingness  to pay for Iranian-backed terrorism.   The SHIP Act has been bipartisan from the start and continues to show  a united front between Republicans and Democrats to limit Iran's global  influence and protect those the Iranian regime seeks to harm, such as  our Jewish and Israeli friends.   The SHIP Act sends a message to those who trade in Iranian oil that  they will have the United States to deal with if they continue to do  so. They can't pretend they don't know where the money is going. They  can't pretend to separate Iranian oil from the very terrorism it  supports. Now, we are putting it in writing that they are going to be  held accountable if they keep enabling Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3774, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, October 26, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.

Provisions of this bill fall       within the Judiciary Committee's Rule X jurisdiction, and I       appreciate that you consulted with us on those provisions.       The Judiciary Committee agrees that it shall be discharged       from further consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please include this letter in your       committee's report to accompany this legislation or insert       this letter in the Congressional Record during consideration       of H.R. 3774 on the House floor. I appreciate the cooperative       manner in which our committees have worked on this matter,       and I look forward to working collaboratively in the future       on matters of shared jurisdiction. Thank you for your       attention to this matter.

Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 3774, the ``Stop Harboring       Iranian Petroleum Act,'' so that the measure may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and  Accountability.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I introduced this bill earlier this year  with Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. It has over 230 bipartisan  cosponsors because Congress recognizes the need to sanction Iranian  petroleum even further.   Since President Biden took office, relaxed enforcement of oil  sanctions has contributed to increased Iranian oil revenues worth  approximately $25.9 billion.   In 2019, Iran's oil exports fell below 500,000 barrels per day as a  result of the prior administration's oil sanctions pressure.   As of September 2023, Iranian oil exports had increased to nearly 1.5  million barrels per day. Most of these increased sales have gone to  Chinese buyers.   Exports are up 59 percent since January of 2021. The administration's  refusal to list entities enabling the trade for secondary sanctions--in  other words, imposing sanctions on the buyers--has contributed to this.   I wish we didn't need to do this, but we have to. HSI and OFAC should  be enforcing these sanctions.   On October 11, 2023, NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications,  John Kirby, responded to a question about the weak enforcement of  sanctions on Iranian oil by stating, quote, ``The President has been  concerned about making sure we have a viable global market for oil,  working hard to keep the prices of gasoline down here in the United  States. Part of that is making sure you remove some of the volatility  in that global supply and demand.''   Are you kidding me? First of all, the United States doesn't get  Iranian petroleum. Our refineries aren't able to process it, and we  already have sanctions in place against it. This administration has  prohibited U.S. oil and gas development more strenuously than it has  Iranian. It is absurd.   Macquarie, a leading financial services advisory firm, recently  advised its clients that: ``In our assessment, the Biden  administration's policy approach has been to limit oil supply  disruptions, regardless of the situation. Given that policy objectives  did not target Russian oil flows even at the height of the Russian- Ukraine conflict, we do not expect Iranian oil exports to be  constrained either.''   Now, there are Members of this body that are going to oppose this  legislation because it is too strenuous, doesn't give enough wiggle  room to the administration. There is a reason we are not giving wiggle  room to the administration. It is because they have been incapable of  enforcing the sanctions against Iran and Iranian petroleum, which has  been used as the funding source for the greatest state sponsor of  terrorism in the world.   Lest anyone think otherwise, the attacks by Hamas, by Hezbollah over  the course of time have been funded by Iran. We must be stringent in  enforcing these sanctions. It is critically important.   When you look at what is happening in the world and the unholy  alliance that has been brought about by Iran, North Korea, China, and  Russia to undermine and destabilize the free world,  [[Page H5197]]  to undermine the United States and our allies, we must enforce these  sanctions, which is why it is critically important that we pass H.R.  3774 so that we can enact sanctions on the buyer.   China has been the largest buyer of Iranian petroleum. Their  refineries are built to refine that oil. Our allies around the world  must recognize and understand the threats that are emanating from this  unholy alliance.   I urge all of my colleagues in both parties to support this  bipartisan, commonsense legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H. Res. 599) urging the European Union to designate Hizballah in  its entirety as a terrorist organization.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                H. Res. 599         Whereas, in April 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against       the United States Embassy in Beirut killed 63 people;        Whereas, in October 1983, a Hizballah terror attack against       the United States Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed       241 American and 58 French servicemembers supporting the       Multinational Force peacekeeping mission;        Whereas, in July 2012, a Hizballah terror attack, carried       out by an operative with dual Lebanese-French citizenship, in       Burgas, Bulgaria, killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bulgarian;        Whereas, in March 2013, a Swedish-Lebanese Hizballah       operative in Cyprus was convicted of planning terror attacks       against Israeli tourists;        Whereas, in June 2015, a Hizballah operative was sentenced       to 6 years in prison after he stockpiled more than 8 tons of       ammonium nitrate in Cyprus;        Whereas the Hizballah International Financing Prevention       Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) and the Hizballah       International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018       (Public Law 115-272) broadened financial sector sanctions       against Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to       refrain from supporting the terrorist group;        Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of the Treasury       imposed sanctions on Abdullah Safi-Al-Din, Hizballah's       representative to Iran, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah       financier, and blacklisted 5 of Bazzi's companies, including       Belgian energy services conglomerate Global Trading Group NV;        Whereas, in October 2018, French police raided the Islamic       Zahra Centre on suspicion of supporting Hizballah, freezing       the organization's funds, and seizing illegal weapons;        Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former leaders of the Zahra       Centre France were arrested on suspicion of continuing to run       that association and supporting Hizballah;        Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of the Treasury       designated 2 Hizballah-backed members of Lebanese Parliament,       Amin Sherri and Muhammad Hasan Ra'd, and Hizballah security       official Wafiq Safa, stating that Hizballah uses its       operatives in parliament to advance its violent activities;        Whereas, as of April 2021, Germany believed there to be       1,250 people with suspected links to Hizballah in the       country;        Whereas Europol's June 2022 European Union Terrorism       Situation and Trend Report outlined that Hizballah ``has been       using the EU as a base for fundraising, recruitment, and       criminal activities'', and the report also stated that       Hizballah ``is suspected of managing the transportation and       distribution of illegal drugs into the EU, dealing with       firearms trafficking and running professional money       laundering operations that include the provision of money       laundering services for other criminal organizations'';        Whereas United States-led Project Cassandra and Operation       Cedar exposed the criminal-business wing of Hizballah, the       Business Affairs Component (BAC) of Hezbollah's External       Security Organization;        Whereas, during Project Cassandra, Hizballah elements       involved in drug trafficking were arrested in the United       States, South America, and several European countries,       including France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy;        Whereas Hizballah's criminal activity in Europe is run by       the BAC, which reports to the External Security Organisation,       also known as Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Organization,       and Abdallah Safieddine, Hizballah's representative in Iran,       is also involved in this activity;        Whereas, in August 2020, United Nations Secretary General       Guterres called on Lebanon to disarm Hizballah, citing the       terror group's persistent violation of Resolution 1701       (2006);        Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of Hizballah, harboring,       financing, training, and arming the group;        Whereas the Department of the Treasury and Department of       State estimate that Iran provides as much as $700,000,000 per       year to Hizballah in the form of financial and logistical       support, weapons, and training;        Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately       150,000 missiles and rockets, with increased sophistication       and many of which can reach deep into Israel;        Whereas Hizballah fighters have been supporting the Assad       regime in Syria, often leading operations in the conflict       which has left more than 500,000 dead;        Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for militias       in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region and       perpetuating violence in those countries;        Whereas Hizballah activities continue to plague Lebanon       with profound economic and political instability and       violence;        Whereas Hizballah's cross border illicit arms and drugs       trafficking undermines the Lebanese Armed Forces, the       legitimate security establishment of the country as outlined       in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006);        Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy Secretary       General Naim Qassem stated that ``[Hizballah does not] have a       military wing and a political one . . . Every element of       Hizballah, from commanders to members as well as our various       capabilities, are in the service of the resistance'';        Whereas the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the       Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia,       and Kosovo, among others, have declared Hizballah in its       entirety as a terror organization;        Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council       formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a terrorist       organization, and the League of Arab States shortly       thereafter adopted the same designation;        Whereas the Department of the Treasury has diligently added       persons and entities to the list of Specially Designated       Global Terrorists who have provided material support to the       Hizballah terrorist organization, thereby hampering its       financing and logistical capabilities;        Whereas the European Union, in July 2013, designated       Hizballah's so-called ``military wing'', but not the       organization as a whole, as a terrorist organization;        Whereas, despite restrictions put on Hizballah since the       designation of its military wing, the group continues to       conduct illicit narcotrafficking, money laundering, and       weapons trafficking throughout Europe and the world; and        Whereas the House of Representatives has previously called       on the European Union to fully designate Hizballah as a       terrorist organization, passing House Resolution 359 in       October 2017 and House Resolution 558 on September 20, 2022:       Now, therefore, be it          Resolved, That the House of Representatives--          (1) applauds and expresses support for the continued,       increased cooperation between the United States and the       European Union (EU) in thwarting Hizballah's criminal and       terrorist activities;          (2) supports transcontinental efforts within Europe to       share intelligence information among police and security       services to facilitate greater cooperation in tracking,       apprehending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign fighters,       and potential offenders;          (3) encourages the European Union to implement sanctions       against Hizballah-affiliated terrorists in tandem with the       United States;          (4) recommends greater civil society engagement in both       the United States and Europe to underscore Hizballah's malign       regional influence; and          (5) urges the European Union to designate Hizballah in       its entirety as a terrorist organization and increase       pressure on the group, including through--          (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation between       European Union members in combating Hizballah;          (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active       supporters of Hizballah;          (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, including       those masquerading as charities; and          (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of       Hizballah.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise  [[Page H5198]]  and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago, Hamas launched a brutal and unprovoked  terrorist attack on our ally, Israel, from its perch in the Gaza Strip.   Now Israel is engaged in a major military operation in response to  the pressing threat posed by this Iran-backed terrorist group. For  years, Hamas benefited from the misconception that it was focused on  governing the Gaza Strip but make no mistake, there is no difference  between the political and military wings of terrorist organizations.   One of Hamas' allies in the region, Hezbollah, also benefits from  this misguided fiction that its political and military entities are  separate. Like with Hamas, this is unequivocally false. Even  Hezbollah's leader himself admits there is no distinction between the  two, so it is unfortunate that the European Union includes Hezbollah's  military branch on its list of sanctioned terrorist organizations, but  not its political wing.   This has enabled Hezbollah to use Europe as a base to plan extremist  terrorist activities and exploit global financial networks to pay for  them. Right now, Hezbollah is launching near daily attacks on Israel's  northern borders with rockets, mortars, and antitank missiles. Every  one of these attacks risks the opening of a second front in this war.   Does this sound like the work of a political party? Yet, the EU's  continued recognition of this arbitrary distinction between political  and military wings allows Hezbollah to continue to operate throughout  Europe, even while causing casualties in Israel. This issue has never  been more urgent. We must make clear to these terrorist proxies that we  are not fooled about their true intention: the destruction of Israel.  We must make clear to Iran that it cannot hide behind its terrorist  proxies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our allies in the European Union to designate  Hezbollah in full as a terrorist organization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to vote in support of  this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, every day that passes risks further  escalation from Hezbollah on Israel's northern border.   We must not allow Hezbollah to continue to present the illusion that  its political and military wings are distinct. The EU must designate  Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization to permanently  dispense with this fiction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3266) to require the Secretary of State to submit annual  reports reviewing the curriculum used by the Palestinian Authority, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3266         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Peace and Tolerance in       Palestinian Education Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In 2016 and 2017, the Palestinian Authority published       modified curricula for school-aged children in grades 1       through 11.        (2) Textbooks used by the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the       West Bank and Gaza include graphics portraying violence       against Israeli soldiers, positive portrayals of individuals       who have committed attacks against citizens of Israel, and       references to Palestinian efforts to target the ``Zionists''.        (3) PA textbooks are used at schools sponsored by the       United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) because UNRWA       schools use the textbooks of the host government.        (4) On April 26, 2018, the Government Accountability Office       (GAO) published a report that found the following:        (A) Textbooks in PA schools feature inaccurate and       misleading maps of the region and include militaristic,       adversarial imagery and content that incite hatred.        (B) The Department of State raised with Palestinian       officials the objectionable content in textbooks, including a       specific math problem using the number of Palestinian       casualties in the First and Second Intifadas.        (C) The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), in       its review of the textbooks, identified content not aligned       with United Nations values, the majority of which content       related to neutrality or bias issues, including issues       related to maps and references to Jerusalem as the capital of       Palestine.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the Palestinian Authority       has not sufficiently eliminated content and passages       encouraging violence or intolerance toward other countries or       ethnic groups from the curriculum used in their schools.       SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for two       years in accordance with subsection (c), the Secretary of       State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate a report reviewing curriculum,       including textbooks, leaflets, pamphlets, magazines, and       other instructional materials, used in schools in areas       controlled by the Palestinian Authority or located in Gaza       and controlled by any other entity. Each such report shall       include the following:        (1) A determination of whether there is content or passages       encouraging violence or intolerance toward other countries or       ethnic groups in such curriculum, and a detailed explanation       of the reasons for reaching such determination.        (2) An assessment of the steps the Palestinian Authority is       taking to reform such curriculum at schools to conform with       standards of peace and tolerance in the Declaration of       Principles on Tolerance by the United Nations Educational,       Scientific and Cultural Organization (adopted November 16,       1995).        (3) A determination whether United States foreign       assistance is used, directly or indirectly, to fund the       dissemination of such curriculum by the Palestinian       Authority.        (4) A detailed report on how United States assistance is       being used to address curriculum that encourages violence or       intolerance toward other nations or ethnic groups.        (5) A detailed report about United States diplomatic       efforts in the preceding five years to encourage peace and       tolerance in Palestinian education.        (6) If any diplomatic efforts referred to in paragraph (5)       were stopped by the Secretary of State, the reasons for such       stoppages.        (b) Public Availability.--The Secretary of State shall post       on a publicly available website of the Department of State       each report required under subsection (a).        (c) Subsequent Deadlines.--Each report required by       subsection (a), other than the first such report, shall be       submitted not later than 90 days after the date on which a       new school year begins for schools controlled by the       Palestinian Authority.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3266, the Peace and Tolerance  in Palestinian Education Act.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Sherman, for introducing this important  legislation to prevent the spread of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic  hatred.   We have known for decades that Palestinian children are taught from a  young age to hate Israel and the Jewish people. Despite robust  international discussion about these concerns, reports by  nongovernmental organizations continue to show that Palestinian  schoolchildren are being indoctrinated with deeply disturbing violent  imagery.   For example, a review of the textbooks used in Palestinian schools in  2020 and 2021 showed that children are taught to read with passages  that describe suicide bombings and the gruesome murders of IDF  soldiers, to do math using numbers of martyrs and jihadists, and to  learn history by asking them to discuss how the USA took advantage of  the 9/11 attack.   These textbooks propagate the lie that the Jewish people control the  media and politics and explicitly refer to Jews as ``enemies of Islam  in all times and places.'' Children are taught to glorify the founders  of the jihad movement and learn that jihad is ``a private obligation  for every Muslim.''   We will never arrive at a peaceful solution for Israelis and  Palestinians as long as Palestinian children are being taught hatred in  textbooks.   Look at the brutal attack that over 2,500 Hamas terrorists carried  out against Israel on October 7. Why else would Hamas terrorists call  home bragging that they murdered Jews? Why else would they live stream  their barbaric attacks?   That disgusting and gruesome cruelty is possible because these Hamas  fighters were indoctrinated with hatred at a young age. They were  taught to glorify terrorism and other so-called martyrs who killed  Jewish people. This must end.   The Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian Education Act takes a first  step to firmly establish Congress' position that the Palestinian  Authority has not sufficiently eliminated inciteful and violent content  from their educational curricula. It also requires the State Department  to report to Congress on educational materials used in schools run by  the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Hamas, and the Gaza Strip,  and UNRWA.   A United States Government assessment of the content of these  educational materials will carry tremendous weight in international  efforts to eliminate hateful content and promote peace.   Since Hamas' attack, we have seen an appalling number of anti-Semitic  and anti-Israel riots around the world and right here at home. I have  condemned these in the strongest terms. I continue to speak out when  they occur, and I have encouraged my colleagues to do the same.   That is why, earlier this year, I introduced legislation to combat  the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses, the Stop Anti-Semitism  on College Campuses Act, which would defund institutions of higher  learning that allow, promote, or sanction anti-Semitic events on their  campuses.   That is why, just last week, Josh Gottheimer and I introduced the  Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would amend the education law to  require the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition of anti- Semitism on its enforcement actions of discrimination laws.   The commitment we made after the Holocaust, ``Never again,'' is being  put to the test. We have a responsibility to prevent the teaching of  anti-Semitism not just here in the United States but around the globe.  This bipartisan bill uses the tools available to the United States  Government to do just that.  [[Page H5200]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Oversight and Accountability.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We must continue to stand against anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias.  It is essential that we ensure children are not taught to hate, and  this starts with the materials they learn in school.   The first step is passing the bipartisan Peace and Tolerance in  Palestinian Education Act, to ensure we have transparent, valid, and  authenticated information.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will say, listening to the  sanctimoniousness of my colleague from New York is quite priceless,  talking about politics. This is a gentleman who couldn't even condemn  the New York City DSA in an op-ed and, in fact, was more upset that I  introduced a resolution condemning them than the actions of those  individuals within the New York City DSA that supported the Hamas  terrorist attack on Israel. That is precisely because of politics,  because his district is one of the most progressive districts in  America. He couldn't muster the courage to even condemn the New York  City DSA, so save us your sanctimoniousness sitting over there with  your smug look.   Mr. Speaker, nobody wants to be in a situation where they are  expelling a Member of Congress. It is serious, and it comes with weight  and gravity because that individual was elected by their constituents  to serve and to represent their district. You don't expel a Member for  being a jerk. You don't expel a Member for something they said. You  expel a Member for their conduct.   The conduct of Mr. Santos has been embarrassing and unbecoming and  unfit for public office. Lying about your background, lying about your  life experiences, making up events that didn't occur in an effort to  bamboozle voters into believing that you are the right person to  represent them, is wrong, fundamentally wrong. It is why all of us  called for Mr. Santos to resign when this information came to light.    The resolution that was brought about in May was referred to the  Ethics Committee for two reasons. Number one, there was not two-thirds  of the vote to expel; and, number two, you wanted to allow for a  process to get more information that Members could hang their hat on in  a vote. That process is ongoing. We all would have liked to have seen  it resolved more expeditiously than it has been, but given the  voluminous amount of lies, it has taken time.   What has changed since May is that you have a guilty plea by the  treasurer who was involved in this scam who has laid out precisely what  happened, and you have a superseding indictment, 13 additional felony  charges, outlining precisely what happened.   Yes, Mr. Santos will get his day in court, but for the purposes of  this body, we now have more than enough information from a court of  law, with the guilty plea of his treasurer, to expel him from Congress.   When you can sit with a straight face and say that you attended an  institution like Baruch College or that you were a volleyball superstar  and recite this on a nationally syndicated radio show, when you can  make up the fact that your mother was in the Twin Towers on September  11 with not even an ounce of shame or remorse, you are unfit to serve.   All of us, being from New York, remember that day precisely. I was in  my fifth day of freshman year of high school. The number of my  classmates whose parents were in the building, whose parents didn't  come home, the number of first responders in each of our districts who  still today are dying from 9/11-related illnesses, this is not  something you joke about or you lie about. It is unfit.   We, as Members of this body, despite the political nonsense that just  came out of my colleague's mouth from New York, we, as Members of this  body, have tried to allow for a process to take place, allow for a  process in which the Members of this body can be confident that Mr.  Santos should be expelled from Congress.   That process has been allowed to play out, both in the Ethics  Committee and here today. Based on the conviction and guilty plea of  his treasurer and the admission of the fraud that was perpetrated upon  donors, upon the NRCC, upon former Speaker McCarthy's chief of staff,  that is more than sufficient evidence and information to expel Mr.  Santos from Congress.   There is not enough time to go through the litany of lies that Mr.  Santos has engaged in during his campaign and during his time in  Congress, including just recently a claim that his 5-year-old niece was  kidnapped by Chinese Communist Party spies.   All of us take seriously the oath that we took. All of us want to  uphold the integrity of this institution. We are willing to take on a  member of our party not for political gain, not because we think this  is fun, but because it is right.   I would ask my colleague from New York, name me one time you ever  stood up to your party. You couldn't even muster the courage to  denounce the New York City DSA.   We will do what is right. We have brought this resolution forward,  and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of Mr. Santos'  expulsion.
