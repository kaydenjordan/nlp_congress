 Mr. Speaker, I would like to say our country and our  military are a better place because of Ranking Member Thornberry's hard  work, involvement, and dedication.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report  to accompany H.R. 6395, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This NDAA continues the  Armed Services Committee's commendable bipartisan tradition.   I am particularly happy with the following aspects of the conference  report that affect readiness.   It authorizes over $250 billion for operations and maintenance,  including facilities sustainment and $8 billion in new military  construction.   It reforms logistics and sustainment to better align the Department's  support to the National Defense Strategy while ensuring that  sustainment planning is emphasized early in major weapon system  acquisition.   It extends critical land withdrawals for the Navy and the Air Force  to perform training activities at the Fallon Range Training Complex and  the Nevada Test and Training Range. These are vital to the readiness of  our aviation forces.   It provides the Air Force with much-needed flexibility to synchronize  military construction and weapons system fielding for the ground-based  strategic deterrent system.   It continues to reform military family housing with better  remediation of severe environmental hazards.   These are just some of the important improvements in readiness that  the NDAA accomplishes.   I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for  their leadership to complete the NDAA, along with Readiness  Subcommittee Chairman   John Garamendi.   Passing this bill signals the clear support of Congress to our  military members and their families. If not enacted, these critical  readiness authorities and vital matters like military pay raises will  not happen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.
