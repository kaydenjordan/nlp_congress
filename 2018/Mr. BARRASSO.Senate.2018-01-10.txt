 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, when we were debating the tax relief  law at the end of last year, it was a very familiar debate in many  ways.   Republicans came to the floor with facts and figures on how much  extra money people were going to see in their pockets and their  paychecks. Democrats came to the floor with the same old tired line  that you always hear them talk about--the millionaires and  billionaires.   Republicans pointed out economic studies that showed that workers  right now pay more than 70 percent of the cost of corporate taxes. We  talked about a study by the Tax Foundation that predicted that if we  passed the tax relief bill, the average family would actually see a  gain of about $2,600 a year in their after-tax income. It was partly  because of getting the tax cut and partly because their employers would  then pass on much of the tax cut in higher wages. Democrats didn't  believe it. They said that only rich people would benefit and that  businesses would never share their tax savings with the workers. The  Democratic leader said that ``tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy  and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.''   Here we are. It is the month after we passed the tax relief bill, the  tax reduction bill, and the tax simplification bill, and the question  is, Who was right? The very day the tax bill passed in Congress, AT&T  came out and said it was giving its workers a bonus. It said that  200,000 hard-working employees were going to get an extra $1,000 each  directly because of the new tax relief, tax reduction, tax cut bill.  The Tax Foundation predicted that they would eventually get an extra  $2,600, and these people are already getting $1,000 each on day one.   That has opened the floodgates to other companies doing the exact  same thing and employees around the country experiencing the exact same  thing. Businesses started sharing the tax savings with rank-and-file,  middle-class workers, and it started on day one--not just the wealthy  and the powerful, as Senator Schumer has predicted. Over 120 companies  have said they are raising wages, giving out bonuses, and investing in  their workers because of the tax law. It adds up to over $980 million-- $980 million in the pockets of hard-working men and women around the  country. How many people are seeing that? By last count, almost 1  million hard-working Americans--over 970,000 hard-working Americans  have already gotten the good news.   There is more good news coming every day, with more announcements  today. It is exactly what Republicans said would happen. It is  happening for people who work at banks, who work at insurance  companies, who work at airlines. It is happening for people who work at  big companies, such as AT&T, Visa, and Comcast, but it is also  happening for people who work at smaller companies, such as a winery in  California and an aviation company in Texas. These are businesses and  people in communities who are important parts of their communities and  doing important jobs. The employees work hard, and now they are getting  a share of the relief the Republicans had predicted they would get all  along. And they are not just getting cash bonuses. There is a bank in  Massachusetts called Berkshire Hills Bancorp. They announced last week  that the people working there will be getting a $1,000 bonus and will  also see the minimum wage raised to $15 an hour.   More is being invested in employee development and training programs.  When you invest more in employee development and training programs,  that means people are going to have additional skills that make them  even more productive, better at their jobs, and qualify for even higher  wages.   This bank in Massachusetts is also contributing an extra $2 million  to its charitable efforts, including scholarships. That helps improve  the communities where the workers live and where they raise their  families.   Democrats said it is not going to happen. It has happened. It is  happening every day. They said that businesses would keep the money for  themselves. That is not what we are seeing all across the country.   Ms. Warren, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, went on PBS. The  senior Senator from Massachusetts said that the idea that tax relief  would lead to higher wages was, in her words, ``the big lie that  Republicans have been selling'' for decades. She said that tax relief  was ``an insult to working families across America.''   I would point out to Senator Warren that many of the people who work  at this bank are in her home State of Massachusetts. People have gotten  wage increases. People have gotten additional money spent on training  so they can become more valuable and make even more money. People have  seen the minimum wage in that business go up. The workers getting these  bonuses and raises in their pay are her constituents. Does she think  these people are feeling insulted? Does she believe they have been  insulted by getting a $1,000 bonus and getting an increase in their  salaries and having investments in terms of additional training? Is  that an insult to those people? I don't think so. I bet they are  feeling pretty glad to be supported and valued by their employer.    There is another business in Nevada, South Point Casino. Workers  there are receiving $1 million total in bonuses. Previously, this  business had actually planned to increase the share of health insurance  costs that its employees would have to pay because health insurance  costs have gone up.   Health insurance prices have skyrocketed ever since ObamaCare was  passed. Companies have struggled with how to deal with these rising  costs. Many have tried to pass these on to the employees.   This company in Nevada has said that because of the Republican tax  relief law, they are canceling their plans to raise insurance costs-- canceling their plans to raise the costs. That is more money in  employees' pockets. The owner of the business said: ``We want to be  sure that our extended family is taken care of.'' That is the way these  people think of the people who work for them--as part of their extended  family. That is how employers are responding to tax relief all around  the country, and that is what we said would happen.   We also predicted that one way businesses might deal with lower taxes  would be to cut prices for consumers, let people who use their services  or buy their products keep more of their hard-earned money. Americans  are starting to see that prediction come true in the form of lower  utility bills. Gas, electric, and water utilities across the country  are getting ready to cut their rates because the taxes are going down  under the law. Customers of the power company in Baltimore are going to  receive millions of dollars in the form of lower rates. It has been a  cold winter on the east coast, and a lower electric bill is going to be  good news for a lot of people in that area. Customers are also likely  to see the same thing in Missouri, South Carolina, and Louisiana.   These are the kinds of effects we are seeing all across the country,  in various ways. It is all good news for consumers, all good news for  people at home as a result of the tax reduction, tax relief, tax cuts  passed by Republicans and signed by President Trump.   Americans are getting the benefits of tax relief. They are getting  the benefit of regulatory relief and the pro-growth policies of  Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration. People are seeing  it in their daily lives. The polling company Gallup said that as soon  as Donald Trump was elected President, economic confidence in this  country soared. That is what the polls found. It has stayed positive  almost without interruption ever since. It is the exact opposite of  what polls were showing during the previous 8 years, in the previous  administration. That was during the so-called economic recovery.   Why are people so optimistic now? It is because you can't open a  newspaper or turn on a television without seeing more good news about  the economy. New employment numbers came out last Friday. CNN had a  headline: ``U.S.  [[Page S123]]  economy added 2 million jobs in 2017.'' The Washington Post's headline  was ``Trump's first-year jobs numbers were very, very good.'' Bloomberg  reported that the Christmas shopping season was ``probably the best one  in a decade.'' People are feeling confident. They are seeing higher  wages, they are seeing cash bonuses, and soon they will start seeing  the tax cut in their paychecks.   The American people know that Republicans have kept our promise. We  are cutting regulations, cutting taxes, putting more money back in  their pockets. That is what hard-working Americans have asked us to do,  and that is what we are going to continue to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
