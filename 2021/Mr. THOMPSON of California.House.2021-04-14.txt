 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 172, bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the United  States Anti-Doping Agency, USADA.   Since 2001, USADA has been recognized by Congress as the official  anti-doping agency for Olympic, Paralympic, and other sporting  competitions in the United States.   The organization conducts drug testing for athletes, manages test  results, and pursues bad actors who seek to undermine the principles of  clean and fair support through the use of illicit or banned substances.   This important legislation reauthorizes USADA through fiscal year  2030 and provides a slight funding boost to allow USADA to prepare for  the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, California.   In addition, this legislation requires USADA to devote a portion of  its funding to clean sport initiatives for young athletes and  authorizes the Department of Justice and other Federal agencies to  cooperate with USADA in the course of its investigations.   I am grateful to my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee  for advancing this legislation to the floor, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''
