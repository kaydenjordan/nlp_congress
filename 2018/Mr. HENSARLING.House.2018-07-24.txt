 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1182) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint  commemorative coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of The  American Legion, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1182         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance       Program Extension Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAM EXTENSION.         (a) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by       striking ``September 30, 2017'' and inserting ``November 30,       2018''.        (b) Program Expiration.--Section 1319 of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking       ``September 30, 2017'' and inserting ``November 30, 2018''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to do something I do not often  do, and that is: I have asked my leadership to put a bill on the floor  that I do not support.   I am talking about the bill that would provide for a non-reform  reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program through the end  of November. To make it very clear, Mr. Speaker, I believe this program  needs to be reauthorized, and the House has done its work. The House  passed a bill with reforms last November. Never underestimate the  Senate's capacity to do nothing.   Unfortunately, the Senate has done nothing. But this is a program,  Mr. Speaker, that continues to be in dire need of reform. And now, we  have reauthorized it without reforms, not once, not twice, not three  times, not four times, not five times, but six times since the  Financial Services Committee first reported this bill out. Enough is  enough.   Mr. Speaker, in America, we lost 116 lives last year to flooding,  with billions and billions of dollars of property loss, and, yet, we  have a program unreformed that incents people to live in harm's way. We  should not be doing this, Mr. Speaker.   I went and I visited with those who survived Hurricane Harvey, people  that were close to your district, people whose homes had flooded three  times in the last 8 years, and I heard harrowing tales of survival.  And, yet, we have a program that says, you know what? We are going to  help rebuild your same home in the same fashion in the same place. Hope  you survive next time. That is just wrong, Mr. Speaker.   And, yes, we need more mitigation money. We need better flood control  projects. The House bill had more flood mitigation money than any other  reform bill, but this bill before us has no reforms.   Finances: This is a program that the taxpayer has subsidized so far  by $40 billion. Some of the debt has been forgiven, but it runs a  billion-and-a-half dollar deficit every single year, Mr. Speaker. It is  unsustainable. The Congressional Budget Office says it, the GAO says  it, the OMB says it. It is an unsustainable program. The finances do  not work.   And then last, but not least, Mr. Speaker, it is a government  monopoly. It is a government monopoly when people could, through a  competitive marketplace, actually get more affordable flood insurance.  And that is just not a theory. That is happening as we speak.   In the small little bit of the marketplace that is open to  competition, people are saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in  places like Pennsylvania, and in places like Florida. We had testimony  in our committee. And so it is just rather disappointing that, again,  we face the seventh time of not reforming a program that has no market  competition, and that is fiscally unsustainable, and, yet, we continue  to see premiums skyrocket in the government monopoly.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Royce) and the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Blumenauer  from Oregon. They tried to put together a reform package with the most  minimal level of reforms, and, unfortunately, it did not appear to  carry the day.   I suspect we will soon cast, with an overwhelming vote, a clean  reauthorization, but I don't think they are going to take it up in the  Senate. Maybe I am wrong, in which case, we will have to deal with  this. And I would just simply again ask, particularly for the people on  my side of the aisle--I think it helps maybe once or twice a month if  we ask ourselves Ronald Reagan's eternal question: ``If not us, who? If  not now, when?''   Mr. Speaker, I invite somebody to answer that question for me, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am now very pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is the chairman of our Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee.  [[Page H7127]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), who is the chairman of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee and a very senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of our Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), who is also the author of the  legislation for the reauthorization bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial  Institutions Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Housing and  Insurance and the author of the real flood reform bill.    I am prepared to close, Mr. Speaker. I think I have  the right to close.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, deja vu all over again. This House has been here many  times before. In fact, we have had 41 reauthorizations of this program,  38 with no reforms.   So, a vote for S. 1182 is a vote for the status quo. And what is the  status quo? The status quo is people in harm's way who have homes that  flood five, six, seven, and eight times, putting their lives in danger  and burdening the taxpayer at the same time.    A vote for S. 1182 is a vote to ensure that we continue to have more  red ink as far as the eye can see. Mr. Speaker, $40 billion of taxpayer  subsidies to the program already. A vote for S. 1182 is a vote to  protect a government monopoly.   The ranking member spoke about affordability. Well, the irony is, if  we had market competition, we would have more affordable flood  insurance, but we don't have market competition.   When is enough enough? When do we finally act? If we can vote down  this, we can vote in favor of reforms, which is what we should have  done in the first place. For us to do the same thing over and over  again and expect a different result, we all know, Mr. Speaker, is the  very definition of insanity.   I have no doubt this thing will be voted ``aye,'' but it shouldn't  be, and it is a sad day for the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
