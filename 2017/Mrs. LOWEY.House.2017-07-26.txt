 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank my very good friends,  Chairman Ed Royce, Ranking Member Eliot Engel, my fellow New Yorker,  and the strong advocate, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I want to thank them for  advancing this very important resolution.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 317, which I introduced with my  friends, Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Ted Deutch, and Ted Poe.  This resolution calls for the unconditional release of U.S. citizens  and legal permanent residents being held on baseless charges by the  Government of Iran.   Two of these prisoners, Siamek Namazi and Baquer Namazi, were  previously my constituents when they last lived in the United States. I  have had the honor of getting to know Babak Namazi, the courageous  brother and son of these two prisoners, who has tirelessly worked to  free them from unjust imprisonment.   While the Iranian Government continues to try and exact concessions  with these prisoners from the United States, Baquer Namazi, an 80-year- old former UNICEF leader, suffers from increasingly poor health in Evin  Prison. A man who spent his entire life serving the world's most  vulnerable should not, cannot, spend his final years in such terrible  conditions.   But this is just one prisoner's story. Each of the United States'  citizen and legal permanent resident prisoners is suffering while  imprisoned on trumped-up charges. Each has family members who worry,  every hour of the day, whether they will ever see their loved ones  again.                                time  1500    The United States must do all we can to ensure these prisoners return  home. This resolution sends a strong message to the Government of Iran.  These heinous attempts will not pay off. All of the prisoners must be  released immediately. And Iran must fulfill its previous promises to  locate and return Representative Deutch's constituent, Robert Levinson,  a U.S. citizen missing in Iran since 2007.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank everyone who helped advance this  resolution.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Typically, the Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs, Energy and Water, and Defense bills would be debated and  amended by the full House individually. Regrettably, we are debating  this $790 billion so-called security minibus in only 2 hours for some  reason other than necessity. Substantive amendments chosen at the  discretion of the chairman of the Rules Committee will be debated for  10 minutes. We also expect $1.6 billion in border wall funding to be  added through a rules gimmick meant to prevent an up-or-down vote on  the wall.   The undemocratic maneuver by the Rules Committee to unilaterally  remove Congresswoman Barbara Lee's amendment to debate a new AUMF,  which received bipartisan support in the committee, is simply  outrageous. All the promises of Republican leadership of returning to  regular order have been broken.   I do, however, want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for conducting  business in the Appropriations Committee markups fairly and  collegially, as the minority offered amendments late into the night.   On top of the many procedural inequities, however, the majority's  increased defense spending is a mirage. Shattering budget control caps  would trigger automatic, across-the-board cuts of 13 percent to every  defense account. Yet, the majority pretends the sequester, which would  cut $72 billion in defense funding in this bill, isn't real.   I want to make it very clear that Democrats are ready to work with  our Republican colleagues to raise the caps on defense, but we must  also raise the caps on important domestic priorities. Playing politics  with the bill that funds the troops by inserting the toxic border wall  into it is really beyond the pale.   Why not include the FBI, or the entire Homeland Security bill? If the  intention is to pass security-related bills, securing our homeland goes  beyond the Department of Defense and our own budgets in the legislative  branch.   The Republican approach to funding our government for FY18 all but  guarantees a short-term, if not a full-year, continuing resolution-- just like every year. Democratic votes will be needed to enact  appropriation law, and I really do hope we will soon start to work  together again to invest responsibly in both defense and nondefense  priorities to grow the economy, create jobs, and secure the country.   As I conclude, I want to thank our distinguished chairman, Mr.  Frelinghuysen, and his outstanding staff, as well as my outstanding  staff.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   However, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill which would  waste $1.6 billion on Trump's border wall, use fraudulent defense  numbers, gut critical investments in clean energy, include poison-pill  riders, and leave the remaining spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) who is  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee  on the Legislative Branch.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Defense.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Labor, HHS.    Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), the distinguished  vice ranking member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to reiterate that this  bill is a departure from regular order, wastes $1.6 billion on Trump's  border wall, uses fraudulent defense numbers, guts critical investments  in clean energy, includes poison-pill riders, leaves the remaining  spending bills with no path forward.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think I closed prematurely without  thanking you for your leadership. It has been really a pleasure working  with you. I do hope that as we move the process forward, we will be  able to have a final product that we can all be very proud of. Thank  you again. You have been a very delightful person to work with.   And I thank the chairman, all my staff that has been so hardworking  and  [[Page H6371]]  so cooperative. We couldn't do this without them on both sides of the  aisle. I thank the chairman.
