 Mr. Speaker, where are our Republican colleagues? They are  in charge in this Chamber. They manufactured this crisis. If any of my  neighbors left work before noon, they would be fired.   The country is on a deadline, and the Republicans that are in charge  in this Chamber just simply left. The real mind-boggling part is that  these same MAGA Republicans that manufactured this crisis voted not  once, not twice, but three times under the previously forever-impeached  President with no issues.   Republicans love to talk about fiscal this, spending that, but not  when it comes to tax cuts to mega-billionaires or when it comes to  funding bombs and wars that our country and our world doesn't need.   They are so completely disconnected with the American people and what  the lives of the American people are like. A delay in Social Security  checks would hurt our seniors. Creating instability of whether or not  they are going to have healthcare coverage next week is just simply  wrong.   A default on our debt for the first time in our history would be  devastating for the American people, and they just left.                            ____________________
