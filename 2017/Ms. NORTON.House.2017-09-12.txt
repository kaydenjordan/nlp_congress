 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ____.  None of the funds made available by this Act       may be used to carry out section 3622(c)(2) of title 18,       United States Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and a Member opposed each  will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment prohibits the Federal Bureau of Prisons from using  Federal funds to carry out a law that requires individuals in halfway  houses or on home confinement to pay a subsistence fee.   Currently, the subsistence fee for residents of halfway houses is 25  percent of income. This criminal justice reform amendment would improve  reentry and reduce recidivism among the Nation's returning citizens.   Out of prison and almost always without a job or ability to support  themselves, returning citizens have no ability to pay counterproductive  subsistence fees while in halfway houses or on home confinement any  more than they could have paid for their subsistence while in prison.   For the limited time individuals spend in halfway houses--up to 12  months--or on home confinement--up to 6 months--the subsistence fee  requirement is a substantial burden on them and de minimis on the BOP,  witness that the Congressional Budget Office concluded that this  amendment would have no budgetary effect.   If returning citizens are lucky enough to find work at all, it would  almost certainly be in minimum wage jobs. So the loss of 25 percent of  their paychecks to subsistence fees would be a significant hurdle to  successful reentry--which is what we are after--  [[Page H7267]]  making it extremely difficult to pay rent, child support, or fines and  fees associated with their conviction, such as restitution.   Far from promoting financial responsibility, subsistence fees, while  in custody, actually prevent returning citizens from meeting their  financial obligations. Congress surely did not mean to impose  additional burdens on returning citizens, setting them up to fail. Jobs  and affordable housing are crucial to reentry but rare for returning  citizens. Charging subsistence fees is antithetical to these goals.   The Department of Justice itself has recommended eliminating this  fee. A November 2016 DOJ memorandum recommended developing a plan to  limit the use of ``counterproductive `subsistence' fees imposed on  indigent residents.''   It further stated:         The Bureau of Prisons' process for collecting these       subsistence fees is costly and administratively burdensome on       both halfway houses and the Bureau. And these fees make it       difficult for residents who typically earn minimum wage, if       anything, to meet their other financial obligations,       including restitution fines and child support.                                time  1545    The BOP already eliminated subsistence fees for individuals on home  confinement, but that is only by regulation. However it was a step in  the right direction.   My amendment would continue this trend and eliminate the fees for  those in halfway houses as well. My amendment provides a critical  reform that would help improve reentry and reduce recidivism.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has  1\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, my friend suggests that the BOP actually  collects this $20 million. I would submit to him and challenge him to  show me that the burden of trying to collect these fees does not  outweigh any actual reimbursement. These people have no jobs. If they  had jobs, they would almost surely be minimum wage jobs.   I want to ask my friend if he would rather the BOP be paid the de  minimis cost to the government--which they hardly ever collect, I am  almost sure--or would they rather this money go to child support, or go  to pay subsistence fees?   This is a cruel burden for people getting out of prison at a time  when the crime rate is low. It sends inmates back to the streets, which  is the only recourse they have for gaining money.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 118 Offered by Mr. Latta    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 118  printed in House Report 115-297.
