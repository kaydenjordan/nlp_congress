 Madam Speaker, today I rise on the day that Congress will  compete in the 110th Congressional Baseball Game for charity.   I rise to recognize a local sports team from a high school in  Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, in the heart of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District.   These young men overcame adversity, injury, and people who just  didn't think they were going to win, but they did what we do in the  heart of PA-12 and across our great Nation: they rose to the challenge,  they overcame the adversity, they worked together as a team, and they  won the Pennsylvania Quad A State Championship for baseball, a  remarkable group of young men that came together to make their  community proud.   Madam Speaker, I wish best wishes for this crew of young boys, men,  their coach, and the community as we celebrate the hard work and  success they have achieved.                            ____________________
