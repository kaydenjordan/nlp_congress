 Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  announce I will be voting against Congressman Price to be the Secretary  of the Department of Health and Human Services. Despite some of the  remarks people have expressed, I feel passionately about the fact that  he is the wrong person to serve in that job. I have heard from a  remarkable number of my constituents who also believe he is the wrong  person for the job.   Congressman Price is an outspoken advocate for repealing the  Affordable Care Act, which would cause up to 30 million Americans to  lose their health insurance and put at risk the lives of thousands of  people in New Hampshire and across America who rely on the Affordable  Care Act--or ObamaCare--for treatment of substance abuse disorders. He  is a rampant supporter of defunding Planned Parenthood and denying  women our reproductive rights. If he defunds Planned Parenthood, it  would mean that women would lose access to contraceptive services and  cancer screenings.    In New Hampshire we have thousands of women who rely on Planned  Parenthood as their only source of health care. Congressman Price is  determined to make billions of dollars in cuts to the Medicaid program,  which would jeopardize the health of some of our most vulnerable  citizens, including millions of children living in poverty and millions  of seniors living in nursing home care.   I am especially troubled by the threat that Representative Price  poses to women's health. I urge my colleagues to listen to the millions  of women across America who marched last month in opposition to the  policies of the Trump administration and Congressman Price. Those of us  who marched on that day had a simple and powerful message: We will not  be dragged backward. We will not allow the Trump administration to take  away our constitutional rights and to interfere with our deeply  personal health care choices. Yet Dr. Price's extreme policies would do  exactly that. They would drastically undermine women's access to health  care, and they would turn back the clock on women's reproductive health  and rights.   Representative Price has spent his entire congressional career  authoring, sponsoring, and voting for legislation that would put  women's health at risk. He cosponsored and voted 10 times--10--to  defund Planned Parenthood, repeatedly championing slashing funding and  access for family planning services. If we want to cut down on  unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country, we need to give  families access to family planning services.   If Congressman Price succeeds in making good on this threat as  Secretary of Health and Human Services, it would result in 1.5 million  Medicaid patients losing the ability to see the family planning  provider of their choice.   As Senator Peters said, Congressman Price does not support the  Affordable Care Act and the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that  women have access to FDA-approved methods of contraception with no out- of-pocket costs. Indeed, he rejects the very idea that women should  obtain birth control with no out-of-pocket costs. He said:         Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one.       There's not one.    Well, that statement is not only wrong, but it is arrogant, and it is  gravely out of touch with reality.   Throughout his career in Congress, Dr. Price has been a zealous  advocate of restricting women's access to contraception and abolishing  our constitutionally protected reproductive rights. He has cosponsored  an ``extreme personhood'' bill--so-called--that would establish that  life begins at conception, and he supported a bill to ban abortion  after 20 weeks, despite the Supreme Court's rulings that similar bills  are unconstitutional. He even voted for a bill that would alter the  recommended medical training for obstetrics and gynecology by  preventing grant funding from being used to train medical students on  how to safely perform the abortion procedure.   The policies advocated by Representative Price would have profoundly  negative impacts on the health and well-being of the people in my State  of New Hampshire. Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would have  devastating effects on people in New Hampshire. Some 120,000 Granite  Staters--nearly 1 in 10 people in New Hampshire--have enrolled in  health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, thanks to  ObamaCare. That is an enormous step forward for the health and well- being of the people of my State. Yet Dr. Price is determined to destroy  that progress. Indeed, he seems to have no higher priority than to  terminate health coverage for millions of people across this country.   Make no mistake. Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would destroy much  of the progress we have made in New Hampshire and in other States to  fight the heroin and opioid epidemic. Across this country, more people  are now killed by drug overdoses than by traffic accidents. There were  more than 52,000 overdose deaths in 2015. But statistics can't fully  capture the profound human toll. It is not only the thousands of  individual lives that have been destroyed. Entire communities are being  devastated.   In dozens of visits to New Hampshire during his campaign, President  Trump pledged aggressive action to combat the opioid crisis. Keeping  that promise is a matter of life and death. Make no mistake.  Representative Price's determination to repeal the Affordable Care Act  has put millions of Americans at risk.   I am especially concerned that repeal would abruptly end treatment  for thousands of Granite Staters fighting addiction. The Affordable  Care Act, and Medicaid expansion in particular--what we call in New  Hampshire our New Hampshire Health Protection Plan--which has  bipartisan support from then-Governor, now-Senator Maggie Hassan and  the Republican legislature, has been a critical tool in combating the  opioid epidemic. More than 48,000 Medicaid claims were submitted in New  Hampshire for substance use disorder services in 2015.   Having traveled across our State in the past year, visiting treatment  centers and meeting with individuals struggling with substance use  disorders, I am convinced that Tom Price's plan to repeal the  Affordable Care Act would mean that thousands of Granite Staters would  lose access to treatment, with devastating consequences because right  now, even as we are beginning to ramp up treatment, we have the second  highest overdose rate in the country.   We need a Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  [[Page S992]]  who will respect women's health care choices and our constitutional  rights and who will defend the enormous progress we have made, thanks  to the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid.  Representative Price is the wrong person for this critically important  position in our Federal Government, and I will vote against his  confirmation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
