CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The State-based system for insurance regulation in the       United States has served American consumers well for more       than 150 years and has fostered an open and competitive       marketplace with a diversity of insurance products to the       benefit of policyholders and consumers.  [[Page H6300]]         (2) Protecting policyholders by regulating to ensure an       insurer's ability to pay claims has been the hallmark of the       successful United States system and should be the paramount       objective of domestic prudential regulation and emerging       international standards.        (3) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) reaffirmed the State-      based insurance regulatory system.       SEC. 1403.

At the conclusion of such       proceeding the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such       registration. The Commission may extend the time for       conclusion of such proceeding for up to 90 days if the       Commission finds good cause for such extension and publishes       the Commission's reasons for so finding or for such longer       period as to which the applicant consents.        ``(iii) Criteria for approval or denial.--The Commission       shall grant a registration under this paragraph if the       Commission finds that the requirements of this title and the       rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the       applicant are satisfied.

TITLE XXIII--FIGHT ILLICIT NETWORKS AND DETECT TRAFFICKING       SEC. 2301. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)       2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, transnational criminal       organizations are increasingly using virtual currencies.        (2) The Treasury Department has recognized that: ``The       development of virtual currencies is an attempt to meet a       legitimate market demand. According to a Federal Reserve Bank       of Chicago economist, United States consumers want payment       options that are versatile and that provide immediate       finality. No United States payment method meets that       description, although cash may come closest. Virtual       currencies can mimic cash's immediate finality and anonymity       and are more versatile than cash for online and cross-border       transactions, making virtual currencies vulnerable for       illicit transactions.''.        (3) Virtual currencies have become a prominent method to       pay for goods and services associated with illegal sex       trafficking and drug trafficking, which are two of the most       detrimental and troubling illegal activities facilitated by       online marketplaces.        (4) Online marketplaces, including the dark web, have       become a prominent platform to buy, sell, and advertise for       illicit goods and services associated with sex trafficking       and drug trafficking.        (5) According to the International Labour Organization, in       2016, 4.8 million people in the world were victims of forced       sexual exploitation, and in 2014, the global profit from       commercial sexual exploitation was $99 billion.        (6) In 2016, within the United States, the Center for       Disease Control estimated that there were 64,000 deaths       related to drug overdose, and the most severe increase in       drug overdoses were those associated with fentanyl and       fentanyl analogs (synthetic opioids), which amounted to over       20,000 overdose deaths.        (7) According to the United States Department of the       Treasury 2015 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, an       estimated $64 billion is generated annually from United       States drug trafficking sales.        (8) Illegal fentanyl in the United States originates       primarily from China, and it is readily available to purchase       through online marketplaces.       SEC. 2302. GAO STUDY.         (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study on how virtual currencies and       online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex and drug       trafficking. The study shall consider--        (1) how online marketplaces, including the dark web, are       being used as platforms to buy, sell, or facilitate the       financing of goods or services associated with sex       trafficking or drug trafficking (specifically, opioids and       synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and       any precursor chemicals associated with manufacturing       fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) destined for, originating from,       or within the United States;        (2) how financial payment methods, including virtual       currencies and peer-to-peer mobile payment services, are       being utilized by online marketplaces to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking destined for,       originating from, or within the United States;        (3) how virtual currencies are being used to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking, destined for,       originating from, or within the United States, when an online       platform is not otherwise involved;        (4) how illicit funds that have been transmitted online and       through virtual currencies are repatriated into the formal       banking system of the United States through money laundering       or other means;        (5) the participants (state and non-state actors)       throughout the entire supply chain that participate in or       benefit from the buying, selling, or financing of goods and       services associated with sex or drug trafficking (either       through online marketplaces or virtual currencies) destined       for, originating from, or within the United States;        (6) Federal and State agency efforts to impede the buying,       selling, or financing of goods and services associated with       sex or drug trafficking destined for, originating from, or       within the United States, including efforts to prevent the       proceeds from sex or drug trafficking from entering the       United States banking system;        (7) how virtual currencies and their underlying       technologies can be used to detect and deter these illicit       activities; and        (8) to what extent can the immutable and traceable nature       of virtual currencies contribute to the tracking and       prosecution of illicit funding.        (b) Scope.--For the purposes of the study required under       subsection (a), the term ``sex  [[Page H6304]]       trafficking'' means the recruitment, harboring,       transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or       soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex       act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which       the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18       years of age.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report       summarizing the results of the study required under       subsection (a), together with any recommendations for       legislative or regulatory action that would improve the       efforts of Federal agencies to impede the use of virtual       currencies and online marketplaces in facilitating sex and       drug trafficking.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, two things that are vital to the American economy:  number one, 3 percent economic growth, and number two, competing with  China.   Three percent economic growth, Mr. Speaker, is so important because,  when you look at the history of America, if you look at jobs that are  created, if you look at increasing incomes, if you look at decreasing  unemployment, this happens in our 3 percent-plus growth years, and that  is why it is so great that America is once again seeing 3 percent-plus  economic growth.   But, Mr. Speaker, can we keep it?   There are some alarming trends that we have to arrest, and that is  that, unfortunately, entrepreneurship, that is, launching new  businesses, recently hit a generational low. Companies that are going  public--and 90 percent of the jobs that a company creates happen after  they go public, IPOs, initial public offerings--they have been in a  decline, a 20-year decline, and they have reached a new low.   If we look at what China is trying to do with their 2025 program, Mr.  Speaker, and dominate the world in high tech and then we turn around  and we see that China has over a third of the world's IPOs, America-- our decline is now down to 11 percent--has got to change.   So thus, today, we are taking up the JOBS and Investor Confidence  Act, also known as the JOBS Act 3.0.   What we are trying to do, Mr. Speaker, number one, we are doing it on  a bipartisan basis, but we are trying to ensure that our entrepreneurs  at least don't face the challenge of having the capital they need to  launch their companies, because, Mr. Speaker, when we have more small  businesses that are launching new enterprises and going public and  staying public, these are the Amazons and the Googles and the  Microsofts of the future.   So, again, Members on both sides of the aisle have come together  because, historically, capital formation has been a bipartisan issue  here. We have come together, Democrat and Republican, to make sure that  these small  [[Page H6307]]  businesses get this start. And we try to treat the whole capital  formation ecosystem, from venture capital with the HALOS Act and  helping accredited investors be able to bring their capital to the  table, to early growth companies and how they have to handle the very  expensive 404(b) Sarbanes-Oxley provision, to the stages of companies  going public, but once they go public, Mr. Speaker, the ability to stay  public, and so we have a venture exchange bill to make sure that they  can concentrate their liquidity in one area.   So this is important. It is important to keep 3 percent economic  growth. It is important that America's garages have fewer old cars,  more new startups.   I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, but I especially  want to thank the ranking member, the gentlewoman from California,  working so strongly and fervently and on a good, bipartisan,  cooperative basis to produce the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act.   Mr. Speaker, I expect that we can have a strong bipartisan vote on  the floor, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee, the real leader of this  capital formation package on the Republican side of the aisle, and also  the sponsor of two provisions of the bill: H.R. 477, the Small Business  Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act, and  H.R. 6139, the Improving Investment Research for Small and Emerging  Issuers Act.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chairman of the House Small Business  Committee and who has sponsored a very important provision in the  package, H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chair of our Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee, also the lead sponsor of an important provision in this  package of bills, H.R. 5970, the Modernizing Disclosure for Investors  Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chair of our Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is the vice-chairman of our Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee.   Mr. Hultgren is the lead sponsor of two provisions of the bill, H.R.  5749, the Options Market Stability Act, and H.R. 6319, the Expanding  Investment in Small Businesses Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), who is the chairman of our Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee. Mr. Duffy is the sponsor of a provision of this bill,  H.R. 4537, the International Insurance Standards Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), who is the vice-chairman of the  Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Financial  Institutions Subcommittee, who is also the lead Republican sponsor of  one of the bills in the package, H.R. 6069, the Fight Illicit Networks  and Detect Trafficking Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), a senior Democrat on the committee and the  lead sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the majority whip of the committee and also the  lead sponsor of H.R. 5783, the Cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies  and Watch Act, and who worked, also, extensively on H.R. 1585, the Fair  Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is the lead sponsor of a very important  provision in the package, H.R. 5877, the Main Street Growth Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), who is the lead sponsor of two provisions in  the package: H.R. 3555, the Exchange Regulatory Improvement Act, and  H.R. 5953, the earlier referenced BUILD Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd), the lead sponsor of one of the provisions in  the bill, H.R. 3903, the Encouraging Public Offerings Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Indeed, Mr. Speaker, some would say the ranking member and I can't  agree even on the time of day. I was told when this debate started that  thunderstorms came over Washington, D.C., it was that monumental of an  achievement.   But in seriousness, I do want to offer my thanks and my gratitude to  the ranking member. She and her staff worked very constructively with  us on this bill and the preceding important bill, the CFIUS reform,  which we are still trying to work out our differences on with the  Senate. But, long story short, we came together.   This is going to be an important day for small business. It is an  important day for 3 percent economic growth, which is so important to  American families.   I, too, want to echo how important the work of our staffs is.  Particularly on the majority side, I wish to thank Kevin Edgar and  Fritz Vaughan and their staff for their contribution.   This is going to make a difference, ultimately, because small  businesses one day become big businesses. This will make a difference  in economic growth for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the JOBS and Investor  Confidence Act of 2018, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
