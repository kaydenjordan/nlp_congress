 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator  Shaheen, be recognized. She will be picking up at the end of my  remarks.    Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to be joined  here today on the Senate floor by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New  Hampshire. Senator Shaheen has been a tireless advocate for clean  energy and is the Senate's bipartisan champion on energy efficiency,  alongside Senator Portman.   The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a major  warning last week. Ninety-one authors and editors from 40 countries  reviewed more than 6,000 scientific papers to assess what it would take  to hold global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial  levels. The report says that we will need to invest roughly five times  what we do now in low-  [[Page S6759]]  carbon energy and energy efficiency by 2050. The Shaheen-Portman energy  efficiency legislation would help move us toward that target.   The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that the  bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 650 million metric  tons over a 15-year period. The cumulative net savings from the bill  would reach nearly $100 billion.   My State of Rhode Island is a national leader in promoting energy  efficiency, so we know how good programs like the Shaheen-Portman  reforms are for consumers, for businesses, and for the environment.  Rhode Island has consistently ranked among the top States for energy  efficiency. This year, we are in the top three on the State Energy  Efficiency Scorecard.   To keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC tells us we  need renewables to grow to about half of the world's energy mix by 2030  and to perhaps 80 percent of the world's energy mix by midcentury. Coal  in the global electricity mix needs to be mostly phased out by 2050.   The fossil fuel industry's front groups, of which there is a  considerable legion, tell us that this will raise costs on consumers,  but renewables are now beating fossil fuel power on cost, and renewable  costs are still falling.   In a recent report on global energy trends, Deloitte notes:         Solar and wind power recently crossed a new threshold. . .       . Already among the cheapest energy sources globally, solar       and wind have much further to go.    The Deloitte report shows the top solar States here in yellow, the  top wind States here in blue, and these two--Texas and California--are  in green because they are leaders in both wind and solar.   If you look at the top 20 U.S. solar and wind States, three-quarters  of those States have electricity prices below the national average, so  clearly renewables don't hurt energy costs. By the way, these States  include some of the reddest politically, including Oklahoma, Kansas,  Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa, and Texas.   The cost transition with renewables coming down through the price of  fossil fuel is showing up in U.S. solar projects' purchased-power  agreements. You can see in this chart from Greentech Media that over  time, solar generation costs have come down in line with new-built  natural gas generation. That is what this band is. This is the price  for new-built natural gas generation.   This dot here represents a new project by NextEra Energy to sell  power to the southern Arizona utility, Tucson Electric Power, from a  100-megawatt solar array with an accompanying 30-megawatt energy  storage system for $45 per megawatt hour, right in line with new  natural gas plants. One industry analyst suggested that this facility  effectively took the place of a peak-demand gas plant.   Defenders of old, dirty energy sources paint renewables as  unreliable, as intermittent, but Deloitte's report finds that  renewables have actually proven ``to strengthen grid resilience and  reliability.'' Integrating renewable capacity into the grid has gone  well in practice, and FERC analyses predict increased renewable uses to  improve grid security and resiliency.   The grid operator in Iowa, the most heavily wind-powered State,  figured out a while ago the algorithms to treat wind across its grid as  baseload. When you pair wind or solar projects with battery storage,  like that NextEra project, then individual renewable projects become  baseload power sources. You don't have to aggregate and run algorithms;  that is a new baseload source.   The transition involves batteries, and batteries are booming. Wood  Mackenzie Power & Renewables projects worldwide storage capacity  currently around 6 gigawatt hours to grow tenfold, to at least 65  gigawatt hours by 2022; 2022 is right around the corner--a tenfold  growth.   Costs are falling fast. Lithium-ion batteries are down in price 80  percent since 2010, just in these 7 years. That is an 80-percent drop  in price.   Regulators are adapting. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  just finalized a new rule--a unanimous and bipartisan new rule--for  energy storage on America's electric grids.   One study has predicted the rule could spur 50 gigawatts of  additional energy storage across the United States, enough to power  roughly 35 million homes.   Energy storage is actually coming to market already. The Colorado  State Public Utility Commission just unanimously approved an Xcel  Energy Program to build $2.5 billion in renewable energy and battery  storage, to retire 660 megawatts of coal-fired power, shutting down  ongoing plants for cheaper, new renewable battery combinations. The  request for bids didn't just smoke out this one bid; it brought out a  flood of renewable energy proposals at costs that beat out existing  coal and natural gas facilities.   The IPCC warning was particularly serious and specific about the  urgent choices before us, and we, too, need to be serious about a new  direction to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.  Renewable energy and energy efficiency are our pathways in that  direction, along with a new technology--trapping carbon emissions to  use or store them, even pulling carbon dioxide straight from the air.   These carbon-captured technologies have been starved without revenue  because of a failure in energy market economics, which is that there is  no revenue proposition for capturing carbon pollution. Which brings me  to the Nobel Prize in economics just won by William D. Nordhaus of Yale  University.    Nordhaus aligns with the well-established market economics that  polluters should pay for damage to the environment and to public  health. That is econ 101. Without that, the price signal, which is at  the heart of market economics, is off, and subsidies result. The market  fails. And when the International Monetary Fund estimates the fossil  fuel subsidy at $700 billion per year just in the United States, that  is a massive market failure.   Nordhaus recommends that we correct the enormous market failure which  the fossil fuel industry now so busily protects politically. ``There is  basically no alternative to a market solution,'' Nordhaus said in  response to the Nobel Prize award. ``The incentives,'' he said, ``are  market prices--to raise the price of goods and services that are carbon  intensive and lower the ones that are less carbon intensive.''   The science on this, as I think most of us understand, is firmly  established, and the economics are widely understood. It is the  politics that keep getting in the way--the fossil fuel industry dark  money politics.   ``This is the last frontier of climate change,'' said Nordhaus. ``I  think we understand the science,'' he said. ``I think we understand the  economics of abatement,'' he said. He said: ``We understand pretty much  the damages. But we don't understand how to bring countries together.  That is where the real frontier work is going on today.''   America should be leading at this frontier, not lagging. Lost in our  fossil fuel politics, we are failing in leadership. History will not be  kind with our failure.   It is well past time for Congress to wake up.   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from  New Hampshire, saluting her once again for the leadership that I  remarked on at the beginning of my remarks in working with Senator  Portman to be the Senate's bipartisan leader on energy efficiency.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ryan  Edwards and Kim Binsted, AAAS fellows in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of this Congress.
