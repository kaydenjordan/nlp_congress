 Mr. President, I come to the floor to continue this  debate about the Armed Services bill we are considering on the floor  today, and I would just note for my colleagues that I know that it is a  general practice, but my colleague from Vermont is bringing up a very  big, important point about amendments, and that is that the NDAA is  marked up in a secret, closed-door session. It is not like we all have  a bright light, and we know what is in there. In fact, they held the  language for 3 weeks and then now, all of a sudden, thrust it onto the  Senate floor and then don't want us to offer any amendments.   In my case, I am objecting, along with the Senator from Vermont, as  to a major shift in policy that is in this proposal that shifts money  away from the Department of Energy and onto nuclear weapons, where we  didn't even vote on it. We didn't vote on it, and members of the Energy  and Natural Resources Committee are in disagreement about this, the  fact that we weren't consulted and that it is basically raiding  jurisdiction.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter signed by myself, Senator Lamar Alexander, Senator Heinrich,  Senator Cassidy, Senator Wyden, Senator Barrasso, Senator Risch, and  Senator Sanders from Vermont.   We object. We are members of the committee. We are very senior  members of the committee. We understand the DOE budget. We understand  the DOE responsibilities. We don't think it is right for somebody to  mark up, in a closed-door session, in the middle of the National  Defense Act, a taking of money, basically neutering the Secretary of  Energy, basically saying: You only have half of your budget because we  are going to dictate over at the Department of Defense exactly how you  are going to spend those dollars.   So that is a big power grab by a very few people and certainly  deserves a vote by the U.S. Senate. It certainly deserves a bright  light by the American people because not only are we talking about this  from the perspective of the taking away DOE resources and  [[Page S4101]]  focus from the Secretary of Energy, we are also talking about putting  into the hands of the Department of Defense what has been civilian  oversight--civilian oversight of the production of our nuclear weapons.   So why is this so important, who is in charge of DOE's budget? Well,  I think the Secretary of Energy is. I think he comes before Congress. I  think he discusses with Congress what that budget is. I think he talks  and we talk and we review his nominees and the work they do on this.   For me, in the State of Washington, we have the largest nuclear  cleanup site in the entire world. So cleaning up Hanford from the  plutonium production that was done for our efforts in World War II is a  massive, multibillion-dollar-a-year cleanup. I wish it wasn't that  much, but it is, and it has been for decades.   And people constantly look at that $2 billion and think: We can shave  some of those dollars off. I am here to tell you, you can't, not with  leaky tanks leaking into the groundwater and moving toward the Columbia  River--no. We cannot have people taking half of the DOE budget and then  basically deciding that the Department of Defense is going to decide  what to do with it.   Hanford isn't the only site. There are other cleanup sites--Paducah.  There are still things to do with Savannah River. There are cleanup  sites all over the United States.   To, in the NDAA bill, basically, preclude us from even discussing  such a major policy change that is not supported by the Secretary of  Energy, not supported by the chairwoman of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee or the ranking member, Senator Manchin, whose  amendment we would like to seek a vote on--so I submit to the Record  this letter from my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee also objecting to this language   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           United States Senate,                                       Washington, DC, July 1, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Inhofe,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jack Reed,      Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Chairman Inhofe, and Ranking Member Reed: As the Senate       considers the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization       Act (NDAA), we write to express our opposition to the       inclusion of controversial and far reaching provisions that       would fundamentally alter the Department of Energy's (DOE)       responsibilities for the nuclear weapons budget.        As members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources, we write in support of Secretary Brouillette's       June 29, 2020 letter to Chairman Inhofe and share his       concerns that provisions in the Senate NDAA bill undermine       DOE's ability to meet its mission goals and responsibility       for maintaining the viability of the nation's nuclear       deterrent.        As currently written, the Senate NDAA bill would strip the       Secretary of Energy of the ability to manage some of the most       sensitive national security programs that account for almost       half of the Department's budget. Such changes could impede       accountability and Congressional oversight, as well as       imperil future funding for other critical DOE       responsibilities such as promoting scientific and       technological innovation, managing our National Laboratories,       sponsoring basic research in the physical sciences, and       ensuring cleanup of the nation's nuclear weapons complex.        Sweeping changes impacting civilian control of our nation's       nuclear weapons programs should only be made in consultation       and coordination with the committee of jurisdiction in an       open and transparent manner. The changes included in the       Senate NDAA bill have been met with opposition from the Trump       Administration, former Secretaries of Energy, recent NNSA       Administrators, and the Congressional Advisory Panel on the       Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise.        We therefore request that the provisions be removed from       the pending bill or that the Senate be allowed to vote on the       relevant amendments filed by Ranking Member Manchin.            Sincerely,          Maria Cantwell, Martin Heinrich, Ron Wyden, Mazie K.             Hirono, Bernie Sanders, Lamar Alexander, Bill Cassidy,             John Barrasso, James Risch.     Mr. President, what else is at stake?   Also, at stake are our National Laboratories. Our National  Laboratories do incredibly hard work for us. I know what ours does in  the Pacific Northwest because they are an expert on cybersecurity. They  are an expert on detection. They are an expert on terrorism and  fighting terrorism.   So now, all of a sudden, you are going to let the National Nuclear  Security Agency decide what that budget looks like because they are  going to take more money from it.   Now is not the time to allow the Department of Defense, without our  oversight that we are sent here to give, to decide what this budget  should look like. That is not their role and responsibility.   So the fact that somebody thinks they can stick this in, in a closed- door session, and then jam us, without a vote of this body to consider  such a major policy change, is appalling.   Now, I know that people tried to do this 2 years ago or a year and a  half ago and basically got taken out by the House of Representatives,  but that is no excuse for doing it now. People jam so many things into  this bill. Last time, they jammed in basically the relicensing of a  hydroelectric dam. Basically, written into this for the chairman was  the revision that said they no longer have to be regulated by the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Well, I can tell you, there are lots of people in the State of  Washington who would probably love to know that the hydro system didn't  have to go through FERC relicensing, but they did have to go through  FERC relicensing.   And so the fact that that was in a panoply of things stuffed into  NDAA, in the final negotiation in the House, they couldn't get it out.  So we are being held hostage one more time on the NDAA bill for bad  policy that has not had the broad discussion of the U.S. Senate.   So I would say to my colleagues: If you care about nuclear waste  cleanup, if you care about the agenda of our national laboratories--and  I will tell you, you think people are threatening you right now? People  are threatening us on cybersecurity. People don't stick a sub into your  waters anymore, taunting you or flying aircraft overhead; they  basically put software tools into your powerplants, into your military  sites. We need our National Laboratories to do their job, not have the  money subverted by some agency that we don't see, they don't come to  us--they go to a few Members. They go to the Senator from Oklahoma, but  they don't come see us and talk about their agenda. They basically just  want an increase, and instead of going through the normal legislative  process, they basically are trying to short circuit both appropriators  and authorizers on this important issue.   So if people are proud of that language, if they think it stands,  they think it is the right policy, then they should let us have a vote.  They should let us have a discussion of who is in charge of DOE's  budget because, I guarantee you, most Americans think it is the  Secretary of Energy and not a  five-, seven-member subcabinet level over at DOD.   This is appalling, and it has to stop.                           Tribute to Joel Connelly    Mr. President, if I could, while I am out here on the floor, pay  tribute to one of the most iconic newspapers in the State of  Washington, the Seattle P-I, and one of its noted journalists who is  retiring this week after 47 years writing for the organization.   This newspaper, which was part of the Northwest history for decades,  finally stopped the print edition several years ago, but it has still  been online. Joel Connelly has been an icon of the Northwest, writing  about Presidents for decades; writing about Northwest policy, such as  the outdoors; writing about the relationship, on international issues,  particularly with Canada.   Joel said it best. Once he said about his employer, the P-I: ``We do  our best to inform you, to intrigue you, amuse you, and at times get  under your skin.''   I miss those days of journalism today, where someone has so much  knowledge and information about our region, about politics in general,  about society that they help keep us informed and engaged.  [[Page S4102]]    Joel once interviewed Bill Clinton on Air Force One and obviously  interviewed many Presidents--both Bushes, Clinton, Obama.   He once was a Pulitzer Prize runner-up for his coverage of the  Washington Public Power Supply System, and obviously he covered Hanford  issues, which I just talked about many times, and many northern border  issues.   He probably was best known in his coverage of Idaho Governor Cecil  Andrus and wrote a book about him and the many fights that happened in  the Northwest on land issues for many, many years.   So I can't even begin to explain what it will be like without Joel  Connelly at the helm of political national commentary for us in the  Pacific Northwest.   Nobody sharper. Nobody keener. Nobody more experienced. Nobody who  struck more fear in me when I had to get on the phone with him because  chances were he knew the issue even better than I did, and I had been  pretty studied on it, but that is what you get after 47 years in  journalism.   So I wish him all the best, but I also hope his retirement is a call  for all of us to remember how important journalism really is; that the  tool and trade of people who basically cover these policies, understand  them, and help give commentary in their columns or in their journalism  and oversight is what helps us keep our democracy here in the United  States.   So, Joel, I know you will be up there on Whidbey Island and you will  be watching us from afar. I know we are not done hearing the last of  you, but I know we have heard a great commentary for 47 years of the P- I and your comments, and we greatly appreciate it   I yield the floor.
