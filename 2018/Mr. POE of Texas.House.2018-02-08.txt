 Mr. Speaker, when Anna first set foot on the campus  of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 2014, she immediately fell in  love with the school. Nestled deep in the scenic New York Finger Lakes,  the small liberal arts college appeared serene and safe.   On that beautiful campus, however, was hiding a much more dangerous  reality. Unfortunately, Anna would discover the terrible truth just two  weeks after she arrived.   On the second Saturday of the semester, Anna was eager to go out and  meet more of her fellow classmates. As the night went on, Anna got  separated from her friends. When they received a text from her telling  them that she was scared of someone she had met and didn't know what to  do, they began frantically searching for her.   It wasn't until the early-morning hours that they finally found her,  bent over a pool table with a football player appearing to sexually  assault her. Her friends immediately took her back to the dormitory.  Anna was very ill, pale, and disoriented. Worried that she had been  drugged and raped, her friends called the paramedics.   After assessing Anna, the paramedics knew she needed to be examined  by a sexual assault forensic examiner, commonly called a SAFE. SAFEs  are specially trained to deal with sexual assault victims and collect  forensic evidence through rape kits. Especially in cases where the  victim has been drugged or was inebriated, forensic evidence can  provide important evidence against an attacker.   Anna was lucky that the paramedics knew she must be treated by a  SAFE, but unfortunately, many victims at colleges are never given this  option. To ensure that all victims can have this care, I have  introduced legislation that would require a hospital to provide access  to a SAFE and a university to provide access to a SAFE who is properly  trained to provide care sensitive to the trauma a rape victim has been  experiencing or to have a plan in place to quickly get a victim to a  nearby hospital.   The bill, named the Megan Rondini Act in honor of a college rape  victim who was denied proper post-rape treatment at a hospital, will  ensure victims can access the care they need.   After the medical exam, Anna returned to school and reported the  attack. She was shocked, however, when the school reacted with  skepticism and indifference. Without giving Anna any time to prepare or  even get the results of her rape kit, the school immediately held a  hearing to adjudicate the case. There was no campus victim advocate to  assist her and speak up for her during the disciplinary hearing. The  panelists spoke over her, interrupted her, and asked her all types of  accusatory questions.   So, just 12 days after the assault, the school cleared the accused of  all charges. Devastated, Anna took leave to recover at home. And while  Anna eventually did return to finish her degree, she never believed  justice against her attacker was achieved.   All victims of sexual assault on campus should have access to a  victim advocate. Advocates can offer counseling, legal advice,  assistance during hearings, and emotional support. Perhaps if Anna had  access to this vital service, she would have gotten the justice that  she was seeking.   Mr. Speaker, if colleges and universities choose to adjudicate sexual  assault on campus independent of law enforcement investigation, then  victims should have access to a campus victim advocate who is trained  under Title IX. This is only fair. Schools must be prepared to deal  with sexual assault victims and must have access to a SAFE, and they  must have access to a victim advocate. Otherwise, victims will never  know whether justice is served for them. And justice, Mr. Speaker, is  supposed to be what we do, even on university campuses.   And that is the just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.

Iranians face brutality, imprisonment, and execution simply because  they want freedom of expression and disagree with the Iranian  Government.  [[Page H980]]    Protests in over 100 cities have been silenced by the IRGC thugs as  the rogue regime continues its crackdown on human rights.   The government has shut down the internet and social media.   The United States should stand with the Iranian people by seeing to  it that the Iranians have access to social media through satellite  communication.   If we help the Iranians have freedom of expression through speech and  press, the world will know how the illegitimate regime persecutes its  own people.   Hopefully, the people will remove this dictatorship and have a  government that they, the people, put in power. After all, isn't that  what freedom is all about?   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
