 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans 2nd  Amendment Protection Act, a bill that I have supported for the last  several Congresses.   The Second Amendment is a constitutional right for all of us, but it  is especially sacred to the men and women who put their lives on the  line to protect our Constitution and our way of life. Unfortunately,  under current law, many of our servicemembers who use a fiduciary to  help them navigate the increasingly complicated Department of Veterans  Affairs are automatically labeled as mentally defective--which, in this  politically correct era, is probably not the best way to phrase them-- which places them in the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background  Check System.   This label wrongly denies these veterans their constitutional right  to bear arms. The determination for a label of this magnitude should  rest with the courts, as this bill ensures, not with a bureaucrat, as  the current practice dictates.   Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said,  they have listed some almost 40,000 people who have a clinical issue  who deserve to have a conversation of the 174,000 that are on the list.  What about the other 130,000?   As the other side has also admitted, it overreaches and is beyond  what we should be doing. Their gratuitous offer to negotiate to fix  that, they know, of course, that the current practice of just labeling  folks by a bureaucrat would remain in place throughout that negotiation  process if it were to ever actually occur.   All too often, government bureaucracies fail the very men and women  who fought to protect this Nation; however, this bill is an easy fix to  ensure that veterans aren't further hindered by Big Government  bureaucracies.   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
