 Mr. Speaker, New York State contributes $41  billion, annually, to the Federal Government in taxation. The House  Republican corporate tax bill cut is being funded by tax increases on  middle America and on western New York.   The elimination of the State and local tax deduction would be a major  hit on local taxpayers. In fact, in Erie County, 89 percent of middle- income households claimed the State and local tax deduction in 2015,  deducting $1.6 billion in already-paid local taxes. The average State  and local tax deduction in Erie County was $12,866.   This corporate tax cut is being funded by tax hikes on middle America  and on western New Yorkers and should be rejected.                            ____________________
