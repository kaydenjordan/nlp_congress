 Madam Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge the  remarkable accomplishments of both the Bishop England High School girls  basketball team and the Goose Creek High School girls basketball team,  who are South Carolina's State champs in the class AAA and AAAAA,  respectively.   The Lady Gators rallied from behind to defeat Spring Valley with just  seconds left in the game. Senior Mary Davis scored two free throw  points to send the Goose Creek girls ahead. And then, with less than  half a second on the clock, Shayla Nelson swatted a last-second attempt  to defeat them.   The very next day, the Lady Bishops beat Keenan High School for their  sixth state title in the last 8 years, captured on the front page of  ``The Post and Courier'' back home in Charleston.   I would say that that makes for quite a sports dynasty. It was a  great season for Lowcountry basketball. And as a former high school  basketball player myself, I could not be more impressed and proud of  the Bishop England and the Goose Creek girls basketball teams. Onward  towards next season.                            ____________________
