 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a friend and a  citizen of Fresno, California, Hugo Morales, for being awarded with an  honorary doctorate degree by Harvard University, the school from which  he graduated. It is fitting and appropriate, for his lifelong pursuit  has been in service to others throughout our valley and throughout our  country, specifically focusing on Hispanic communities.   His story is the story of immigrants past and immigrants present. It  is the American story. Born in Oaxaca, Mexico, Hugo and his family came  to this country to pursue what so many immigrants have throughout  generations, the American Dream.   As a child, he worked in the fields alongside his parents and  attended public schools. Despite the challenges he faced, he persisted  and was able to receive a scholarship to Harvard University, where he  graduated law school in 1972.   After graduating, he came back home to Fresno and decided to start a  radio station. Radio Bilingue is what they called it. Today, Radio  Bilingue is the leading Spanish-language public radio in the United  States, serving as a voice to empower Latinos, farmworkers, Dreamers,  the undocumented, and people who are in underserved communities  throughout our country.   Radio Bilingue has been a critical messenger in so many issues and  challenges we have faced over the decades, from COVID-19 responses to  immigration policy, to encouraging participation in the United States  Census, so many different efforts of public service.   Hugo is a pioneer in public broadcasting, an inspiration to many of  us, especially our young people and aspiring journalists in the valley.  But,  [[Page H2890]]  again, his reputation has spread nationwide. Therefore, it is fitting  and appropriate, as I said at the outset, that Harvard University  provide him with an honorary doctorate degree.   I congratulate my friend on his well-deserved honor. He is a role  model and an inspiration for so many. He makes the San Joaquin Valley  proud. I thank him very much.                         Celebrating Dia de Portugal     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a special day for  Americans of Portuguese descent to celebrate Dia de Portugal, a  national Portuguese holiday.   The story of Portuguese Americans is part of the American story,  which is about immigrants past and present--in this case, the  Portuguese community.   As a proud descendant of Portuguese immigrants, the traditions and  values that my family took from the Azore Islands off the coast of  Portugal have never been far from my heart. It is the story of my  family.   The fact is that Portugal is one of America's longest and strongest  allies. It was one of the first nations to recognize the United States  as an independent nation after the Revolutionary War.   As co-chairman of the Portuguese Caucus, I look forward to continuing  our efforts in a bipartisan fashion to advance mutual interests and  strengthen the bonds between the United States and Portugal.   We celebrate the richness and ethnic diversity of all the communities  in our country. I am convinced it is the secret sauce of America. De  Tocqueville wrote a book about it in the late 19th century, wondering  why America could reinvent itself with every generation of immigrants  that came to these shores with nothing more than the clothes on their  back but a deep desire to work hard and succeed for themselves and  their families. That is the secret sauce, the American Dream that we  share in common.   For Dia de Portugal, Feliz Dia de Portugal.                            ____________________
