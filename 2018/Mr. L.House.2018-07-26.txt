A. Leathers founded Brookville Locomotive Works when  he started installing railroad wheels on gasoline-powered trucks. The  company went into full-scale production of gasoline- and diesel-powered  locomotives following World War I.   Over the course of its history, Brookville has constantly redesigned  and adapted its machines with new technology to keep up with thriving  industry needs.   It has also prevailed over many challenges, including a flood on July  19, 1996, where more than 8 feet of water nearly drowned the company.  With the help of Brookville's dedicated workforce, its family and  friends, they were able to restore the facility to 100 percent  production in just 1 month.   The U.S. Small Business Administration recognized Brookville for its  resilience with an award in 1999.   Mr. Speaker, since 1918, the name Brookville has meant quality. I  wish them much continued success for years to come.                            ____________________
