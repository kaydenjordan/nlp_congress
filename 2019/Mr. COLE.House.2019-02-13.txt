 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I want to thank my good friend, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes.   Normally, Madam Speaker, I would be agreeing with my good friend, Mr.  McGovern, on the issue of congressional war powers, and, frankly, I  want to applaud his efforts over the years to reassert congressional  war powers.   It is a responsibility, in my view and, I know, my friend's view,  that Congress has abdicated and one which we must work to reclaim in  the weeks and months ahead. I commit to work with my friend, as I have  in the past, to do just that in the future. But, in my view, this  particular issue is not about congressional war powers.   Madam Speaker, we had a spirited debate on this joint resolution in  the Rules Committee Monday night, and I expect that today's debate will  be just as spirited. The reason is because this measure concerns one of  the most important of Congress' powers: the power under Article I of  the Constitution to declare war and to say when, where, and with whom  the American Armed Forces will be committed to combat.   In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which is intended  to give Congress and the President procedures to follow when committing  U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities and to give Congress a method to  instruct the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities.   Today, the majority is bringing up H.J. Res. 37, a resolution  ostensibly arising under Congress' powers under the War Powers  Resolution, to instruct the President to remove United States Armed  Forces from hostilities in Yemen. Specifically, this refers to United  States support for key allies, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia in their  intervention in the civil war in Yemen against the Iranian-backed  Houthi rebels.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, I believe this resolution is fatally  flawed, misstates the facts, and will not accomplish what the majority  is promising. For that reason, I oppose this rule and oppose this joint  resolution.   Let's start with the text of the resolution.   Section 2 of the resolution directs the President to ``remove United  States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of  Yemen except United States Armed Forces engaged in operations directed  at al-Qaida or associated forces.''   Of course, the problem with this resolution is that, under the terms  of the War Powers Resolution, American Armed Forces are not currently  engaged in hostilities. Hostilities, under the War Powers Resolution,  means firing weapons or dropping bombs.   As we heard on Monday night at rules, the United States is presently  providing assistance to the Saudi-led coalition that falls short of  actual hostilities. We are providing intelligence and logistics support  to an ally, but that is a far cry from the threshold necessary to be  considered hostilities for the purposes of the War Powers Resolution.   This came up during Monday night's Rules Committee debate. I note  that even Representative Connolly, who spoke in favor of this  resolution at the Foreign Affairs Committee a few weeks ago, stated  that ``the United States is not technically involved on the ground in  hostilities.''   If we are not ``technically involved'' in hostilities--we don't have  troops on the ground, we don't have flights in the air, and we are not  engaging in combat missions of any kind against the Houthis in Yemen-- then what does this resolution actually accomplish?    The majority attempts to get around this by redefining hostilities to  mean ``in-flight refueling non-United States aircraft conducting  missions as part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.''   Even if I did accept, for the sake of argument, that this is a  legitimate definition--and I don't--this is still a false statement.  The United States is not currently providing Saudi Arabia with in- flight refueling assistance and has not since early November of last  year. That fact is just one of the many problems with the resolution.   I do point out the last administration certainly did that. It is  actually this administration that canceled that procedure, which it  inherited from the Obama administration.   But even if the statement, again, were accurate, I believe the  majority's resolution raises significant questions that should give us  pause.   Across the globe, the United States has security agreements with 117  countries, including Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Saudi-led  coalition. We as a nation and the President of the United States have  obligations under those security agreements, including to provide them  with support when they find themselves in combat situations. The  resolution the majority is asking us to consider today is putting all  of those security agreements--all 117 of them--into jeopardy.   When the President provides assistance short of hostilities to allies  and to countries with whom the United States has a security agreement,  the President is generally well within his or her rights as Commander  in Chief to do so and well within his or her statutory authority to do  so.   It is only when American troops enter hostilities that the War Powers  Resolution applies, and today, in Yemen, American forces are not  involved in hostilities.   I think that the majority should sit back and think about the  possible consequences of this resolution. For allies around the globe,  this resolution should give them pause; and, for our adversaries, this  resolution should give them hope.   For the first time, the United States Congress would be saying that  the President of the United States no longer has the authority to  provide assistance short of hostilities that we have agreed to under  our security agreements with these countries. For our allies and NATO,  this would put in jeopardy our commitment to the collective defense of  Europe.                                time  1230    For our allies in the Pacific, like South Korea and Japan, it would  put into question our ability to continue to provide support in the  event of a conflict with North Korea.   For potential adversaries like Russia or Iran, this resolution  provides the hope that America will not live up to its security  commitments and will not support our allies during their time of need.   Perhaps most disturbingly, it would put our ongoing security  arrangements with the state of Israel in question. In 1973, shortly  before the War Powers Resolution was passed, Israel was subject to a  surprise attack. During the resulting Yom Kippur War, while Israel was  fighting for its survival, the United States launched an effort to  resupply Israel. The United States military airlifted supplies,  ammunition, and vehicles to Israel, helping to ensure their continued  survival. However, we were never engaged in hostilities. We never  committed forces to combat.   If the majority has its say, U.S. assistance to Israel under similar  circumstances could be put in jeopardy. Under the type of resolution  the majority is putting forward today, Israel would have good cause to  question the U.S. commitment to that nation and to question our  commitment to providing Israel with support in the future.   Should the United States provide Israel with the support it needs,  our allies would have good reason to fear that a portion of the House  of Representatives would try to shut off the tap by putting forward a  resolution like this. I suggest to my friends that they rethink whether  the War Powers Resolution should or even can be used in this way.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friends talked a great deal about human rights, and I just want to  make the point that I don't believe--I surely don't believe they think  that the Houthi rebels in Yemen are great defenders of human rights or  that the Iranian forces who are on the ground in Yemen are actually  there to advance human rights and are defending them.    Frankly, I think this issue has more to do with whether or not we are  involved in hostilities, which we clearly are not.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), my good friend, a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up the text of H.R. 336, the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act of 2019. One of  the four constituent parts of this bill has already passed the House by  voice vote in this Congress, and three of the four constituent parts  passed the House by voice vote last Congress.   The four parts of this bill authorize assistance and weapons  transfers to Israel, extend defense cooperation with Jordan, establish  additional sanctions related to the conflict in Syria, and allows  States to divest from entities boycotting Israel. On the whole, unlike  the resolution on the floor today, it will preserve and strengthen our  relationship with our allies and reaffirm America's commitment to a  peaceful and more secure Middle East.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), my distinguished colleague and the chair of the  Republican Conference.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and then I will turn to my friend from Texas.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his comments. And we do;  we just disagree. I do not see this as appropriate for the War Powers  Resolution, because we don't have troops in common; we have not  committed anybody to hostilities. But the Commander in Chief  historically has had broad authority to assist countries that we have  agreements and arrangements with that he thinks are important in our  own security, short of committing troops into combat. I think that is  precisely what he is doing.   Frankly, that is what his predecessor did. It would have been nice if  our friends were as equally concerned when President Obama actually was  committing us to the kinds of activities we are talking about. I don't  recall hearing a lot about it then, but I am happy to discuss it now.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and the  current ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule and the underlying  measure.   The majority has brought up a resolution under the War Powers  Resolution instructing the President to remove the United States Armed  Forces from hostilities in Yemen. Unfortunately, this resolution is  misguided. United States Armed Forces are not currently involved in  hostilities in Yemen, and it is unclear exactly what this resolution  will accomplish.   Further, passage of this resolution would likely damage our  relationships with our allies, who would have reason to question our  commitments to them, and embolden our potential adversaries in the  future.   I want to take just a moment to, frankly, reaffirm and thank my  friend for his strong assertion of Congress' powers under war powers. I  think he has absolutely been a leader in this area, and I have tried to  work with him on many occasions.   I want to state for the Record, I look forward to working with him in  this area again, because I think this body, under both Republicans and  Democrats, has far too often abdicated its responsibilities and simply  left it to the executive branch to determine when we were at war.   Frankly, when President Bush 41 went to war in the Gulf, he came to  Congress and asked for its permission; when President Bush 43 went to  war, he came to Congress and asked for its permission in both  Afghanistan and Iraq--and they received it.   President Obama never bothered to do that. Whether it was in Libya or  whether it was extending the mission, in many cases, he simply did not  choose to do that. And, frankly, it was President Obama who began the  actions that concerned my friends in Yemen.   So, again, my friend has appropriately tried to pursue, over the  course of his career, the reassertion of congressional war powers, and  I commend him for that. This case is not one of those cases.   The President of the United States does have legitimate powers as  Commander in Chief to support friends and allies short of war without  congressional approval. That has happened time and time and time again  in American history.   We have 117 security agreements with various countries around the  world. Some of those are with countries we have formal alliances with,  some of them are not. They do not commit the United States to  hostilities, but they do say, in certain situations, we will be there  to render support.   I agree with my friend that there have been atrocities in Yemen. I  think he is absolutely right about that. I think, unfortunately, we  didn't talk very much about the Iranian role in that. We didn't talk  very much about the Houthi role in that. We didn't talk very much about  who overthrew a legitimate government and what other countries were  involved in that. This is a lot more complex than that.   But, in this case, unlike Libya, for instance, where President Obama  did commit us to military activity without coming to this Chamber and  asking permission, somehow stretched the NATO alliance to cover our  participation in a conflict within a country that had not attacked any  member of NATO, let alone the United States of America, that was a time  we should have done something like this.   Right now, in my view, whether you agree with him or not, the  President is exercising his legitimate authority as Commander in Chief.  And it is worth noting for the Record, he is actually doing less than  his predecessor, President Obama, did. He actually is the person,  President Trump, who ordered the cessation of aerial refueling  operations with the Saudi Air Force.   Again, there is room for disagreement here. I know, on the underlying  issue of congressional war powers, my friend and I agree. I look  forward to working with him on that issue as we go forward, as I know  we will. But, in my opinion, this is the wrong place and the wrong time  to have this debate.    I think the President is operating well within his rights. He has  made it clear he will veto this legislation should it pass the United  States Senate. None of us know whether it will. But I can assure you  this: that veto will have more than enough votes to sustain it.   So, again, I thank my friend for the spirited debate and discussion.  It is always thoughtful.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, ``no''  on the underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
