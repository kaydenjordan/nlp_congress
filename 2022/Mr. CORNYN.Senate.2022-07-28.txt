 Mr. President, a few weeks ago, the fate of the CHIPS  Act, our collective effort to shore up the vulnerable semiconductor  supply chain, was in limbo. Republicans said we would not move forward  with what was then known as USICA, the U.S. Innovation and Competition  Act, while Democrats were crafting a partisan reckless massive tax and  spending bill behind closed doors.   Then Senator Manchin, the Senator from West Virginia, made a decision  that angered most of his Democratic colleagues--he slammed the door on  the climate and tax provisions and reconciliation. He said:         Until we see the July inflation figures--    Which we haven't seen yet--         until we see the July Federal reserve interest rates, then       let's wait.    He noted that families were struggling to buy such essentials as  gasoline and groceries and added:         I can't make that decision basically on taxes of any type.    That was what I will call the old Joe.   After we received assurances privately from some Senate Democrats,  including the staff of the Senate majority leader, that the tax and  climate provisions were off the table, we were able to move forward  with USICA and the funding of this vulnerable semiconductor supply  chain that is an important part of the bill that the House is voting on  today.   So Republicans and Democrats went to work, negotiating in good faith  to reach an agreement because we recognized that the vulnerability of  our semiconductor supply chain was an economic and national security  existential threat because 90 percent of the advanced semiconductors in  the world that power everything from your cell phone to the F-35, to  the Stinger or the Javelin missiles that are being used in Ukraine  today--90 percent of those come from overseas, and the United States  makes zero percent of them. That was the vulnerability and the risk we  were exposed to, so that is why we worked so hard on a bipartisan basis  to pass what used to be called Endless Frontier. I guess it has had  about four or five different names so far, but it started, in my mind,  with the CHIPS for America Act that Mr. Warner, the Senator from  Virginia, and I introduced in June of 2020.   So we all celebrated with a bipartisan press conference just in the  LBJ Room over here, but then shortly after that bipartisan  announcement, we learned some astonishing news: The climate and tax  provisions apparently  [[Page S3767]]  were never off the table despite what we had been told.   Apparently, Democrats--specifically, the majority leader and Senator  Manchin--just moved those discussions out of the public eye, into a  secret back room. And I pretty much believe that other Democratic  colleagues were not clued in on those negotiations. That is my  impression. It was a secret deal between the majority leader and  Senator Manchin.   Well, as I said, the CHIPS Act was part of this larger China  competitiveness bill passed around 1 o'clock, and it was just 4 hours  later that Senator Manchin sent out a press release that ``Build Back  Broke'' was now on track. After saying repeatedly he would not support  such reckless policies, he has done an Olympic-worthy flip-flop, and  there is simply no denying it.   Let me talk about the new Joe.   It simply can't be overstated how dramatic this reversal is.  Democratic Senators called me and texted me yesterday after Senator  Manchin's announcement.   One said:         I am so shocked and upset.    Another said:         I am appalled.    A member of the President's Cabinet said:         I hope you know and trust that I had absolutely no idea       this was going on.    Just 2 weeks ago, Senator Manchin said he wouldn't support the  climate policies and tax increases out of fear that it would fan the  flames of inflation.   Last month, as we will recall, inflation hit a new four-decade high.  Everyday expenses for food, groceries, and other necessities of life  were up more than 9 percent from just a year ago. Our colleague from  West Virginia said he told the Democratic leader it would be ``wrong''  and ``not prudent'' to move forward while inflation was at a record  high. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for that sense of fiscal  responsibility to fade.   I don't know the details about the secret deal between Senator  Manchin and Senator Schumer that resulted in this reversal, but I have  to say, it was ugly. Now Senator Manchin not only supports the ``Build  Back Broke'' bill, he now said it is his proposal--he, in effect, wrote  it--and it includes the same policies that he previously opposed.   Tax hikes on working families and small businesses, Green New Deal  climate policies, socialist price controls on prescription drugs,  things like subsidies for wealthy purchasers of electric vehicles-- forget the fact that somebody who can't afford an electric vehicle, who  has to drive an old clunker, perhaps, or buy a used car--they are the  ones subsidizing wealthy people buying electric vehicles--it is all in  there.   Democrats could not have picked a worse time to push this reckless,  irresponsible bill. This morning's news on the state of the economy  confirms what millions of Americans have known for months: that the  Biden recession is officially here. Our economy is not just stuck in  the mud; it is sinking. Families and small businesses deserve better  than a toxic combination of higher prices and feeble economic growth.  Instead of helping the people survive this recession, our Democratic  colleagues want to push them even deeper into the hole.   In 2008, Senator Schumer himself, the majority leader, said that  raising taxes during a recession was a bad idea.   President Obama said exactly the same thing. In 2009, President  Obama--in the aftermath of the great recession due to the financial  crisis in 2008--President Obama said virtually the same thing that  Senator Schumer said:         The last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle       of a recession.    And that is exactly where we are.   The following year, in 2010, Senator Manchin agreed with Senator  Schumer and President Obama. He said:         I don't think during a time of recession you mess with any       of the taxes or increase any taxes.    That is the old Joe. That is the same Senator who is now proposing to  raise taxes on families in the middle of a recession.   Now, here is the real joke, but I guess the joke is on all of us:  They are calling it the Inflation Reduction Act. What an insult to the  intelligence of the American people. Do they think anybody will be  fooled? Do they think the American people are so stupid that they will  believe this is an honest attempt to address inflation? There is not a  chance. This proposal is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Our Democratic  colleagues can try to rebrand the ``Build Back Broke'' bill that they  tried to pass earlier this year all they want, but it is filled with  the same rotten policies that will hurt families, small businesses, and  energy producers, while the President, by the way, goes to Saudi Arabia  hat in hand, asking the leader of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to  produce more oil overseas rather than encourage domestic production  here in America.   If this bill were to pass, it would eliminate any chance we had of  escaping the recession policies that Democrats have landed us in.   Families are being crushed by the worst inflation in four decades.  For every dollar you have, it is worth 91 cents in purchasing power  because of the broken policies of the Biden administration. But it is  not the politicians who pay the price; we are doing just fine. It is  the working families all across this country who are paying the price  for Democrats' war on American energy, for example. And they are sick  and tired of being told by Washington Democrats that you can tax and  spend our way out of this mess.   I have some bad news: If the Democratic leader can manage to keep all  50 Democrats on board, it is going to get worse. Our only hope is that  a single Democratic Senator will oppose this massive, irresponsible  bill, and it only takes one in a 50-50 Senate.   Not only will this bill have a devastating impact on the American  people, it will absolutely paralyze this Chamber.   There have been recent discussions about, well, amidst polarization,  there is possibility for bipartisan cooperation, and I have been proud  to be a part of some of that bipartisan cooperation. I think we have  done some important things for the American people.   But the Senate functions on trust. There are only 100 of us, and the  relationships and the confidence that we have that when somebody looks  you in the eye and tells you something, that they are going to stick  with it, is important to negotiating in good faith and building  consensus that is necessary to pass legislation. That is the only way  we can pass legislation--work in a bipartisan, candid, good-faith way  to get things done, like our mental health and school safety bill  recently. That trust was eviscerated yesterday.   Senators Manchin and Schumer did not draft this 725-page bill in the  4 hours between the passage of the CHIPS Act and Senator Manchin's  press release. They have been working on this the entire time, when  they told us it was off the table. How is this Chamber supposed to  function if we don't have at least some modicum of trust in what our  colleagues tell us? How can we negotiate in good faith, compromise  where necessary, and get things done together after the majority leader  and the Senator from West Virginia pull a stunt like this?   The American people are sometimes left to wonder whether our  institutions, including this one, can work anymore. Well, I can only  speak for this Senator when I say: This betrayal is an absolute  declaration of political warfare.   For years, many of our Democratic colleagues have claimed that the  Senate is broken because of the filibuster. They act as though a  procedural vote with the 60-vote threshold is an end of democracy as we  know it. But look where we are now. The Democratic leader is crafting  secret deals in back rooms. He is keeping members of his own political  party in the dark, such that they have to apologize to people like me  who have been willing to trust that what people say--that their word is  their bond.   Look, if somebody can't agree with me, I would prefer they tell me  outright, and then we can figure out where we can agree if we can't  agree in some areas. But to look you in the eye and tell you one thing  and then to do another is absolutely unforgiveable.   Now the majority leader is trying to abuse the rules of the Senate to  pass a $700 billion partisan spending bill in the next week, in the  next matter of days--a bill that was only announced in a press release  yesterday.  [[Page S3768]]    The Senate is not broken, but I am afraid, if this stunt pays off,  Democrats are about to break it.
