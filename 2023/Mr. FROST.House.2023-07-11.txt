 Mr. Speaker, right now virtually anyone in our country can  walk into a store and purchase a firearm they don't know how to use or  store.   I rise today in support of my amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act. It studies weapons training, safety, and storage  standards in the military to see how we can implement them for  civilians.   Through our Armed Forces, the United States has developed a system  capable of ensuring the safety and training of gun users. Look at all  of the steps our servicemembers must take before they can carry a gun.  This is what our servicemembers must go through before they can even  pick up a gun.   Hundreds of people die every year from unintentional shootings. Why  not take our military's best practices in firearm safety and apply them  to civilians so we can reduce gun accidents and save lives? That is  exactly what my amendment seeks to do, and I urge folks to support it.                            ____________________
