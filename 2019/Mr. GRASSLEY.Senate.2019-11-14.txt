 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, a 5-year decline in farm income,  retaliatory tariffs on U.S. ag commodities, disrupted renewable biofuel  policies, devastating natural disasters, and now shortages of LP gas  needed to dry harvested grain add to the growing burdens weighing  heavily on the minds of Iowans and American farmers.   Mounting pressure to pay the bills, to get the crops out, and to make  ends meet can be overwhelming. We have lately expressed lots of worries  and pressures that come from the increase in farm bankruptcies and the  increase in rural and farm suicides.   There are many uncertainties in farming that are beyond human  control, but there are other areas where Congress can help. As a farmer  and as a Senator representing the No. 1 agricultural State, I am  fighting to build mental health resources--as an example, there is the  Grassley-Tester bill to help preempt suicides--to uphold the RFS by  fighting with the EPA, and to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement.   These are issues that are tops on the minds of Iowans and not just  the farmers.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
