 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing  crisis on our border with Mexico.   Last week, the CDC announced they would officially rescind their  title 42 order on May 23. Title 42 is an important tool for DHS to help  mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19 and other infectious  diseases.   Title 42 health restrictions should be in place until we have border  security. Given the number of crossings we are seeing, we are far from  having a secure border.   CBP is encountering more than 5,500 migrants daily. Some reports  indicate that there could be upward of 18,000 migrants per day  encountered when title 42 is lifted next month. To put this in  perspective, President Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh  Johnson, stated in his tenure that 1,000 apprehensions a day would be  considered a bad day.   Over a year ago, I introduced my first piece of legislation, the  REACT Act, which would require DHS to test all migrants illegally  crossing our border for COVID-19.   It is time to work in a bipartisan manner to secure our border; halt  illegal drugs and human trafficking; support law enforcement; and  ensure the safety of all of our communities.                            ____________________
