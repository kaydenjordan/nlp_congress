 Madam Speaker, the left is trying to block America  First warriors from appearing on the ballot in 2024, and their path to  victory begins or ends with me.   They are after the American people, but MAGA fighters in Congress are  in the way.   The Washington elites are panicked. Their savior Joe Biden is a  withering, blundering failure. They feel the birth pangs of America  First reemergence.   What is their solution, Madam Speaker, to stop us patriots from  returning to office? Well, they filed a challenge to disenfranchise  voters across the Nation and block America First candidates from  appearing on the ballot. And they started with me.   I promise you, they will fail.   But their efforts and the deep state's work to shut down Trump and  his supporters will ramp up. Watch what happens to the January 6  prisoners. They will become a nationwide template for what the regime  will do to all of us.   MAGA fighters in Congress are in the way of their agenda, so they  have to come for us first.   But to MAGA patriots across the Nation, pay attention. If they take  us down, they will come for you next.   But take hope. God and the people are on our side.
