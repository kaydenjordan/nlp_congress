 Mr. Speaker, as I begin, I and many others have been  outraged by the President's zero-tolerance policy, so it is so  therapeutic for me to stand before you today and talk about a program  that brings us together rather than divides us. Today I rise to  celebrate the successes of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   The LWCF is a highly successful conservation program, and it enjoys  great bipartisan support. It was created in 1964. It was a bipartisan  commitment to safeguard our natural areas, to safeguard our water  resources, and to protect and enhance our cultural heritage. We also  wanted to be able to provide for recreational opportunities for all  Americans.   It was a simple idea. It said: Use the resources from the depletion  of one resource, which was offshore oil and gas, to support the  conservation of another precious resource, our land and water.   Over its 50-year history, with no cost to taxpayers, it has provided  critical access to public lands for hunting, fishing, biking, hiking,  climbing, paddling, and many other outdoor activities that Americans  enjoy. It has protected critical watersheds, ecosystems that provide  for clean, safe drinking water, and has protected the habitat for our  wildlife. Finally, it has provided protection and access for cultural  and historic sites across our Nation.   Fifty percent of it goes to local and State grants, which help to  build and preserve local and State parks, trails, and wildlife areas.  Fifty percent in my State we have used for habitat conservation  programs and the Forest Legacy Program. The other 50 percent goes to  support access and conservation in and around our U.S. public land.   So, for example, in my district or near my district, really near my  district, we have places like the Channel Islands National Park, Joshua  Tree National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,  and Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. They all benefit from the Land  and Water.   I would like to say that where we are is that we have a bill now. We  finally must deal with the reauthorization, and we have a bill, H.R.  502, that reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and it has  the support of 35 Republicans and 194 Democrats. Mr. Speaker, it must  be reauthorized before September 30. I ask that you bring it to the  floor of the House because it will have overwhelming support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State  of Virginia (Mr. McEachin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
