 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a really tough bill because this is a really  difficult subject. We mourn the loss of Kate Steinle, and we have an  obligation to take action to keep our streets safe. But this bill  doesn't do that.   Our goal has to be to remove dangerous criminals from our streets so  that they don't harm people. That has got to be our focus.   That is why I am so frustrated that we are taking out of a  comprehensive immigration reform bill--which could have done just  that--a provision that would have addressed this issue in a more  rational way; in a way that doesn't go after people seeking asylum; in  a way that doesn't say, ``If you have been convicted of three  nonviolent misdemeanors, you go to jail for 10 years;'' and in a way  that doesn't punish people who are victims of human trafficking who--if  they spent time in our prisons as a result of what they were forced to  do, go back to their country, come back seeking asylum--could be forced  to go to jail. These victims could be forced to go to jail for 20  years.    None of that is going to keep our communities safer.   We ought to work together. I urge my Republican colleagues to work  with us to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform that will  include provisions--like what is in this bill--that are still humane,  provisions that will help keep American citizens safe, but that don't  demonize immigrants.   It is possible to do both. My friends on the other side of the aisle  know that it is possible to do both, and we ought to work together to  get that done. That is the best way to keep our communities safe and to  respect our values as Americans.
