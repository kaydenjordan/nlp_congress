 Madam President, on February 25, Indiana lost a  great Hoosier when Dr. Thomas L. Morin passed away at the age of 76.  Today, I rise to pay tribute to Tom's remarkable legacy as a husband,  father, and professor and to recognize his educational service to our  State.   In 1965, Tom earned his bachelor's degree at Rutgers University,  followed by a master's degree from the University of New Mexico in  1967. While on a full NASA scholarship, Tom subsequently earned a  second master's degree and a PhD in Operations Research from Case  Western Reserve.   For nearly 45 years, Tom served as a professor of industrial  engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. While at  Purdue, he won the admiration and respect of his students and  colleagues alike. As a professor and researcher, Tom changed the way  young Hoosiers think, pushing students to pursue an analytical and  practical approach to solving the world's wide-ranging issues. A  lifelong educator and Fulbright scholar, Tom was a gifted mentor to his  students and a valued member of the scholarly community. Tom is one of  those remarkable people that made Purdue University what it is today:  the national destination for pioneering research and education in  engineering, research to which Tom was a key contributor.   To his family, Tom was a man of remarkable character and passion. He  was utterly devoted to his children, grandchildren, and the love of his  life, Susan, whom he met in 1962 and with whom he remained inseparable  for 58 years. As avid travelers, Tom and Susan toured the world  together, from Las Vegas, to the Sahara and the Greek Isles. Beyond his  own family, Tom served as a role model and a leader in his community.  On behalf of the Hoosier State, I recognize how fortunate we are that  Tom dedicated his life, passion, and knowledge to Indiana.   While West Lafayette has lost a pillar of its community with Tom's  passing, I believe that his work will serve as a legacy for future  generations. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sympathies  to Tom's wife, Susan; two children, Michael and Marisa; and four  grandchildren, Andrew, Gaby, Charlie, and Kennedy, as they remember the  great life of Dr. Thomas L. Morin.                            ____________________
