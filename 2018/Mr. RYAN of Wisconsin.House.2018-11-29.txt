 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express profound  gratitude to the people of the First District of Wisconsin.   Any time I get to swear in a new Member as we just did, it brings me  back to the time when I was first sworn in here in 1998. I remember  just being awestruck the first time I walked down that center aisle.  That feeling just never goes away. I still feel it when I walk onto the  floor each and every time.   I am immensely grateful to the people of southern Wisconsin for their  trust and their confidence. I have always had this thing about calling  the people I represent not my constituents but my employers. It is the  way I have always thought of this, and I think it is important that we  as Members understand that we work for the people and not the other way  around, and that we are in this to make a difference for them.   We work every day to keep that obligation, especially, actually, when  it comes to constituent service. It is the lifeblood of the work we do  here as Representatives. It is something that goes unreported, but it  is extremely important, extremely valuable, and very gratifying.   Any success that we have had is really, in my case, due to our humble  and our hardworking staff. I have had the chance to work for and to  work with the very best people. I really have.   Before I was a Member, I was part of a legion of Hill staffers. I was  a staffer here before I got elected as a Member. I started as an intern  in the mailroom, and I worked my way on up: legislative correspondent,  legislative assistant, legislative director, and chief of staff, all of  those things.   I figured I knew everything about these jobs, all long hours and all  sacrifices, but nothing can truly prepare you for having people willing  to help you in such a big undertaking on the front lines. So I am  profoundly grateful for the dedicated public servants who have helped  us serve the people--my employers--of the First Congressional District.   I want to thank the members of our team who have stayed with us to  the very end: Rebekah Cullum, Jordan Dunn, Brandon Farnsworth, Megan  Wagner, and Laura Wiley.   I want to thank Allison Steil, our deputy chief of staff, who has  been with us for 10 years.   I want to thank Tricia Stoneking, our director of scheduling and  office operations, who has been with us for 15 years.   I want to especially thank the members of our team who have been with  us from the very beginning, from the start. We call them the lifers:  Danyell Tremmel, my chief of staff; Chad Herbert, director of military  and veterans services; and Susie Liston, district director.   Chad is a hunter. He is a veteran. Danyell came from my predecessor.  She knows every nook and cranny in the Federal Government and how to  help constituents navigate their problems. Chad has helped countless  veterans. He knows the veterans system so well, and he has done so much  good for the veterans of southern Wisconsin.   Susie Liston, our district director, has one of the most pleasant and  happy demeanors. You can get a lot of angry constituents walking into a  district office. She handles them better than anyone I have ever known.   Teresa Mora, director of outreach, has run my bilingual services. She  has helped me with all my bilingual Hispanic townhall meetings. She has  done a spectacular job of doing constituent outreach throughout my  district.   Many of you know Joyce Meyer. Joyce was my first legislative  director.   Andy Speth started off as my district director then my longtime chief  of staff. He is my silent partner. Andy and I met in sixth grade  basketball camp at St. Paul Lutheran School where he went and where his  kids go. We have been friends ever since we went to high school  together. When I moved home to run for Congress, he was the guy who  helped me. He has been my partner in this venture all along, and I am  so grateful for his friendship. I am so grateful for his partnership.   I also am just grateful for the people of Janesville, Racine,  Kenosha, Oak Creek, Elkhorn, Lake Geneva, Walworth County, Racine  County, Kenosha County, Rock County, Waukesha County, and everyone in  between.   Since becoming Speaker of the House--which is not something that we  are used to in Wisconsin; I am the only one who has done that--I  appreciate the indulgence of the people I work for who indulge the fact  that I had other responsibilities in addition. When I took on these  additional responsibilities, the people of our staff really stepped up  and really helped serve our constituents so that they continue to enjoy  those flawless constituent services.   I am just so grateful for these people in my life. I am so grateful  that they were able to serve the people of southern Wisconsin so well,  and I am absolutely grateful to the people of southern Wisconsin for  entrusting me as their Representative.                            ____________________
