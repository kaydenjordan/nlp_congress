 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life  of Mrs. Sherra Fertitta of Monroe, LA. Mrs. Fertitta leaves behind a  legacy of generosity, optimism, and intellect after a remarkable career  as a student, educator, and incredibly engaged member of her community.   Mrs. Fertitta was proud to teach for more than 25 years across three  States before retiring in 2010 from Ouachita Parish High School. Upon  completion of her impressive teaching career, Ms. Fertitta accepted the  title of educational director of Vantage Health Plan of Louisiana.  Here, she created an educational series via weekly radio interviews  with Representative Michael Echols for public health education  purposes.   Ms. Fertitta continued her community involvement as a member and core  organizer of OPWRC for more than a decade. She spearheaded many  projects during her time with OPWRC, including an event during August  2020 that safely provided a forum for Fifth District congressional  candidates and voters to interact ahead of the election season amidst a  global pandemic.   I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Ms.  Fertitta, who have lost an invaluable loved one. Her memory will live  on with her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and all whom  she encountered as a dedicated, kindhearted educator.                            ____________________
