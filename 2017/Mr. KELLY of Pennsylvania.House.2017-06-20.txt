 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2866) to review and improve licensing standards  for placement in a relative foster family home, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2866         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Unnecessary       Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act''.       SEC. 2.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         (a) Effective Date.--Subject to subsection (b), the       amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date of       enactment of this Act.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extent their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2866,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on H.R. 2866, the  Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act,  introduced by my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).   Introducing this legislation, Congressman Smucker was joined by our  Ways and Means colleague, Congresswoman Terri Sewell from across the  aisle. The bill has strong bipartisan support, including mine. I am a  cosponsor. And the Child Welfare League of America has strongly  endorsed this legislation.   So what does this bill do? Well, in short, the bill will reduce the  bureaucratic process for placing children in foster care with  relatives, when possible, and is in the best interest of the child.   Now, this just makes common sense. Last year alone, there were almost  a half million children in foster care, more than 16,000 children in my  home State of Pennsylvania alone. Now, there are countless family  members of these foster children who are not only willing, but they are  ready to have these children placed in their homes when one of their  relatives can't take care of them.   As a matter of good public policy, we should be making the placement  process much easier for family members, not more difficult, because it  is often in the best interest of the child.   Studies show that placing foster children with relatives solves many  of the problems children face when being placed into foster care;  moreover, it improves the outcomes for these children. Children are  more likely to succeed when they can stay with a family member of their  own and someone they are already familiar with and know. Children  placed with relatives tend to spend less time in foster care and also  experience much more stability.   The problem is that, while current law allows States to waive certain  licensing standards when placing children with relatives, many States  have been slow to implement the law. One of the purported reasons is  that caseworkers are slow or they simply don't know how to place  children with relatives because of a lack of training on their part.   Today, caseworkers may not be adequately trained regarding their  ability to waive certain standards when licensing relatives. This has  resulted in delays in placing children with relatives.   And when these children are already facing a tremendous amount of  turmoil and uncertainty in their lives, we shouldn't be tying them up  in bureaucratic red tape. We need to do more to place these children  with a loving family member whenever possible.   Now, how do we do that? Well, Representative Smucker's bill, H.R.  2866, will help remedy this problem by making our foster care system  more family  [[Page H4956]]  friendly, by ensuring States take proactive steps to speed up the  licensing process for relatives.   Specifically, the bill would require Health and Human Services to  identify reputable model standards for licensing foster family homes by  October 1, 2018. States, subsequently, would need to do their part by  submitting their plans to be in compliance with model standards for  family foster care placement. Additionally, States would need to  explain how caseworkers in their respective States are being trained.   This commonsense bill is at absolutely no cost to taxpayers, but it  would pay tremendous dividends for our Nation's children. Every child  deserves to be raised in a loving home. The Smucker-Sewell bill will  ensure that many more children can live safely and happily with loving  family members when they cannot stay in their own home with their  nuclear family.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important  legislation. Passing this legislation is the very least we can do for  these children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   My feeling is the National Association for Regulatory  Administration's Model Foster Home Licensing Standards would be a prime  example of what HHS should consider.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), the sponsor of this  important legislation, from my home State and a key member of the  Keystone Coalition.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a minute because I think today is  one of those days where the American people look to the people's House  and say: Isn't it something that they can actually agree? Isn't it  something that they actually think with their hearts? Isn't it actually  something that they can come together on an issue that is so basic, so  simple, and so easy to understand?   We are talking about our most precious asset and the country's best  hope for the future: our children.   As I heard Ms. Sewell talk and Ms. Bass talk, I know in their hearts  how they feel about this. I know this is not something they just  thought about today or this week or thought this would be a good piece  of legislation; they think it is good because it is good for American  people.   Mr. Smucker joined with Ms. Sewell to have this legislation come  forward. It is a breath of fresh air for the people's House. This is  legislation that protects children, legislation that puts children with  their families in case they can't be taken care of in their own homes,  and it is an incredible effort by both sides.   I want to tell you what a great privilege it is to serve with you  today and to be on the floor with you. Mr. Davis is eloquent. Ms. Bass,  Ms. Sewell, and Mr. Smucker of Pennsylvania are good friends of mine.  So it is good to be here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
