 Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Rhode Island and all  across America, people are working harder than ever just to get by.  Wages are flat and costs continue to rise. In fact, just last month,  gas prices hit a 3-year high. It is obscene. Working people have been  getting ripped off at the pump for years.   One of the biggest reasons is that countries in OPEC and other  foreign oil cartels work together to inflate the cost of gas. Some  folks think there is nothing we can do about this.   That is why, last month, along with Congressman  Steve Chabot, I  introduced the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC  Act. This is a commonsense bill that will help bring down the cost of  gas by making members of OPEC and other foreign oil cartels subject to  U.S. antitrust laws and preventing them from price gouging. It  prohibits those same companies from withholding their supply of oil in  order to raise prices.   Earlier this week, our bill was approved by the House Judiciary  Committee. I look forward to this bill coming to the floor and its  swift passage. It is long past time that we deliver some much-needed  relief to working people in this country.                            ____________________
