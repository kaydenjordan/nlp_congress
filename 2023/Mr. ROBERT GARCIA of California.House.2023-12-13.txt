 Mr. Speaker, this impeachment  inquiry is a political stunt with zero evidence.   We are here today not because of any wrongdoing by President Biden  but because Donald Trump wants revenge. Welcome to the Donald Trump  revenge show.   He is running a campaign promising to destroy democracy and the rule  of law and will soon be found guilty of serious crimes. The American  people reject this toxic and disgusting agenda.   That is why Trump's allies here in Congress are trying to rescue him.  They are throwing everything they can at President Biden, from  misleading leaks to outright fabrications and lies. They are even  trying to sell debunked Rudy Giuliani conspiracy theories.    Let's be clear: The White House has provided thousands of pages of  bank records, statements from personal bank accounts, and testimony  from the President's family, but none of this is enough for the extreme  MAGA GOP.   This is all to appease the con man and the criminal Donald Trump, but  make no mistake: The American people will see through this entire  impeachment sham.
