 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Bass for yielding. I just wanted  to stand on this bill because this is an important area and I want to  commend Representative Bass for bringing it.   I am happy to be a cosponsor, but I particularly thank Congresswoman  Ann Wagner. When we had a bill last year, the SOAR Act, Stop, Observe,  Act and Respond, to Health and Wellness Act, a pilot program to train  healthcare workers who come into contact with people who have been  sexually trafficked, they oftentimes do see healthcare workers because  they have either been beaten up by their pimps or they have gotten a  venereal disease.   They might have to go in for birth control or for some other reason  sexually related, oftentimes health related, so that we need to train  health workers to observe and to know when they were seeing somebody  trafficked to stop, to observe, to see if that person might be in that  situation, and then to ask them, and then to send them to an agency  that can help them.   This was an important bill that we were able to pass in the Senate  and make law.   Representative Kinzinger helped, Representative Cardenas helped, but  Representative Wagner was my star, and I want to thank her so much for  working with us and helping on the Senate side, particularly, to get it  passed.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. I also want to mention  that Representative Burchett is a strong sponsor and supporter of this  type of legislation, and a great American.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 752) to amend titles 5 and 28, United States Code, to require the  maintenance of databases on awards of fees and other expenses to  prevailing parties in certain administrative proceedings and court  cases to which the United States is a party, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 752         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  up to 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 752, the Open Book on Equal  Access to Justice Act, a bill House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member  Collins and I have worked on together for several years.   The Equal Access to Justice Act was enacted to allow Americans to  recover attorneys' fees and costs associated with lawsuits against the  Federal Government. This has enabled ordinary citizens, such as  veterans, seniors, small business owners, advocates for clean air and  clean water, and any other type of citizen to fight unfair or illegal  government actions without fear of court costs.   The law has been a success. In 1995, however, an important reporting  requirement was removed from it, which made it harder for the public to  know how much money the government has awarded. Our bill, the Open Book  on Equal Access to Justice Act reinstates the Equal Access to Justice  Act's tracking and reporting requirements with respect to payments  awarded so that American people can have access to this important  information.   It would do this by requiring ACUS, an acronym for the Administrative  Conference of the United States, a highly respected, nonpartisan  agency, to prepare an annual report for Congress on the fees and costs  awarded in these cases. The reports would also include the number and  nature of the claims involved.   In summary, H.R. 752 would promote greater transparency and  accountability. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me and Mr.  Collins in voting for this measure today, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize a lady who served in this  Congress named Cynthia Lummis. She was the original cosponsor I had on  this bill and worked hard on it and was a very fine Representative.   We also worked with a man named Lowell Baier. Mr. Baier wrote a book  called ``Inside the Equal Access to Justice Act: Environmental  Litigation and the Crippling Battle over America's Lands, Endangered  Species, and Critical Habitats.'' He was a great supporter of this  concept, and I want to recognize his efforts as well as Mrs. Lummis'.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, I would like to thank all  the other people, all the members of the Academy and the producers and  directors, but also Ranking Member Collins for his continued  partnership on this bill, which passed the House last Congress and  almost passed the Senate. We always have to remember the enemy is not  the Republicans; it is the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Collin Peterson and Liz Cheney  for their efforts as well. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
