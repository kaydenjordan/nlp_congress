 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Earl  and Doris Sorrells, a remarkable couple who dedicated their lives to  bettering their community.   Earl passed away on January 2 and was preceded in death by his wife,  Doris, last year, leaving a hole in the hearts of many. Since then,  their beloved town of Raymond, Illinois, has shown a little less  bright.   Almost everyone in town knew Earl. He ran a radio show that aired at  5:30 every morning, dedicated to the latest in Illinois agriculture.  Off the air, Earl and Doris and their entire family worked hard running  their small business in Raymond.   I knew Earl and Doris for over 25 years. They were some of the most  generous people I have ever met, giving back in every way to their  community, not only with their financial contributions, but with their  time and talents as well. There is nothing that made them happier than  their hometown of Raymond, Illinois--except, maybe, the St. Louis  Cardinals.   Earl and Doris were very well loved by me and by everyone in central  Illinois. They are missed immensely.                            ____________________
