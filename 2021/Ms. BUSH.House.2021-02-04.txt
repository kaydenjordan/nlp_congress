 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in defense of our  Nation's schoolchildren. I cannot sit idly by and allow white supremacy  and hatred to have decisionmaking power over our students' futures.   To my Republican colleagues: let history remember what you did in  this moment. A prerequisite for appointment to these committees and for  all that we do must be that you love and represent all people.   We owe it to our children and we owe it to their parents to have a  House Education and Labor Committee that is committed to fighting for a  country where all children have an equitable education in an  intentionally anti-racist society. Let me say that again: an  intentionally anti-racist society.   From the Ferguson-Florissant school district in St. Louis to the  Normandy, Hazelwood, Riverview Gardens, Jennings, and University City  school districts, to St. Louis Public Schools, all of our school  districts deserve better. Harris-Stowe State University, University of  Missouri-St. Louis, our tech and trade schools, St. Louis University,  and Washington University deserve better.   Our teachers, our custodial workers, and our cafeteria workers  deserve better.   Our students who don't have a roof to sleep under at night, our  students who don't have running water at home, our students who don't  have enough to eat deserve better.   Those living with student debt and those who desire to go to college  deserve better.   Our parents deserve better.   We cannot build an equitable, anti-racist education system if a  seated House Education and Labor Committee member incites violence  through the perpetuation of racist lies in an attempt to overturn an  election. We cannot build an equitable, anti-racist society if a Member  of Congress endorses white supremacy. We need to strip them of their  committee assignments. And then we must pass our resolution, H. Res.  25, to investigate and expel them.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  being such a leader at this time.   Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to reflect on how our office  experienced the white supremacist attack on our Nation's Capitol on  January 6.    Everybody's experiences are different, and everybody's experiences  must be validated. Everybody's experiences.   I remember sitting up in the gallery listening to floor speeches,  knowing that there was supposed to be a protest happening outside,  seeing people outside and thinking that this was just part of the day.  Until something happened, and I just felt the need to stand up and walk  out.   I walked out and walked over to the steps, and I went down a flight.  I went to the steps and I went to look to see what was happening  outside. I saw the tip-top of flags, and then I saw more of the flags,  and I could read words.   And then after I could read words, I could see people. Then I  realized that people were approaching. So I hopped on the nearest  elevator and left and made it back to my office safely.  [[Page H365]]    When we came back into our office, we walked in, and we started to  see on our televisions people breaching doors.   I remember thinking, Is this actually what is happening?   The more I watched, people were calling this a protest. Let me say  this: That was not a protest. I have been to hundreds of protests in my  life. I have co-organized, co-led, led and organized protests not only  in Ferguson, Missouri, alongside the amazing Ferguson front line that  most people don't even acknowledge--they don't even know their names.  They don't even know who died. They don't even acknowledge the amazing  people who put their lives and livelihoods on the line for our safety,  believing that Black Lives Matter. Because they actually do. And we  shouldn't have to say it. It should just be true. But it is not evident  in our society when we have to continue to say, ``My life matters.''   And then they hit us with things like this. So I remember sitting in  the office with my team and just thinking to myself, I feel like I am  back. At this very minute, I feel like I am back. I feel like this was  one of the days out there on the streets when the white supremacists  would show up and start shooting at us. This is one of the days when  the police would ambush us from behind, from behind trees and from  behind buildings, and all of a sudden now we are on the ground being  brutalized. It felt like one of those days.   And I just remember taking a second thinking, if they touch these  doors, if they hit these doors the way they hit that door, if they hit  these doors and come anywhere near my staff--and I am just going to be  real honest about it--my thought process was, we banging to the end. I  am not letting them take out my people, and you are not taking me out.  We have come too far.   So, Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise with a message for our  Republican colleagues. On January 6, I thought about January 3, and I  thought about how we all raised our right hands up and took an oath,  each and every one of us, on this very floor. We swore that we would  support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all  enemies, foreign and domestic.   Even though that Constitution wasn't written for people who look like  me, even though that Constitution wasn't written by people who look  like me, and even though that Constitution cemented an unjust nation  for people like me, my team and I got to working. We unveiled  legislation to investigate and expel those who were responsible for  inciting this attack so that we could defend it because we have a duty  to fight for a more perfect Union.   Because if you cannot stand up to white supremacy in this moment as  Representatives, then why did you run for office in the first place?   No matter what district you represent, no matter where you live, no  matter Democrat or Republican, you represent a district that is, on  average, about 700,000 people. Meaning, you have to represent those who  love you, those who despise you, those who voted for you, those who  swear they will never cast a vote for you, people who talk like you or  people who don't look like you.   Building better communities, building better lives, building a better  society is not a Democratic or Republican issue. We can't build a  better society if Members are too scared to stand up and act to reject  the white supremacist attack that happened right before our eyes.   How can we trust that you will address the suffering that white  supremacy causes on a day-to-day basis in the shadows if you can't even  address the white supremacy that happens right in front of you in your  House?   Does your silence speak to your agreement, is the question.   In St. Louis, the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately  hospitalizing and killing Black and Brown people. I have lived that. We  have people dying from gun violence, a crisis that stems from decades  of economic disinvestment and disruption from an overreliance on  policing that this very Chamber has continually voted to endorse.                                time  2000    I have cried those tears. You don't know what that is like. So I ask  you today, take a moment to think about what it is like to live what we  live through. If you cannot do what is right in the face of a blatant,  heinous, foul, white supremacist attack like the one we just saw, how  will you do right by the Black and Brown people you represent who just  want to know that our children will have safety, that our children will  have life, and that they will have shelter, because you represent us,  too.   So on January 3, we stood together to swear our oath of office to the  Constitution. We swore to defend it against all enemies foreign and  domestic. Well, it was attacked by a domestic enemy called white  supremacy and we must stand together now, today, to uphold that oath  and hold every single person who helped incite it accountable.
