 Mr. President, most Americans know that there are two  sexes, male and female, and that sex is rooted in science. Most  Americans also know that we ought to treat all people, including those  who feel conflicted about their gender, with respect and dignity,  without sacrificing the truth in the process.   These beliefs are now under attack from some of the most powerful  corporations in the history of the world. Just a few weeks ago, while  House Democrats were passing their far-left Equality Act, the leftwing  media was busy canceling Dr. Seuss, Amazon quietly erased a book from  its online store without notice, without warning, without explanation.  That book is ``When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender  Moment by Ryan Anderson.''   Amazon claims it banned this book for violating its brandnew policy  on ``hate speech.'' Of course, that excuse is arbitrary and patently  false. You can go to Amazon right now--right now you can go to Amazon  on your phone or on your computer and buy copies of actually hateful  books. You can get Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' shipped to your door with  free Amazon Prime delivery. You can get the ``Unabomber Manifesto,''  written by a serial killer who murdered 3 people and maimed 23 others.  You can even get ``How to Blow up a Pipeline.'' I assume the title  speaks for itself. All those books are available for purchase on Amazon  right now, one click away. But Amazon wants you to believe that a  conservative book is somehow beyond the pale, unacceptably hateful,  literally worse than Hitler, as they like to say.   My office asked Amazon to send us the exact passages from ``When  Harry Became Sally'' that it deemed so hateful that it couldn't even  sell the book on its website. Shocking surprise, I know, they never got  back to us. That is because the book doesn't say anything hateful. To  the contrary, the book makes very clear that we should treat people who  feel conflicted about their gender with the same respect and compassion  that are due to all people. To quote the author, ``We should have  abundant compassion and charity and patience with people who feel this  form of alienation. But we also need to insist on telling the truth . .  . ''   That is not hate. That is far from it. The author's real offense, his  only offense, was telling the truth. He said calmly and compassionately  that boys are boys and girls are girls. And the richest man in the  world banned his book from his company's platform.   But, of course, you don't have to agree with the commonsense historic  understanding of gender in order to acknowledge how dangerous it is for  one of the biggest corporations in the history of the world to start  banning books because while Amazon's censorship may start with  conservative views, it could easily mutate to censor other views that  offend Jeff Bezos and his bottom line. Perhaps Amazon will come after  union organizers next since they are trying to bust up a union election  in Alabama or maybe environmental activists or maybe trustbusters,  since so many people are talking about potential antitrust violations  in the world of Big Tech.   And even if Amazon goes only this far and no further, the damage of  free  [[Page S1410]]  speech has already been done. Books like ``When Harry Became Sally''  won't get published anymore. Writers who hold unfashionable opinions  that just a few days ago were considered basic mainstream views of a  large majority of Americans, may decide to self-censor, stay silent.   The virtual book burning may spread to other companies. Maybe Amazon  will put a book burning app on its Kindle so readers can drag books  from its catalog into the virtual bonfire.   Political correctness will only grow more oppressive if its  enforcers, like Amazon, don't face some consequences for their actions.  Amazon, for instance, makes billions of dollars each year hosting  websites and storing data for the government. Almost all of Amazon's  profit is made in these enterprise services, not in its consumer-facing  retail business. Those are our tax dollars flowing to a company that  uses its power to censor the beliefs of a large majority of Americans.  Perhaps it is time for lawmakers to reconsider whether these contracts  are in the best interest of our country.   I also note Amazon is the country's largest bookseller, selling three  out of every four e-books in America. It is time for lawmakers to  evaluate whether Amazon's practices are consistent with our antitrust  laws or whether antitrust laws need to be updated to address this type  of behavior from a monopolistic firm. We better hurry, though, because  maybe they will ban all books on antitrust and monopoly behavior before  we have a chance to study the question.   I will close by quoting from the book that Amazon banned, which  predicted the very events we are witnessing here today:         If trans activists succeed in their political agenda, our       nation's children will be indoctrinated in a harmful       ideology, and some will live by its own lies about their own       bodies, at great harm to themselves physically,       psychologically, and socially. Lives will be ruined, but       pointing out the damage will be forbidden. Dissent from the       transgender worldview will be punished in schools,       workplaces, and medical clinics. Trying to live in accordance       with the truth will be made harder.    This is not a fight over hate or bigotry, respect or compassion. It  is a battle over truth itself, the truth of who we are as human beings  and the fundamental freedom to speak that truth or any other truth  without fear.   Throughout our history, Americans have never surrendered to an  oppressive tyranny of opinion, whether a majority or, in this case, a  small but highly influential minority, and we won't be cowed in silence  today. We will fight for what is true. We will fight for the freedom to  say it. No matter what the cultural forces arrayed against us do, we  will never back down.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
