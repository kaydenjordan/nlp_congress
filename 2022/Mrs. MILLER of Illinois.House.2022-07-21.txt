 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   In just one week, House Democrats have managed to bypass the wishes  of the American people and pass radical legislation that permits  abortion through the ninth month, assures payouts to Planned  Parenthood, attacks the traditional family, and eliminates medical  supervision for chemical abortion pills.   The American people who overwhelmingly oppose abortion through the  third trimester are appalled by the radical leftwing agenda put forth  by the Speaker. House Democrats are pushing an extreme leftwing agenda.  They are trying to distract from the surging gas prices, record  inflation, and the crisis at the border, which they created.   It took less than 2 years for woke leftists to destroy the American  economy, which was booming under President Trump's leadership. These  same leftists have also openly advocated for open borders, transgender  surgeries on  [[Page H6947]]  teens, and removing the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.   All of these initiatives are deeply unpopular with the American  people, and I will also vote ``no'' on the radical agenda of the left.
