Mr. Speaker, today, we have  more questions than answers about profoundly disturbing ties between  the President-elect and shadowy Russian influences.   The American people deserve full disclosure about any financial or  personal interests held over this incoming administration by foreign  entities and potential collusion to undermine our democracy.   Why has Mr. Trump failed to oppose Russia's forceful annexation of  Crimea?   Why did he pressure his party to officially withdraw a plank calling  for assistance to Ukraine?   Why did Mr. Trump reflexively attack our own intelligence officials  when they warned of Russian interference in the election?   Why is he avoiding regular intelligence briefings?   Now that our intelligence community has concretely confirmed that  Russia meddled in our democracy, we must demand to know if there has  been any undue influence on Mr. Trump since he began his campaign.  These new allegations finally shed light on his potential motives.   Mr. Speaker, Congress, as a coequal branch of government, must  conduct a bipartisan investigation and do it immediately.                            ____________________
