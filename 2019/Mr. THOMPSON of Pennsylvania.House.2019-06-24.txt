 Mr. Speaker, today, I welcome Cindy Lam  to the Capitol. Cindy is the winner of Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District Congressional Art Competition.   The annual art competition organized by the Congressional Institute  showcases the artwork of high school students from across every  congressional district in the country.   Cindy just finished up her sophomore year at DuBois Area Senior High  School earlier this month. Her artwork entitled ``Self'' is a prism- colored pencil drawing.   Cindy's artwork was selected, by an independent panel of judges, from  68 entries, which is one of the largest groups of students to  participate in the 15th District's Congressional Art Competition. All  the winning pieces will be displayed for the year in the Cannon tunnel,  where they will be viewed by Members of Congress, staff, and many  visitors of the Capitol every day.   Today, Cindy is participating in a reception where she and fellow  winners from across the country will be honored for their talented  work.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Cindy and all the students who  participated in the competition.                            ____________________
