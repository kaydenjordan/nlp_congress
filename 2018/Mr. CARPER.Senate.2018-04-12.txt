 Mr. President, they say that a man or woman's word is his  bond. When the Environment and Public Works Committee voted on the  nomination of Andrew Wheeler, someone I have known for 25 years or  more, I was very clear about my desire to help smooth the way to a  faster floor process. I was very clear that what I needed, and what we  needed, was an assurance from EPA that it would respect settled law,  that it would respect EPA actions and court decisions that found that  global warming pollution from cars and SUVs is a danger to our Nation,  to our citizens, and to our planet.   What I asked for was an assurance from Scott Pruitt that he would do  what the auto industry has asked him to do, which is to negotiate an  agreement on vehicle standards for the State of California. I worked  with Bill Wehrum, the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and  Radiation, for weeks, and we reached an agreement that I was told  Administrator Pruitt supported until Scott Pruitt reneged on the deal  and decided he might prefer fighting and litigation to cooperating and  negotiating.   Let me be clear, I tried to work with the EPA. I believed that  perhaps in just this one instance we could find a win-win. There is one  that is right there to be grasped. But Administrator Pruitt ignored his  own top air official.   Let me close, if I can.    Whatever Mr. Wheeler's qualifications, he cannot solve  this problem alone at EPA, which is that Scott Pruitt has no interest  in governing, no interest in leaving a lasting and responsible legacy,  and no interest in working with anyone who doesn't enable him to act on  his own worst instincts.    I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, we are here today primarily to discuss the  nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Deputy Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency. Before I turn to Andrew Wheeler, I  want to spend a few minutes talking about our current EPA  Administrator.   Recent reports of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's ethical  shortcomings and lavish spending on the American taxpayers' dime are  breathtaking, but they should come as no surprise. Just over a year  ago, I stood at the very same spot where I stand today to discuss Mr.  Pruitt's nomination. Last February, I said that never before had I been  forced to consider a candidate to lead the EPA who had been so focused  throughout his career on crippling the very Agency he sought to lead or  so hostile to the basic protections that keep Americans and our  environment safe.   At the same time, I warned our colleagues that based on his record as  attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt had an unacceptably casual  approach to meeting obligations as a public servant. Unfortunately,  with respect to too many of my colleagues, that warning fell on deaf  ears.   In the 15 months since he was confirmed--narrowly confirmed--Mr.  Pruitt has proven to be an even worse leader than I imagined on a  policy front but also with regard to one ethical failing after another,  as well as his disregard for the American taxpayers.   The Presiding Officer and I have spent large portions of our lives  serving our country in uniform--he as a marine, me as a naval flight  officer. I was a midshipman for 4 years before being commissioned,  served 5 years in the war in Southeast Asia, and 18 years at the end of  the Cold War as a P-3 aircraft mission commander.   From the age of 11, I was trained to be a leader. My guess is, my  colleague was also. I was a Boy Scout, Civil Air Patrol cadet, naval  ROTC midshipman, served 5 years on Active Duty, and another 18 years as  a Reserve flight officer. If I don't know something about leadership,  it is my fault. I have had great mentors, great role models. I was  trained as a leader since the age of 11.   I want to mention this about leadership. Leaders are humble, not  haughty. Leaders are servants. Our job is to serve, not be served. We  lead by example. Leaders stay out of step when everybody else is  marching to the wrong tune. Leaders put the best team around them that  they can find. When the team does well, the leader gives credit to the  team. If the team falls short, the leader takes the blame.   Leaders are aspirational. They appeal to our better instincts. They  are purveyors of hope. Leaders build bridges, not walls. Leaders focus  on doing what is right--not what is easy or what is expedient but what  is right. Leaders treat other people the way they want to be treated.  They actually embody the Golden Rule.   Leaders focus on excellence in everything they do. If it isn't  perfect, they say: Let's make it better. Let's work with other people  to make it better. When leaders know they are right, are convinced they  are right, and other people realize they are right, leaders don't give  up.   I knew 13 or 14 months ago what kind of steward Scott Pruitt would be  with respect to protecting our air, our water, our public health. I had  no idea--no idea--what kind of leader he would prove to be with respect  to ethical behavior or misbehavior. What a shame. What a shame.   Over the last 2 weeks, we have been barely able to go a day without  learning new and increasingly troubling information about the  Administrator's failures to conduct himself in a way a public servant,  working on behalf of the American people, should behave.   His poor financial judgment and serious ethical lapses make it clear  that he is unfit for office. Setting aside his lack of stewardship on  environmental issues, he should have never been confirmed in the first  place.   Administrator Pruitt's conduct is emblematic of an extraordinarily  and ethically tone-deaf administration. There are some good people in  this administration, a number of them. Our Presiding Officer knows  them, and I know them. Unfortunately, one of them is not running the  Environmental Protection Agency, where lavish trips, extravagant office  furniture, and personal favors are the norm, not the exception.   President Trump said he was going to drain the swamp. Scott Pruitt is  the definition of what I recently heard one person call a swamp  creature, with his close ties to polluters, misuse of taxpayer money,  and corrupt dealings.   Should the Senate confirm Andrew Wheeler, we will be setting him on a  course to address not just these recent allegations but these  occurrences, these terrible examples.   As of today, Administrator Pruitt faces growing bipartisan calls for  his firing or resignation amid nearly 25 ethics and improper  expenditure allegations--25--and growing.   This is 2 weeks of turmoil. This chart is the cliff notes version.  There is more. It is not anything to be proud of. It is a lot to be  ashamed of--excessive raises for political appointees who came with him  from Oklahoma and unprecedented security requirements are just a few of  his growing collection of scandals that have made headlines almost  every day in recent weeks.   Since his confirmation, Administrator Pruitt has developed a taste  for the finer things in life, particularly when the American taxpayer  is picking up the tab. Mr. Pruitt has been broadly criticized for his  lavish spending of taxpayer dollars on various flights in his first  year as EPA Administrator, including international trips, first-class  flights, weekend trips home to Oklahoma, and chartered military jets.   Mr. Pruitt somehow managed to spend over $1,600 on a flight from  Washington, DC, to New York City last year. It takes real effort to  find a seat that expensive. My offer to Mr. Pruitt still stands; that  the Administrator join me on Amtrak and save a ton of money.   Administrator Pruitt took a $40,000 trip to Morocco in December 2017  to promote liquefied natural gas--an issue that is not within his  Agency's jurisdiction. On his way to Morocco, Administrator Pruitt  missed two flights while staying in Paris for 2 days. Reports also  indicate that Administrator Pruitt spent $120,000 on a trip to Italy  last June, including $30,000 in security-related expenses, $53,000 in  travel vouchers, and a $36,000 chartered flight from Cincinnati to New  York City to catch his international flight. A $36,000 chartered flight  from Cincinnati to New York City--really?   Mr. Pruitt has spent more than $105,000 in first-class flights during  his first year alone in office. When confronted with the exorbitant  pricetag on his first-class travel, the Agency said Mr. Pruitt's first- class travel was necessary--listen to this--because of the high number  of security threats he had received. If that were truthful, we should  all be concerned. There are a lot of reasons to believe it is not  truthful.   He apparently did not consider a first-class upgrade to be vital to  his safety while flying on his own dime, since Administrator Pruitt  flew coach on personal trips back home to Oklahoma.   Administrator Pruitt is also facing scrutiny for assembling a team of  20 security agents deployed in 19 vehicles--20 security agents deployed  in 19 vehicles--who provided an unprecedented 24/7 level of protection.  Administrator Pruitt's unprecedented domestic and international travel  has led to rapidly escalating costs, with his around-the-clock security  detail racking up so  [[Page S2089]]  much overtime--get this--that many hit their annual salary caps of  $160,000.   CNN has reported that the demands of providing the Administrator with  the 24/7 security coverage he desired meant taking some investigators  from their field work.   The New York Times reported that Administrator Pruitt asked his  security team to use his vehicle's emergency lights and sirens to speed  through traffic en route to a French restaurant right here in  Washington, DC, to celebrate the President's withdrawing from the Paris  climate agreement. And when the security agent advised Mr. Pruitt that  sirens were only to be used in an emergency, the agent was reassigned  less than 2 weeks later.    The Washington Post reported that Administrator Pruitt also sought a  $100,000-a-month private jet membership, a bulletproof SUV with run- flat tires, and $70,000 for office furniture, including a bulletproof  desk.   I am not sure where Administrator Pruitt thinks he works, but his  security detail has cost the American taxpayers nearly $3 million  during his tenure--$3 million--roughly three times that of his  predecessor Gina McCarthy.   Related to Administrator Pruitt's apparent privacy concerns, he felt  the need for taxpayers to pay for him to install a private, soundproof,  $43,000 phone booth in his office at EPA headquarters. He added $6,000  biometric locks to the booth, paid $3,000 to have his office swept for  bugs, and described his soundproof booth as a sensitive compartmented  information facility. No other EPA Administrator in history felt the  need for such a booth. I am not aware of any Cabinet Secretary who has  felt that kind of need.   Earlier this week, Administrator Pruitt removed a career staffer who  approved an internal report that undermined Mr. Pruitt's claims that he  needed to fly first class, a 24/7 security detail, a bulletproof desk,  and other unprecedented security protections. The career staffer who  questioned those expenditures, who approved the internal report  discussing them, was removed.   Reports have also surfaced that Administrator Pruitt bypassed the  White House to hire ex-lobbyists and sidestep President Trump's promise  to drain the swamp and require appointees to sign an ethics pledge.  Utilizing an obscure provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act intended  to let the Agency quickly hire senior management and scientific  personnel, Mr. Pruitt instead used his authority to skirt the ethics  pledge and increase the number of ex-lobbyists who could work on issues  of importance to their previous clients with impunity.   It goes on. Mr. Pruitt used this same authority to again bypass the  White House and grant significant raises to favored staff.   After the White House refused to boost the pay of those favored  staff, Administrator Pruitt reappointed both staffers under the Safe  Drinking Water Act authority, allowing him to set salary levels  himself. A 30-year-old senior counsel who worked for Pruitt in Oklahoma  was given a raise of approximately $56,000 a year--$56,000 a year. That  raise is just $1,000 short of the annual median household income for  our country. Mr. Pruitt's 26-year-old director of scheduling of events  got a pay bump too--almost $30,000.   On his interview with FOX News last week, Mr. Pruitt denied knowledge  of the raises, but recently reported emails among EPA staff indicated  that Mr. Pruitt was aware and personally involved with at least one of  those raises.   Perhaps the most troubling among the litany of questionable financial  expenditures and ethical lapses Mr. Pruitt has exhibited during his  time as Administrator are recent reports that say he demoted,  reassigned, or pushed out staff who tried to curtail his spending or  question his ethical misbehavior.   The New York Times reported 2 weeks ago that at least five  officials--both career EPA employees and one political appointee, four  of them high-ranking--were reassigned, demoted, or pushed out after  they raised concerns about Mr. Pruitt's excessive spending and  mismanagement.   Just yesterday we learned that Mr. Pruitt wanted to revamp EPA  memorabilia to, of all things, more prominently highlight himself. That  is not what leadership or public service are supposed to be.   The list goes on. Almost every day a new scandal emerges, and Mr.  Pruitt's alleged actions and ethical shortcomings surpass what many of  us thought even possible. Yet he continues to serve the American people  as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Unfortunately, this outcome was predictable. I hope to go to a  baseball game in Delaware tonight, the home opener for the Wilmington  Blue Rocks, the Kansas City Royals' farm club. Some of the pitchers are  going to throw a pitch tonight, and the pitch will be well telegraphed.  That means the hitters can sort of guess what is coming their way.   Well, this outcome was predictable. This pitch was well telegraphed.  When the Senate confirms a candidate who has focused throughout his  career on crippling the very Agency he seeks to lead, we should not  expect a different result. Expecting anything more from Mr. Pruitt  would be foolish. He spent 6 years as Attorney General of Oklahoma  attacking the very Agency that he now leads--suing the very Agency he  now leads.   The only question is when President Trump or Members of this body  will finally hold Scott Pruitt accountable for the damage he has done  to the Agency and the environment he has promised and pledged and sworn  to protect.    We should know whether Andrew Wheeler is up to the task of helping to  right this badly damaged EPA ship, to restore confidence, and to get it  headed back on the right course.   So, once again, I will warn my colleagues that Scott Pruitt's  behavior should give us pause before we consider another nomination.   Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle may suggest  that I am grandstanding or that this is some effort to score political  points. Let me just say that this is serious stuff. This is serious  stuff not just to Democrats, not just to Republicans or Independents,  not just to the people in government, but to the people who pay for  that government--the taxpayers of this country.   Today we are considering the nominee to serve as the Deputy  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler.  The Deputy Administrator is second in command at the Agency. The role  of Deputy Administrator is to assist the Administrator--in this case,  Scott Pruitt--in overseeing the day-to-day operations that help to keep  the Agency running, to protect our air, to protect our water, and to  protect our public health.   Scott Pruitt has been making headlines at the EPA as of late, but for  all the wrong reasons. From his first-class flights to his ethically  questionable dealings with industry, Scott Pruitt has clearly been  doing what he wants to do at EPA with little regard for the rules or  for the American people. Even if Mr. Wheeler disagrees with the  decisions being made by EPA's current leadership, which is something we  should find out, it seems as though Scott Pruitt simply silences or  isolates or reassigns any dissenters.   It is important to know how Andrew Wheeler views the chaos that has  engulfed EPA in the last year, most of which is of Scott Pruitt's own  making. After all, the things we have learned about the EPA over the  last 2 weeks gives us a different outlook than when Leader McConnell  filed cloture on Andrew Wheeler's nomination just before the Easter  recess. It certainly gives a different perspective than we had when  Andrew Wheeler sat before the Environment and Public Works Committee  last year.   It is especially important to learn how Mr. Wheeler would address  Scott Pruitt's ethical lapses because it is becoming clear that my  Republican colleagues, sadly, have little interest in addressing them.   This week, our colleague Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island  and I sent a letter to our chairman and our friend, Senator Barrasso,  requesting a hearing on the troubling information that we received  regarding Mr. Pruitt's expensive and unprecedented security detail.  Chairman Barrasso apparently does not intend to hold a hearing. I hope  he will reconsider that decision.   When our top government officials fail to follow the rules, we in  Congress have a constitutional duty to hold them accountable and to get  to the  [[Page S2090]]  truth. What did Thomas Jefferson used to say? He said: If the people  know the truth, they will not make a mistake. Hopefully, if we in this  body know the truth, we will not either.   The legislative branch of government is a coequal branch of  government. Our Founding Fathers in their wisdom designed a system  where there would be checks and balances built in so that no one branch  could get too far out of line, but that system only works if each  branch is willing to assert its authority.   I am hardly the first person to recognize the need or the importance  of congressional oversight. Many of our Senate colleagues have  conducted effective oversight over the years. I have, our Presiding  Officer has, and many Members of this body have.   Here is a call for increased oversight from 2010. It reads:         The legislative branch has its own responsibility to       provide oversight over the executive branch agencies. . . .       Our mission should be to provide oversight for the current       administration to ensure integrity and transparency over       policy decisions being made that affect peoples' lives today.    As issues arose in previous Congresses, previous chairmen held  hearings into those matters.   Those are not my words. Those are the words of our friend, the  chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.   Let me just say, that I approved this message.   Here is a call for increased oversight from, I think, April 2016. It  reads:         Mr. President, like so much in Washington, D.C., the EPA       has grown too big, too arrogant, too irresponsible, and too       unaccountable. And people in America deserve accountability.    Again, I agree with John Barrasso.   Finally, a quote from September 2015 reads:         The agency needs to step back and rethink its priorities. .       . . The Environmental Protection Agency has been out of       control for far too long. It is time for Congress and       President Obama to hold the EPA accountable for its failures,       and it is time to rein in this runaway bureaucracy before it       does more damage to our communities, to our economy, and to       our country.    September 17, 2015.   Some things are too important to be held hostage by partisanship.  Oversight shouldn't only be important when a Democrat is in the White  House. Oversight shouldn't only be a critical component of Congress's  work when Barack Obama or Gina McCarthy are in charge. Oversight of the  executive branch is, in fact, our constitutional responsibility here in  the Senate, and it should be constant no matter which party is in power  in the Senate, the House, or in the White House. Whether an official's  actions are right or wrong does not depend on where they fall on the  political spectrum.   Even Trey Gowdy--a terrific Congressman from South Carolina, the  Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee--recognizes the need  for oversight here, and our Republican colleagues in the Senate have an  obligation to hold Mr. Pruitt to the same standards that they held  officials who served in past administrations. If Lisa Jackson had been  accused of even a fraction of the things it seems as though Mr. Pruitt  has done, we would be holding hearings in the Dirksen Senate Office  Building in the EPW hearing room every week--and we should be.   Andrew Wheeler worked as a Senate staffer. He worked for our friend  George Voinovich, one of my dearest friends in my whole life. He  conducted oversight throughout his career. He later worked for Senator  Jim Inhofe. Andrew has worked for Members such as Senator Inhofe and  Senator George Voinovich, who I know take and took seriously their  oversight roles. We should be able to hear from Andrew Wheeler what his  plans are to rein in the abuses at EPA before he takes over this  important job.   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.    Mr. President, yesterday, Jeh Johnson, our former  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, dropped by to say  hello, and I shared with him the results of an annual Federal survey.  As the Senator may know, every major Federal agency has its employees  surveyed with respect to its morale. Some agencies have very high  morale, and some agencies have not so high.   I am still a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Jeh Johnson  and Alejandro Mayorkas, who were the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of  that Department, spent 3 years serving in these capacities and working  with us on the committee to try to figure out how we could help the  employees at the Department of Homeland Security feel better about  their work.   I would come here to this floor every month and pick out a different  part of the Department of Homeland Security where work was being done  and have posters and pictures, just as the Senator has done here today,  in order to  [[Page S2092]]  make real the service and the sacrifices of the folks, whether they be  in the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security. It was one of those  things, we found out, that kind of resonated in the Department. It just  spread. Even to this day, people remember it and express thanks for  that.   I thank the Senator for taking a moment to do, really, something very  similar--maybe better--than what I tried to do over those years.   When I was the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I will  say I had a chance to work with Jim Comey--not every day but a fair  amount. I have worked with a lot of great leaders and some who were not  so great. The Senator from Texas has as well. Yet I must say that I  have enormous respect for Jim Comey, for his integrity and his  commitment to doing what is right. I have high regard for Chris Wray,  our new FBI Director, but there is a part of me that still wishes Jim  Comey were still leading that agency. So we will see what he writes in  his book, but I wish him and his family well.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise--again today for the second time-- in opposition to the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler, at this time to be  Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is not  a decision I came to lightly or without considerable effort to find a  different path. I wish to begin this section of my remarks by  describing some of the events that brought us to this point.   First, I wish to talk briefly about my own experience with Mr.  Wheeler. As a staff member of the Environment and Public Works  Committee, working for our dear friend, the late-Senator George  Voinovich, and Senator Jim Inhofe, Mr. Wheeler was not someone with  whom we agreed on each and every issue. However, Mr. Wheeler did prove  to be someone with whom we could work on policies on which we did  agree, like, for example, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, which  reduces significantly diesel engine pollution and emissions from older  diesel engines. I would also note that his responses during and after  last year's hearings on his nomination were, for the most part,  encouraging.   Mr. Wheeler also has some recent professional history that is  troubling--and to some, very troubling. During the Trump transition,  the public got a chance to read the so-called Murray action plan. What  is that? It is a list of policy proposals submitted to President Trump  and other Trump administration officials by Mr. Wheeler's former client  for a while, Bob Murray. The Murray action plan includes any number of  measures that EPA, in the last 15 months, has begun to implement, like  the repeals of the Clean Power Plan and the clean water rule and the  decimation of the EPA's career workforce. The document also calls for  some measures that EPA has not yet acted upon. For example, Mr. Murray  calls for the repeal of the mercury and air toxic standards, rules that  limit dangerous pollution from powerplants, even though industry is  already complying with those same rules.   Mr. Murray also calls for a reexamination of climate change science  and the repeal of EPA's so-called endangerment finding. I will talk a  little bit more about that in a minute. It is the conclusion that both  the Bush and the Obama administrations reached that found that global  warming pollution from cars and SUVs was dangerous. I think I will just  take a minute and talk about the endangerment finding right here.  People talk about the endangerment finding. I don't think it is well- understood where it came from, and I wish to take just a moment if I  can to try to relate it in terms that I can understand and, hopefully,  other people can as well.   If you go back to the Clean Air Act, section 202 of the Clean Air Act  says that if EPA determines that an air pollutant emitted from motor  vehicles endangers public health or welfare, EPA has to write  regulations to control those emissions. It has to write regulations to  control those emissions. I believe it was in 1999 that environmental  organizations petitioned EPA to do just that, and they asked EPA to  determine that the greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles were  dangerous. President Bush rejected their position in 2003, saying that  greenhouse gases did not meet the law's definition of an air pollutant.   The State of Massachusetts led a coalition of other States and  environmental organizations, though, and they filed a lawsuit against  the Bush administration's decision. In April 2007, I think it was, the  Supreme Court ruled in favor of Massachusetts and those who filed with  Massachusetts. The court told EPA in 2007 that greenhouse gasses are  ``air pollutants'' under the Clean Air Act, and they went on to say  that EPA had to determine whether they were dangerous.   Although President Bush's EPA Administrator, Stephen Johnson, was  ready to make the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases  being emitted from cars and SUVs, the White House would not let him do  it. The White House would not let their own EPA Administrator make that  finding. So it wasn't until a year or 2 later--I think it was in  December 2009--that the Obama administration's EPA finalized its  determination that greenhouse gases from motor vehicles are dangerous.  In 2010, EPA and the Transportation Department issued the first joint  fuel economy and greenhouse tailpipe standards for cars and SUVs.   In the meantime, many industry groups tried to overturn the EPA's  decisions. They filed suits in a number of different Federal courts  saying that those groups did not agree with the climate science. They  didn't agree with the process that EPA used to arrive at this  endangerment finding, and they didn't like the regulation that EPA was  writing in 2009. Well, 2 or 3 years later, in 2012, the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the DC Circuit, which is the top appeals court in the whole  country, right below the Supreme Court, ruled against the industry,  upholding both the endangerment finding and the EPA's clean air rules.  The Supreme Court declined to take up the industry's appeal. So it  stood.   The U.S. court of appeals essentially sustained what EPA, under the  Obama administration, sought to do and what Stephen Johnson, who was  the EPA Administrator in the Bush administration the last year or 2,  sought to do.   So what does all of this mean? What this means is that this is  settled law. The highest courts in the land have said that greenhouse  gases are air pollutants, they are dangerous, and EPA must regulate  them.   Now, with that as a backdrop, let me say that I met with Mr. Wheeler  a couple of times in the last year. I asked him directly whether or not  he was involved in writing Mr. Murray's proposal--the so-called Murray  plan that has been taken as an action plan by this administration and  by this EPA under its current Administrator. Mr. Wheeler assured me  that he was not involved in writing Mr. Murray's proposal.   He did go on to tell me, however, that one of Murray Energy's  priority issues that Andy Wheeler actually worked on was securing  health and other benefits for retired miners. I think that is something  most of us would support.   Moreover, Mr. Wheeler also assured me that he views the EPA's legal  authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which is based on the  endangerment finding, as settled law. Let me say that again. Mr.  Wheeler assured me that he views the EPA's legal authority to regulate  greenhouse emissions, which is based on the endangerment finding, as  settled law.   I have no reason to doubt Mr. Wheeler's assurances that, at least on  the question of the endangerment finding, he holds a view that is  distinct from Bob Murray's, and that is a good thing, at least to me. I  am sure that I speak not just for myself when I say that I do not feel  similarly assured by Administrator Pruitt.  [[Page S2097]]    The Trump White House has said it wants EPA and the Transportation  Department to negotiate what I would like to call a win-win on CAFE and  tailpipe standards with California. That means the Trump  administration's policy must be to leave the endangerment finding alone  because the endangerment finding is what gives EPA and California the  authority to write the tailpipe greenhouse gas rules in the first  place.   But Administrator Pruitt has repeatedly refused to say this clearly.  For example, last July, he told Reuters that there might be a legal  basis to overturn the EPA's endangerment finding decision. When I asked  him in late January not to overturn it for as long as he is  Administrator, he refused to make that commitment.   In preparation for Mr. Wheeler's confirmation, I tried very hard to  obtain some clarity about just what EPA plans to do with regard to the  endangerment finding and the Agency's stated efforts to negotiate new  greenhouse gas vehicle standards with California.   My staff and I talked to Bill Wehrum, who is the EPA Assistant  Administer for air--an important job--and with Ryan Jackson,  Administrator Pruitt's chief of staff. We spent several weeks  exchanging drafts of a letter that EPA planned to send me that sought  to do three things, to make clear three things.   First, the letter affirmed the legal authority EPA used to find that  the greenhouse gas emissions were dangerous and set vehicle standards.  That is No. 1.   Second, the letter affirmed California's Clean Air Act authority to  set its own, more stringent, vehicle standards.   And third, the letter committed to negotiate in earnest with  California using a process not unlike the one used in past efforts to  preserve a single national set of vehicle standards that automakers in  California could support--a true win-win.   We actually reached agreement on the text of that letter with those  who were negotiating, including Mr. Wehrum, his team, folks from  California, and others. I am told Administrator Pruitt initially agreed  to let the letter be sent, but then, maybe a week or two ago, a woman  named Samantha Dravis, a political appointee at EPA, who I think is  from Oklahoma and who recently resigned after reports that she failed  to come to work for some 3 months last year, apparently convinced the  Administrator to renege on the deal and to not sign the letter.   Ultimately, a significant part of the reason I cannot support Mr.  Wheeler is because the Agency refused to follow through on an agreement  it made with me on issues that are really important to the country, the  auto industry, and California.   The truth is, at this point in time, it is not the only reason we  should not be moving forward with this vote. In the past several weeks,  each day brings headline after headline. There they are again. This is  just a handful of headlines. This is a target-rich environment in terms  of headlines from Scott Pruitt. In the past couple of weeks, each day  brings headline after headline, scandal after scandal, report after  report about simply what I think is an unconscionably manner in which  Mr. Pruitt is running the Agency, as I talked about earlier.   There have been dozens of calls for his resignation that have come  from both parties here and in the House. Speculation about how long he  will be able to remain in the job is at a very high pitch--very high  pitch. It is entirely possible that Mr. Wheeler might be sworn in as  Acting Administrator before he spends a single day on the job as Deputy  Administrator. We will see.   The truth is, we have never really had the opportunity to ask Mr.  Wheeler how he would remedy the reports of excessive spending out of  EPA under Mr. Pruitt's leadership--inappropriate travel, retaliation  against staff who dare to cross him, unlawful rule repeals, and the  gross abuses of power Mr. Pruitt has inflicted on this country--if it  were suddenly Mr. Wheeler's job to right those wrongs, which it will be  if he is confirmed today.   Neither Mr. Wheeler nor members of the Environment and Public Works  Committee were even aware of the extent of many of these problems and  scandals when his confirmation hearing was held more than 5 months ago  in the Environment and Public Works Committee.   Essentially, in my view, the Senate quite simply should not vote  today on this confirmation until we know which job Mr. Wheeler will be  filling at the Agency and until we know how he views and how he would  remedy the overwhelming number of serious problems he will face when he  arrives there.   Let me say one last thing, if I could. I am a big believer in win-win  situations and win-win solutions. I think my colleague who is presiding  at this moment is also. We partner on a variety of things, including  trying to promote recycling, not just here in this body but all across  this country, in ways that create jobs and create economic opportunity.   I focus a lot--and I think a lot of my colleagues do--on how do we  create a more nurturing environment for job creation and job  preservation. We don't create jobs here. Governments and Presidents  don't create jobs. We try to help create a nurturing environment for  job creation. One of the elements that is important for having that  kind of nurturing environment for job creation, frankly, is clean air,  clean water, and good public health. Another thing that is important is  certain businesses like certainty and predictability.   It has been 10 years or more, but I will never forget when I was  visited by a bunch of utility CEOs from all over the country. They had  come to talk with me and my staff about clean air legislation covering  four distinct pollutants. They included mercury, CO2,  nitrogen oxide, and maybe one more--all types of legislation for  polluters.   I had introduced legislation on the heels of President Bush's  proposal. President Bush proposed multipollutant legislation that he  called Clear Skies. The version I introduced, with a Republican  colleague, was called Really Clear Skies. The four pollutants were VOC,  NOC, mercury, and CO2. That is what it was.   We had these CEOs from utility companies across the country who came  to see us. They wanted to talk about our legislation to, over time,  ratchet down the emission of those pollutants from their utilities. We  talked for about an hour. At the end of the hour, one of the CEOs of  the utilities--I think he was from the southern part of the country-- said: Look, let me tell you, Senator, what you should do. Here is what  you and your colleagues should do with respect to air emissions for  utilities. He said: Tell us what the rules are going to be, give us  some flexibility, a reasonable amount of time to meet those  expectations, and get out of the way. That is what he said: Tell us  what the rules are going to be, give us a reasonable amount of time to  meet those expectations, some flexibility, and get out of the way.   With respect to CAFE, what we are doing with fuel efficiency  requirements for cars, SUVs, and trucks--what we need to keep in mind  is providing the same kind of certainty and predictability for the auto  industry inside the country and outside of this country as we expect  them to increase fuel efficiency over time for cars, trucks, and vans.   Under current law that we adopted, I want to say, about 10 years ago,  we ramped up fuel efficiency requirements up through 2025. Between 2021  and 2025, the increases are pretty significant, pretty steep. The  current administration wants to almost eliminate entirely those  increases between 2021 and 2025 and be really silent on what happens  after that.   I go to the Detroit auto show almost every year. In Delaware, until a  couple of years ago, we built more cars, trucks, and vans per capita  than any other State in the country. I got used to going to the Detroit  auto show so often that I would know the people who ran Chrysler and GM  so that if they ever thought about closing their plant in Delaware, we  actually know whom to talk to. I still go to the Detroit auto show most  years.    I went this time and met and talked with representatives from 10 auto  companies from this country and around the world. We talked about CAFE  and fuel efficiency requirements going forward. To a company, this is  what they said to me in private conversation: We need some flexibility  in the near term, between 2021 and 2025. In return for  [[Page S2098]]  that additional flexibility, we are willing to accept tougher goals  extending out as long as 2030--near-term flexibility, longer term  requirement for more rigorous standards. They said: Having said that,  we don't want to be stuck in a situation where we have to go with one  car with higher fuel efficiency requirements or see a model for a car,  truck, or SUV with higher requirements for fuel efficiency for  California and a different standard for the rest of the country. That  just doesn't work for their business model. They need to be able to  build one model, one set of standards for California and the other 49  States.   California, where they have had huge air pollution problems over the  years, wants to have rigorous requirements.   I said this to the majority leader earlier this week; that there is a  way to work through all of this with the auto industry, California, the  other States, with EPA, and the Department of Transportation. There is  a way to work through all of this that provides a real win-win, that  preserves jobs in the auto industry--people building cars, trucks, and  vans--and with respect to California's special concern, provides the  certainty and predictability the industry needs and also ends up giving  us more energy-efficient vehicles, cleaner air, and cleaner water-- especially cleaner air. That is a real win-win situation. That is a  real win-win situation, and that is where we need to go. We need  leadership at EPA, we need leadership from the administration,  leadership here, and in States like California to get us there.   Wayne Gretzky is a great hockey player. I am not a huge hockey fan. I  watch it a little bit. When Wayne Gretzky was playing, he was believed  to be the best hockey player anybody had ever even seen, at least in  this country. His nickname was ``The Great One.'' He took a lot of  shots. He was not shy about shooting for a goal.   He was once asked: Mr. Gretzky, why do you take so many shots on  goals? He said these words: I missed every shot I never took. I missed  every shot I never took.   I like to take the shot in a lot of different respects. This is a  shot we should take, and, if we do, we will do a lot more than score a  goal. We will score a big win for our country. In the end, for people  who are driving cars, trucks, and vans in the years to come, we will  save them a lot of money, and we will have cleaner air and protect a  lot of jobs that need to be protected and need to be preserved.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rarely rise three times in the same day  to give a speech. This is a special day for me and maybe for the  Senate. But I want to assure my colleagues that the concerns many of us  have been expressing about the current chaos at the Environmental  Protection Agency and the nomination of Andrew Wheeler--the person who  could predictably replace the EPA Administrator--are not ours alone.  Editorial boards around the country, including those from newspapers in  Republican-leaning States, are expressing concerns regarding EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt's recent slew of ethical lapses--it would be  charitable to call them lapses. It is these failings by Mr. Pruitt that  Andrew Wheeler will be expected to address if he is confirmed by the  Senate.   I can assure the citizens of all these States, the editorial boards  of all these papers, and all my colleagues that the Environment and  Public Works Committee has not considered the nomination of Andrew  Wheeler with these ethical failings in mind. Mr. Wheeler has been  nominated to serve as the individual who will oversee day-to-day  operations of an EPA currently in chaos. We have had no opportunity to  ask Mr. Wheeler about the Administrator's questionable behavior, nor  have we had a chance to ask him how he plans to right a ship that has  so clearly lost its way.   I am sobered but not shocked to read what people who have their  fingers on  [[Page S2107]]  the pulse in their communities have to say about the current leadership  in the Environmental Protection Agency. It is truly maddening and  deeply sad to see the indictments on an agency that we in Congress have  vested with the responsibility of protecting our children, supporting  our elders, and ensuring a world in which we and all the life around us  can thrive.   What are newspapers around the country saying about the leadership of  the Environmental Protection Agency these days?   As a kid growing up in Virginia, I never read the Virginian-Pilot in  Danville and Roanoke. This is what they said in Virginia through a  newspaper called the Virginian-Pilot on April 6, 2018, about a week  ago. The headline of the editorial is ``EPA's Pruitt a terrible  choice.''   They said:         Short of nominating an actual oil derrick or a landfill to       the post, President Donald Trump couldn't have done worse       than tapping Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental       Protection Agency.    They went on to say:         And yet, it's unlikely that his sinister approach to       managing the EPA will be Pruitt's undoing. Rather, it's       almost certain to be a comparatively banal brand of       corruption that is infuriatingly commonplace in the highest       echelons of the Trump administration.    The editorial goes on to say:         Having a director of the Environmental Protection Agency       wholly uninterested in protecting the environment is a       national embarrassment, and Americans deserve much better       than the worst option available.    The next quote comes from Charleston, WV, and it is from the West  Virginia Gazette-Mail. It is focused more on a favorite Presidential  theme.         Donald Trump campaign crowds loved to chant ``Drain the       swamp!'' But if ever there was a political swamp creature,       it's Scott Pruitt, the man Trump picked to head the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency.    On the issue of favoring his fellow Oklahomans on the EPA staff, the  Charleston Gazette-Mail editorial continued:         Despite the White House telling him not to give large       raises to two employees--    I think one raise was $29,000 and another was $56,000 per year--       --who followed him from Oklahoma, Pruitt did it anyway. He       used a loophole in the Safe Drinking Water Act that's       supposed to let the EPA hire experts quickly in an emergency,       not give taxpayer-funded raises to political lackeys.    Nor did the Administrator's security concerns pass muster. The  Charleston Gazette-Mail went on:         Pruitt is clearly very worried about his security; he has       tripled the size of his security detail, and is the first EPA       administration to have 24/7 security--again, at taxpayer       expense. That security detail includes some EPA agents who       would otherwise be investigating environmental crimes, rather       than protecting their snowflake boss.    Those are the newspaper's words, not mine.   The editorial goes on to say:         Pruitt's predecessors, Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson--who       were demonized repeatedly by West Virginia politicians, among       others--flew coach, with a much smaller security presence.    The Charleston Gazette-Mail editorial concludes:         There are many reasons why Scott Pruitt shouldn't be       leading the EPA, primarily that he doesn't seem to believe in       science and is more interested in helping big business,       than, you know, protecting the environment. But his       obvious belief that taxpayer money and resources are given       to him for his personal benefit is a big reason, as well.    Let's go down to Texas. The Houston Chronicle weighed in on this. I  don't know if we have a poster on this one, but here we go. This is  what they said at the Houston Chronicle on April 6, this month. The  headline of the editorial is ``The time has come for EPA Administrator  Scott Pruitt to resign.''   It reads in part:         On the next episode of the Trump administration's reality       show, the latest character the President needs to vote off       the island is Environmental Protection Agency Administrator       Scott Pruitt.        Indeed, it's hard to figure out how Pruitt has survived so       far into this season. The host of this show says he wants to       drain the swamp, but the EPA boss is so deep in the muck, he       could play the creature from the Black Lagoon.    The Houston Chronicle concluded:         So Pruitt seems destined to become the next character cut       from Trump's chaotic reality show. Dropping this bad actor       can't happen fast enough.    Even in Mr. Pruitt's home State, some people are fed up with his  antics. The Tulsa World editorialized in this way--this was on April 6.  The title is ``With a controversial agenda, EPA Administrator Scott  Pruitt must live above suspicion.''   In part, the editorial reads:         Some of the latest accusations are embarrassing. He should       have known better, and he may pay a heavy consequence for       them.    The paper goes on:         From his first day in office, Pruitt has been under the       microscope of scrutiny from those who disagree with the       president's thinking on environmental issues. If that's not       entirely fair, it also should have been obvious to Pruitt       that he would have to live a life that was above suspicion.       In ways that have nothing to do with money, he couldn't       afford to fly first class.    The second Oklahoma newspaper, the Edmund Sun, had more particular  advice for the President, along these lines:         Donald Trump has never needed help miring himself in       controversy, and that was true before he ever moved into the       White House. But he could do himself a favor, and gain some       begrudging respect from detractors, by drop-kicking Scott       Pruitt to the curb.        The fact that he defied a White House decision should by       itself make Pruitt ripe for termination. Staffers and Cabinet       members far more ethical than Pruitt have been shown the       door. Trump should cut him loose, and get rid of the rope and       the scissors he used to make the snip.    Under the best of circumstances and even in the most accountable  administrations, consideration of a nominee to serve as EPA Deputy  Administrator is a huge responsibility for this body. As the Miami  Herald rightly points out, this is no normal circumstance and surely  not a normal EPA that Mr. Wheeler would enter. He would have to be  ready for a job that none of us can say at this time that he is ready  to tackle--cleaning up a huge mess at EPA.   The Miami Herald notes:         The flurry of ethical questions surrounding Environmental       Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is now a       blizzard. The emerging picture is of a chief environmental       officer not only fighting a war on science as he promotes oil       and gas interests but also arrogantly betraying the public       trust.    The Miami Herald concludes:         Time and again, Trump has accepted arrogance and       incompetence on his staff as long as loyalty remains beyond       question.    Meanwhile, in Akron, OH, in its editorial entitled ``Deep in the  Swamp at the EPA,'' on April 8, the Akron Beacon Journal notes that  some folks in the White House knew just how bad Scott Pruitt was.         John Kelly showed the right instinct.    John Kelly is the Chief of Staff.         According to news accounts, the White House chief of staff       advised President Trump that Scott Pruitt, the administrator       of the Environmental Protection Agency, needed to step down       in view of his ethical misdeeds and spending excesses.    The Beacon Journal concludes:         Scott Pruitt should go. This isn't about policymaking,       dismaying and damaging as the direction of the agency has       been. The problem is his conduct in office. Pruitt has abused       the public trust, in the way he has spent taxpayer dollars,       in the perception he invites.    Apparently, Mr. Pruitt is not showing folks in the Show Me State what  they want to see in an EPA Administrator either. In an editorial on  April 7, 2018, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said:         There are many good reasons why President Donald Trump       should fire Scott Pruitt as administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency. Top on our list are his       multiple failures to do his job protecting the environment.       He's gone so far as to say that if global warming is real, it       might be a good thing.    Do you know what. I wholeheartedly agree with the St. Louis Post- Dispatch.   In conclusion, I share these editorials because I think they  illustrate the situation that Mr. Wheeler will face should he be  confirmed, and that is a very difficult situation. As the No. 2 person  at EPA, Mr. Wheeler will be responsible for fullfilling the Agency's  mission and doing so in a way that earns, once again, the public's  trust. There is a long way to go to regain that trust, and Mr. Wheeler  will have a Herculean task in front of him to help the Administrator do  so, should he be confirmed today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
