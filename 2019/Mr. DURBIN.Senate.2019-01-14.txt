 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this  evening's vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Strengthening  America's Security in the Middle East Act of 2019, S. 1.   On vote No. 3, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture.                            ____________________
