 Mr. Speaker, it is important for us to understand why we  are here. We are here because the Republican majority in the House and  the Senate and the President of the United States have not funded the  government.   Secondly, we also are here because there are a number of issues on  which I think there is agreement in both Houses that have not been  brought to the floor irrespective of the majority's will.   It appears, from what the Senate leader has said, that there is an  agreement in the Senate, and, perhaps--and I think probably--we will  move forward today to open up the government.   But I hope my Republican colleagues do not misinterpret what is  happening because the issues will not go away. Between now and February  8, if that is the date, we must resolve how we are going to fund the  government--that is what has held us up--and we must bring to this  floor a bill to protect people whom the President of the United States  said we ought to protect.   Let's do it. Let's do our work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, as I said this morning, the reason why the government  shut down is because the Republican majority has failed to fund the  government. They have the majority of the House, the majority of the  Senate, and the Presidency of the United States.   And with all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, five  previous shutdowns were purposefully perpetrated by my Republican  friends; the last for 16 days.   The continuing resolution on the floor today reflects that failure.  It does not, 9 months after we should have been done, establish the  level of spending for this fiscal year. It is 9 months late.   As a result, another continuing resolution may be inevitable. And in  this resolution, we will extend the harmful effects of another CR to  both defense and nondefense agencies for another 17 days.   That means that Congress will be more than 4 whole months into the  fiscal year without a budget agreement. This is dangerous, Mr. Speaker,  both to our military and to our civilian agencies, each of which  require budget certainty.   Before February 8, Republicans must work with Democrats to resolve  the issues at hand. This means working together to lift the budget caps  in accordance with the principle of parity, which Speaker Ryan agreed  to over the past 4 years and should continue to today and in the  future.   It also means working in a bipartisan, bicameral way to address the  status of DREAMers, now that President Trump created a crisis with his  ending of the DACA program. Congress should act responsibly to allow  these young people to stay, as more than 80 percent of Americans  believe should be done.   Mr. Speaker, it requires reauthorizing community health centers and  other critical health programs essential to complement the passage of  the CHIP reauthorization, which is included in this CR.   We also have a responsibility to help those impacted by the  devastating hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands; those affected by the wilderness fires in California;  and communities struggling to combat opioid abuse.   Congress must not waste the next 17 days as it has the last 114. I  will be voting ``no,'' Mr. Speaker, on this continuing resolution, not  because I don't want to see it pass, but because it does not guarantee  that Congress will address the issues that have been referenced.   I pray that neither I nor Congress will be in this same position come  February 8. I hope we will address in a positive manner the issues  before us.   I am now pleased, Mr. Speaker, to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader.   (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, we have 10\1/2\ days remaining before we have  another crisis in funding our government. Those are legislative days.  We have more calendar days. Let us try to use every one of those days  to reach agreement on funding the government so we don't have another  CR, which all of us believe is bad fiscal policy and substantive  policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge us to come together so that we can avoid another  crisis like this and address the issues that we know need to be  addressed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.

B.      Jones      Valadao                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore    The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the vote). There are 2 minutes  remaining.                                time  1809    So the motion to concur was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated for:    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), my friend and the majority leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   Today, both Chambers have passed the CR that takes us to February 8.  That leaves 17 calendar days. I was going to say it did 6\1/2\  legislative days, but the gentleman has now given up probably half a  day, as I understand it, which is Wednesday of the retreat. So,  essentially, Mr. Speaker, we have 6 days between now and February 8 in  which we will be in session. That makes it incumbent upon us that we  come together, cooperate with one another, compromise, and send  legislation from here to the Senate that the Senate can agree to.   I want to say, I did not know the gentleman was going to mention  that, but I want to see the Defense Department fully funded. But I also  want to see fully funded departments that take care of the health of  our people, the education of our children, domestic law enforcement,  and relations between ourselves and the rest of the world in the State  Department, and so many other agencies of government that are in the  nondefense part of the budget.   Mr. Speaker, I would tell my friend that I would hope we would come  to an agreement very, very shortly on the overall spending levels so  that we can pass both defense and nondefense priority issues. And I  would say to my friend, all we are asking for in that context, as the  gentleman knows, is what we have done over the last 4 years as a result  of agreements between Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray, so I would hope  that we can proceed on that.   Secondly, and there is so much to bring up, but the second thing I  want to mention is, clearly, one of the issues that we have been so  concerned about has been how we are going to treat the DREAMers in our  country. As the gentleman knows my view, based upon polls that I have  read, 85 percent of Americans essentially agree that we ought not send  those young people, for the most part, out of the country away from  their home to places they do not know, particularly when they are  making such a positive contribution to our country.   Now, while I said there were some 5\1/2\ days left between now and  the 8th, there are 10\1/2\ days--actually, I guess, now, 9\1/2\ days in  which to deal with the issue of the DREAMers.   The gentleman and I, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Durbin have been  working. I look forward to working on that, and I hope that we work on  it every calendar day that we have available--we won't be in session,  but we will work on that--so we can, in fact, come to an agreement so  that those young people who the American people think ought to stay  here and continue to be productive citizens, contributing individuals  to our country, would be allowed to stay here, given a path to  citizenship. I would hope that we could work toward that end.   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   I am hopeful that we can agree on the underlying issue which led to  the necessity for a CR and the temporary closing of government. That is  the underlying agreement on what budget numbers will be, what our caps  will be, how much discretionary funding we will have to spend both on  defense and nondefense. That is at the core. When you fail to do that,  you fail to pass appropriation bills, and you, therefore, have to  repair to CRs, which everybody on this floor agrees is bad fiscal  policy and should not be the way we do business.   Secondly, I appreciate the majority leader's leadership and  engagement on the issue of solving the problem, or the challenge and  the opportunity, I should say--not so much a problem, but an  opportunity--of DREAMers. It is what the President, Mr. Speaker, asked  us to do. Hopefully, we can, in fact, working in good faith with one  another, get that done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
