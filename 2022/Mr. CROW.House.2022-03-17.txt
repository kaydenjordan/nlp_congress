 Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize Jewish  Family Services and join them in celebrating their 150th anniversary.   From their founding in 1872, Jewish Family Services has always  adapted to meet the moment time and time again. They helped resettle  Holocaust survivors in the wake of World War II, opened a group home  for individuals with disabilities in the 1980s, and formed an  employment services department in 2021.   In the last year alone, Jewish Family Services helped over 25,000  individuals stand strong against COVID-19 and even became a temporary  Afghan refugee resettlement agency for Afghans looking to start new  lives in the Denver metro area.   For 150 years, our community has been made a better and more  inclusive place to live because of the thousands of volunteers who have  pulled upon their faith to serve our community and improve the lives of  others.   I congratulate and thank Jewish Family Services for their service to  our community and look forward to what the next 150 years will bring.                            ____________________
