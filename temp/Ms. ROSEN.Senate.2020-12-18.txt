 Mr. President, I would like to take this time to honor  Senator Lamar Alexander. Over the past 30 years, Senator Alexander has  served the people of Tennessee as U.S. Senator, Governor, and U.S.  Secretary of Education under President George H.W. Bush. Over the past  2 years, however, he has also been a great friend to a freshman Senator  from Nevada who came from a different political party but shared his  desire to get things done for the American people. Like so many in this  Chamber, I will miss this dedicated public servant who sought to find  common ground on the many pressing issues facing the Senate, including  healthcare, education, and medical research.   Senator Alexander has been a great mentor and colleague of mine in  the Senate. I was grateful for how gracious he was when I first came to  the Senate and for his willingness to engage me on the key issues  facing Congress. As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, of which I am proud to be a member, Senator  Alexander worked tirelessly on important issues like increasing access  to telehealth services, lowering health care costs, making it easier to  apply for student financial aid, and advocating for our seniors. I  particularly appreciated the work he did to support the fight against  Alzheimer's disease and ensure we invest in robust funding for medical  research.  [[Page S7705]]    Especially this past year during these unprecedented times, the  American people needed bipartisan work and leadership from its public  officials in getting relief to struggling communities across the  country. Senator Alexander's direction and leadership through debates  and negotiations brought out the best in him this year, as it has in  the past, evident both in how he treats people with dignity and respect  and in his unwavering dedication to public service.   Not only will we miss Senator Alexander's presence in this Chamber,  but we will also miss his beautiful piano skills during the holiday  season. I hope he will have the opportunity to come back to the Senate  Hart Building and play for us again soon. I promise I will be there in  the front row.   Senator Alexander, I wish you the best in the next chapter of your  life and hope you have a wonderful retirement after your long and  impactful career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to honor my  dear friend and colleague, Senator Tom Udall. Throughout his time in  Congress, he has continued to be a staunch advocate for protecting  working families, our public lands, and so much more. Tom's desire and  commitment to serve the people of New Mexico over the past 20 years are  not only inspiring but serve as an example of what a faithful public  servant represents.   As we all know, the ``Udall'' name rings with great respect and honor  among those involved in public service, and Tom is no exception. As a  true native of New Mexico, Senator Udall understands the importance of  protecting our public lands and the people who reside there. It has  been an honor to serve alongside him in the western delegation to  secure funding for environmental restoration and public lands  preservation. It has been my distinct pleasure to work with him and his  staff on monumental legislation such as the Great American Outdoors  Act, which permanently funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund,  LWCF. The LWCF provides funds for restoration and outdoor recreation  opportunities in Nevada and numerous projects in New Mexico. We have  also fought side-by-side to defend our public lands from those who  would take them out of public hands.   Senator Udall, your mentorship, expertise, and, most of all, your  friendship will be deeply missed. You and your family welcomed me with  such warmth when I began my journey as a Senator. I am so grateful to  have not only a great professional relationship but a wonderful  personal one as well. I would also like to take a moment to thank your  wife Jill for showing my husband Larry the procedures and protocols as  of being new Senate spouse. Larry and I are so happy to have you and  Jilly as friends for life.   Mr. President, Senator Udall's decades as a public servant are an  inspiration for so many of our colleagues, myself included. The western  delegation will continue to honor Senator Udall's work to reduce global  emissions, build a clean energy economy, and protect the public lands  that we all hold so dear. It has been an honor to work with Senator  Udall, and I wish him and Jill a joyful and tranquil transition in the  years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and thank my dear  friend and colleague, Senator Doug Jones, for the hard and noble work  he has done in the United States Senate. I greatly admire his passion  and all that he accomplished for the people of Alabama and all  Americans.   For his entire life, Senator Jones has stood tall as a pillar of  justice and equality. After graduating law school, Senator Jones became  counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee for then-Senator Howell  Heflin and served as an Assistant United States Attorney shortly after.  Senator Jones then became the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District  of Alabama, where he fought for civil liberties and against racial  injustice. As U.S. Attorney, he successfully was able to prosecute two  of the four men who were responsible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th  Street Baptist Church, and later indicted domestic terrorist Eric  Rudolph. By pursuing these cases, Senator Jones encouraged us all to  continue to reject bigotry and hate in all its forms.   In 2017, Senator Jones became the first Democrat to represent the  state of Alabama since 1997. He made it his duty to represent the  people of Alabama in every vote he made on the Senate floor. He always  voted in the best interests of his constituents, even when it wasn't  politically expedient or convenient. His service stands as a reminder  that bipartisanship is vital in addressing the issues that our nation  currently faces.   Senator Jones is a man of bravery and strength. His heart and passion  are not only moving, but admirable as well. I am very proud to have had  Senator Jones as a friend and colleague as we served alongside each  other on the HELP Committee these past two years, and I am eager to  continue watching his fierce fight against injustice, joining with him  in this struggle until hate is rejected in every corner of this nation.   Doug, you have been a great friend and colleague of mine in the  Senate. It has been an honor serving alongside you, and I am so sorry  to see you go. We have shared so much, both on and off the Senate  floor, and I look forward to continuing our friendship. During your  time here, you've shown bravery and strength, you followed your  conscious, and you have always done what was right. The lives of the  people of Alabama have been made better with you as their Senator. You  will be dearly missed.                            ____________________
