 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for  yielding the time.   Let me, first, dispel a couple of myths that have been suggested on  the floor of the House.   One myth has been that small businesses are negatively impacted by  the menu labeling requirements. Small businesses are unilaterally  exempt from menu labeling requirements. The rule only applies to  ``covered establishments,'' meaning those that have 20 or more  locations. This rule does not and never was intended to apply to small  businesses. That is misinformation being given out by the majority.   The second item which I just heard momentarily about, penalties, menu  labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms and penalties as  those for packaged food. The FDA has maintained its commitment to  compliance, outreach, and education and has waived enforcement for the  first year.   Additionally, numerous State and local governments have menu labeling  requirements, and not one chain restaurant has faced criminal  liability--once again, misinformation being distributed by the  majority.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this special interest-driven  attack on popular and necessary menu labeling rules.   When we crafted the health reforms in the Affordable Care Act, we  kept several critical goals in mind. We aimed to slow the staggering  growth of healthcare spending, make preventive and wellness care more  central to our health system, and give Americans access to more data so  that they can make their own informed healthcare decisions.   Menu labeling is an essential tool to meet all three of those goals.  That is why I have been a longtime champion of menu labeling, and I  fought hard to secure its inclusion in the Affordable Care Act.   Congress passed standardized menu labeling in 2010. The goal was to  arm Americans with the information they need to make informed  nutritional decisions for themselves and their families.   The language was built on consensus and compromise. It was worked out  between a variety of interests, including industry partners and the  National Restaurant Association.   Industry has already had nearly 8 years of input for the  implementation of the labeling rule, yet, with this misguided bill,  certain sectors of the industry will tear down the progress that we  have made. This bill would roll back and weaken this crucial step to  combat the obesity epidemic in the United States. This is obstruction.  American families are paying the price in their healthcare costs.   In 2015, sales at restaurants and bars surpassed spending at grocery  stores for the first time. In a typical day, one-third of our children,  4 in 10 adolescents, and one-third of adults eat at a fast food  restaurant. Americans are eating, on average, one-third of their  calories outside of the home. Nutritional information must be made  readily available where the consumer is at the point of purchase.   A health impact assessment from Los Angeles County found that menu  labeling could avert 40 percent of the 6.75 million-pound average  weight gain in the country. You think of that in terms of healthcare  costs and the impact that decrease would have.   Our children are especially at risk. Today, more than one-third of  our kids  [[Page H818]]  and adolescents are overweight or obese. Children eat more than twice  as many calories at a restaurant than they do at home. They consume  less nutrients and more saturated fats. The impact on our kids alone  should be reason enough to oppose a measure that undermines a  consumer's ability to make informed, nutritious choices at mealtimes.   Menu labeling is popular. In a national poll, over 80 percent of  Americans support menu labeling in chain restaurants. Over 100  nutrition and health organizations support menu labeling. Chains from  Starbucks to Panera Bread to McDonald's are already implementing menu  labeling. The rest of the industry must follow suit.   Consumers have a right to make an informed decision. It is  disrespectful for the industry and their partners to argue that the  American people cannot understand menu labeling. Give people the  ability to make their choice.   You go in to eat, it has been a great day, you look at the board, you  see something that you want, you look at the calories and say: Today, I  think I will watch my calories. You order accordingly.   Other days, it is a bad day. You go in and you throw caution to the  wind. You say: I am going to order whatever I can, no matter what the  calorie count is.   This is about the right to choose and freedom of choice. That is what  we are talking about here today. This bill denies consumers the right  to nutritional information at that point of purchase. Even if 49  percent of orders are placed from in-store menus, food establishments  could bury menu labeling online.   Multiple studies have shown that providing calorie menu labeling  information can help Americans make lower calorie choices, but they  cannot do this if they do not have the information they need.   This bill increases consumer confusion and allows restaurants to list  deceptive portion sizes, listing an entree as multiple servings even  though these items are most often consumed by one person.   It weakens enforcement and consumer protection, completely removes an  establishment's incentive to comply with the menu labeling  requirements, and removes the ability of individuals to hold retail  food establishments accountable for violations to the food labeling  law.   The existing law is already extremely flexible. I said restaurants  with less than 20 locations. Mom-and-pop small businesses are excluded.  I don't believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand  that. Read the legislation.   Let me mention something which has been very interesting, and that is  about pizza companies. I come from New Haven, Connecticut, an Italian- American neighborhood. I know something about pizza.   What we have done with the industry is to work with them. The FDA  opened the door to allow them what they asked for: to give a range of  calories on a slice of pizza. They have done it.   These are FDA charts which demonstrate how easily you can put a label  on the food so that people understand what the calories are. I will  show this one. Calories are listed per slice. That is what the industry  wanted. That is what we did. They have the ranges that they have for  their various toppings.   Don't let the other side sell you a bill of goods. The FDA has  conceded that they can list the calories in a single slice rather than  an entire pizza.   This all illustrates that the Food and Drug Administration has  already been working closely with the industry to address their  concerns. We should let them work through this process, rather than  complicating it with legislation that, in fact, would harm what we have  been doing, what we have worked on all these years: meaningful,  impactful work on menu labeling with a single stroke.   This is a special interest-driven bill. It is not the answer. I urge  my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a document that outlines the  myths that are perpetrated by the majority and what the underlying  facts are.                     Busting the Myths of Menu Labeling         The Menu Labeling Rule provides consumers with nutritional       information on the foods they purchase. This crucial       information would give Americans a tool to make healthy       choices. Nevertheless, the lobbying of special interest       groups has resulted in H.R. 772, a bill based on nothing more       than misleading myths.        MYTH No. 1: Small businesses are negatively impacted.        Small businesses are unilaterally exempt from menu labeling       requirements. The rule only applies to ``covered       establishments,'' meaning those that have 20 or more       locations. The rule does not, and never was intended, to       apply to small businesses.        MYTH No. 2: Labeling requirements are burdensome and       difficult to comply with.        In reality, nutritional labeling requirements are       straightforward and easy to implement, which is why numerous       food retailers are already labeling calories on their menus.       Furthermore, FDA has sought eight years of industry input       which has resulted in the most flexible disclosure       requirements to date. Nutritional information for complex       menu items can be disclosed in ranges, without the need to       estimate exact calories for various combinations.        MYTH No. 3: Labeling requirements only create consumer       confusion.        The Menu Labeling Rule actually reduces consumer confusion       by providing nutritional information at the point of       purchase, and ensures that portion sizes are listed       realistically. The rule will allow for a standard nutritional       information format which will facilitate consumer       understanding. Without it, consumers will be subject to       deceptive portion sizes which can lead to them making       misinformed decisions based on misleading information.        MYTH No. 4: Enforcements and penalties for noncompliance       are harsh and unreasonable.        Menu labeling will be subject to the exact same mechanisms       and penalties as those for packaged food. FDA has maintained       its commitment to compliance outreach and education, and has       waived enforcement for the first year. Additionally, numerous       state and local governments have menu labeling requirements,       and not one chain restaurant has faced a lawsuit.        MYTH No. 5: Menu Labeling Requirements are unpopular among       American consumers.        Consumers have unequivocally maintained their support for       menu labeling, with a recent poll showing support as high as       80 percent among Democrats, Republicans and Independents.       Moreover, more than 100 public health organizations and       health professionals have voiced their opposition to H.R. 772       because it would ``undermine congressional intent to provide       access to calorie labeling in a broad range of chain food       service establishments.''        Congressional Republicans have yet again bowed to special       interest and created a carve-out for big food corporations       who do not have the best interests of Americans at heart.       Overwhelmingly, consumers want to know the nutritional       information of the foods they are eating.        Please oppose H.R. 772--as well as any efforts that seek to       undermine consumers.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this continuing  resolution. I cannot support a bill that flies in the face of  responsible governing. This is pure incompetence.   How many times are we going to do this? This is our fifth short-term  spending bill since September. How many times will we punt our  priorities, lurching from one self-inflicted wound to another?   That is exactly what the continuing resolution represents: a failure  to govern. It is shameful that, yet again, we neglect our core  obligation as a Congress, which is to fund government programs. We  should be voting on new top-line spending levels for 2018, that  alleviate sequestration from both nondefense and defense spending.   We should have spent the last few months fulfilling our  responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan bills to fund  programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable, support  evidence-based scientific research, and help working people get the  skills they need to find good jobs and get good wages.   Instead, the majority forced through their tax scam for millionaires  and billionaires. They became the first party to ever control both  Chambers of Congress and the White House, and, yes, they shut down the  government. And today, the President of the United States says that he  supports a government shutdown.   The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the  American people. Instead of working with Democrats to set budget  numbers and ensure parity, equal for defense spending and nondefense  spending, they have put the government on autopilot.                                time  1800    They put services and investments that are critical to our families  and to our communities at grave risk from apprenticeships to education  for students with disabilities, childcare, after-school programs that  help working families make ends meet, and financial aid for students  who are attending college. Instead, they are forcing through another  continuing resolution, this time cutting almost $3 billion from the  Prevention Fund over the next 10 years on top of the $750 million that  they cut in December.    We are talking about cuts to programs that improve our  public health immunization infrastructure at a time when the flu is  rampant in this country, as well as cuts to lead poisoning prevention  programs that seek to prevent and ultimately eliminate childhood lead  poisoning.   Programs like these and dozens of others in the Prevention Fund save  billions of taxpayer dollars by preventing illness and disease before  they occur.   You cut the Prevention Fund and you cause millions of Americans to  suffer for no reason. You pit community health centers against the  Prevention Fund.   Take the money, the $1\1/2\ trillion that you give to the richest  people in this country: the millionaires, the billionaires, and the  richest corporations; don't take it from children's health, don't take  it from the healthcare centers, and don't take it from the Prevention  Fund. It is unacceptable, because here we are talking about people's  lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Reject this continuing resolution.  It fails to meet our obligations to the American people.
