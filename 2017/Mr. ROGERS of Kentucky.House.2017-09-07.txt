 Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution  500, as the designee of Mr. Frelinghuysen, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Would the Chair advise whether or not  amendment No. 103 is included in the en bloc?    Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of  amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman has offered, I  think, a reasonably good amendment, and we would like to see it  adopted, so I urge an ``aye'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in respectful  disagreement with my colleague who offered this amendment.   The United States Institute of Peace works to help prevent, reduce,  and resolve violent conflicts abroad. The Institute works alongside our  military, our diplomats, and development experts in some of the most  conflict-affected and fragile environments, including Iraq,  Afghanistan, Tunisia, South Sudan, and Ukraine. Eliminating the U.S.  Institute of Peace would hamper our efforts to stabilize these areas  and to prevent further outbreaks of conflict.   The Institute also works with local leaders and other partners to  find solutions to religious freedom and to mitigate the rise of  extremism and persecution.   Let me point out, too, that the staffer the gentleman just mentioned  in his remarks is no longer with the Institute. She is gone.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would cut funding  for the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Affairs  account by $209 million. That is a 16 percent reduction in the fight  against narcotics.   There is already money in the bill for TB, $241 million, which is the  same as current levels, and that exceeds the last Obama request and the  first Trump request for TB. It also includes another $1.35 billion for  the Global Fund to fight a combination of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB,  which includes additional funding for TB programs. So there is already  money in the bill for TB.   This would cut the International Narcotics Control and Law  Enforcement Affairs account by $209 million, a 16 percent cut, when it  is not really needed.   Funding for this account supports counterdrug and law enforcement  activities, strengthens the rule of law, and increases border security.   Mr. Chairman, I just came back with my subcommittee from a trip to  Ukraine and Georgia, and I understand by seeing it firsthand the  importance of our assistance that helps governments combat corruption  and improve the rule of law.  [[Page H7129]]    A portion of this funding also helps partners in our own hemisphere  fight drug trafficking and violent crime before it reaches the border  of the United States.   Undoubtedly, every agency can do more with more, but the allocation  for this bill was cut by 17 percent from last year. And rather than cut  every account by 17 percent, we deliberately and carefully considered  each program, and directed the funding recommendations to reflect our  priorities. Among those priorities is funding for TB, which is held at  last year's level. This means, of course, that other accounts and  programs took a disproportionately higher cut to make that possible.   I know the gentleman wants more funds for TB, and I sympathize with  him in that desire. I can assure him that preserving last year's level  of funding puts TB in a very rarefied position in this bill, because it  is treated well.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 4 of House  Resolution 500, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen, I move to  strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady).    I thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing  this issue to our attention. The committee takes seriously reports of  Americans abroad being treated unfairly, denied due process, or being  used as political pawns.                                time  1630    Colombia is a friend and ally of the United States and an important  trading partner. We expect the Government of Colombia to ensure our  citizens are treated fairly in their courts. The committee will follow  up on this matter with the Department of State to ensure our Embassy is  engaged on this issue. And I thank the gentleman for bringing this  matter to our attention.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 97 Offered by Mr. Hastings     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    As I mentioned in my statement, Mr. Chairman,  the bill before us today contains $3.1 billion in a Foreign Military  Financing program funded for Israel, which fully funds the last year of  the current memorandum of understanding with Israel.   This amendment would reduce the Foreign Military Financing program  account by more than $80 million. In addition to Israel, this account  provides funds for Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Colombia, and Ukraine. The  President's budget request proposed deep cuts to this account, which we  clearly rejected in the committee mark.   I should also note that the bill already provides over $6 billion for  humanitarian assistance. I do appreciate the gentleman's desire to help  the Ethiopian-Israeli community, but I cannot support an $80 million  cut to security assistance. So I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Florida for raising this important issue. The plight of religious  and ethnic minorities persecuted by ISIS has been, and remains, a  priority for this committee, including the need for psychosocial  support services to those affected by the crisis. That is why ample  funding has been provided to assist communities affected by ISIS,  including persecuted religious and ethnic minorities.   The fiscal year 2017 Security Assistance Appropriations Act provided  over $1 billion for programs to counter ISIS and address the needs of  those affected by ISIS. Funding was also provided in the fiscal year  2017 regular appropriations bill.   Finally, we included language on this very issue in the fiscal year  2018 bill, including designating $10 million for programs to protect  vulnerable and persecuted religious minorities. The amendment, however,  would reduce the Foreign Military Financing account by more than $70  million. This account funds our friends and allies like Israel, Egypt,  Jordan, Tunisia, Colombia, Ukraine. The President's budget request  proposed deep cuts to this account, which we clearly rejected in the  committee mark.   In short, we have already addressed the gentleman's concerns, and I  cannot support such a large cut to security assistance.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the overseas scholarship  programs are popular among our Members because most of these programs  support American educational institutions abroad.   Students that participate and receive an education based on American  values help shape their societies. They are more likely to embrace  democratic principles, counter extremism, and foster greater economic  opportunity. These programs are an important part of the so-called soft  power of America.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I really appreciate the  gentleman's concern, but not enough to support his amendment. As he  knows, the administration proposed to close the United States African  Development Foundation.   Given the significant reduction in our subcommittee's allocation, it  would be very easy to agree to the administration's request. The bill  before us, however, does not close the foundation, but instead doubles  the requested amount.   If our conference allocation is more generous, then perhaps we can be  more generous with the foundation. Until then, however, the bill, as  reported out of committee, strikes, I think, the appropriate balance of  assistance and diplomacy.   Mr. Chair, I urge a rejection of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I want to take this time briefly to address the concerns the  gentleman from Florida has raised with regard to these organizations,  many of which I share. That is why the base bill includes some pretty  tough conditions on these organizations. In fact, these conditions have  never been stronger with regard to the U.N. Human Rights Council.   No funds can be provided until the Secretary of State certifies to  Congress that participation in the Council is, one, in the national  security interest of the United States and, two, the Council is taking  significant steps to remove Israel as a permanent agenda item and  increase transparency in the election of its members to the Council.   We raised these issues, Mr. Chairman, with Ambassador Haley when she  appeared before our committee. We all know she is actively engaging in  these matters, and our conditions give her additional tools which she  can use to get the Council to make some real reforms.   Next, the bill prohibits funds for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency  until the Secretary can certify to the Congress that this organization  is conducting regular inspections of its installations to ensure they  are only used for humanitarian purposes and that the content of  educational materials does not induce excitement. These conditions  provide Secretary Tillerson with leverage to demand accountability and  reform.   Also, we should be mindful that the President is reengaging with  Israel and the Palestinians on a Middle East peace deal, which we all  know is difficult and a very complicated task. Prohibiting funds to  UNRWA at this time may have an adverse impact on those delicate  processes the President and his team have before them.   This committee has and will continue to follow these issues very  closely. It is a top priority, and the tough conditions in the bill  reflect that.   I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.
