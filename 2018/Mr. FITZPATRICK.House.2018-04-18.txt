 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, April 22, is Earth Day,  and I am proud to recognize the significant event and to reiterate my  strong support for the environmental stewardship and conservation in  our communities.   From my days as a Boy Scout, I learned the true beauty of nature and  the value it brings to our community, and I still live by the Scouting  mantra: Leave the campsite cleaner than you found it.   I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Bowman's Hill  Wildflower Preserve, which held its annual symposium last month. This  event awards the Land Ethics Award for usage of native plants and an  eco-friendly design to create a sustainable habitat for wildlife and  for public education.   This year's winner was the Wilma Quinlan Nature Preserve Committee in  New Britain Borough. I would like to recognize the Wilma Quinlan Nature  Preserve Committee for their dedication to land conservation, and  congratulate them on receiving this award.   I would also like to thank and recognize Bowman's Hill Wildflower  Preserve's education coordinator, Kelly Joslin, for her role in  organizing this important event.                            ____________________
