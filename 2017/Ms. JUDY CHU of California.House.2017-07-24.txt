 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   To date, small business investment companies have assisted thousands  of high-growth businesses, providing over $100 billion in capital. The  key to the program's success is leveraging Federal funds to expand the  amount of private capital invested in promising small firms.   The Small Business Administration provides funding to qualified SBICs  with expertise in certain sectors of the economy. SBICs then use their  own funds and leverage from SBA to invest in small businesses. Their  actions have facilitated over 3 million jobs total and nearly $6  billion per year of investment in domestic small employers.   Yet this very success has pushed many SBIC licensees against the  leverage caps, in turn reducing the flow of capital to worthy small  businesses. Addressing the cap should be a priority to stabilize the  financial landscape. Failure to do so leaves employers without capital  to create jobs and expand our economy.   In recent years, Congress has raised the leverage limits for SBICs to  maximize the impact for family of funds licensees, but neglected to  assist SBICs that manage just one company. That leverage cap remains at  $150 million.   H.R. 2333, the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act, would  increase the cap to $175 million for a SBIC that manages just one  company. This change will enhance the flow of capital to small  businesses.   I am happy to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to add my appreciation to Chairman  Chabot for his support in the process. I commend his leadership and  Ranking Member Velazquez for their willingness to work in a bipartisan  manner. I am pleased to serve on a committee that takes their  responsibility seriously to help our Nation's small businesses prosper.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, expanding access to capital  for small businesses has been a top priority for both sides of the  aisle.   The SBIC program fills the gap in the capital markets for businesses  that have outgrown SBA's flagship 7(a) loan guarantee program, but  remain too small or risky for the private equity industry.   H.R. 2333 will help boost this program's success by changing how much  leverage a SBIC can obtain from SBA.   Specifically, this legislation is narrowly tailored to increase the  leverage limit exclusively for SBICs that manage just one company.  Increasing the capital will expand the flow of much-needed capital to  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2056, the Microloan  Modernization Act of 2017. This bill comes at an important time,  because the nature of small business financing has evolved. No longer  do many banks want to take on a business loan under $250,000, leaving  much of the Nation's small employers empty-handed.   Small entities don't always want or need large amounts of capital,  and find small loans sufficient to meet their needs, or they lack the  qualifications necessary to qualify for a bank loan. The SBA's  Microloan program helps fill this gap by serving entrepreneurs who are  not served by the private sector or SBA's 7(a) loan program.   This program has provided millions of dollars in financing and  technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs since its  inception in 1992. By providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries who,  in turn, lend funds to the smallest of small businesses, the program  helps borrowers streamline their operations, grow to profitability, and  create new jobs.   Microloans have proven to be incredibly valuable to prospective  entrepreneurs and to communities who badly need greater economic  opportunities. Despite the average microloan size being about $13,000,  these loans have changed the face of small business lending and how  small companies are funding their success.   H.R. 2056 offers a much-needed change by increasing the microloan  intermediary loan limit from $5 million to $6 million. It also raises  the cap on grant funds that intermediaries can spend on technical  assistance for prospective borrowers.   Microloans are labor intensive and require staff time, expense, and  risk. Technical assistance grants allows intermediaries to support  personalized and intensive technical assistance for those  microborrowers in their portfolio. Raising the cap will better serve  potential business borrowers by ensuring they are ready for that next  step: taking on a loan.   These changes will increase the reach of the program and will  ultimately go a long way toward creating opportunity for established  enterprises and those who dream of going into business for themselves.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, SBA's Microloan program fulfills a critical need in the  capital markets. It is a key resource for startup, newly established,  and growing small businesses, many of which come from traditionally  underserved markets, where personal and commercial credit are hard to  come by.   The Microloan Modernization Act of 2017 makes targeted reforms to  assist more of these small businesses, by raising the amount that the  SBA may commit to an intermediary and raising the cap on the amount of  grant funding for technical assistance.   These changes would further assist very small businesses to obtain  loans and, in turn, provide them greater opportunity to create and  retain the jobs that they need.   With no significant effect on the Federal budget, I can think of no  better time to make long-sought changes to improve the program. As  such, I once again would urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2364, the Investing  in Main Street Act of 2017.   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, accounting for two  out of every three new jobs. So as part of our commitment to creating  opportunities and growing our economy, it is our responsibility to help  more small businesses succeed.   The SBA's Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is an  effective tool that facilitates private investment into early stage  startup small businesses across the country, and all at no Federal  cost.   Tesla, FedEx, Apple, Intel, and Costco are just a few examples of the  thousands of small businesses that have successfully used the Small  Business Investment Company program during their early stages of  growth.   One of the SBIC program's greatest strengths is its hands-off  approach, giving fund managers the autonomy to invest in almost any  business sector they choose, from apparel to cutting-edge technology.  This freedom, coupled with sound investment strategies, has led to its  success.   In fact, in 2016, the SBIC program provided $6 billion in financing  to 1,200 small businesses and helped to sustain over 120,000 jobs. It  has afforded America's small businesses an invaluable opportunity to  grow their innovative ideas.                                time  1645    However, the SBIC program is currently restricted from taking more  than 5 percent of capital investments from banks due to an outdated  provision in the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. At the same  time, current banking regulations established by the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency allow these banks to invest up to 15  percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs.   The Investing in Main Street Act will correct this discrepancy by  allowing banks and Federal savings associations to invest up to 15  percent of their holdings to these funds to match current banking  regulations. This change will strengthen and grow the SBIC program,  unleashing more capital to small businesses, and all at no cost to the  taxpayer. That means more entrepreneurs will be able to access the  capital they need to grow their businesses and hire more workers.   This legislation makes a sensible change to address the number one  need of small firms: accessing capital.   I would like to thank our cosponsors, Representative Knight and  Representative Meng, for their support, and I ask my fellow Members to  support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the ranking member of the  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every small  business. The SBIC program fills the gap between the availability of  venture capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth  situations.   The SBIC program has long been an important way of channeling capital  to leading-edge, high-growth companies. In fact, some of the Nation's  most successful corporations received early-stage financing from SBICs.  Without it, they may not be the companies that they are today.   The key to the program's success is leveraging Federal funds to  increase the amount of private capital invested in such promising  startup companies. By dramatically increasing the amount of capital in  the SBIC program, the changes made by H.R. 2364 will result in  significant small business investment. As such, I once again urge my  colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H6183]]
