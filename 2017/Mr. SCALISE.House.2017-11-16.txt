 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague  from Texas. Chairman Brady has done an incredible job at bringing this  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to the House floor.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 16, 2017, on page H9407, the following appeared: Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Texas.      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Texas.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Today is an historic day, Mr. Speaker. For families who for so long  have been calling out saying that they want to pay less in taxes, we  answer that call today, Mr. Speaker.   When you have heard the complaints, as I and so many others have  every time we see a company move more jobs overseas, good, high-paying  jobs overseas because America has the highest tax rate in the  industrialized world, we finally do something about that today, Mr.  Speaker, by cutting the corporate rate so that we can be competitive  again and so that we can bring those jobs back home.   Let's talk about something else that is going to be a benefit to  hardworking families in this bill, Mr. Speaker. We finally simplify the  Tax Code in a way that over 90 percent of American families will  actually be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Just think of how  much that is going to save for people who have to pay to have their  taxes done because the Code is so complicated and has become so massive  that nobody can figure it out. We simplify the Code.   Let's go through those things.   We lower tax rates. Everybody is going to see lower tax rates at  every income level.   We double the standard deduction from $12,000 to $24,000 that every  family can take advantage of now. That doubled standard deduction is  going to be a big win for hardworking families that are struggling.   We eliminate special interest loopholes, Mr. Speaker. You might hear  a lot of complaints out there from people who have been able to get  their little piece of the Tax Code. The problem is, every time somebody  gets a special interest loophole, it costs the rest of us. Now we get  rid of those loopholes so that everybody can pay less in taxes. That is  a big win for hardworking families.   Mr. Speaker, in our bill, we completely repeal the death tax,  probably one of the most immoral parts of our Code, where small  businesses, family farms, if their loved one dies, the first thing they  are thinking is grieving for their loved one, but immediately after,  they get a big tax bill from the Federal Government that, in many  cases, forces them to sell their small business instead of passing it  on to their family. That is part of the American Dream. They pay taxes  on it. We repeal the death tax.   We deliver a much fairer Code, Mr. Speaker. Again, what this bill is  about is finally putting more money in the pockets of hardworking  families. It is about getting our economy moving again and creating  jobs.   Families recognize when they see the highest corporate tax rate in  the industrialized world, tens of thousands of jobs going to countries  like Ireland and Canada. I love Ireland and I love Canada. I just don't  want them to have tens of thousands of our good jobs. Let's bring those  jobs back. In our bill, we do that, Mr. Speaker.   This bill is a win for hardworking families. This puts money back in  the pockets of people who have been struggling so long, and it allows  the economic growth that is going to see wages finally increase. After  10 years of a stagnant economy, it is about time we finally answer the  call that millions of Americans have been asking us to do for so long,  Mr. Speaker.   Let's pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and get our economy moving  again.
