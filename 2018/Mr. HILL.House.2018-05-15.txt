 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 2018 winners of  my office's Educational Award Program.   Each year, my office recognizes students who have shown their  continued dedication to excelling academically, leading in their  schools, and improving in their communities. Since 2015, we have  recognized 91 juniors and seniors from 29 high schools across Arkansas'  Second Congressional District. These students have continuously  demonstrated a strong commitment to community service, leadership,  teamwork, and high academic achievement.   It is my sincere hope that the receipt of this award serves not only  as an honorarium for these exceptional students, but also as motivation  for other central Arkansas students to strive for the highest levels of  excellence both in and out of the classroom. I wish them all the best  as they continue their studies.                Recognizing the Achievements of Edward Poletti     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of  Edward Poletti, chief of learning resources at Central Arkansas  Veterans Healthcare System.   The Library of Congress' Federal Library and Information Network has  awarded Mr. Poletti with its Federal Librarian of the Year Award. Along  with this honor, his name will be added to a perpetual plaque listing  each year's recipients. Mr. Poletti is being awarded for his skill in  survey designs, statistics, and for providing his statistical talents  to many other librarians needing assistance with data interpretation  and survey design.   He is also receiving the Lois Ann Colaianni Award for Excellence and  Achievement in Hospital Librarianship from the Medical Library  Association.   I honor Mr. Poletti's 36 years of service as a Federal librarian,  assisting so many throughout Arkansas and the Nation.       Recognizing Susan Cookus, National Female Volunteer of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Susan Cookus of the  Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System for being named National  Female Volunteer of the Year.   The National Advisory Committee of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Voluntary Service named Ms. Cookus the National Female Volunteer of the  Year after reviewing nomination letters from the Central Arkansas VA  and from our veterans in central Arkansas.   Susan's dedication and service to veterans and their needs have  earned her a great deal of appreciation, recognition, and respect over  the years.   Ms. Cookus is also a member of the Soldiers' Angels, a Texas-based  nonprofit that provides aid and comfort to the men and women of the  U.S. armed services, their families, and an expanding veteran  population. Ms. Cookus  [[Page H3938]]  volunteered more than 570 hours and helped distribute more than  $720,000 in donations in the past year brought in by Soldiers' Angels.   There is no one more deserving of this award, and I am proud to have  such a dedicated member of my district volunteering and helping our  veterans.     Recognizing the Lifelong Service of Esther Crawford and Emma Wilbert     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lifelong service  of two constituents of mine, Esther Crawford and Emma Wilbert, both of  whom were recently inducted into the North Little Rock, Arkansas,  Senior Citizens Hall of Fame.   Esther serves as a board member for the North Little Rock Education  Foundation and the William F. Laman Public Library. She has earned the  designation of Most Vital Pal at the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer  Institute for all of her help to their multiple myeloma patients.   Emma serves as activity director at the Campus Towers' senior public  housing facility in North Little Rock, after she retired from a 28-year  career with the U.S. Postal Service. She was elected as vice queen for  the Hays Senior Citizens Center's Red Hat Society chapter for 7 years  and serves in both the sanctuary choir and nursing home ministry of  Greater Second Baptist Church in Little Rock.   Senior Hall of Fame selections are bestowed every 2 years on  individuals for their significant contributions to North Little Rock,  Arkansas' senior citizens. I congratulate them.                            ____________________
