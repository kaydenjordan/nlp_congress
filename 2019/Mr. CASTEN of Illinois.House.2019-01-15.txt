 Madam Speaker, today I will cast my vote in  favor of H.R. 136, The Federal Intern Protection Act of 2019. But I  will do so with the concern that it does not go far enough. This bill,  for all of the improved protections it does afford, fails to provide to  Federal interns with the basic safeguards against harassment that are  common to their counterparts in corporate America.   Having spent 16 years as a CEO of companies ranging from 10-200  employees, I know this subject well. In my private-sector workplaces,  our harassment policies protected paid and unpaid employees from  harassment as this bill does. But those policies did not stop there. We  also prohibited harassment against any contractors or suppliers who  were on our premises or who were working with our staff in environments  that were reasonably considered to be work related--for example, at an  off-site dinner meeting.   We then went further still and required that any contractors or  suppliers who required access to our facilities also agree to be bound  by those policies. We did not do this out of legal obligation, but  because it made our workplaces and employees safer and more productive.   I respectfully submit that we should do the same in this body. To be  sure, it may be difficult for us to obligate anyone in our offices to  be fully bound by our policies. But surely we can provide a safer  workspace not only for our paid and unpaid employees but also for  committee staff, and staff from other Members' offices, as well as  visitors.
