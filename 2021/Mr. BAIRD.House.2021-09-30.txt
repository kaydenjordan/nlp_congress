 Madam Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the  Democrats' infrastructure proposal. This weekend the President said  that his Build Back Better agenda costs zero dollars and that it adds  zero dollars to the national debt.   With all due respect, I disagree. The CBO's report projects that it  will add $398 billion to the deficit. Further, this multi-trillion  partisan spending spree is projected to add as much as $1.75 trillion  to the deficit over the next 10 years.   This bill only dedicates less than 10 percent of its multi-trillion  dollar price tag to highways, bridges, and other projects. Less than 10  percent.   Last month, Republicans offered our own counter bill, the STARTER  Act, that offered targeted investments in core infrastructure that  meets our Nation's needs.   For years, Congress has worked together to get a targeted  infrastructure package across the finish line. Let's get back to doing  that.                            ____________________
