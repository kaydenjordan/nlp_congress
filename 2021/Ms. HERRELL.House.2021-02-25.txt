 Mr. Speaker, I first want to agree with the bill's  sponsor from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) that discrimination is wrong.   He went on to say the bill, H.R. 5, does no more and does no less  than to give LGBTQ people the respect and equality they deserve. But I  disagree because the bill moves us far beyond nondiscrimination and  toward a place of one side over another. It eliminates mutual respect.   Mr. Speaker, we can't be so anxious to protect one class of people  that we harm another. For instance, the bill forces churches in the  public square to do things that counter their deeply held beliefs. It  moves our Nation away from our Judeo-Christian values. It places women  in sports, in domestic shelters, and in the healthcare profession at  risk. It allows government to take an even more drastic step of making  decisions that should be reserved for our families.   The Equality Act is anything but. Let's not be fooled by the title.   It would, likewise, force both people and organizations in many  everyday life and work settings to speak or act in support of gender  transition, including healthcare workers and licensed counselors, even  when it is against their professional judgment. The Equality Act would  force healthcare providers to perform abortions and gender transition  surgeries against their deeply held religious beliefs. That is not  equality.   Any parent who does not want their child to go through gender  reassignment surgery at a young and vulnerable age would be  stigmatized, and there is a risk that their child could be taken away  or the life-altering surgery would be done with the blessing of only  one parent. This diminishes the ability of parents to raise their  children and to pass on their values. It is Washington, D.C., that  ultimately decides the morality of our children and our churches.   If this is truly about respect, then let's start with it here in this  Chamber. I must correct the record, and I take exception to being  labeled as someone who vilifies those across the aisle. That is simply  not true. No one on this side of the aisle has said ``less than'' or  ``illegitimate.'' These are the labels being used on your side, not by  me and not by my colleagues.   If we want to do what is right by the American people, then let's  start respecting one another in this Chamber. Let's start doing things  that are for the benefit of the people. Let's start understanding that  we are here to protect all lives. All lives matter.   But when we can't stop fighting and discouraging each other in this  Chamber, shame on us, because we are going to do a lot better for the  people who sent us here when we can start having civil conversation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  partisan wilderness package before us today.   This bill is yet another example of the majority taking steps to  prevent the creation of high-wage jobs and access to our public lands  all while ceding our energy independence to foreign adversaries.   This bill also contains provisions affecting Members' districts  without the support of those Members. These include the permanent ban  on mineral development on over 1 million acres of public lands in Mr.  Gosar's district in Northern Arizona, something he strongly opposes.   Also included, are countless new land designations in Mrs. Boebert's  and Mr. Lamborn's districts in Colorado--again, without their support.   The delays in permitting, coupled with the mismanagement of our  Natural Resources, our forests, and handing this all over to the  Federal Government for management, is a mistake.   We need more cooperation with the management of public lands with the  States and those that live on, in, or around or make their living from  these lands, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1815
