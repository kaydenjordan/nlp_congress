 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the extraordinary  acts of a few of our first responders, law enforcement officers, and  brave residents.   On Saturday, May 20, a 911 call was received for an 8-year-old  suffering from cardiac arrest.   Thanks to the swift response and unwavering commitment of the Carmel  Police Department, particularly Police Officer Thomas Eagan, who  arrived on the scene within 2 minutes and initiated the lifesaving  application of an AED, the 8-year-old's life was saved.   Also assisting were Sergeant Laura Whitten, Officer Michelle Yeager,  and Officer Brian Detz, who provided CPR, maintained scene control, and  assisted medics, while Detective Daniel Shea also helped.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Mahopac Volunteer Fire Department, with a  special mention to Assistant Fire Chief Rivera, who provided CPR, and  to the Putnam County ambulance, medic, and EMS teams that stabilized  the child and swiftly transported him to the Westchester Medical  Center.   The immediate actions of Good Samaritans Laura Spallina, Judith  Schoen, and Karen Tubman made a vital difference.   I also recognize Mircea Bors, who recognized cardiac arrest and began  CPR. His fast thinking set the stage for the rescue efforts.   I thank the other law enforcement agencies that assisted with the  safe transport of the child: Yorktown PD, Westchester County Police  Department, New York State troopers, and the town of Mount Pleasant  Police Department.   Through their combined efforts, an 8-year-old child's life was saved,  a family was spared epic grief, and the community was reminded of the  importance of our brave law enforcement officers and first responders.                            ____________________
