 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Nuclear Waste  Policy Amendments Act.   This bill is an opportunity to give the Department of Defense and our  Nation's nuclear plants a proper place to store spent fuel. It also  relieves a burden on our nuclear plants, which provide a critical  source of resilient baseload power to our electric grid. Furthermore,  nuclear plants provide good jobs to communities across the Nation, many  of which are in economically distressed areas.   Unfortunately, several nuclear power plants are prematurely closing  because of government policies. For a long time, I have repeatedly  warned the executive branch about the national security risks if too  many plants deactivate. I am glad to hear some Members across the aisle  are actually acknowledging this problem, at least partially.   In April, I met with Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station workers. I  told my constituents that I would do everything I can to protect their  jobs and the Nation's grid, and I meant it.   This bill addresses some of the uncertainty and added costs the  industry  [[Page H3895]]  faces, and it is one step in helping to secure those jobs and the  reliability and resiliency of our electric grid.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a big welcome home to the  three Americans who arrived early this morning back in the United  States, in their words, the greatest Nation in the world, following  their captivity in North Korea.   I commend Secretary of State Pompeo for his work to secure the  release of these Americans and to President Trump for resetting the  negotiating dynamic that led to this day. If we were following the  prior administration's strategic patience, they would still be  imprisoned.   With the freeing of these Americans and the other recent developments  on the Korean Peninsula, including what is reflected in this photo,  both North and South Korea removing their respective propaganda  speakers from the DMZ, one cannot help but recall the events of 1989,  in Eastern Europe, and the thaw that resulted in the freeing of half a  continent.   Today's homecoming is a positive step in achieving lasting peace, but  we still have a long way to go. It is a  [[Page H3920]]  shame that this could not have come to fruition in time for Otto  Warmbier's safe release.   Let us hope that, with the forthcoming talks between the United  States and North Korea, much more progress will be made.                            ____________________
