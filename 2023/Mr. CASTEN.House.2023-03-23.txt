 Mr. Speaker, I ask for a quick show of hands: How many of  us in this room have ever had someone  [[Page H1336]]  come into our office and ask to make the world safer for their  competitors? Me neither.   The Record will show that no hands were raised.   This is because there is no lonelier position in Washington than  being an advocate for free and competitive markets.   Competition is hard. Free markets are scary. That is why when markets  allocated capital to clean energy, cheaper energy, and it displaced  fossil fuel energy and $20 trillion flowed into ESG funds, the losers  came to Washington and got the majority of the people in this body, the  majority of people in this House to block that free flow of capital.   I thank the minority of my colleagues, and President Biden, who  blocked that from happening, who stood up for markets in spite of how  hard it was.   To my Republican colleagues who are being pressed by their donors and  their colleagues, in William F. Buckley's words: ``Stand athwart  history yelling, stop.''   I sympathize. It is hard and it is scary to support progress. It is  hard and it is scary to support markets. I hope that you will do what  is right in spite of that pressure.   There is no pride in only doing the right thing when it is easy, but  history will smile on the brave.                            ____________________
