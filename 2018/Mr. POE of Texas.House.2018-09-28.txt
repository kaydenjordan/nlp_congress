 Mr. Speaker, one in four women will experience  domestic violence during their life. Nearly three women are murdered by  their spouses every day. This is violent America in our time. Violence  in the family unit.   These crimes affect the spouse, the children, and the quality of life  of our community.   The Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, has helped women throughout  our Nation.   Lifesaving programs and resources have given victims of domestic  violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence a chance for a  better life.   My legislation to reauthorize the full funding of VAWA through 2019  will help victims of violence and support groups that work with  battered families. But Congress has only extended VAWA for 3 months.   Women affected by domestic violence deserve better than more delay.  Standing up for victims is not a partisan issue. Congress needs to  fully fund and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act because  domestic violence victims are people too.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
