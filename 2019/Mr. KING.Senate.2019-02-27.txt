 Mr. President, I rise in sadness and somewhat perplexed  because what we are doing in this colloquy is recreating a statement, a  letter, as the Senator from Minnesota outlined, that was sent by six of  our predecessors in December of 1986, warning about the dangers of  climate change, warning about what this can do to our country and to  our world, about costs, and about how we had to take action.   One of those Senators was George Mitchell of Maine, one of the great  legislators of the 20th century. I am honored to be in the seat that  once was occupied by George Mitchell and also by his predecessor,  Edmund Muskie. I think the story of the major environmental legislation  of the 20th century, sponsored principally at the beginning by Edmund  Muskie, the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, is worth mentioning, if  only briefly.   The most important point is that the Clean Air Act, one of the most  important and comprehensive environmental pieces of legislation in our  Nation's history, passed this body unanimously. It passed this body  unanimously.   It disturbs me that we couldn't agree on the time of day around here  unanimously these days. I don't know when this issue became a partisan  issue, but I deeply regret it because it is causing harm to our  country.   What I would like to do is step into George Mitchell's shoes for a  moment and read a statement that he himself wrote and made back in  1986, and you are not going to believe how prescient this statement is.  It could have been written yesterday. Here are George Mitchell's words:         The problem of global warming is one of immense       significance. It is the most serious and more pressing than       anticipated. Previously, most of the models forecasting the       rate of global warming focused on the air pollutants produced       by the combustion of fossil fuels. More recent data suggest       that trace gases may also increase the rate of warming by a       factor of two. This means that warming may be increasing       twice as fast as previously thought.        The data produced to date suggests there may be an average       increase in temperature of 1 deg.C since the beginning of the       industrial revolution.    This was in 1986. We are now at about 1.5 degrees centigrade.         Considering how much warmer this June has been than       average, a 1 degree difference may appear to be       insignificant, but an average of 1 degree increase could be       devastating, so the experts tell us. A 1 degree increase in       the average global temperature would melt glaciers--    That is happening--       and such melting would increase the sea level.    That is happening.         There are uncertainties in predicting how much the sea       level would increase in a particular area. In some cases, it       could be an average increase of a few feet; in others, much       more. For a coastal State like Maine and to other States       along the coastline, such an increase would be devastating.    To deviate from George's words for a moment, this is what we see  happening. We are now seeing what are called rainy day floods, flooding  in areas of our country along the coast that were rare. Six-month  events are now every high tide.   George Mitchell says:         An average of 1 degree increase in temperature could have       major impacts on agriculture. This country's Midwestern bread       basket could again become a dust bowl. More heat would mean       less water for crops and variations in growing seasons. It is       important to keep in mind that this average increase is       global in nature. It is not a national or regional problem.       If American farmers suffer for lack of water, so will farmers       all over the planet. If shorelines along our coasts are       flooded, so will shorelines everywhere in the world.        The enormity of this phenomenon is staggering, and we have       a responsibility to limit emissions of pollutants that trap       the heat in our atmosphere. As difficult, as immense, and as       seemingly remote as the problem is to our daily lives, we       cannot delay.    This was George Mitchell in 1986--we cannot delay.         There will be those who argue that more research is       necessary to completely understand the phenomenon and to       answer every scientific question.    We are still hearing that argument today--we need more science; we  need more studies; we are not sure.   George goes on:         As in the case of acid rain, such complete understanding       will come only after we flounder in the weight of our       shortsighted policies. This is one more indication that the       benefits of industrialization carry with them the burden of       controlling pollutants. These pollutants threaten our lakes,       fish, health, and forests today in the form of acid       deposition.        We will hear today that these pollutants also threaten the       future of our planet, which cannot tolerate such a sudden and       dramatic increase in temperature and survive in a form       familiar to us.    In 1986 George Mitchell said:         Solutions are possible and available. The statement       released at the conclusion of the Villach Conference in       Austria last October--    This was in 1985--       addresses the common nature of some of our environmental       problems. That statement said in part that ``climate change       and sea level rises due to greenhouse gases are closely       linked with other major environmental issues, such as acid       deposition and threats to the Earth's ozone shield, mostly       due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere by human       activity.''        Reduction in coal and oil use and energy conservation       undertaken to reduce acid deposition will also lower       concentration of greenhouse gases. Reductions in emissions of       chlorofluorocarbons--    Which we achieved--       will help protect the ozone layer and will also slow the rate       of climate change. The rate and degree of future warming       could be profoundly affected by governmental policies on       energy conservation, use of fossil fuels, and the emission of       greenhouse gases.    Those words were written 32 years ago.         The rate and degree of future warming could be profoundly       affected by governmental policies on energy conservation, use       of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases.    The testimony that they were intending to hear at the hearing that  George is describing demonstrated ``that such governmental policies are  needed . . . nationally and on a global basis.''   I pause on ``a global basis''--the tragedy of leaving the Paris  climate accord, because the only solution to this problem has to be  local, national, and global.   The testimony from Federal Agencies will be that the current  government policy is to conduct more research, a familiar refrain on  issues of this type. George Mitchell said:         What is missing in the Federal effort is action. The       problem of global warming brings another round of scientists       before us decrying the folly of waiting until it is too late       to  [[Page S1519]]       prevent irreversible damage. In the case of acid rain,       research has been offered as a substitute for much-needed       action. This policy has produced more bodies of water that       cannot sustain life, more trees that are dying, and more       people who find it hard to breathe.        The policy has produced more studies, not any meaningful       change in policy. I hope these two days of hearings will help       persuade the administration--    And the people of the country--         that inaction has its own costs, almost invariably higher       than the cost of action.    George Mitchell was right. The cost of inaction is invariably higher  than the cost of action.   George concluded by saying:         I represent a State that already has been affected by acid       deposition. I want to do all I can to keep Maine, the rest of       our country, and our planet from facing potentially more       dramatic environmental damage from global warming. The best       way to avoid these undesirable outcomes is to begin taking       action now to prevent further damage rather than spending       twice as much time and later money repairing damage.    George Mitchell was right in 1986. Tragically, he is even more right  today because we did not heed his call. We did not take action. We have  avoided action.   I don't want to be the generation that our children and grandchildren  look back on and say: Where were you and what did you do when the  climate was deteriorating, when the glaciers were melting, when the ice  sheets were melting, when the sea level was rising, when the storms  were increasing in intensity, when the wildfires were burning our  States? What did you do, Senator?   I, for one, want the answer to be ``I took action.'' The answer  should be ``we took action.''   Today, this is a challenge even greater--significantly greater--than  it was in 1986, but the very fact that people like Quentin Burdick,  George Mitchell, John Chafee, Bob Stafford, and David Durenberger saw  the future and predicted it so succinctly and profoundly should spur us  to the type of action that is necessary to meet, confront, and overcome  this most serious of challenges before us.   Thank you.   I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.
