 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Lowey for that gracious set- aside, and I wish to say that the American people expect Congress to  have their backs.   Our economy needs help with historic levels of unemployment bearing  down, and the HEROES Act will provide a bridge of support to save lives  and livelihoods of our families, workers, hospitals, and small  businesses on the front lines. Imagine those folks.   Let me applaud all of those still working, facing an unknown killer.   A huge win within this HEROES Act is significant and direct  assistance to communities of all sizes that are hemorrhaging because of  the costs of fire, police, and emergency squads.   This legislation will finally make multiemployer pension plans whole  as well.   Today, the deep recession requires bold action by our Congress.  American lives truly are on the line here at home. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this lifesaving bill.
