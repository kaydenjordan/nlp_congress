 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Warren County native Kit Sekelsky for her success on ``Jeopardy!.'' In  2021, Kit won three games, taking home nearly $40,000.   Earlier this month, she had the opportunity to compete again as part  of the Second Chance Tournament. The Second Chance Tournament gives  champions from past seasons an opportunity to qualify for this season's  Tournament of Champions. Kit was able to make it out of the  quarterfinal before finishing second in the semifinal match.   While she was unable to move forward in the competition, Kit earned  the elusive ``Jeopardy!'' champion title.   Congratulations, Kit, on this special achievement.                            ____________________
