 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I support Mr. Rosenstein's nomination to  be Deputy Attorney General. Not only is he a very experienced and  accomplished attorney, he has served in the Justice Department for  almost three decades under five Presidents, but he served as the U.S.  Attorney for the District of Maryland under both President Bush and  President Obama--a very rare record of service. During his nominations  hearing to be Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein promised us that  he would ``work to defend the integrity and independence of our justice  department, to protect public safety, to preserve civil rights, to  pursue justice, to advance the rule of law and to promote public  confidence.''   However, many Members have mentioned they are concerned about the FBI  Director's announcement of an investigation of Russia. And during his  nominations hearing, Mr. Rosenstein was repeatedly asked if he would  commit to appointing a special counsel to handle any investigation in  this matter. I was impressed with his unfailing commitment to  independence when he answered these questions.   Rather than prejudge investigations before he knows the facts, he  unwaveringly promised to make decisions only after thoroughly reviewing  all the relevant information in a particular case. He committed to not  prejudge the situation before he knew the facts. And he committed to  conducting every investigation with independence.   I personally believe Mr. Rosenstein possesses the necessary  independence to conduct any investigation of this type. He told us he  had never met with Russian officials nor has he spoken to the President  or Attorney General about this matter. And he spoke in great length  about his career-long commitment to independence and to conduct his  work free from political concerns.   In fact, we already know that he has a well-known reputation for  independence. In 2012, Attorney General Holder specifically asked Mr.  Rosenstein to handle a special investigation into leaks of classified  information because of his reputation for independence and  impartiality.   When Republicans suggested a special prosecutor might be appropriate,  members of the Judiciary Committee assured us that none was necessary  precisely because Mr. Rosenstein was at the helm of the investigation.  One member of the Committee described him as a ``scrupulous man'' and  ``independent.'' There was ``no reason to believe why [he] cannot work  with the FBI and assemble a very strong prosecution team where  warranted.''   Mr. Rosenstein is still scrupulous and independent. If Mr. Rosenstein  could conduct an investigation with independence under Holder then, he  can certainly do it now. Furthermore, Mr. Rosenstein comes with high  recommendations from a bipartisan list of former Attorneys General and  Deputy Attorneys General. And he comes with high recommendations from  his home state Senators, current and former.   Former Senator Mikulski wrote the committee and told us that he will  be a ``strong, experienced leader at the Department of Justice who is  fair and committed to the equal application of our laws'' and ``In  these polarized times, now, more than ever we need a strong,  experienced leader at the Department of Justice who is fair and  committed to the equal application of our laws. I hope the Senate will  confirm Rod Rosenstein for this important position.''   After Senator Cardin described all Mr. Rosenstein's professional  accomplishments when he was introducing him at the hearing, he said,  ``What impresses me the most, he has done this in a totally non- partisan manner.'' And concluded by saying, ``I think Mr. Rosenstein is  the right person at the right time for Deputy Attorney General.''   Finally, James Cole, President Obama's Deputy Attorney General, wrote  to inform the committee that Mr. Rosenstein will respect the need for  the Department ``to not only enforce the laws, but to also maintain a  level of independence that enables it to have credibility in the eyes  of our citizens.''   From all I see and know about him, I believe Mr. Rosenstein will keep  his promise for integrity and independence. He promised us if he is  confirmed as Deputy Attorney General, ``all investigations under my  supervision [will] be initiated and conducted in a fair, professional,  and impartial manner, without regard to political considerations.'' We  can't ask for anything more. I urge all my colleagues to join me in  voting to confirm Mr. Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time  postcloture on the Rosenstein nomination expire at 5 p.m. today and  that, if confirmed, the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action and the Senate resume consideration of the Acosta  nomination.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
