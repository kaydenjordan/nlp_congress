 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a mother of a Loyola Cub, a formidable rival  to the Mater Dei Monarchs, but I have the courage enough to say that  Mater Dei is a world-class high school that prepares young men for the  highest echelons of sports, academic, and life achievement.   They own that accolade in part to the legendary coach, Bruce  Rollinson.   Coach Rollo, as he is affectionately known, has been as committed to  winning high school national championships as he has been to developing  these students into productive young men.   Some famous Monarchs heralding from this fine school including  USC's--my alma mater--Matt Leinart, Matt Barkley, and Todd Marinovich.  They are all success stories in different ways.   I do want to add that the JV football is looking pretty Division I  ready this year, and they are a daunting lineup for anyone who is  trying to oppose them.   This is, as was mentioned, the only high school to produce three  Heisman Trophy winners.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share and have included in the Record a  quote from Heisman Trophy winner, powerhouse, and Pasadena-bred Bryce  Young, one of the best quarterbacks college football has seen in the  past decade. Yes, I said it.         Congratulations to Coach Rollo, who has had such a positive       impact in my life. From when I first entered his program, he       always believed in me and pushed me to be the best version of       myself on and off the field.        While he is retiring from coaching football, I know he will       always be there for the young men who had the privilege to       call Coach Rollo their coach.        I am honored to have played for him and now call him a       friend.
