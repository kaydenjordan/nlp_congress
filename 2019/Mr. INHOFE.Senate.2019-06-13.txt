 Madam President, I have heard from other sources about  Shannon Kent, to whom he is referring, and she is in fact an American  hero. Everything he said about her is very true; however, everything he  said about our President is not very true. Here we are, with probably  the best economy we have had in my life--    Madam President, I just want to comment that every time I  hear things about the President--you have to keep in mind that we have  the best economy we have had. Unemployment is at 4 percent. We are  better than we have ever been.   We went through 8 years with the Obama administration taking down our  military to the point where we allowed Russia and China to get ahead of  us in many areas, such as hypersonics, and now we are going into this  thing with a Defense authorization bill. But it is this President who  is changing--trying to overcome the problems.   I don't criticize President Obama because he was really feeling where  his priorities should be, and they have not been to defend America. He  set up this system that says for every dollar that you put into the  military, you have to put a dollar into nonmilitary, and that is just  not what we are supposed to be doing in this country.   So we are going to get to the point at which the American people are  going to be very proud that we are going to have systems, we are going  to have weaponry, we are going to be back to where we used to be and we  have been since World War II--having the best equipment, treating our  people the best, having the best troops. We already have the best  troops in the field. We need to do for them what they are doing for us.  That is what this bill is all about.   Again, this President has been very supportive in rebuilding the  military.   Look at the court system. Right now we have great new jurists. We are  up to over 40 appellate judges who now have been confirmed.   So good things are happening. This President is accountable for these  good things, and I can assure you that the American people know better  than some of the stuff they hear about President Trump. It is just not  true.   I want to get on record here because we have some votes coming up  having to do with the joint resolution of disapproval regarding arms  sales to Bahrain and Qatar.   These two Arabian Peninsula states are important to the American  partners in countering Iran and combating ISIS and other terrorist  groups. We depend on them. They are our friends.   Bahrain actually hosts about 7,000 U.S. personnel, and that would be  in the U.S. Fifth Fleet.   Qatar hosts about 10,000 U.S. personnel, as well as the Combined Air  Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base.   Through these arms sales, we can improve cooperation, enhance  interoperability, and help our partners defend themselves and our  American troops in the region. They are defending themselves. They are  defending our American troops who are over there right now. I really  get concerned when things like this come up. What is the rest of the  world to say when we treat our allies this way and we renege on a  commitment that we made?   Through these arms sales, we can improve cooperation and we can  improve our relationships in that whole part of the world, but, more  importantly, if we renege on these arms sales, we will undermine the  national defense strategy. The ``National Defense Strategy'' is a book.  I should have brought it down to hold it up. I normally do when we talk  about it. It is something in which Democrats and Republicans agree to  get America back on top; this is what we need to do. Part of this and  the recommendations of the national defense strategy made up of top  Democratic and Republican leaders in the field of defending America-- they are all in agreement that we can't renege on the commitments that  we have made on these arms sales.    I recall that the top NDS priority is competing with Russia and  China. That is one of the things that happened during the last  administration. All of a sudden we find we have peer competitors. We  have China and Russia doing things right now where they actually are  exhibiting better equipment and better resources than we are. So we  have to stand by our partners.   Make no mistake about it. If something happens and they can't rely on  us for their defensive needs, they are going to go someplace else.  Where will they go? Will they go to Russia? Will they go to China? I  can assure you, the main thing that people overlook is they are going  to get the arms from someplace. They will either get them from us or  they will get them from Russia and China.   I have to ask my colleagues who support this resolution, do you  expect Russia and China to ensure the freedom of navigation in the  Middle East against Iranian threats? Will Russia and China lead a  coalition to defeat ISIS? No. You know better than that.   Will Russia and China deter Iran from attacking our partners and  troops in this region?   I understand that my colleagues have concerns about Saudi Arabia's  terrible human rights record. I agree. I am offended by that. This is a  different issue altogether. This is an issue of whether we are going to  keep our commitment to our allies in that very sensitive region where  we need more allies. Or are we going to renege on our commitments to  them? Keep in mind, they are going to get them anyway.   I know that some of my colleagues disagree with the administration's  recent emergency declaration regarding arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but  the leadership has assured me that we will have a vote on Saudi Arabia,  so I urge my colleagues to raise their concerns about this at that  time. That is the appropriate time to bring this up.   More to the point, I urge them not to punish Bahrain and Qatar  inappropriately and not to undermine U.S. national security interests  in that region. The bottom line is everyone understands that Bahrain  and Qatar are going to get arms anyway. They are going to get them  either from us or from those who are our adversaries. That is why this  is so important. I strongly urge that we defeat these efforts that are  out there right now to try to stop the arms sales that are taking place  now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate BG Louis W. Wilham, assistant adjutant general of the  Oklahoma Army National Guard, for his extraordinary dedication to duty  and service to our Nation. Brigadier General Wilham will soon retire  from the Oklahoma National Guard after 31 years of service.   Brigadier General Wilham enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard  in 1987 and received his commission through the Oklahoma Military  Department's officer candidate school in 1989. Since then, General  Wilham has served in a variety of key leadership and staff positions  within the Oklahoma National Guard, commanding at the company,  battalion, and brigade levels prior to serving as the assistant  adjutant general and interim adjutant general. Throughout the course of  his career, Brigadier General Wilham has supported numerous  mobilizations for both State and Federal missions. In 2008, he deployed  to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving with the Joint  Area Support Group-Central in Baghdad. In 2017, while serving as the  interim adjutant general of the Oklahoma National Guard, Brigadier  General Wilham oversaw the mobilization of over 2,000 Oklahoma soldiers  and airmen in support of Hurricane Harvey.   During the course of Brigadier General Wilham's service to our  Nation, he earned awards and decorations, including: the Legion of  Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze  oakleaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation  Medal with one bronze oakleaf, Army Achievement Medal with three bronze  oakleaf clusters, Iraq Campaign Medial with one Bronze Campaign Star,  and Combat Action Badge.   On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I want to  personally thank Brigadier General Wilham and his family for over three  decades of selfless service to the State of Oklahoma and the United  States of America. He will leave a legacy of leadership and integrity  that will remain with the Oklahoma National Guard for many years to  come. I wish Brigadier General Wilham, his wife Jodi and their  daughters, Taylor and Shelby, the very best as he retires from military  service.                            ____________________
