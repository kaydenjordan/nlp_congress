 Mr. President, I am here today with my colleague  Senator Graham to express my profound concern about the humanitarian  tragedy that is currently unfolding in Idlib and northern Hama in  Syria.   It is hard to imagine that after 8 years of war, the greatest  humanitarian disaster in Syria might still be before us, because  clearly what we have seen in the past 8 years is a horrible  humanitarian tragedy, a civil war that has involved, really,  international players and that has led to the deaths of hundreds of  thousands of Syrians and to the displacement of millions more. But with  the escalated attacks that have occurred since late April, the Syrian  regime and its Russian and Iranian allies are threatening a population  of approximately 3 million there in Idlib. Of those 3 million, 1  million are children. This is a region that is strained by hundreds of  thousands of internally displaced people who have already fled from  Assad's forces in other parts of Syria and neighboring countries. Just  last Thursday alone, observers counted over 50 airstrikes in this  region from early morning to early afternoon, and that was on top of  artillery-shelling that was going on.   Last December, Senator Graham and I came to the floor to warn about  the dangers of President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from  northeast Syria. I felt very strongly about that because last summer I  had a chance to travel with Senator Graham to Syria, and we saw the  important work that the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent  Resolve and its Syrian partner forces were doing there. We saw  communities like Manbij city that had recovered after 3 years of  occupation by ISIS. We saw that Syrians were returning to that  northeast region of Syria where it was peaceful, and they were growing  crops again. We visited the market. We walked around without any fear  that terrorists were going to bomb us.    Local multiethnic residents saw the positive presence of U.S. troops  and the value of U.S. global leadership. In fact, as we drove down the  road and went by children, they flashed a ``V'' sign for ``victory''  when they saw it was the U.S. military.   Together with our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, we made  significant gains against ISIS, but that progress, sadly, is not  guaranteed. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now in Idlib is the  result of a confused U.S. strategy in Syria.   When I spoke on the floor here in December, I warned that a hasty and  ill-informed withdrawal could embolden ISIS and threaten the gains that  U.S. partners have made. We discussed the fact that it would also cede  the accomplishments of U.S. forces and our allies to Assad, Russia, and  Iran.   What we are seeing now in Idlib and northern Hama is Assad's and his  foreign supporters' military solution. We are seeing indiscriminate  bombing and shelling that destroys schools and hospitals and that sets  fire to farmers' fields. The latest surge in violence has killed dozens  of people. It has destroyed thousands of acres of crops. It has forced  another 300,000 people to flee their homes.   I would urge President Trump to listen to his military and diplomatic  advisers and to recognize that an absence of U.S. leadership in Syria  would give a free hand to Assad and to his Russian and Iranian allies,  because clearly they are not our allies.   The people of Syria face danger at the hands of ISIS and of their own  government. Unfortunately, they have  [[Page S3823]]  very few options left, but what they do have is the voice of the  international community, and it is now up to us to stand against the  carnage in Idlib once and for all.   I urge President Trump to use U.S. leadership to oppose the  humanitarian disaster that Syrian and Russian forces continue to create  in Idlib and northern Hama and to work with our allies to truly bring  an end to this civil war and this disaster that has been created, the  humanitarian disaster that has been created.   I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.    Mr. President, today, on behalf of the New  Hampshire congressional delegation, Senator Maggie Hassan and  Representatives Ann McLane Kuster and Chris Pappas, I wish to salute  the Mount Washington Cog Railway on its 150th anniversary. Once hailed  by famed showman P.T. Barnum as the ``Second-Greatest Show on Earth,''  the Cog Railway remains an engineering marvel and a one-of-a-kind  experience a full century and a half after its maiden voyage up New  Hampshire's highest peak.   A railway summiting 6,288-foot Mount Washington was first proposed by  New Hampshire native Sylvester Marsh, a retired meatpacker who made a  fortune working in Chicago. When he approached the New Hampshire State  Legislature for a charter to build his cog-and-rack system, Marsh  encountered some skepticism of his innovative design. Legend has it  that one lawmaker remarked that Marsh ``might as well build a railway  to the moon.'' Marsh got his charter in 1858, and his system found a  nickname, ``The Railway to the Moon,'' that it proudly uses to this  day.   Construction began in 1866 at the base of the mountain, and it took  engineers and builders 3 years to complete the 3\1/4\ mile track to the  peak. It opened to fanfare on July 3, 1869, as the world's first  mountain cog railway. One of its passengers that first summer was  Ulysses S. Grant, who became the first U.S. President to visit Mount  Washington. According to newspapers, the President was impressed with  the safety and simplicity of the locomotive's air brake system.   The Cog Railway's locomotives embraced technology and ingenuity to  push passenger cars up the track and slow their descent. The first  locomotive, nicknamed ``Old Peppersass'' because of its likeness to a  pepper sauce bottle, mounted a vertical boiler on twin trunnions in  order to keep it upright as it climbed the steep grade. Old Peppersass  was eventually replaced in the late 1800s by a fleet of more modern  coal-powered steam locomotives, but it remains preserved and on display  [[Page S3840]]  at base station. Today, under the direction of current owner Wayne  Presby, most locomotives are powered by state-of-the-art biodiesel  technology. The new trains are faster, quieter, cleaner, and more  efficient, but the Cog Railway still uses a couple of steam locomotives  for those who want to experience the trip as it was years ago.   While the locomotives may change with the times, one feature of the  Cog Railway has remained a constant: Personnel must maintain a  resilient system capable of withstanding extreme and unpredictable  weather. Winters come early and leave late atop the Northeast's highest  peak, often burying the mountain in several feet of snow. Mount  Washington is famous as the site of one of the fastest recorded wind  speeds in history: 231 miles per hour in 1934. The Cog Railway weathers  torrential rain, heavy snow, blustering winds, and even hurricanes. A  severe hurricane battered the mountain in 1938 and destroyed Jacob's  Ladder, a steep, curving trestle near the top of the mountain. It was  quickly rebuilt with the help of Dartmouth College.   The White Mountains are a majestic site, and there are few better  places to behold this beauty than the Mount Washington Cog Railway. It  offers spectacular views and brings you to a summit where you can see  up to five States and into Canada on a clear day. Moreover, riding the  Cog Railway is an experience that ties riders to Sylvester Marsh and a  century and a half of steam, steel, and many unforgettable memories.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, we ask our colleagues and  all Americans to join us in congratulating the Mount Washington Cog  Railway on 150 years of service and wishing its staff and many  supporters all the best in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my defense  fellow, Jenny Tsao, and Pearson fellow, Anthony Pirnot, be given floor  privileges for the remainder of the first session of the 116th  Congress.
