 Madam President, before I begin some remarks, I would  like to advise the desk that I will deliver a portion of my remarks in  Spanish.    Madam President, I rise today profoundly humbled by the  people of California for placing their trust in me to serve and  represent them for a full term in the U.S. Senate.   It is a tremendous honor to return to this body, and I also recognize  that it is also a tremendous responsibility.   To the people of California, thank you, and please know that I will  work hard every single day to uphold that trust.   And to my colleagues who have helped me hit the ground running since  my first day in the Senate 2 years ago, thank you, and that includes  California's senior Senator, Dianne Feinstein, who has served the State  of California for over three decades as a trailblazing public servant  and a model for principled leadership, whom I have been honored to  serve alongside.   And I will always be thankful for my parents, Santos and Lupe  Padilla, for all they did for my brother, my sister, and me growing up.   And, of course, I could not be here without the love and support and  often the patience and understanding of my wife Angela and our three  boys, Roman, Alex, and Diego.   Now, as the first Latino elected to represent California in our  State's history, it is not lost on me what this moment means for  millions of people back home. I understand that my family's story is a  reflection of what so many other hardworking families have experienced.   As I have shared many times before, my parents emigrated from Mexico.  They came to the United States in search of a better life. For 40  years, my dad worked as a short order cook and my mom cleaned houses as  they raised the three of us in the proud, working-class community of  Pacoima, CA, in the San Fernando Valley.   I am proud of our family's journey, but it wasn't without our share  of challenges. I remember what it looked like to see our neighborhood  neglected, navigating everything from buckled sidewalks to drug dealers  as we walked to and from school.   I remember what it was like for our family to live paycheck to  paycheck--my mom, at times, bartering the mechanic, offering some of  her homemade tacos for just a little bit more time to pay the bill.   And when it came time to figuring out how I was going to pay for  college, I remember filling out the financial aid forms and realizing  that tuition alone at MIT was a larger amount than my dad's W-2.   But it is because of their hard work and sacrifices that I stand here  today. The very idea that a first-generation son of a short order cook  and a housekeeper is now serving in the U.S. Senate is proof of the  American dream.   But that dream has never been about passive participation. It is made  possible by those who work for it and by those willing to defend it and  expand it. It is about hopeful goals for a better future and the  ambition to work towards them. It is about the drive to get up each  morning before the sun rises, to put on a white apron, and push through  tired eyes and a sore back because you know that someday your kids can  have it better.   And if my parents are my inspiration for being here, then my children  are my motivation for fighting to keep the dream alive. I am one of the  few Members of this body blessed to still have young kids at home. So  when we talk about the future of our country or the future of our  planet, it is not in the abstract. I think of Roman, Alex, and Diego  and their generation. They are the generation who will carry on these  monumental tasks and fight for equality and opportunity in the future.   So, colleagues, we have to be focused on doing the work today to make  sure the American Dream is alive for them tomorrow.   So I ask: Who is willing to defend the dream? And what are we willing  to do to defend it?   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   Who is willing to defend the American dream?   Today, I am here before you as the first Latino elected to represent  California in the Senate. It is a dream come true because my family's  story reflects what many working families have lived in this country.   My parents, Santos and Lupe Padilla, emigrated from Mexico to this  country in the sixties.   For 40 years, my father worked as a cook, and my mother worked  cleaning houses.   I am here today thanks to their sacrifices, and they continue to be  my inspiration.   Now it is our turn to defend the dream for the next generation.  [[Page S410]]    When we talk about the future of our country, or the future of our  planet, I think about my sons Roman, Alex, and Diego.   They are my motivation to continue working for a better future, and  to continue defending the American dream.   (End of Spanish translation).    You know, my first 2 years in the Senate, we have made real progress  to keep the dream alive for millions of Americans--from giving families  the extra support they needed to get through a once-in-a-century  pandemic to lowering healthcare costs to passing the largest investment  in history to confront the climate crisis--but we can't stop now.   American prosperity over the next 6 years--the survival of the  American Dream--means keeping up the fight to level the playing field,  and that starts with addressing some of the most urgent threats  standing in the way of that dream.   You know, just last month, over the course of 3 days--3 days--my home  State experienced three back-to-back-to-back mass shootings that  claimed the lives of 19 Californians.   I was returning home from visiting a victim resource center in  Monterey Park, CA, when I received word of the two additional shootings  in Half Moon Bay and in Oakland.   Americans are sick and tired of the Republican excuses and the gun  lobby rhetoric. No one can deny that we have a gun violence problem in  America. When gun violence is the leading cause of death for children,  how can we say they have the opportunity to achieve their dreams?   So I refuse to grow numb to the epidemic of gun violence. And I still  have hope that we can prevent future tragedies with commonsense  policies like universal background checks and an assault weapons ban  that has been proven to save lives.    This winter California also experienced a relentless stream of severe  weather--rain storms, flooding, and mudslides--that caused over $1  billion in damages. I welcomed President Biden and Vice President  Harris to survey the storm damage in California, and they have been  exemplary partners both in disaster response as well as efforts to  rebuild our communities. But the process to rebuild is ongoing, and we  will need to work together to get the impacted areas the resources they  need.   Let me be clear that, despite the record rainfall that dominated the  news last month, California and our fellow Western States are still  suffering from a crippling drought. Californians know all too well that  natural disasters and extreme weather whiplash have become the new  normal in the 21st century. Each year we brace for increasingly  frequent and devastating wildfires, catastrophic flooding and  mudslides, and searing droughts. They all point to one thing: the need  for climate action.   Our very survival depends on our ability to combat the climate  crisis. We must continue to step up our efforts to protect our planet.  Yes, that means eliminating carbon pollution and transitioning to a  clean-energy economy, and it also means fighting for clean air and  water, particularly for the more vulnerable communities  disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution. And it means  protecting and managing our Federal lands and waterways.   At times, that means making difficult and innovative decisions to  preserve our resources and protect our communities. For Western States  that rely on the Colorado River, that means coming together to find  consensus on a water agreement that prevents disaster and preserves the  human right to water.   We must also reform our outdated immigration system and do so in a  way that better reflects our values. That means creating a pathway to  citizenship for the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who live in daily  fear of deportation from the only home they have ever known and for all  the essential workers who kept us safe and our economy going throughout  the pandemic.   It means making sorely needed updates to our legal migration system  by addressing the crippling visa backlog that keeps families apart and  denies our economy the workforce that it needs. And it means ensuring  that individuals and families who are fleeing horrific conditions in  their home countries and seeking asylum in the United States are  treated humanely and provided due process.   Our Nation is also confronting a serious mental health crisis. Now,  this crisis existed well before COVID, but we saw the pandemic  exacerbate the crisis. Demand for healthcare is way up, while we have  an increasing shortage of healthcare professionals available.   This is also a critical opportunity to fundamentally end the stigma  surrounding mental health. You know, if a family member or a friend  breaks their arm or leg, we don't judge them for going to the hospital  to seek help. Nobody looks down on somebody for going to the dentist  for regular checkups. We need to treat mental health the same way.   And, finally, at a time of rising nationalism around the world, we  must secure the foundations of democracy. For those who say that  legislation to protect the sacred right to vote in America is too  partisan, they are only right in the sense that attacks on our right to  vote are partisan.   We must denounce Republican candidates across the country who choose  to divide the American people with lies and conspiracy theories. As  long as Republican-led State legislatures work to pass voter  suppression laws across the Nation or election deniers put our election  workers in danger, we have more work to do.   And as long as millions of eligible Americans have yet to exercise  their right to vote, including the roughly 80 million who did not vote  or were unable to vote in an otherwise record-setting 2020 election, we  have more work to do. That work includes bolstering our cyber security  efforts, not just to secure the infrastructure of elections but to  combat disinformation from bad-faith actors.   Now, I am not naive about the challenges ahead. After 2 years of  historic achievements, an extreme wing of Republicans now hold progress  in the House of Representatives hostage. This group has shown that they  would rather undermine our democracy than defend it. They would rather  risk a first-ever default by the Federal Government than serve the  interests of the American people.   At stake for millions of Americans are programs that they have spent  decades paying into, like Medicare and Social Security, American  institutions that define how we take care of one another and how we  provide dignity for seniors.   And they have set their crosshairs on a woman's right to make her own  decisions about her own body.   So we have a tall task ahead of us. But to the people of California,  please know that I didn't seek out this office because I thought it  would be easy. I did so because the issues are too important, and I am  ready--I am ready--for the difficult fight ahead because today we have  a responsibility to write the next chapter of American progress into  history, to join so many who came before us who made the American dream  possible.   When ``huddled masses'' came to our shores with the belief in a  better future, immigrants put in the work to build our country and our  economy and to make the dream a reality. When we celebrate America as  the land of freedom and equality, we recognize generations of civil  rights activists who risked everything for the right to vote and to  expand the dream to groups often denied it.   And when a man from Jalisco and a woman from Chihuahua immigrated to  Los Angeles in search of a better life, it was them--Santos and Lupe  Padilla--who toiled and sacrificed to secure the dream for their  children.   They are the American story. They are the American dream.   In closing, I just want to share that, over the last 2 years,  countless people have asked me if becoming a U.S. Senator is a dream  come true. My honest answer is no. You see, for me, when I was a kid  growing up, I never dreamt that anything like this was possible.   But, now that I am here, I promise I will not take a single day for  granted, and I will never stop fighting to keep the dream alive for  future generations.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Outdoors for All Act. This legislation would ensure that access to  local parks and outdoor recreation is equitable and available to all.   The Outdoors for All Act would codify and strengthen the Outdoor  Recreation Legacy Partnership Program at the Interior Department, which  provides grants to build new outdoor recreation spaces, improve  existing parks, and form connections between underserved, urban  communities and the outdoors.   It specifically invests in parks and open spaces in areas where the  majority of Americans live. Any single urban area or two adjacent urban  areas with a population of at least 25,000 can qualify for grants,  which can benefit residents in all 50 States.   These grants would fund projects in park-poor, urban communities, and  the bill would require the National Park Service to prioritize projects  that support underserved communities, provide job-training to youth,  and leverage resources through public-private partnerships.   As our cities grow and the effects of climate change intensify, this  bill will increase equitable access to the many benefits of local  parks, from job creation, to shade and tree cover, the reduction of the  urban heat island effect, and clean air.   Nationwide, 100 million people, including 28 million children, do not  have a park within a half-mile of home. That is almost one-third of  America.   Additionally, in the 100 most populated cities, neighborhoods where  most residents identify as Black, Latino, American Indian/Alaska  Native, or Asian American and Pacific Islander have access to an  average of 44 percent less park acreage than predominantly White  neighborhoods.   For example, in Los Angeles, low-income communities and communities  of color lack equal access to parks--a Los Angeles County survey found  that Compton reported only 0.6 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents,  in contrast to Malibu, which has 55.5 acres of parkland per 1,000  residents.   This bill would address this staggering inequity in Los Angeles and  across the country and make equity and justice a key focus of park  investment and planning.   I thank Senator Collins for introducing this legislation with me in  the Senate and Congresswoman Barragan and Congressman Turner for  leading this effort in the House of Representatives.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Outdoors for  All Act soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Rubio, Mr.          Lankford, Mr. Schmitt, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Hagerty, Mr. Hoeven, Mr.          Kennedy, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Budd):   S. 459. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide  enhanced penalties for convicted murderers who kill or target America's  public safety officers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
