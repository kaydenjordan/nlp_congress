 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio, and thank  Congressman Meadows, for working with me to improve the federal  government's transparency on disaster assistance spending and the  government's efficiency on providing communities with relief funding.   As fires burn across California and hurricanes continue to hit the  Southeast, it is clear that disasters are becoming larger, more  dangerous and frequent, and significantly more expensive. According to  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there have been more  than 2,400 federally declared disasters since 2000, totaling hundreds  of billions of dollars in federal relief aid.   Multiple federal agencies help communities recover from these  disasters. However, they do not coordinate when conducting damage  assessments, which creates duplicative work across agencies.   That's why I joined Congressman Meadows in introducing the Federal  Disaster Assistance Coordination Act. This bill is commonsense: it  requires FEMA to create an interagency working group to determine any  areas of overlap across agencies when conducting assessments used to  administer disaster assistance. It also requires the working group to  assess new technologies that may accelerate damage assessments  following disasters.   This bill, in coordination with two other disaster assistance bills  Mr. Meadows and I introduced together--the DISASTER Act and the Post- Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act--allow the federal  government to efficiently provide communities with disaster relief aid.  [[Page H8487]]    I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today, and I look  forward to the Senate acting on all three of our disaster transparency  bills.
