 Madam President, over the past week, Democrats and  Republicans have made important progress toward an agreement on the  national security supplemental. While the job is not finished, I am  confident we are headed in the right direction.   I want to thank all the Members and staff from Senate Democrats,  Senate Republicans, and the White House who worked through the weekend  to get us closer to an agreement. I can imagine that they are tired  after working nonstop, coming into the office early in the morning and  working furiously into the evenings. With the holidays around the  corner, they are sacrificing time with family, with their kids, and  have to put travel plans on hold to get this done.   I salute my colleagues and staff for their excellent work, and I am  encouraged by the progress we made over the weekend--significant  progress--and I urge them to keep going.   Now, we all know this is extremely difficult work--among the most  difficult things we have done in recent  [[Page S6014]]  memory. Everyone knows that something should be done to fix our broken  immigration system, but we can't do so by compromising our values.  Finding the middle ground is exceptionally hard, and both sides must  accept that they will have to make concessions. And it is going to take  some more time to get it done. But we must succeed. Democrats remain  committed to working with our Republican counterparts to reach an  agreement.   As these negotiations continue off the floor, we must also finish the  job on confirming military promotions and other nominees. In past  years, these four-star generals would have been swiftly appointed to  their posts. But this year, one Senator--the Senator from Alabama--has  broken decades of bipartisan tradition by placing blanket holds on  these highly qualified and dedicated nominees.   While I am glad the Senator has relinquished his holds, I am  disappointed it has taken this long, and we will still need to confirm  the last few of these nominees before the end of the week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 445.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.
