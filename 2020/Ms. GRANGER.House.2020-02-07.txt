 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5687.   While this bill is being sold as an appropriations bill for Puerto  Rico, it has more than $16 billion in unnecessary tax breaks which are  largely unrelated to the recent earthquakes that hit the island.   Also included in this bill are more than $4 billion in new emergency  appropriations, much of that for disasters that haven't happened yet.   And finally, this bill is premature, as Puerto Rico has funds from  previous bills that have not been used.   Over the last 3 years, we have allocated more than $40 billion for  Puerto Rico disasters, and less than half of that has been spent. And  we have all seen recent press reports about warehouses in Puerto Rico  full of water, diapers, and food that have not been distributed to  residents in need.   As for the recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico, the Federal Government  has not completed the required studies and reporting on the extent of  the damage.   While I, too, have been frustrated with the amount of time it takes  the Federal Government to distribute funds after a disaster,  appropriating funds before we know what is truly needed is not the  answer.   There are billions in the FEMA Major Disaster Relief Fund that are  already available and can be used toward earthquake response and  recovery efforts now, while we wait on a full and accurate report on  the damage and estimated cost.   When disasters strike, it is our job to ensure that the Federal  Government helps those in need. We also have a duty to ensure that  taxpayer dollars are used in a fiscally responsible manner.   Unfortunately, including tax breaks related to disaster recovery and  funds  [[Page H942]]  for disasters that haven't even occurred yet is not a good use of  taxpayer funds.   Again, when funds are needed, we will be there, just as we have been  there repeatedly for Puerto Rico for the last several years. But at  this time, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking  Member Granger for yielding.   Since December 28, Puerto Rico has experienced more than 2,100  earthquakes that have significantly impacted our southwestern region.  Actually, I was on the island on January 6 when a 5.8 earthquake struck  us, and then the next day, a 6.4, and then half an hour later another  6.2.   I thank the President for immediately issuing an emergency  declaration and, days later, a major disaster declaration, which  prompted immediate Federal assistance to the now 29 municipalities that  have been hit the most.   However, the seismic activity has not stopped. Every day the  infrastructure weakens. More roads and houses are damaged. The anxiety  of the people on the island grows; and that is why I stand here today  in support of this disaster supplemental package.   I am thankful to Chairwoman Lowey for introducing this bill. And yet,  in order to get this legislation enacted into law, in order to truly  get the aid to Puerto Rico and other States and jurisdictions affected  by natural disasters, it is imperative to have the input of both sides  of the aisles, Senate and House administration, and get this ready to  go.   So it is my sincere hope that, as we move forward with this bill, and  the negotiations that may begin as a result of it, that we keep in mind  that we are dealing with real people's lives and their suffering here.   Every week, every single week, when I go back home, I meet with  people who have lost everything due to the earthquakes. And again, we  are used to hurricanes, but we are not used to earthquakes, so this is  a completely new game in Puerto Rico.   I meet parents who are too frightened to send their kids to schools,  and families refusing to return home out of the fear that their houses  will collapse.                                time  0930    At one point, over 7,000 people were living in shelters, many  establishing campsites on the side of the road, in parks, and in open  areas. The devastation, my friends, is real.   It is true that the island has already allocated over $40 billion,  not $90 billion, in funding to respond to the unprecedented Hurricane  Maria. However, we are dealing here with an entirely different  disaster. And let me say, of all that money that has been allocated,  just $1.5 billion has been disbursed, so we don't have the cash, and we  don't have the funds that Congress already allocated 2 years ago.   The earthquakes are ongoing. The ground has not stopped shaking.  While FEMA and the administration officials are onsite, Congress cannot  wait until funds are depleted to act.   Madam Chair, I want to highlight also the tax provisions included in  this bill for Puerto Rico. Although some may argue that they have no  place in a supplemental, these provisions are vital for the long-term  recovery of the island and all those efforts.   I thank Chairman Neal for crafting this package, including  legislation that I have previously introduced, such as H.R. 302, to  provide families in Puerto Rico with one or more children the same  treatment currently given to island families with three or more kids  under the child tax credit; H.R. 1786, to make the rum cover-over tax  permanent on the island--we managed to include a 5-year extension, but  now this will make it permanent; and a provision extended to the earned  income tax credit for the island, which is similar to legislation I  introduced in H.R. 754.   I will always stand with the people I represent. I am the sole  representative of the people of the island, 3.2 million Americans. Yet,  we don't have a delegation in the House and in the Senate to support  and push for these kinds of bills. That is why I am supporting this  bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   What has happened in Puerto Rico, we don't know yet how much longer  these earthquakes are going to continue to happen. The U.S. Geological  Survey is saying that it may be a year, or it may be months.   Every time this happens, the infrastructure weakens. Again, it began  with just six towns. Now, we have 29 towns in the disaster declaration.   This is an ongoing emergency. I wish nobody would suffer what we are  suffering today without having a complete recovery from the hurricanes.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice), a member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the  ranking member for yielding again.   I think we have not understood the magnitude of this event. Yes, we  do have $40 billion in approved funds for Puerto Rico, but of that,  just $1.5 billion has been disbursed to the island. The rest of the  funds go through a different process.   Actually, in February of last year, there was the publication of the  guidelines to access $8.7 billion. Of that, just 1.7 got a grant  agreement in January of  [[Page H947]]  this year. So, again, in order to get the funds, it will be several  months before we have it.                                time  1015    That is the reason one of the concerns is that FEMA is getting the  emergency disaster individual assistance as we speak, the same thing as  the other Federal agencies that are doing the job on the ground.   But at the same time, we did have a power plant on the island that is  completely shut down, so we lost the power for a few days. Right now,  we don't have 500 megawatts reserved. Actually, if we do have another  earthquake or any other replicas, we may run out, again, of power  because our power plants were affected as well.   I do believe that roads and pipelines were affected. Government  buildings were affected as well. We haven't seen yet the amount of  destruction.   Again, you will see a lot of Puerto Ricans leaving the island. It is  happening already. It happened with Hurricane Maria. They flew to  Florida. We are depleting, basically, our island because of these kinds  of things.   Yes, we do need the money. We do need to help our people in this  stress. The tax provisions are good in this bill. Let me say, they are  not an invention from me. This House and Senate did a report in 2016  recommending the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and  many other amendments that treat Puerto Rico and the territories  differently. That is the reason we don't have enough resources to face  a lot of these challenges.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise to offer a question of the  privileges of the House previously noticed.
