 Mr. Speaker, since the start of the COVID-19  pandemic, we have seen an increase in scams targeting older Americans.  These scammers promise everything from COVID cures and take-home  testing kits to insurance and stimulus funds.   That is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2610, the Fraud and  Scam Reduction Act. This bill, championed by my friend, Representative  Lisa Blunt Rochester, includes my bill and Representative Marshall's  bill, the Protecting Seniors from Emergency Scams Act. This bipartisan  legislation ensures that the FTC makes available resources for older  Americans about the type and number of scams targeting their region. It  also requires an FTC report to Congress on that information so we can  prevent seniors from falling victim to scams during future pandemics.   While we may be closer to a vaccine, this will likely only increase  the number of these diabolical scams. Let's arm older Americans with  the right information to prevent themselves from falling victim. Let's  make locally specific resources available to caregivers already working  around the clock. Let's help the FTC win this fight against scammers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2610.
