 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an  obstacle that has stood before this Nation for many years, but that has  recently risen to new and alarming heights.   Last month, the United States national debt topped $22 trillion for  the first time in our history. This is $3 trillion higher than our  annual GDP and equates to over $67,000 in debt to be borne by each and  every American.   I understand this debt is the culmination of choices that all seemed  responsible in the moment. My colleagues and I entered public office to  serve the country. And, too often, it is tempting to fix society by  throwing money at our problems. However, this tactic mortgages future  generations for the benefit of the present.   Congress has a duty to serve not only their own generation but  generations to come, and we must exercise prudence to balance the  desires of the present with the needs of the future.   This $22 trillion problem will require strong resolve from strong  leaders.   Our Nation looks to us, this Congress, to correct the spending  mistakes of the past, and I look forward to working with you all to  clear a path for our future.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 13, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
