 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Stearns County Soil  and Water Conservation District for receiving the Source Water  Protection Award for 2019.   Each year, the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Rural  Water Association recognize water suppliers that conserve resources.  This year, the Stearns County facility demonstrated its ability to go  above and beyond to help save energy for the community.   Over the course of the year, the Stearns County facility updated its  wellhead protection activities and ensured its inventory met  contamination standards. Because of practices like these, the  constituents of Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District have access to  safe drinking water.   Additionally, these efforts worked to conserve water, saving money  for the county and bettering the environment.  [[Page H5923]]    The Stearns County Soil and Water Conservation District has worked  closely with grant programs to raise money for its efforts. The  citizens of Stearns County have better access to the services they need  because the district has put conservation and health first.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Stearns County Soil and Water  Conservation District for this outstanding recognition. We are grateful  for its work to help our district and the great State of Minnesota.                            Recognizing Dan Stoltz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dan Stoltz for  receiving the HERBIE Award.   This award from the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce recognizes  individuals that exemplify the traits inspired by its namesake, Herb  Brooks: humanitarian, enterprising, resilient, bold, inspirational, and  ethical.   Herb Brooks remains a Minnesota legend. As coach of the United States  Olympic men's hockey team in 1980, he led them to their gold medal  victory with his focus, determination, strong work ethic, and  inspirational leadership.   As CEO of Spire Federal Credit Union and in his everyday life, I can  attest that Dan Stoltz channels the energy of our Minnesota legend,  Herb Brooks.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dan for this well-deserved award. Our  community appreciates the generosity he provides every day.           Congratulating the Schlichtings, Farm Family of the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Schlichting  family for being named the University of Minnesota 2019 Farm Family of  the Year.   The Schlichting farm is a third-generation farm owned and operated by  the Rick Schlichting family. His grandparents homesteaded in Rice,  Minnesota, in the 1920s.   Since then, Rick has taken pride in the land his family has worked  and cared for by restoring some of the land to what it was like when  his grandparents first settled the property. In fact, close to 70 acres  have been reverted to original prairie.   The Schlichtings are dedicated to stewardship. In 2016, they were  honored with the Outstanding Conservationist Award by the Minnesota  Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.   I am honored to represent farm families like the Schlichtings. They  have dedicated themselves to preserving the land while doing their part  to feed the world.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Rick and his family for being named Farm  Family of the Year.                        Remembering Gabriele Grunewald     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the incredible life  of Gabriele Grunewald, who passed away far too early.   Taken by a disease that has impacted the lives of nearly everyone we  know, Gabriele was known by the world as an Olympic runner, star track  athlete for the University of Minnesota, and someone who fought cancer  every step of the way.   She used her story and her struggle to share a message of hope. She  did this by starting the Brave Like Gabe Foundation, which supports  research on rare cancers.   A cure is vital, but private and public dollars are necessary to fund  this work, which is why we have and should continue to fund the  National Institutes of Health.   We did not have a cure in time for Gabriele or for all the other  loved ones we have already lost, but if we continue to support medical  research and innovation, a cure will be found, and we can save future  generations from this awful disease.             Thanking Brent Hales for His Service and Leadership     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Brent D. Hales for the  service and leadership he provided to the University of Minnesota's  Extension program. I am also grateful for his participation on my  Agricultural Advisory Committee.   Brent's service to agriculture in Minnesota has been amazing. His  work to foster community development and innovation in agricultural  production has served our State well.   We have been lucky to benefit from his expertise and commitment.  While we will miss him, I want to congratulate Brent for his new role  as Penn State's director of extension. As he transitions out of this  service to the University of Minnesota on July 31, we wish him the  best.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Brent, and congratulate him on his new  opportunity.                            ____________________
