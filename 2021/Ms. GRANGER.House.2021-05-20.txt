 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3237, a bill to provide  funding for Capitol security and other purposes.  [[Page H2622]]    Unfortunately, after several weeks of discussion, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have chosen a path of partisanship instead  of working together. I want to explain how we ended up in this  situation.   In January, the Speaker of the House directed a retired lieutenant  general and his team to review security needs on the House side of the  Capitol following the events of January 6. This review was directed  without even consulting House Republicans or the Senate.   Even though the review by General Honore began as a partisan effort,  members of the Appropriations Committee hoped things could get back on  track and we could negotiate a funding agreement that could be  supported by both parties in both Chambers.   That is why it is so disappointing that we are now left with the bill  before us. This is a one-sided solution that does not even have buy-in  from Democrats in the Senate.   The bill we are considering today implements permanent  recommendations before ongoing security assessments are complete; it  creates a multi-million-dollar fund for future expenses at the Capitol  prior to knowing what is really needed; and it delays much-needed  reimbursements for agencies that have protected the Capitol since  January 6, such as the National Guard and the Capitol Police.   It also provides $200 million to establish a force within the D.C.  National Guard to respond to incidents at the Capitol, raising serious  concerns about the role of our military on American soil.   Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also  raised concerns about using the National Guard in this way.   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy,  has said that it is important for the Capitol to remain open and  accessible to the public and not feel like a militarized zone. I agree  with him.    Matters of such importance like this should be handled in the proper  way, marked up in the Appropriations Committee and authorizing  committees so that Members' positions can be fully considered.   At the very least, amendments to this bill should have been allowed  on the House floor today. Unfortunately, Members on both sides of the  aisle have been shut out.   Madam Speaker, the events of January 6 were tragic and exposed  serious security vulnerabilities around the Capitol complex, as well as  an inability to properly respond and act when intelligence is provided.   Congress must prevent anything like this from ever happening again,  but the bill before us today is not the solution.   There is no reason why we cannot continue discussing in good faith  and reach a bipartisan compromise.   For this reason, I must urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  package. I hope we can get back to the negotiating table soon.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington.                                time  0930
