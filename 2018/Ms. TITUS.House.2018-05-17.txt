 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill which, much  like the Republicans' tax measure, comforts the comfortable and  afflicts the afflicted. It will have devastating impacts on SNAP  recipients across the Nation, including one in seven in Nevada who are  on this program. It will take away food assistance from some of our  most vulnerable: young children, seniors, and the disabled. It will  also force families to jump through extra hoops in order to access  other needed benefits like assistance with their electricity bills.   We can and should be doing more to lift families out of poverty and  end hunger in the United States. Shamefully, this bill does just the  opposite.
