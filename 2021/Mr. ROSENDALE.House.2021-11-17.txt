 Madam Speaker, I rise to condemn Merrick Garland  targeting parents who express their views on how their children are  educated.   Recently, parents have risen up to voice their opposition to schools  indoctrinating their children with critical race theory, but Merrick  Garland won't stand for folks exercising their parental rights.   Merrick Garland testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that  he didn't think parents getting angry at school boards constitute  domestic terrorism, and that he could not imagine a circumstance where  they would be labeled as domestic terrorism.   Despite this, it is now clear Garland has weaponized the FBI's  counterterrorism division against concerned parents, using threat tags  to label and surveil them as domestic terror threats.   Parents have a right and an obligation to voice their opinion on how  their children are educated, and I wholeheartedly agree critical race  theory has no place in our classrooms.   Weaponizing the FBI against concerned parents is dangerous and an  absolute disgrace.   Merrick Garland must resign immediately. Thank God he isn't on the  Supreme Court.                            ____________________
