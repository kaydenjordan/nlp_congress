 Thank you, Congressman Raskin, and thank you for your  leadership with the Progressive Caucus and in articulating a positive  vision of what the American people need with a budget.   I want to address the issue of manufacturing because this President  went around the country campaigning on bringing manufacturing jobs  back. And there is a simple philosophical difference in what the  Progressive Caucus believes and the President's budget. If you believe,  as the Republicans do, that we need to cut taxes and have less  spending, you would be for this President's budget.   But if you believe, as we do, that the big issue facing this country  is good-paying jobs and higher wages, you would be for the progressive  budget.                                time  1745    Let me give you a concrete example. One of the programs that the  President cuts in the name of less government and lower taxes is the  Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Now, what does this do? What does  the Manufacturing Extension Partnership do? It actually works with  small- and medium-sized manufacturers across this country, many in the  Rust Belt, to help them be competitive, to help them compete against  currency manipulation, against unfair trade deals, to help them compete  against lower cost labor.   How does the program do this? It partners them with leading  technology companies to say, look, if you are a small- or medium-sized  manufacturer, maybe you should have cloud technology. Move your  technology off the factory floor and use the cloud to be more cost- competitive so that you can compete. Basically, the program helps to  bring and keep manufacturing jobs in the United States.   Now, here is the irony. You would think, oh, is this a liberal idea?  Is this the idea of Democrat, or a liberal Democrat? The irony is this  was Ronald Reagan's idea. It was actually a program instituted by  President Reagan in 1988 to help American manufacturers compete for the  21st century, and every administration has supported it.   One would think this President who ran on bringing manufacturing jobs  would say, okay, let's quadruple funding for the Manufacturing  Extension Partnership. Instead, he zeroed it out, zeroed out the  funding for manufacturing programs. The progressive budget says we want  to increase our investment in manufacturing. We want to actually help  the small- and medium-sized manufacturers create jobs in the United  States.   I have one more concrete example before I hand it back over to my  colleague, Mr. Raskin.   The Appalachian Regional Commission invests in helping to create jobs  across the parts of this country that most need that investment. I was  down in Appalachia visiting Hal Rogers' district, a distinguished  Republican who chaired the Appropriations Committee, and we saw the  Appalachian Regional Commission's investment in helping coal miners'  kids get jobs.   This Republican budget, this administration zeros out the funding for  the Appalachian Regional Commission. Instead, we ought to be increasing  funding in programs that are going to help transition folks from the  industrial to the digital economy.   I think my colleague, Congressman Raskin, will explain that the  Progressive budget is not just a moral document. It very much is, and  it keeps our commitment to seniors and to those in need, but it is also  a blueprint for job creation and good wages and for creating jobs in  precisely the places that need them most.   This is the big division in this Congress. Do you believe that the  big issue is that we need more tax cuts for the investor class, that we  need simply to cut government, or do you believe we need government to  partner with local leaders, with businesses, to create jobs and better  wages?   If you believe the latter, I urge you to take a look at the  Progressive budget and see our vision for job creation and higher  wages.
