         You may well ask: ``Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches       and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?'' You are       quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the       very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks       to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a       community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced       to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue       that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of       tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may       sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not       afraid of the word ``tension.'' I have earnestly opposed       violent tension, but there is a type of constructive,       nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as       Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in       the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of       myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative       analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for       nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society       that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and       racism to the majestic heights of understanding and       brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to       create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably       open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in       your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland       been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue       rather than dialogue.        One of the basic points in your statement is that the       action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is       untimely. Some have asked: ``Why didn't you give the new city       administration time to act?'' The only answer that I can give       to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must       be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will       act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of       Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to       Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person       than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to       maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell       will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive       resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without       pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must       say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil       rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure.       Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged       groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.       Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give       up their  [[Page S2008]]       unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us,       groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.        We know through painful experience that freedom is never       voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by       the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct       action campaign that was ``well timed'' in the view of those       who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.       For years now I have heard the word ``Wait!'' It rings in the       ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ``Wait''       has almost always meant ``Never.'' We must come to see, with       one of our distinguished jurists, that ``justice too long       delayed is justice denied.''        We have waited for more than 340 years for our       constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and       Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political       independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace       toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it       is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of       segregation to say, ``Wait.'' But when you have seen vicious       mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your       sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled       policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and       sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty       million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of       poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you       suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering       as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she       can't go to the public amusement park that has just been       advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her       eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored       children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to       form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to       distort her personality by developing an unconscious       bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an       answer for a five year old son who is asking: ``Daddy, why do       white people treat colored people so mean?''; when you take a       cross country drive and find it necessary to sleep night       after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile       because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day       in and day out by nagging signs reading ``white'' and       ``colored''; when your first name becomes [a racial slur],       your middle name becomes ``boy'' (however old you are) and       your last name becomes ``John,'' and your wife and mother are       never given the respected title ``Mrs.''; when you are       harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are       a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite       knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears       and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a       degenerating sense of ``nobodiness''--then you will       understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a       time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no       longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.     Mr. President, throughout 2 days of questioning in front  of the Judiciary Committee on which I sit, Judge Jackson proved,  without a shadow of a doubt, what we all knew to be true: She is  eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of our country.   Judge Jackson has the intellect, the integrity, and the temperament  befitting an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and she  doesn't have an ideological axe to grind. Judge Jackson is  exceptionally qualified and well regarded across the political  spectrum.   And yet not a single Republican voted to advance Judge Jackson's  nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and only three  Republicans have publicly expressed support for her.   So I ask my Republican colleagues: What is it going to take? What is  it going to take to put politics aside to support a nominee like Judge  Jackson? Because, clearly, intelligence, extraordinary breadth of  experience, and support from prominent conservatives--conservatives-- did not suffice. Clearly, a candidate who has support from  organizations from across the political spectrum--from the Black and  Hispanic U.S. Chambers of Commerce to the National Education  Association, with thousands of teachers; to the Fraternal Order of  Police, the largest police union--they would not be supporting somebody  who is soft on crime--to child advocacy groups that would not be  supporting her, either, if she was not being appropriate in her  sentencing of child pornography defendants. So even with this breadth  of support, she didn't make the cut with the Republicans on the  Judiciary Committee. So, clearly, a nominee who was uniformly called  ``brilliant,'' ``beyond reproach,'' ``first rate,'' and ``impeccable''  by her colleagues across the Nation was not enough.   So, truly, what will it take?   Sadly, some of my Republican colleagues resorted to unfounded and  misleading attacks in an unsuccessful attempt to smear her character.  To highlight how ridiculous the attacks around the sentencing of child  pornography offenses were, I asked Judge Jackson about the history of  the sentencing guidelines for these crimes and the concerns that these  guidelines do not reflect what is happening with child pornography  offenses.   And these facts bear repeating. A decade ago, the U.S. Sentencing  Commission first addressed the issue of sentencing in this area. Even  way back then, only 40 percent of convicted offenders were receiving  sentences within the guidelines. Now, 10 years later, even fewer  offenders are receiving sentences within the guidelines. In 2019, just  30 percent of non-production offenders were sentenced within the  guidelines. In the DC Circuit, in which Jackson served, the average  goes down to just 20 percent of offenders. This puts Judge Jackson well  within the mainstream in her sentencing in this area. She is not an  outsider.   I named numerous other judges nominated by President Trump and  supported by the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who have also  sentenced offenders to sentences well below the sentencing guidelines.  So these judges also expressed concern about how the sentencing  guidelines do not reflect the circumstances in the child pornography  cases of today.   I will repeat this. Judge Jackson is a mainstream judge. She has  issued decisions and sentences similar to other judges across the  Nation, including those nominated by both Republicans and Democratic  Presidents. Despite some of my Republican colleagues' attempts to  distort the truth to get more likes on Twitter, what Americans across  the country saw was an incredibly impressive, highly qualified  individual demonstrate that she has the intellect and the temperament  to serve on our highest Court. Throughout the course of this week,  Americans also learned about her character.   I was particularly moved to hear the testimony of an individual who  has known Judge Jackson for nearly 38 years--when they were in  elementary school. He said, in part:         Ketanji's incandescent brilliance was obvious to all of us       from day one. But even more importantly, she has always been       one of the kindest, warmest, most humble and down-to-earth       people I have ever met. All this, while still possessing       boundless charisma, drive, maturity, and grace.    These qualities, apparently from a young age, have clearly guided her  throughout her life and her career, particularly when it comes to  treating every single person she encounters with dignity and respect.   During the hearing, I asked Judge Jackson the same two questions on  sexual assault and harassment that I ask of all nominees--male and  female. In follow-up questioning, I named judges who had committed such  misconduct and asked Judge Jackson what she does to ensure her court is  a safe and inclusive place to work. After Judge Jackson's hearing  concluded, a woman who had clerked for one of the judges I named who  had engaged in this kind of harassing behavior reached out to me. And  this is a person who had clerked for one of the judges that I had  named. During her clerkship with this judge, she endured extreme and  pervasive sexual harassment. She came forth publicly about this judge's  conduct, an experience she described as ``a harrowing ordeal.''   She went on to a second clerkship, this time for Judge Jackson. In  Judge Jackson's court, she said, she was treated like a valued and  talented employee who could make meaningful contributions to the law.  She says clerking for Judge Jackson was the most meaningful  professional experience she has ever had. She stated:         Judge Jackson is the reason I am still a lawyer. I have no       doubt I would have left the profession were it not for the       way she treated me the year after my ordeal.    Judge Jackson is exactly the kind of judge and individual we need on  the U.S. Supreme Court: experienced, evenhanded, with dignity,  integrity, and humanity. Moreover, Judge Jackson is not just extremely  qualified to serve on the Supreme Court; her nomination is a historic  one.   The Supreme Court has existed for over 233 years, and of the 115  Justices in the history of the Court, only 5 of them have been women,  only 2 have been Black, and not a single one has been a Black woman.  This is the Court that has decided cases that have had sweeping impacts  on our lives, including decisions that have solidified rights for  LGBTQ-plus people, empowered women, strengthened unions, and more. But  this is also the same Court that has throughout the course of history  upheld slavery, Jim Crow, and the unlawful internment--incarceration-- of Japanese Americans in World War II.   So it is about time. It is about time we have a highly qualified,  highly accomplished Black woman on the Supreme Court. It is about time  our highest Court better reflects the country it  [[Page S2016]]  serves. It is about time that Black women and girls across the country  can finally see someone who looks like them sitting on the highest  Court, making decisions that will impact their lives--our lives. And  they will know that the possibility is there for them.   I close by noting that during the hearing, Judge Jackson told the  committee that as a freshman at Harvard, she wondered whether she could  fit in or whether she could make it, and a Black woman she didn't know  leaned into her as they were walking by, probably in Harvard Yard, and  said to Judge Jackson--she wasn't a judge then: ``Persevere.'' That is  something that a lot of us can relate to: perseverance, including  myself, who came to this country as a poor immigrant kid, persevering  to learn the language, to learn the culture of a country I knew nothing  about. Judge Jackson being on the Supreme Court would send such a  powerful message of perseverance to everyone in this country.    I will be honored to vote to confirm Judge Jackson. I look forward to  calling her Justice Jackson.   I yield the floor.
