 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R.  3949, yet another piece of bipartisan, commonsense legislation that  will serve our veterans.   In the transition from deployment to employment, apprenticeship  programs have proven to be extremely successful. Roughly 20,000  veterans are actively training or participating in these programs, and  their employment outcomes are nothing short of impressive. According to  VA's data, over 90 percent of veteran apprentices are employed after  completing their programs with an average starting wage of over  $60,000. Over their lifetime, apprentices see an increase in  compensation of over $300,000 as compared to their peers.   These programs aren't just a win for our veterans, they are a win for  taxpayers. Every dollar invested in apprenticeship programs sees a  return in benefits of $35.   While it is clear to see the advantages of apprenticeship programs,  like in many parts of VA, this program is hampered by needless burden  and bureaucracy. Currently, private employers who offer these programs  in more than one State have to register with each State individually.  Burdened by the difficulty and trail of paperwork that this creates,  many employers only choose to participate in a limited way or they just  don't offer them altogether.   H.R. 3949, the Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform  Act, or the VALOR Act, authored by my good friend and colleague,  Congressman Ro Khanna, streamlines the registration process for  employers, which, in turn, encourages them to participate and leads to  more opportunities for our veterans.   Given the tremendous sacrifice our veterans have made for our  country, we should do everything we can to ensure that they have access  to good jobs, and the VALOR Act does just that.   I would like to thank Mr. Khanna again for his hard work and his  leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it.
