 Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the  destruction that this historic hurricane season has wrought on Texas,  Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf Coast, I am very  pleased that, in addition to the emergency relief funds for wildfires  that are burning on both ends of California, the bill also includes  liquidity and emergency nutritional assistance for Puerto Rico, where  they are facing particularly difficult challenges in their recovery  efforts. This bill also provides for partial debt forgiveness of $16  billion for the National Flood Insurance Program.   I am encouraged to see that the administration finally understands  what we have been saying for a long time: we need to forgive the debt  of the NFIP, which FEMA has repeatedly stated it will never be able to  repay.   Following the losses that will be incurred as a result of the recent  hurricanes, the NFIP needs debt forgiveness more than ever. But let's  be clear. The partial debt forgiveness will leave the NFIP with a  crushing level of debt. Although this is a step in the right direction,  we should forgive all of the debt that the NFIP has accrued from  catastrophic storms like Katrina and Sandy instead of burdening the  NFIP policyholders with hundreds of millions of dollars in interest  payments every year.  [[Page H7997]]    Before this hurricane season, NFIP policyholders were already paying  more in interest than the entire NFIP spends on salaries and expenses  or funding mitigation or paying for flood maps.
