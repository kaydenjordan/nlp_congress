 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we all teach our kids. We teach them how to stay safe  and how to respond in an emergency. They learn things like stop, drop,  and roll for fires; don't talk to strangers; look both ways before you  cross the street; and dial 911 in emergencies.   Unfortunately, there is no lesson explaining that on some phones you  must dial 9 to get an outside line before you dial 911. Other phones  even have additional numbers, and they are not the same for every phone  system.   Multiline phone systems like those found in offices--our offices,  hotels, and hospitals--make our lives easier by condensing multiple  lines into a single phone. One feature of multiline phone systems is  that, in order to get outside of the internal lines, you must dial a  specific code or set of digits. It doesn't seem like a big deal or even  necessarily life threatening, but to this young girl trying to save her  mother, that is exactly what a multiline phone system in Marshall,  Texas, became.   We have heard the story. In 2013, Kari Dunn was stabbed by her  estranged husband while her daughter attempted to dial 911 multiple  times. She knew the number to call to save her mother's life, but she  didn't know to dial 9 to get an outside line. She didn't realize what a  multiphone system represented. The emergency personnel subsequently  were not getting notified in time.   The Energy and Commerce Committee marked up this bill in a previous  Congress and supported its passage into law. I was grateful to support  the bill back then. I am grateful to Mr. Gohmert for continuing to  press this issue. I look forward to voting for this again.   This tragedy occurred in Texas, but it could have happened anywhere.  In emergencies, every minute counts. We must remove obstacles to  emergency response, and this bill does just that.
