 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 72. This  resolution sets a dangerous new standard that will only deepen  divisions within this House.   For all of their talk about norms and institutions, it is the  Democrats who have acted to undermine the people's House at every turn.   Let's check the Record. Afraid for their political careers, they have  moved to shut down debate and silence dissent in committee and on this  floor. They went so far as to eliminate the motion to recommit--the  minority party's only chance to offer an amendment--which stood for  over a century until this year.   They have rushed impeachment through without a shred of due process,  just like today, reducing this tool from the highest constitutional  remedy to just another opportunity to fundraise and go on TV.   And now, they are declaring the majority has veto power over the  minority's member selections for committee.                                time  1645    We have reviewed this with the historians. Never before in the  history of this House has the majority abused its power in this way.  Never in the entire history of this House have you ever abused the  power in this way.   But it is clear Speaker Pelosi's Caucus thinks differently. They are  blinded by partisanship and politics, and it is the American people who  will suffer the most because of it.   Mr. Speaker, as for the Member in question, let me be very clear:  Representative Greene's past comments and posts as a private citizen do  not represent the values of my party. As a Republican, as a  conservative, as an American, I condemn those views unequivocally. I  condemned them when they first surfaced, and I condemn them today.   Mr. Speaker, this House overwhelmingly voted to condemn the dangerous  lies of QAnon last Congress and continues to do so. I made this clear  when I met with Representative Greene.   I also made clear that we, as Members, have a responsibility to hold  ourselves to a higher standard. She acknowledged this during our  conversation and apologized for her past comments. I will hold her to  her words and her actions moving forward.   Because these comments caused such deep wounds, I offered Leader  Hoyer a path to lower the temperature and address these concerns in a  productive way. I offered to remove Representative Greene from the  Committee on Education and Labor, but it was rejected. It was rejected.   Now, privately, I have had calls from many Democrats, acknowledging  what they are doing is wrong. They understand that this partisan power  grab is not only cynical, it is hypocritical. If this is the new  standard, I look forward to continuing out the standard because if you  look for a side that has a leadership that has done something when  their Members do something as a Member, not prior, look to me, because  I did just that.   But when a Democrat freshman said, ``Israel has hypnotized the  world,'' that supporting Israel is ``all about the Benjamins,'' and  that 9/11 was ``some people did something,'' did Speaker Pelosi kick  her off the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or did she keep her on the  committee and even pose with her on the cover of a magazine?   Will the standard change?   When another Democrat was compromised by a Chinese spy, and it was so  serious that the FBI had to brief congressional leaders, did Speaker  Pelosi remove him from the House Committee on Intelligence or the  Committee on Homeland Security after the briefing?   I am the only other person that had that same briefing just recently.  I was in the room with the Speaker. I heard what was said. I will be  very clear: I would never have that Member on either of those  committees.   Or did she reward him by making him the head of the subcommittee  overseeing the CIA?   I guess there are different standards.   Mr. Speaker, when the chairman of the Committee on Rules objected to  certifying the 2016 election, citing Russian interference, did Speaker  Pelosi censure him?   How about when the chairwoman of the Committee on Financial Services  told supporters at a rally in 2017--she was a Member then, unlike the  person we are talking about today--``If you see anybody from that  Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station,  you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you  tell them they are not welcome anymore, anywhere.''   After she called for violence against public servants, did Speaker  Pelosi condemn it, or did she look the other way and make her  chairwoman again?   I don't know if you want to amend this one and add others so you can  keep your standard. The answer is obvious. While Democrats attack  Congresswoman Greene, they not only ignore the infractions within their  own party, they reward these Members with prestige and influence.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes time to vote, I expect Democrats will  codify this partisan power grab. I would advise them to think twice and  pull this resolution from the floor while they still can.   I have heard Democrats quote the Senate minority leader to defend  this resolution. I would remind them what Leader McConnell said when  Democrats voted to nuke the judicial filibuster: ``You will regret  this, and you may regret this a lot sooner than you think.''   If that is the new standard, if people are held to what they have  said prior to even being in this House, if the majority party gets to  decide who sits on whatever committees, I hope you keep that standard  because we have a long list you can work within your own.   Mr. Speaker, in the end, this resolution is merely a distraction from  the real issues. In the last 2 weeks, Democrats have taken just two  votes: the one today and the one last month on a waiver for a Cabinet  member.   This is the least productive Congress since last year. I thought that  would be hard to beat.   There is nothing for workers who have lost their jobs, including  thousands of blue-collar jobs that were eliminated just by a stroke of  a pen of President Biden, even laying off the union workers who  endorsed him. It is a shame. They need that job. It is a good-paying  job. Nobody sat and talked to them before or asked them. They just laid  them off.   Nothing for students who have been stuck learning from behind screens  for nearly a year, even though the administration's CDC Director says  in-person learning is safe.   Nothing to increase the pace of vaccine distributions so we can get  them to people who want them and get one step closer to fully reopening  this economy.   At a time when households are already struggling, Congress should use  its window of opportunity to get Americans back to work, kids back to  school, and vaccines for any American who wants it.   These are the immediate priorities that deserve our energy and our  attention. This is what we would work on if we had the opportunity to  be in the majority or even had the same opportunity that those in the  minority had for last 100 years: to offer a motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, as I said before, a House distracted cannot govern, and  we are proving it one more time today. Let's stop trying to invent  dangerous and divisive ways to abuse the power of a majority and start  working on what really matters.   No one supports what was said before a person ever became a Member.  When a Member said something that was inappropriate on this side of the  aisle, we removed them from committee because they said it when they  were a Member.   As we list the long list of the standards on the other side, no, no  one ever  [[Page H351]]  got removed. They got rewarded. And now, the more than 200-year-history  in this body is going to change. But if it changed as a standard to  reach all, I will be right here with you.   If the concern was really what the majority leader said to me about  being on the Committee on Education and Labor, I am the first one to  switch it. I actually offered it. That would be appropriate.   But not for this majority. They believe something different, and that  is wrong, just as the words that were said were wrong.   That Member came to this floor to answer those questions. She did it  as a Member of Congress, not as a private citizen, when they were said.   Mr. Speaker, I listened to President Biden as I watched him sworn in.  I heard the word ``unity.'' That is why I reached out, as well. If  there is concern about education, we can fix that. If there is concern  on the other side about working with people or getting laid off with  every stroke of every executive order, I will work to fix that. If  there is concern about getting kids back in school, we will work on  that. If there is concern about getting a vaccine to any American who  wants it, we will work on that.   But unfortunately, the majority gets to decide what comes to the  floor. And once again, this Congress will get listed as the least  productive Congress in history.   But the one thing it will have a record of is changing the rules to  be one-sided, a long history that I believe this body will be  embarrassed by.
