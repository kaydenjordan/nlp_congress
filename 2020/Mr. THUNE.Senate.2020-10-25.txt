 Madam President, the Democratic leader seems to think that  this had something to do with a 3-minute speech 30 years ago. I don't  know where that comes from.   I can tell you that he has been involved in a systematic reversal of  the longstanding precedent when it comes to the consideration of judges  to the Federal bench by the U.S. Senate. I am a beneficiary, I suppose  you could say, in some strange way of that. That was a major issue in  my campaign in 2004. We made it about the blockade that the Democrats  in the Senate at the time, led by the current Democratic leader, had  started against a whole long list of nominees put forward by then- President George W. Bush.   I remind you of a few names: Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen,  Miguel Estrada, Judge Charles Pickering. There was a long list of  judges who were blocked at the time by the current Democratic leader.  In fact, as Leader McConnell has pointed out, it wasn't even sort of a  random thing. It was a planned strategy to start playing politics with  the Federal Judiciary instigated by the architect, the current  Democratic leader, who, at the time, was holding workshops and seminars  about how they could politicize the Federal judiciary and figure out  new ways to block consideration of judges put forward to the Federal  bench by then-President George W. Bush. That was a major issue in that  campaign season, and, I would argue, one of the principle reasons that  I am here in the U.S. Senate.   Then, of course, when the chickens came home to roost and the same  tactics were used by the other side in the previous administration, as  was pointed out again yesterday by Leader McConnell, the Democrats  decided to break the rules to change the rules in 2013 to go to a  simple majority to basically get and confirm judges on the Federal  Judiciary.   We are where we are today, notwithstanding all the bluster that you  just heard, because of a long, systematic strategy by the Democratic  leader to block judges put forward by Republican Presidents.   Despite all of what you just heard, tomorrow we are going to get to  vote to confirm one of the most outstanding judicial nominees whom I  have had the pleasure of considering during my time in the Senate.  Judge Amy Coney Barrett is eminently qualified for the Supreme Court.   By now, her accomplishments are well known: first in her class at  Notre Dame Law School, Supreme Court clerk, beloved Notre Dame law  professor, outstanding scholar, circuit court judge.   Americans, of course, got to see Judge Barrett's qualifications for  themselves a couple of weeks ago during her Judiciary Committee  hearing. For 2 days, she answered tough and probing questions from  Democrats and Republicans, displaying a consummate command of the law  and a calm and thoughtfulness that shows she has the kind of judicial  temperament you want in a Supreme Court Justice.   Since Judge Barrett's nomination, the tributes have poured in from  across the political spectrum: ``Barrett is highly qualified to serve  on the Supreme Court,'' said Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, one of  the House Democrat's star impeachment witnesses.   Patricia O'Hara, former dean of Notre Dame Law School, sent a glowing  letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Ranking  Member Dianne Feinstein. The letter says:         I was the dean of Notre Dame Law School at the time that       Judge Barrett first joined our faculty. In that capacity I       was responsible for providing an environment in which she       could flourish as a young faculty member, but also for       evaluating objectively whether she met the University's high       standards for scholarship and teaching required for       advancement. This proved to be the easiest task of my ten       years as a dean. Judge Barrett was (and remains) a stellar       teacher beloved by students, a brilliant and nationally-      recognized scholar, and generous colleague   She went on to say:         I am confident that if she is confirmed by the United       States Senate, she will be an outstanding justice--brilliant,       fair, impartial, and empathetic--and will serve to strengthen       an independent judiciary committed to the rule of law.    Professor O'Hara also took care to note in her letter that she  doesn't write glowing reviews for Federal judiciary nominees on a  regular basis. In fact, she said the only similar letter she has ever  written was in support of Democratic nominee Elena Kagan's nomination  to the Supreme Court.   She went on:         I feel every bit as strongly about Judge Barrett's       qualifications for a position as Associate Justice as I felt       about Justice Kagan.    While I may not always agree with the American Bar Association's  judicial rankings, they certainly got it right with Judge Barrett. That  is I talking, not the professor. I am still struck by the testimony  that the head of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary  submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The ABA's Standing  Committee on the Federal Judiciary is the body that provides the ABA's  evaluations of Federal judicial nominees.   In his testimony detailing the ``well-qualified'' rating that the ABA  gave to Judge Barrett, the head of the ABA committee noted:         Lawyers and judges uniformly praised the nominee's       integrity. Most remarkably, in interviews with individuals in       the legal profession and community who know Judge Barrett,       whether for a few years or decades, not one person uttered a       negative word about her character. Accordingly, the Standing       Committee was not required to consider any negative       criticisms of Judge Barrett.    That is quite a tribute.   But, of course, ratings of ``well-qualified'' do not just depend on  character; they also depend on professional competence. Here is what  the ABA's representative had to say about that:         Given the breadth, diversity, and strength of the positive       feedback we received from judges and lawyers of all political       persuasions and from so many parts of the profession, the       Standing Committee would have been hard-pressed to come to       any conclusion other than that Judge Barrett has demonstrated       professional competence that is exceptional.    Along with her character, competence, and command of the law, Judge  Barrett brings a clear understanding of the proper role of a judge. She  understands that the job of a judge is to interpret the law, not make  the law; to call balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the  game; or, as Judge Barrett said in an answer to a Senator's question,  ``I apply the law. I follow the law. You make the policy.''   As Judge Barrett made clear in her hearing, she will be the kind of  Justice who leaves her personal beliefs and political opinions at the  courtroom door. She will look at the facts of each case and judge  accordingly to the law and the Constitution and nothing else.   When I came to the Senate, I hoped to have the opportunity to put  judges like Amy Coney Barrett on the bench. I was proud to vote to  confirm her to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, and I look  forward to voting to confirm her to the Supreme Court tomorrow.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today we will confirm Amy Coney  Barrett to the Supreme Court. By now, I don't need to tell anybody that  she is one of the most highly qualified Supreme Court candidates in  living memory. Her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee was  a master class in what a Supreme Court Justice should look like, which  is probably why a majority of voters want the Senate to confirm this  outstanding nominee to the Nation's highest Court.   A CNN anchor recently pointed out that, ``in another age . . . Judge  Amy Coney Barrett would be getting 70 votes or more in the United  States Senate . . . because of her qualifications.''   That is unquestionably true, but, unfortunately, it is extremely  unlikely that Judge Barrett will be collecting 70 or more votes later  today because, for my Democratic colleagues, this has never been about  Judge Barrett's qualifications. Democrats were never going to support  this nomination, no matter how supremely qualified the individual in  question. The President could have nominated the wisest, most  outstanding jurist in the history of the world, and Democrats would  still be opposing this nomination--in large part simply because it was  made by this President.   Democrats had their talking points ready from the beginning--the same  talking points that they trot out for every Republican Supreme Court  nominee. The sky will fall if this nominee makes it on to the Court,  they cry. Minorities will suffer. Women will suffer. Americans will  lose their healthcare. They have used that one a lot this time.   Democrats would like to convince Americans that Republicans are  trying to confirm Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court for the sole  purpose of eliminating the Affordable Care Act and protections for  preexisting conditions. It is a ludicrous charge. Every Republican-- every Republican--in the Senate supports protections for preexisting  conditions, but apparently that doesn't matter to Democrats.   The truth is, Republicans have no idea how Judge Barrett would rule  on any particular ObamaCare case. The facts of each case are unique,  with unique legal and constitutional issues.   What we do know is that Judge Barrett will approach each case without  prejudices or preconceived notions. We know that she will examine the  facts of the case, the law, and the Constitution, and make her decision  based solely on those criteria--not on her political beliefs, not on  her personal opinions, just the law and the Constitution, no matter  which party drafted any legislation in question. That should reassure  Democrats, but it doesn't because, for many Democrats, their primary  concern in confirming judges is not whether they will uphold the law  but whether they will deliver the policy outcomes that Democrats want.   That is why some Democrats are threatening to resurrect the long- discredited idea of court-packing, should they return to the majority.  They are not sure that they can rely on a Supreme Court with Judge  Barrett to deliver the policy outcomes that they want. So they want to  add Justices to the Supreme Court until they can be sure that they will  get the results that they desire. One has to wonder where this will  end.   Let's say Democrats add three more Justices to the Court. Then, when  Republicans take the majority back, we add three more Justices to  counteract the Democrats' power grab. Then Democrats get back in power  and add still more Justices. It won't be long before the members of the  Supreme Court are more numerous than the Members of the U.S. Senate.   In addition to trying to scare Americans by suggesting that  Republicans are trying to take away Americans' healthcare, Democrats  have also tried to delegitimize the process. They have tried to suggest  that it is wrong for Republicans to take up this nomination in an  election year because Republicans didn't confirm Merrick Garland when  President Obama nominated him in an election year. I am not going to  spend a lot of time on this because the Republican leader, myself, and  others have spent ample time demonstrating that confirming Judge  Barrett is well within historical precedent.   But I will say this: The Constitution of the United States gives the  Senate the power to advise and consent to nominations made by the  President. The Senate has full authority to accept or reject the  President's nominations at any point in time during a Congress or  President's term. There is no constitutional carve-out for election  years. The minority party may not always like it when the majority  confirms a nominee, which I completely understand, having been in the  minority myself. But that doesn't mean that the majority party is doing  anything wrong by proceeding with a nomination.   I also have to ask: Are Democrats seriously suggesting that if they  were in the same position--if they were in the majority in the Senate  and the President were a Democrat--they would decline to approve a  qualified jurist to the Supreme Court simply because the vacancy had  occurred in an election year? I think everyone knows that if Democrats  were in the same position, they would absolutely confirm a Democratic  nominee to the Court--as they repeatedly urged us to do in 2016--and  they would be well within their constitutional rights to do so, just as  Republicans are well within our constitutional rights to confirm Judge  Barrett.   Before I close I would like to touch on another claim the Democratic  leader keeps making--that Judge Barrett's nomination is somehow  distracting Republicans from the COVID crisis or that her nomination is  preventing us from taking up COVID legislation.   That is flatout false. The Senate is capable of focusing on more than  one important issue at a time. In fact, it is pretty much a requirement  of our job that we be able to do so. Has the Democratic leader  forgotten that Republicans tried to bring up additional COVID relief  legislation literally just days ago and that Democrats, led by the  leader, filibustered and that they did the same thing when we brought  up COVID relief legislation in September?   Republicans have been ready to pass additional COVID legislation for  months. The only reason we haven't passed it already is that Democrats  have refused to agree to any compromise legislation that could actually  make it to through the Senate and to the President's desk.   I am hoping that sooner rather than later, my friends on the other  side will see the value of working together to provide real relief to  our fellow Americans. This disease doesn't recognize party differences,  and I am hopeful that my colleagues will realize that passing COVID  relief shouldn't be a time for insisting on partisan priorities.   It is unfortunate that Judge Barrett's nomination has been  overshadowed by so much partisanship from Democrats, but ultimately  what matters is that we are confirming this outstanding nominee.   As I said yesterday, I came to the Senate with the hope of putting  judges like Amy Coney Barrett on the bench: thoughtful, intelligent men  and women with a consummate command of the law, and most of all--most  of all--with a clear understanding that the job of a judge is to  interpret the law, not to make the law, to call balls and strikes, not  rewrite the rules of the game.   I am very proud to cast my vote to confirm Judge Barrett, and I look  forward to calling her Justice Barrett in the very near future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
