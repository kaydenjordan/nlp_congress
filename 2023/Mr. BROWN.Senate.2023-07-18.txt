 Mr. President, it is my honor today to rise in support of  Rachel Bloomekatz to serve as a judge on the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court  of Appeals. People often think of the courts, especially the circuit  courts--this comes from a nonlawyer, keep in mind--as something like an  ivory tower, detached from everyday people's lives.   We know the decisions judges make affect Ohio's workplaces and affect  Ohioans in their paychecks and in their own personal freedom about how  to live their lives. That is why it matters so much whom we promote to  these important jobs.   We want our brightest talent. We need our brightest talent on the  bench. We need thoughtful judges--thoughtful judges who adhere to the  highest ethical standards, who follow the letter and the spirit of the  law. We need judges who are compassionate, capable of recognizing and  understanding the many different perspectives of the people who will  come into their courtrooms. And we need judges with wisdom and with a  love for our country's core values.   Rachel Bloomekatz will be all of those things. She will protect the  rights of all Americans, not just the powerful and the privileged-- something, unfortunately, we see far too much of in the Nation's  highest courts.   Ms. Bloomekatz brings with her not only impressive legal credentials  but the empathy, the intellect, and the deep commitment to justice  required to serve the people of the Sixth Circuit.   Rachel had an impressive academic career, to be sure. She clerked for  highly respected judges on the State supreme court, in the Federal  district, and in circuit levels, and she clerked on the U.S. Supreme  Court. Rachel has a robust and successful litigation practice where she  has advanced the cause of justice.   Throughout her career, Ms. Bloomekatz sat on both sides of the table.  She represented people across the ideological spectrum. She has  represented companies and consumers. She has argued on behalf of the  government and for the rights of private citizens.   She has been recognized for the breadth of her practice, which  includes work on both civil and criminal matters, both types of cases  she will see as a judge on the Sixth Circuit.   She has worked with women's groups, and she has worked with veterans  groups, seeking justice for women harmed while giving birth on Active  Duty at military hospitals. She helped to represent our colleague  Senator Marco Rubio with an amicus brief, arguing in support of his  legislation providing protections for victims of human trafficking.   Don't just take it from me. Listen to the chorus of people from all  across the ideological and political spectrum who enthusiastically  support Rachel Bloomekatz's nomination. Twenty fellow Supreme Court  clerks, including several Scalia clerks and Kavanaugh clerks, wrote to  the Judiciary Committee saying:         We hold diverse opinions on many areas of law. We are       united in our view, though, that Rachel is an extraordinary       nominee who will uphold the best traditions and defining       attributes of the Federal courts, the rule of law, equal       justice, fidelity, and the Constitution.    They are joined by 25 Ohio appellate lawyers--again, from across the  political and ideological spectrum--who also wrote in support. They  said:         Some of us will no doubt disagree with some of the opinions       Rachel will author or join on in the Sixth Circuit. We are       united, though, in urging the Judiciary Committee and the       United States Senate to confirm her to the Sixth Circuit.    The letter goes on:         Rachel has the right temperament to serve as an Article III       judge, and her intelligence, diligence, and respect for the       rule of law will make her an excellent addition to the Sixth       Circuit.    Perhaps Ms. Bloomekatz's most powerful endorsement is from the judges  already on the Sixth Circuit who have appointed her to represent  clients in serious cases with fundamental rights at stake.   Ms. Bloomekatz is supported by Jewish leaders who represent the  breadth and diversity of Ohio's Jewish community--Eric Fingerhut,  former Member of the House, the president and CEO of Jewish Federations  of North America; Howie Beigelman, the executive director of Ohio  Jewish Communities, who recently brought a group of his colleagues to  Washington, last week, to talk to Members of the Ohio delegation in  both parties about the evil scourge of anti-Semitism.   Rabbi Kanter, Rachel's rabbi when she was a child in Nashville, said:         Rachel's deep values, informed by her Biblical faith, have       led to her compassion for people and her commitment to       justice and to the law. I can think of no better endorsement       than that. I can think of no better candidate to serve the       States of the Sixth Circuit--my State of Ohio, Kentucky,       Michigan, and Tennessee. There is no better candidate than       Rachel Bloomekatz.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Rachel Bloomekatz's  confirmation.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
