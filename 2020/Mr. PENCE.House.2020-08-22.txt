 Madam Speaker, Nancy Pelosi is dragging the entire House  of Representatives back here to Washington, D.C., on taxpayer dollars  for an unnecessary political vote.   Speaker Pelosi is choosing to vote on a political conspiracy theory  regarding the United States Postal Service. Instead, the House should  be working on commonsense COVID-19 legislation to address liability  protections for States, counties, cities, schools, nonprofits, and  businesses that are trying to reopen.   This bill is nothing more than an attempt to utilize the courts to  shut down the 2020 election.   We need to stop wasting time on a sham political vote like H.R. 8015,  because, in reality, House Democrats are the ones trying to scare the  American people, blame President Trump, and, yes, undermine the 2020  election results.   In these days and weeks before the election, Democrats are clearly  desperate.  [[Page H4255]]    Why can't we focus on providing COVID-19 relief, small business  support, infrastructure, and rural broadband?                            ____________________
