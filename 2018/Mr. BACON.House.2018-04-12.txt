 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 2, which  proposes a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United  States, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.   For too long, the United States Government has overdrawn its checking  account, and we must stop or we leave our children, our grandchildren  and great-grandchildren saddled with debt.   In Nebraska, we balanced our budget and even have a cash reserve on  hand of around $500 million. This is the Nebraska way, and we need to  make it the American way. Our State law forbids the carrying over of a  deficit from one year to the next. This has resulted in Nebraska being  ranked sixth for best fiscal condition in the Nation.  [[Page H3182]]    We need a forcing function that balances the Federal budget like we  have in Nebraska. What Nebraska does, so can we with our Federal  budget.   While H.J. Res. 2 will require the President to submit a proposed  budget to Congress where spending does not exceed receipts, there are  some safeguard measures in the event spending would need to exceed  revenue. A requirement for a three-fifths vote of both Chambers would  be required to raise the debt ceiling, but Congress can waive that  three-fifths requirement for any fiscal year the U.S. is engaged in  military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat  to national security and is declared by a joint resolution of both  legislative bodies.   If I could balance my checkbook at home, why can't the United States?   If the State of Nebraska can balance their budget and have a cash  reserve, why can't the United States?   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 2 to  put our great Nation on the path to debt recovery.
