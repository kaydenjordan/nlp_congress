 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this past Sunday, hundreds of  thousands of protesters filled the streets of Hong Kong to remind  Beijing that totalitarianism will no longer go unchallenged.   I was reading a New York Times article about this protest when I came  across a particularly striking quote. When asked why she had taken to  the streets, a 24-year-old biology researcher named Alice said:         We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong. We don't       want to become like China.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this article on the Hong Kong human rights protest, that  appeared in the December 9 edition of the New York Times and that  depicts a beautiful picture of what people will do for the cause of  freedom.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Dec. 7, 2019]        Hong Kong Protest, Largest in Weeks, Stretches Several Miles                   (By Javier C. Hernandez and Elaine Yu)         Hong Kong.--Hundreds of thousands of protesters, basking in       a recent election victory by Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp,       poured onto the city's streets on Sunday in one of the       largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet       demands for greater civil liberties.        The huge turnout was a reminder to China's leader, Xi       Jinping, that the monthslong campaign against his       authoritarian policies still had broad support in Hong Kong       despite a weakening economy and increasingly violent clashes       between protesters and the police.        Tensions in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, had       eased somewhat in recent days, after pro-democracy advocates       won a stunning victory in local elections two weeks ago,       giving new hope to the movement.        On Sunday, demonstrators returned in force, packing city       streets to denounce Mr. Xi's government, rail against police       brutality and reiterate demands for greater civil liberties,       including universal suffrage. They beat drums, sang protest       anthems and chanted, ``Fight for freedom.'' Though the march       was largely peaceful, some demonstrators vandalized shops and       restaurants and lit a fire outside the high court.  [[Page S7001]]         ``We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong,'' said       Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher who stood among       protesters gathered at Victoria Park. ``We don't want to       become like China.''        As many as 800,000 people attended the march, according to       Civil Human Rights Front, an advocacy group that organized       the gathering.        The mood at the march was relaxed, with people taking       selfies against a backdrop of the vast crowds. Children, some       dressed in black, marched with their parents, holding hands       as they shouted, ``Stand with Hong Kong!''        A sea of protesters, spread across several miles, filled       major thoroughfares as they moved between towering       skyscrapers. In some areas, there were so many people that       the crowds moved at a snail's pace and spilled into adjacent       alleys. Some small businesses encouraged the turnout by       promising giveaways if more than one million people joined       the march.        The protesters said they intended to remain peaceful on       Sunday, but some vowed to use more aggressive tactics if the       police cracked down. In the evening, the police readied       canisters of tear gas as they stood opposite crowds of       protesters who had barricaded a street downtown in a briefly       tense moment.        The large turnout could further embolden the movement's       confrontational front-line protesters, who said they planned       to disrupt the city's roads and public transportation system       on Monday. The call for further action seemed to resonate       among some protesters on Sunday.        ``If the government still refuses to acknowledge our       demands after today, we should and will escalate our       protests,'' said Tamara Wong, 33, an office worker who wore a       black mask as she stood among the crowd gathered at Victoria       Park.        The protesters have demanded amnesty for activists who were       arrested and accused of rioting, as well as an independent       investigation of police conduct during the demonstrations.        Despite the show of strength on Sunday, it is unlikely that       the protesters will win further concessions from Beijing,       which has worked to portray demonstrators as rioters       colluding with foreign governments to topple the governing       Communist Party.        Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at       Hong Kong Baptist University, said that even though Sunday's       march showed the protest movement remained strong and       unified, Beijing was unlikely to listen to its demands.        ``Hong Kong is condemned to live in a permanent political       crisis as long as China is ruled by the Communist Party,''       Professor Cabestan said.        Mr. Xi, who has cultivated an image as a hard-line leader,       has demanded ``unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent       activities'' in Hong Kong. He has publicly endorsed the       city's beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, and her efforts to       bring an end to the unrest.        Chinese officials have suggested that the United States is       responsible for helping fuel unrest in Hong Kong, pointing to       statements by American officials in support of the protests.       Last month, President Trump signed tough legislation that       authorizes sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials       responsible for rights abuses in Hong Kong. The move was       welcomed by many protesters but also seen as exacerbating       tensions between the two countries.        In a possible sign of increased scrutiny of American       citizens working in Hong Kong, two leaders of the American       Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said on Saturday that they       had been denied entry to Macau, a semiautonomous Chinese       city. Mr. Xi is expected to visit Macau this month to mark       the 20th anniversary of the former Portuguese colony's return       to China.        Tara Joseph and Robert Grieves, the president and the       chairman of the American business group, said they had       planned to attend an annual ball put on by the chamber's       Macau branch.        ``We hope that this is just an overreaction to current       events and that international business can constructively       forge ahead,'' Ms. Joseph said.        The protests, which began in June in opposition to a bill       that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, have       hurt the tourism and retail sectors, pushing the city's       economy into recession.        In recent weeks, the violence has escalated, with       protesters intensifying their efforts to vandalize businesses       they associate with hostility to the movement. The police       shot an antigovernment protester last month, inflaming       tensions. Then, in some of the worst violence, universities       became battlefields, with black-clad students hurling       gasoline bombs, throwing bricks and aiming arrows at the riot       police, who shot rubber bullets and fired tear gas in return.        Many demonstrators acknowledge that a compromise with the       government is unlikely, despite recent victories. Mrs. Lam,       the city's leader, who is under pressure from Beijing to       restore order without weakening the government's position,       has brushed aside their demands and has warned that the       mayhem could ``take Hong Kong to the road of ruin.''        Government officials have cast the demonstrations as       primarily centered on economic issues, arguing that vast       inequality in Hong Kong has exacerbated anger among the       city's youth. They rolled out emergency measures recently to       counter the effects of the turmoil on the economy, including       providing electricity subsidies to businesses and expanding       job training for young people.        The authorities have justified their efforts to crack down       on the movement by saying that protesters are endangering       public safety. On Sunday, the police said they had found a 9-      millimeter semiautomatic pistol, five magazines, 105 bullets       and two ballistic vests, as well as fireworks, among other       items, during a series of early morning raids.        Senior Superintendent Steve Li of the Hong Kong Police said       early in the day that officers had received information that       the firearm and fireworks would have been used on Sunday to       create chaos.        The police have in recent months banned many protests and       rallies in Hong Kong, citing safety concerns. But the       government granted a rare approval for the march on Sunday,       which was held to mark the United Nations' Human Rights Day.        Demonstrators said they believed that the turnout sent a       strong message: The protest movement would not back down.        ``If the government thinks that we will give up,'' said       Adam Wong, 23, a university student who was waving a black       flag, ``today's turnout will prove them delusional.''     Madam President, Alice's statement is loaded with  historical context and correctly implies that what we are seeing now is  the culmination of a slow but sure violation of the laws and norms that  once defined Hong Kong's semiautonomous relationship with mainland  China. These protests erupted after what Beijing argued was a simple  proposed change to existing extradition laws, but the people saw it for  what it was--a thinly veiled threat to Hong Kong's relative autonomy.  It wasn't a takeover. It was just that foot in the door, and China is  nearly unparalleled in its ability to turn a foot in the door into a  permanent existing condition.   Sometimes their power plays are very obvious, and sometimes they are  not. On my recent trip to Djibouti, I saw firsthand the influence of  China's debt-trap diplomacy.   Here is what debt-trap diplomacy is. It is a fancy way of saying that  China has increased its influence around the world by offering to  struggling nations that they are going to hold their debt in exchange  for preferential treatment on trade or maybe a physical presence such  as a port or other sweetheart deals.   In Djibouti City, I saw this tactic run wild. Now China would say  that what they have done is to help the Djiboutians create a ``smart  city'' in the Horn of Africa, but in reality they have negotiated their  way into creating a full-blown surveillance state.   Cameras are everywhere--on every corner and every street, with 24/7  footage--and guess where that footage lands. Beijing. They have even  tried to point one of those cameras at our military base, right at the  entrance to Camp Lemonnier.   Debt-trap diplomacy is bold. It is obvious. If that is all you see of  China, it is easy to assume that all of their tactics are that bold and  obvious. As I said, they will go after you in obvious areas and also in  areas that are not as obvious.   Even domestically, China's surveillance state is notoriously the  opposite of covert. Their domestic ``smart city'' program has outpaced  that of every other country on the face of the Earth and the majority  of their $70-plus billion budget for that project has been spent not on  intelligent power grids or traffic management systems or on clean air  or clean water, but it is being spent on surveilling their own  citizens.   The greatest danger China has created by engaging in brash and at  times absurd surveillance and suppression is that it has created a  false sense of security here in the West when we don't see the evidence  of what they are doing. In the United States we are not particularly  vulnerable to their debt trap, but we are vulnerable to less obvious  attempts to get that foot in the door.   In some form or another, most Americans have allowed Big Tech to take  hold of a portion of their lives. Smartphones and cloud storage once  were very novel, but now we assume that even simple transactions come  predicated by an additional condition. Everything is free as long as  the app or the service has access to--guess what--your data. They want  to own your virtual you.   Popular apps like TikTok, whose parent company is based in China,  have left me with more questions than answers about the platform's  business practices, privacy protections, and ideological loyalty to the  Communist  [[Page S7002]]  Party. Consider that the U.S. Army has barred soldiers from using  TikTok. Everybody needs to understand this. The U.S. Army has said: You  cannot use TikTok. This very body has expressed our concerns on a  bipartisan basis with the platform's censorship and data handling  practices.   It is no wonder that TikTok's chief executive officer canceled this  week's scheduled meetings here in DC with Members of this body. The  fact that millions of Americans, especially our American children,  continue to offer their personal data to TikTok is beyond disturbing,  but we will not be able to roll back the creeping surveillance state  without setting our own standards for what is acceptable from both  foreign and domestic companies.   When I introduced the BROWSER Act earlier this year, I did so not  only to give Big Tech solid guidelines regarding data privacy and  content but to set a new standard for what consumers expect from Big  Tech. Our problem here in this country is pretty much one of awareness  and of understanding that the exact same philosophy drives China's  surveillance programs and their less obvious but much more personal  individual monitoring schemes--their surveillance state scheme.   China's Communist Party is after more than just ad revenue and more  complete data sets. Their goal, as those Hong Kong protesters put it,  is to trick other countries in becoming more like China, which is not  tilting toward freedom but tilting away from freedom.   My goal with the BROWSER Act and with my focus on what has become the  surveillance state is to do the exact opposite--to enable freedom, to  encourage freedom, not only here but around the globe--and to make  certain that consumers here decide how much of their data they want to  be able to share. We must make certain that we continue to support the  cause of freedom wherever human beings show up to protect the freedoms  they have.   I yield the floor.
