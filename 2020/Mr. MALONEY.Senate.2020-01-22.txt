 Let's talk about July 26, a lot of years       later. You go to the front, you go to Donbas with Ambassador       Volker, I believe. And you're on the bridge, and you're       looking over on the front line at the Russian soldiers. Is       that what you recalled?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes, sir.         And you said the commander there, the       Ukrainian commander, thanked you for the American military       assistance that you knew was being withheld at that moment.        Ambassador TAYLOR. That's correct.         How'd that make you feel, sir?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Badly.         Why?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Because it was clear that that commander       counted on us. It was clear that that commander had       confidence in us. It was clear that that commander had what--      was appreciative of the capabilities that he was given by       that assistance but also the reassurance that we were       supporting him.    Mr. Manager CROW. Like me, Ambassador Taylor is a combat veteran. In  fact, he was awarded a Bronze Star. Ambassador Taylor knew how vital  our military aid was to those Ukrainian troops because he knows what it  feels like to have people counting on you.   Members of the U.S. Senate, I know you believe that aid is important,  too, because 87 Members of this body voted to support it. President  Trump did not think the aid was important last year. He ignored you and  the direction of Congress. He betrayed the confidence of our Ukrainian  partners and U.S. national security when he corruptly withheld that  aid. He did so because he simply wanted to help his own political  campaign. Our men and women in uniform deserve better. Our friends and  allies deserve better. The American people deserve better.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Justice Roberts, Senators, and counsel  for the President, I want to talk to you about the White House meeting  that President Trump offered to President Zelensky during their first  phone call in April. But, as you know, that meeting has not been  scheduled. It was never scheduled.   Ambassador Sondland testified that after the May 23 meeting with  President Trump, it became clear that President Zelensky would not be  invited to the Oval Office until he announced the opening of  investigations that would benefit President Trump's reelection. During  his testimony, Ambassador Sondland stressed that it was a clear quid  pro quo. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. I know that members of this committee       frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a       simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified       previously with regard to the requested White House call and       the White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani       conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and others       that President Trump wanted a public statement from  [[Page S466]]       President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma       and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests       directly to the Ukrainians, and Mr. Giuliani also expressed       those requests directly to us. We all understood that these       prerequisites for the White House call and the White House       meeting reflected President Trump's desires and requirements.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Sondland also testified that the  scheme to pressure Ukraine into fulfilling the President's requirements  for an Oval Office meeting became progressively more specific and  problematic--what he described as a ``continuum of insidiousness.'' He  explained the evolution from generic requests to investigate corruption  to calls to pursue specific allegations against President Trump's  political opponents.   Here is Ambassador Sondland again.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Well, Mr. Chairman, when we left the       Oval Office, I believe on May 23, the request was very       generic for an investigation of corruption in a very vanilla       sense and dealing with some of the oligarch problems in       Ukraine, which were longstanding problems. And then as time       went on, more specific items got added to the menu, including       the Burisma and 2016 election meddling, specifically the DNC       server specifically. And over this continuum it became more       and more difficult to secure the White House meeting because       more conditions were being placed on the White House meeting.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. In short, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland  understood that to get the meeting scheduled, they needed to get Mr.  Giuliani's agreement first.   On June 27, Ambassador Sondland explained to Ambassador Taylor that  President Trump needed to hear from the Ukrainian leader before he  would consent to a White House meeting. Here is how Ambassador Taylor  explained it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told       me during a phone conversation that President Zelensky needed       to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky,       was not standing in the way of investigations.    Diplomat David Holmes testified that he understood, early on, the  investigations to mean the Burisma-Biden investigations that Mr.  Giuliani and his associates had been speaking about publicly. Mr.  Holmes noted that while President Trump was withholding an Oval Office  meeting with Ukraine's newly elected leader, he agreed to meet with  Ukraine's chief foe, Vladimir Putin.   Mr. Holmes had this to say:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
