 Mr. Speaker, this morning I was  grateful to join my fellow South Carolinian colleagues at the Boeing  Leaders for the Second Century program. This program is dedicated to  discussing leadership capabilities and better understanding public  policy.   Boeing has brought thousands of jobs to South Carolina, and we are  grateful that they call us home.   Additionally, I am thankful for the inspiring leadership of  Charleston Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry;  Chairman, President, and CEO Dennis Muilenburg; Vice Chairman Raymond  Conner; Executive Vice President Leanne Caret, as well as all who have  joined us this morning from worldwide operations.   I appreciate Boeing suppliers creating jobs in the Second  Congressional District. This includes: Zeus, located in Orangeburg and  Aiken; Prysmian of Lexington; Thermal Engineering of Columbia; and AGY  of Aiken.   When I think Boeing, I think jobs, and I look forward to continuing  to work to bring jobs to South Carolina. Best wishes to the Boeing  Company for successfully creating more jobs in South Carolina.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
