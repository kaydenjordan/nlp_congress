 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor H.R. 5689, the Resilient  AMERICA Act, along with Chairman DeFazio and Subcommittee on Economic  Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Chair Titus and  Ranking Member Webster. This bill is going to strengthen our support  for communities and individuals in mitigating disasters.   We know that for every dollar invested upfront in mitigation, $4 to  $11 are saved in damages from a disaster. Given that, one way we lower  costs of future disasters is by investing upfront in mitigation.   This bill builds on the bipartisan work that we did on mitigation in  the  [[Page H4173]]  Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. It ensures mitigation funds are  spent and targeted in ways to support efforts by communities and  homeowners to save lives and reduce damage.   In my district, my constituents regularly experience flooding that  not only causes damage to homes and businesses but disrupts lives and  displaces people. Sadly, the time it takes to recover and receive  assistance is far too long.   I am glad to see more being done to make commonsense investments on  the front end through mitigation projects, which will save taxpayers  money. More importantly, it can help save lives.   This bill also has the support of several groups, including the  National Association of Home Builders.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  National Association of Home Builders.           National Association of Home Builders, Government             Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 5, 2022.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, House Transportation & Infrastructure           Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: On behalf       of the more than 140,000 members of the National Association       of Home Builders (NAHB), I write in support of H.R. 5689, the       Resilient AMERICA Act. The resilience and pre-disaster       mitigation initiatives contained in this bipartisan bill       would provide a comprehensive and preemptive approach to       reducing the risks of natural disasters while preserving       important flexibilities at the state and local levels.        NAHB supports a comprehensive approach to addressing       natural disasters through initiatives focused on implementing       cost-effective solutions that encourage greater resiliency in       the nation's housing stock--while preserving housing       affordability. The Resilient AMERICA Act would invest in       common-sense mitigation activities, with an emphasis on       residential retrofits for improving resiliency in older       homes. Expanding mitigation opportunities and creating       incentives to facilitate upgrades and improvements to older       homes and structures would help to reduce risks and minimize       losses from future catastrophes.        NAHB also supports the incorporation of language that       respects state and local jurisdictions' control over building       code adoption by providing flexibility to adopt one of the       two latest published codes. In addition, the bill includes a       provision that would provide consistency in how FEMA       evaluates which code a jurisdiction has adopted. This       language will provide the flexibility needed for communities       to take positive steps to withstand and recover from extreme       events.        We urge the passage of H.R. 5689 to make American       communities more resilient while also protecting important       building code flexibilities at the state and local levels.        Thank you for considering our views.            Sincerely,                                                James W. Tobin III,                         Executive Vice President & Chief Lobbyist.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for  working with us on this bill as we have all seen the effects of  disaster in our districts and across America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bipartisan legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Aviation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.  [[Page H4175]]    Mr. Speaker, in closing, the Resilient AMERICA Act does support the  communities by investing in premitigation efforts, and these efforts  are going to save lives. It is going to save taxpayer dollars by  lowering costs of future disasters. It is going to do so many things.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important piece of legislation. I  again want to thank the chairman for working with us on this. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act.  It is a bipartisan bill that cuts red tape and helps expedite disaster  recovery efforts, especially in small and rural areas that we have  throughout the country.   This legislation updates the threshold of what FEMA considers a small  project. It updates it to $1 million under the Stafford Act; $1 million  under the Stafford Act. This is the first statutory adjustment under  the Stafford Act for inflation and rising repair costs in nearly three  decades.   Historically, small projects have accounted for about 95 percent of  all the recovery projects, but the prolonged failure to increase the  cost threshold now means that 25 percent of these projects no longer  qualify as small projects. That puts a huge burden on small rural  communities that simply don't have the same kind of resources to deal  with the bureaucracy at FEMA. For places like Craig, Missouri, or  Brunswick, Missouri, both of which got hammered by the flood of 2019,  it has meant more delays and headaches just trying to get the help that  they need to recover and to rebuild.   Updating the small project threshold is going to allow these  communities to have more control over their disaster recovery efforts  and to allow FEMA to focus more of their time and resources on larger  and much more complex projects, which represent 90 percent of all  disaster costs.   After hearing directly from the communities in my district about the  paperwork burdens and the increasing denials over technicalities, my  hope is that this commonsense adjustment to the small project threshold  is going to improve the process and speed up recoveries for many, many  of our communities. We have also received a lot of support for this  bill from emergency managers themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a joint letter of support from  the National Emergency Management Association, the Big City Emergency  Managers, and the International Association of Emergency Managers.   [[Page H4176]]                                                  IAEM, NEMA, BCEM,                                                 September 10, 2021.      Hon. Dina Titus, Chairwoman,      Hon. Daniel Webster, Ranking Member,      Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and           Emergency Management, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Titus and Ranking Member Webster: On behalf       of the three associations representing state and local       emergency management nationwide, we wish to convey our       support for the efforts of Representative Graves of Missouri       to introduce the Small Project Efficient and Effective       Disaster (SPEED) Recovery Act.        When managing a disaster under the Stafford Act with       assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency       (FEMA), projects falling below a certain threshold are       considered ``small.'' While this threshold is adjusted       annually for inflation, the Fiscal Year 2020 level was a mere       $131,000. These small projects require less administrative       burden at the local, state, and federal levels which means       their approval and execution time is significantly faster       than larger projects. The SPEED Recovery Act will raise this       threshold to $1,000,000, thereby significantly increasing the       number of projects that can be expedited during the recovery       to a disaster.        This type of modernization to disaster response and       recovery programs will allow us as emergency managers to more       swiftly move projects for disaster survivors and expedite the       road toward recovery. As we work individually and with one       another to build resilience nationwide, tools such as the       SPEED Recovery Act will simplify and streamline FEMA programs       when survivors need them most.        We thank Representative Graves for his foresight on this       issue and appreciate your leadership in ensuring the SPEED       Recovery Act sees action in your subcommittee and throughout       the legislative process. Please contact NEMA Deputy Director       Matt Cowles, IAEM Director of Government Affairs Thad Huguley       or BCEM Executive Director Ron Prater if we can be of further       assistance.            Sincerely,      Sima Merick,        NEMA President.      Judson Freed,        CEM, IAEM-USA President.      Mark Sloan,        BCEM President.     Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves for  yielding time.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act, which  is bipartisan legislation introduced by Ranking Member Graves with the  support of Chairman DeFazio, Chair Titus, and Ranking Member Webster.   This bill aims toward updating disaster recovery procedures. I can  talk about that at length.   During Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria, many  municipalities on the island faced the situation where, because of the  rising costs of materials and labor, relatively simple projects such as  a repair to a street or a minor building exceeded the current threshold  for what is defined as a small project.   That threshold today is around $123,000, which really only covers  some minor work. This means that a lot of the work for which  municipalities may have had the resources to cover their non-Federal  share to start and finish promptly instead had to go through the full  procedural chain for major projects to qualify for FEMA reimbursement.   Those processes themselves have taken longer than expected. It took  almost 4 years in the case of Puerto Rico after the 2017 hurricanes for  those municipalities, FEMA, and the Puerto Rico Recovery Office to be  able to agree just on the measures to make the processes faster.   That is years in which the people wondered when they were going to  see the promised reconstruction. When a community does not see at least  small things being taken care of, that weakens our communities and  promotes displacement.   Increasing the threshold to $1 million, including adjustments for  inflation, would allow more recovery projects to proceed under  simplified procedures, reduce administrative burdens, and provide more  certainty for all. This is a major step, and that is the reason I am  supporting this bill.   Most disaster claims are on a small, local scale where there is no  need to navigate the same procedures over larger, more complex projects  and tie up the resources of FEMA and other agencies just looking at  those papers. Although FEMA and other agencies have been open to using  the administrative flexibility the law provides, in many real-world  incidents, that is not enough.   These updates make the Stafford Act language match the realities of  construction costs in our States, territories, and communities, which  FEMA and the local authorities can then use in order to facilitate  approval of the small projects.   Believe me, this is the biggest burden we have in the case of Puerto  Rico. Four years after the hurricanes, we are still dealing with this.   Many heads of agencies, Cabinet members, and administrative positions  from FEMA and the rest of the Federal agencies still travel to the  island to see how they can do this faster, and it is not just red tape.  It is amending this kind of language that will provide for those  projects to be sped up.   I support this commonsense bipartisan legislation and urge all  Members to support it, and I thank the ranking member for doing this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act, is a commonsense,  bipartisan bill that is going to help many small and rural communities  respond to and recover from disasters with less delay and much less  bureaucracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this very important piece of  legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.
