 Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to  remember a Minnesota icon, and that would be Prince, whom we lost 2  years ago. Prince was a one-of-a-kind artist, fiercely independent, and  uniquely talented. I grew up with his music.   For Minnesotans, Prince was our superstar next door. He made ``Purple  Rain'' a household name, First Avenue a landmark, and brought  international fame to Minnesota's music scene.   Minnesota loves Prince, and Prince loved Minnesota. He was born in  Minneapolis in 1958 and developed an interest in music at an early age.  He wrote his first song at just 7 years old and recorded his early demo  tapes at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis.   With seven Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award,  he pioneered that ``Minneapolis sound,'' that mix of funk, rock, and  pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced music for  decades to come. From Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to Janet Jackson and  Bruno Mars--even Beyonce--so many artists have been influenced by  Prince's music and his heart.   Over his career, Prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide,  released 39 studio albums, had 5 No. 1 billboard hits, and 40 singles  in the top 100 songs.   In 2004, Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the  very first year he was eligible. And 6 years later, he received a Black  Entertainment Television Lifetime Achievement Award.   Despite all of his success, Prince never stopped calling the State of  Minnesota home. He lived in our State, and he never lost the sense that  he was a beloved son, neighbor, and Minnesotan.   He wrote songs about Minnesota sports teams, including ``Purple and  Gold'' during the Minnesota Viking's run to the 2010 National Football  Conference Championship. When the Minnesota Lynx won their third  Women's National Basketball Association Championship, Prince held a  concert in their honor.   When Prince passed away on April 21, 2016, he left behind millions of  fans and a legacy of music that touched hearts, opened minds, and made  people all over the world want to dance. I am proud to honor Prince's  life and his achievements as a musician, a composer, an innovator, and  a cultural icon, and I am proud to call his home, Minnesota, my home as  well.   Prince reminded us all that there's a world waiting for us after this  life:         A world of never-ending happiness        You can always see the sun, day or night.    I am sure that is where Prince is today. On Saturday, the  anniversary, purple will reign again.
