 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Village of Hannibal  Mayor Ronald K. Greenleaf who was recently named Veteran of the Year by  the Oswego County Veterans Service Agency.   Ron Greenleaf has spent the vast majority of his life in public  service, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to his country and  community.   In 1967, he entered the United States Navy, serving in Vietnam on the  USS Harnett County. An electrician by trade, Mr. Greenleaf assisted  with maintenance, while contributing to the ship's overall mission of  providing tactical assistance to American and Vietnamese forces. In  recognition of his service, Mr. Greenleaf was recommended to receive  the Combat Action Ribbon.   Following his deployment, Mr. Greenleaf returned to central New York  to pursue a career as an electrician, to raise a family, and to  continue his service in the Navy Reserves.   Ron Greenleaf has been married to his wife, Dawn, for 47 years, and  together, they have two daughters. He is known for his commitment to  his family, attending countless practices, games, dance recitals, and  plays of his grandchildren.    Following his retirement, Mr. Greenleaf ran for the Hannibal Village  board, a position he was elected to in 1994, and served in for 10  years. He then ran for the position of town supervisor where he served  seven terms. Leaving this position in 2017, Mr. Greenleaf went on to be  elected as the mayor of Hannibal, a role he still holds today.   Of his many accomplishments as an elected official, Mr. Greenleaf has  most notably worked to improve infrastructure and promote recreation in  Hannibal. He has been praised as a driving force behind the popular  Hannibal ramp park, a multiuse park for bikes, skateboards, and  Rollerblades.   Aside from his work in public service, Mr. Greenleaf has found many  other ways to serve his community. As a member of the VFW, Hannibal  American Legion, and chairman of the 2013 Wounded Warrior Benefit, he  has worked to assist and support his fellow veterans through adversity  and hardship. A deeply patriotic man, Mr. Greenleaf has given several  speeches at Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies in and around  Hannibal.   On several occasion, Mr. Greenleaf donated his skills as an  electrician to assist with repairs for in-need neighbors. Devoted to  his faith, for many years Mr. Greenleaf has been an active participant  in the Hannibal United Methodist Church, serving as a trustee and youth  group leader.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in honoring  Ronald K. Greenleaf. Serving in the military, contributing as an  elected official, and volunteering in central New York, Mr. Greenleaf  has spent the majority of his life serving others.   Our Nation and community need more people like Mr. Greenleaf, and we  are inspired by and thankful for his commitment to public service.                     Honoring the Life of Elijah Cummings     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and passing of  my friend, Elijah Cummings.   When I first came to Congress a few terms ago, I teamed up with Mr.  Cummings to introduce a bill honoring the life and legacy of Harriet  Tubman.   When I approached Mr. Cummings about this bill, he didn't ask me what  party I was in. He didn't ask me what my political philosophies were.  He didn't care about partisanship. What he cared about is the fact that  we had a common interest; that being, Harriet Tubman.   I always appreciated that and in the years that have passed since  then, we continued to cosponsor that bill and continued to push it.   I am sad to hear of his passing, and I offer my prayers to his wife  and family, and I pray that he is united with God right now. And I  think going forward, we can all be happy and proud of the legacy he set  for us here in Congress.                            ____________________
