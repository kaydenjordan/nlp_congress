 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of S. 151,  the TRACED Act.   In 2018 alone, phone numbers with 517 and 734 area codes in my  district received over 223 million robocalls. I know. I received a  bunch of them.   Not only are these calls bothersome and unwelcome, but they often  lead to scams that prey on the most vulnerable. One such scam is the  one-ring scam, which attempts to trick consumers into paying huge fees  for return phone calls.   S. 151 includes important legislation that I worked to have included  which will end the harmful practice of one-ring scams.    Mr. Speaker, robocalls are not only a nuisance; they pose a threat to  individuals' privacy and security. S. 151, the TRACED Act, will help  put a stop to these harmful practices by empowering phone carriers to  implement call authentication technologies so consumers can trust their  caller ID with no additional cost.   It will also expand and streamline the FCC's enforcement authority to  take strong and quick action when it tracks down robocallers and levy  fines against those bad actors.   In the end, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will put a stop to these  predatory actors behind harmful robocalls and put consumers back in  charge of their phones.
