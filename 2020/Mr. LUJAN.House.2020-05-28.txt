 Madam Speaker, since the beginning of this crisis, I have  heard from Tribal leaders about the human tragedy of COVID-19 on the  Navajo Nation: whole families ravaged by the disease, doctors  overwhelmed by the surging cases, and insufficient Federal help.   These leaders are sounding the alarm for a community in crisis, and I  have been working to ensure the medical professionals who serve the  Navajo Nation have every tool at their disposal to treat patients and  protect themselves.   But instead of doing right by the Navajo Nation, this administration,  ProPublica found, awarded a $3 million contract for personal protective  equipment to an 11-day-old company headed by a former White House  staffer. As a result, the IHS received hundreds of thousands of masks  that may be unsuitable for medical use.   This lack of leadership endangers lives. That is why I am working  with the New Mexico delegation and our colleagues from Arizona to hold  the Trump administration accountable.   The Navajo Nation deserves the full support of the Federal Government  during this crisis and not to have this administration turn a blind eye  while the Nation loses one more parent, grandparent, son, or daughter.  This administration must act as an honest partner to the Navajo people,  and I will fight to ensure that happens.                            ____________________
