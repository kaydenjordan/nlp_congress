 Mr. Speaker, I think it is a new low for this Congress to  allow the critical and bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program  to expire. This program is 20 years old, and this has never happened,  where we have allowed the basic safety net healthcare program for  children to expire.   We hear over and over again, Mr. Speaker, you talk about the ne'er do  well, lazy ones of our constituents who are poor and don't want to  work. But, Mr. Speaker, these are children who are ineligible for work  and unavailable to take care of themselves. We are destroying the  health safety net for children.   But it is not that we haven't had time to extend CHIP. We have  renamed post offices. We have renamed a highway. We have advanced the  House budget reconciliation riddled with unpaid tax cuts for the  wealthy, including the repeal of the estate tax, which alone would  increase our deficit by $269 billion by 2025. Mr. Speaker, that is  billion with a B.   Are Republicans in this body trying to solve the budget crisis and  our deficit problem by cutting CHIP?   I don't think so.   Even more, Mr. Speaker, last week, we spent a considerable amount of  time debating the 20-week abortion ban. We heard passionate speeches  about how important it was to preserve the life of fetuses. We spent  all this time and speaker after speaker making emotional demands on  this body that we restrict women's body autonomy, but we spent no time  reauthorizing the program for little Junior, once he crowns and is  born--the basic healthcare that he needs immediately exiting the womb.                                time  1815    Mr. Speaker, simply put, it is hypocritical for you to say that life  ends as soon as the umbilical cord is cut. And, Mr. Speaker, your  actions prove it.   You know, I am of the mindset of one of our news reporters, Rachel  Maddow, that we ought to just watch what you do and not what you say.   Almost 9 million children depend on CHIP for healthcare; 9 million  children from low- to moderate-income families who will lose access to  vaccinations, routine checkups, dental care, mental healthcare,  prescriptions, and some of these children are profoundly disabled.   Mr. Speaker, what is going to happen to the 24 percent of the  children enrolled in CHIP that have special  [[Page H7967]]  healthcare needs, including asthma and learning disabilities?   The health of our children depends on this program, yet, Mr. Speaker,  all you can do to muster up a reauthorization for CHIP is to fund it by  increasing Medicare premiums--Medicare, a program designed for people  over 65--and cutting the Prevention and Public Health Fund.   All you can do, Mr. Speaker, is to pit old people against our babies  in order to provide basic healthcare to children. This sounds really  Faustian, and it is unimaginable, yet this is the reality that we are  working with.   Mr. Speaker, it is now time to put these politics aside and to  reauthorize CHIP now for 5 years. This is a disgrace not only in this  Nation, but internationally. I, as an American, don't want to be judged  by putting our kids last.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I am kind of new to this body, but when I came here, I  came with the same intention as I did when I first got into the Arizona  State Legislature. One of the first issues I worked on was this  program, a program that helped kids stay healthy, a program so that  they could be successful at school, a program that is imperative. Yet,  today, millions of people around this country, millions of families  around this country are asking themselves: What are they going to do  about my children's health? What is going to happen? Who is going to be  there for my child?   When I was a police officer, I had, sadly, the ability to see people  in poverty day in and day out, what it meant to their families, but  especially what sick children look like, what it means to see children  taken out of homes in ambulances instead of having preventative care,  what it means for a child to have to be in a hospital instead of having  had the ability to have preventative care, what it means to a child  with disabilities to have to go through that process and not have the  physical therapy that is needed.   This happened time and time again before CHIP became reality. I don't  think America wants to go back there. I think America wants to move  forward and make sure our children are healthy and able to withstand  the issues in our society that lead us to make sure that they do.   I cannot understand, for the life of me, why we would keep these  families--it is 11 days now. It is going to mean many more. We will  have to find some level of agreement. Yet, as was just mentioned by the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin, we are funding this by taking money away  from the elderly, from those also in need, from those also at risk.   I have to say that when I patrolled the streets of Chicago, I did so  to make sure that people were saved and safe. And I can't believe that  I have come to this body and found out that we are willing to keep  these families waiting, we are willing to sit back and not understand  the core issues of what it means to those families to have to suffer  through this process of the unknown of their child's future healthcare.   I have to say that this is an issue that most Americans and most of  this body agree to. I don't know why we have gone down this path of  taking money--or thinking of taking money away from the elderly. It is  wrong. But I do know that we should get this dealt with quickly and  make sure the families in America that need it can provide for their  children's health.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative Langevin, the gentleman from  Rhode Island.
