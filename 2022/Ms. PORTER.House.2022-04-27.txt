 Madam Speaker, trying to cancel a subscription can take  you in as many circles as looking for summertime parking at Newport  Beach. I have experienced it myself.   For too long, dishonest companies have gotten away with trapping  Americans into subscriptions by intentionally making it easy to start  and nearly impossible to stop. As a longtime consumer advocate, I am  pleased that the Federal Trade Commission is now holding corporations  accountable for this abusive practice.   The FTC has made it clear that businesses should make it as  straightforward for customers to unsubscribe  [[Page H4514]]  as it was to sign up. If they don't and they lock consumers in with  abusive practices, they will face penalties. Policing unfair and  deceptive business practices makes our capitalist economy stronger,  safer, and more competitive. That is the FTC's job, and I am glad they  are a cop on the consumer protection beat.   I am committed to saving Orange County families time and money. If a  company won't let you cancel a subscription, you can report this fraud  on the FTC's website or contact my office for help.                          Secure David Lin's Release     Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of David Lin who,  has been imprisoned in China since 2006 on charges of contract fraud.   Although the Chinese Government has reduced David's sentence, the  fact remains that David has been separated from his family for nearly  16 years and may die in prison. He has already missed his children's  graduations, his daughter's wedding, and the birth of his grandchild.   At age 67, his health is declining, and he may never have the  opportunity to hold his grandchildren or see his family again.  Recently, his daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer. This is  urgent.   Americans wrongfully detained overseas should be allowed to come home  to their loved ones, and I urge President Biden to continue doing  everything in his power to secure David's release.                          Southwest Carpenters Visit     Madam Speaker, Orange County infrastructure is getting an  upgrade because of Federal funds.   Last week, I had the opportunity to wear an orange safety vest and a  hard hat and join the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters Local  714 at one of their job sites. I saw firsthand how they are working to  improve our freeways and keep families safe. Their commitment to  quality work was an inspiration.   This project will improve 16 miles of the 405 in Orange County. It  will revamp road conditions and upgrade bridges with safer sidewalks  and bike lanes. It was paid for, in part, through Federal funds.   I was proud to support the bipartisan infrastructure law, which makes  additional investments to create millions of jobs and strengthen our  economy. This law will make necessary infrastructure projects possible,  and I will continue supporting Federal legislation that brings  resources back home to Orange County.                            ____________________
