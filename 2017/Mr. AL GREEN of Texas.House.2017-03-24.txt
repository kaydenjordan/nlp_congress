 Mr. Speaker, although Trumpcare is a terrible  Healthcare plan, it is a terrific Wealthcare plan.   Trumpcare is terrific Wealthcare because in the final analysis, it  allows the 400 richest families to get $7 million a year ad infinitum,  $7 million a year forever.   In the final analysis, 79% of the cuts become Wealthcare dollars for  the very rich, not healthcare dollars for the very poor.  [[Page H2440]]    In the final analysis, it sacrifices $1 trillion from Medicare and  Medicaid to enrich the lives of millionaires and billionaires.   In the final analysis, it provides more money for Wealthcare and less  money for Healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, Trumpcare is more Wealthcare and less Healthcare.
