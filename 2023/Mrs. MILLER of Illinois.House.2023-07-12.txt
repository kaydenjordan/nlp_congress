 Mr. Speaker, priests and pastors have guided  our troops through the darkest days of our toughest battles, and it is  imperative that Congress continues to support and defend the religious  liberty of our brave servicemen and -women.   This year, on Easter weekend, the Biden administration kicked  Catholic priests out of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center  through a cease and desist order.   In response to this attack on our servicemembers and their religious  liberty rights, I had the honor of leading my colleagues in the House  in sending a letter to Biden's Department of Defense demanding answers  and accountability.   The Defense Department claims that they are looking into why pastoral  care was removed from Walter Reed during Holy Week, but Congress must  demand that they correct this wrongdoing to ensure that this never  happens again.   We must safeguard religious liberty for our troops by ensuring  pastoral care at Department of Defense medical facilities.                            ____________________
