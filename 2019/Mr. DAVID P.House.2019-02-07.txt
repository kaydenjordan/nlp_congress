 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 840, the Veterans'  Access to Child Care Act, and I acknowledge the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), the chairwoman and sponsor of this  legislation, for her hard work and leadership on this issue.   As a father of three and a grandfather of three more, I know  firsthand how important affordable, accessible, and safe childcare is  and how difficult it can be for busy parents to find.   I never want a veteran, particularly one struggling with a mental  health condition that requires regular ongoing treatment to manage, to  be unable to get the care they need because of a lack of childcare.   The Veterans' Access to Child Care Act would prevent that by  authorizing the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide childcare  assistance to veterans who are receiving mental health or certain other  intensive healthcare services.   Since 2011, VA has been providing childcare assistance to eligible  veterans in select sites through a pilot program that has been extended  by Congress on a consistent basis. This bill would permanently  authorize that program and expand it across the VA healthcare system.   I was proud to support this bill last Congress as it passed the House  with unanimous bipartisan support, and I am proud to support it today.  However, my support is not without some reservations.   When we passed this bill last Congress, it had been reported out of  the committee fully offset with a mandatory pay-for that, again, passed  the House with unanimous bipartisan support.   An amendment offered by Congressman Gus Bilirakis of Florida that  would use the same pay-for to offset the cost of this bill, which has  increased from $96 million 2 years ago to an estimated $120 million  today, was ruled not in order by the Rules Committee yesterday. That is  a shame.   As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the previous  Congress, I entertained frequent objections to other good policies from  my friends on the other side of the aisle due to concerns about how  improvements to the VA healthcare system would be accounted for under  discretionary caps. It appears those concerns have suddenly  disappeared.   Yesterday afternoon, Chairman Takano noted that no offset was  provided for this bill because the House Democrats have no requirement  for discretionary costs to be offset, and it would be up to the  appropriators to provide the funding VA needs to implement this  program.   The Democrats' lack of a rule promoting fiscal discipline does not  mean that we should not aspire to be good stewards of taxpayer money.  The American taxpayer should expect and certainly deserve more from  their elected officials than literally passing of the buck.   I also have reservations about this bill because it failed to move  through  [[Page H1420]]  regular order, which it most certainly would have benefited from.   I commend my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for offering a  number of thoughtful amendments to this legislation. I look forward to  considering a number of those later today.   That said, we do not know what the Department thinks of them. We do  not know what veterans service organizations think of them. We are  blind to the second and third order implications they will undoubtedly  have on this program and its cost. What is more, not all of the  thoughtful amendments that were offered to this bill were ruled in  order or will be up for debate.   I offered an amendment that would have provided the Asset and  Infrastructure Review Commission greater flexibility by removing a  prohibition against the Commission meeting in any calendar year except  2022 and 2023.   The AIR Commission is an objective, data-driven, transparent process  that will consider VA's real property portfolio as a whole and  determine how it will be realigned and brought into the 21st century to  continue providing the high-quality care that our veterans require in  future years.   The bill we are considering today could result in the repurposing of  existing space or creation of new space to be used to provide childcare  services. Decisions about how limited VA medical facility space will be  used must not be made in a vacuum, especially when Congress has already  established a process for how those decisions should be made. I fail to  see how my amendment doesn't apply here, and it is a shame that we  didn't have an opportunity to have a robust debate on that in committee  or on the floor.   Another good government amendment that was, unfortunately, ruled out  of order was offered by Congressman Jodey Arrington of Texas.  Congressman Arrington's amendment would have prohibited any employee  who is hired by VA to provide childcare pursuant to this bill from  spending their time on taxpayer-funded union activities rather than  performing the childcare duties they were hired to perform.   I agree that government employees should be doing the job for which  they are hired and receive a taxpayer-funded paycheck to do, and do  nothing else.   Again, it is a shame we won't be able to discuss or debate that  amendment. Despite these issues, I do find the underlying bill to be a  worthy one, and I will be supporting it today.   I thank Congresswoman Brownley, again, and Chairman Takano for  bringing this bill to the floor today, and I look forward to working  with them in the next 2 years on these and other important issues of  our Nation's veterans.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I have no further  speakers. I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of  my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, just to, I guess, retort  to my friend, the chairman, if a program costs money, the money has to  come from somewhere. We have programs right now, and the appropriators  are going to have to decide, if this program costs a lot of money, to  take it away from some other VA program, whereas, we had the extra  revenue to pay for this program. That is all we are talking about.   Every single one of us in this Chamber last Congress agreed to pay  for it. So now something has changed. I have no further speakers on the  bill, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First of all, I thank Ms. Brownley for her leadership on this. I,  too, have been, at one point in my life, a single parent. I am a  veteran, and I certainly understand the difficulty in childbearing and  child-rearing from my previous life as an OB/GYN doctor. I delivered a  lot of babies and took care of a lot of parents who were single  parents, who struggled to not only make ends meet, but to get the  healthcare they need.   I think this is a great bill. I think it should be supported  unanimously in this Congress.   Our American heroes who have served this country can come get the  care they need. We know that, in this country, 20 veterans commit  suicide each day, and 14 of them have never gotten into VA care. We  don't know what the reason for some of those are, but, hopefully, it is  not a barrier of childcare.   Madam Chair, I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support unanimously H.R. 840, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent  to claim the time in opposition, though I am not opposed to it.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Brindisi and former  member of the committee Congresswoman Kuster's amendment that would  clarify that veterans receiving intensive mental health or other  qualifying treatment from community-based outpatient clinics, CBOCs,  are also eligible for childcare assistance from the VA.   CBOCs are an important access point for many veterans, and healthcare  continues to transition away from inpatient hospitals and will form the  basis of future care. Madam Chair, we have over 800 of these CBOCs in  the country, so it makes care much more available to our veterans in  their home communities.   Childcare burdens are no less a factor for veterans who receive care  in a CBOC than it is for veterans who seek care in a VA medical center.  This amendment rightly recognizes that fact and ensures that we don't  inadvertently create a disparity for veterans with the same conditions  seeking the same treatments who happen to use different VA medical  facilities.   Madam Chair, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I thank Congressman Brindisi and Congresswoman Kuster  for submitting that, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I strongly support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I thank Mrs. Radewagen,  who is a tireless advocate for veterans issues, for bringing this up.  She travels, I guess, about as far as anybody, 24 hours in the air to  get here, so she is a tireless advocate for our Nation's heroes, and I  thank her for that.                                time  1545    Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment that would  clarify that childcare assistance is intended for veterans while they  are attending a VA appointment or traveling to and from a VA  appointment, but not at any other time.   This amendment is in line with the intent of the underlying bill,  which is to provide access to childcare services so that veterans who  would otherwise be burdened with childcare responsibilities can have  easier access to the care that they need.   By clarifying when VA-provided childcare assistance will be provided,  this amendment will help ensure that this program is sustainable, is  not unintentionally abused, and will help the greatest number of  veterans in need.   Congresswoman Radewagen is a valuable member, as I have stated, of  the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I thank her for bringing this  commonsense, good-government amendment forward today.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.    ROE of Tennessee. Will the gentleman yield?    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, Mr. Sablan and I have  worked together on these unique issues about where he is in American  Samoa. That is one of the reasons I wish we had had regular order. We  could have brought this up, because the gentleman does have unique  circumstances because of long travel distances, and I think that is  something else we need to look at in the committee.   I will pledge myself to work with you on this issue as ranking  member.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Rose's amendment to  include substance abuse or drug abuse counseling under the definition  of a covered health service, and I thank him for his service to our  great country.   Unfortunately, our veterans are not immune to the scourge of  addiction that has tragically impacted far too many of our communities  for far too long, particularly in the last few years of the opioid  crisis. Veterans seeking substance abuse treatment from VA should  certainly have access to childcare assistance if they require it, and I  am grateful to Congressman Rose for sponsoring this amendment to make  sure that they are specifically included in this bill. I hope that I am  joined by all my colleagues in supporting this needed amendment today.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I urge support of  Congressman Rose's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of  this amendment to prohibit VA from constructing new structures to be  used as childcare centers.   Mr. Chair, the VA has over 6,000 pieces of property, and 1,100 of  them are either not utilized or underutilized. We on the committee,  including the chairman, have just witnessed a $600 million hospital in  Denver, Colorado, explode into a $2 billion--I didn't say that wrong,  two thousand million dollars--project.   Both General Bergman's amendment and mine, which would have provided  greater flexibility to the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission,  recognized that VA's vast and, in most cases, outdated, misaligned, and  prohibitively-expensive-to-maintain infrastructure must be dealt with  holistically.   I regret that my amendment was not made in order today, but I am glad  that General Bergman's was. Where VA has existing space that is not  needed for veteran patients, VA could and should consider repurposing  that space to provide childcare assistance, and where existing space is  not available, VA should use the authorities provided in this bill to  provide childcare assistance.     ROE of Tennessee. Where existing space is not available,  VA should use the authorities provided in this bill to provide  childcare assistance off VA property--either through leases, sharing  agreements, and other means--rather than investing in costly new  buildings.   Mr. Chair, what happens? If we build a childcare facility and the  demographics change and it is no longer needed, we have got an empty  building. If we lease that building, which this gives us the authority  to do, we can let the lease expire, and the VA can go on and use their  moneys for something else.   General Bergman is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, and I thank him today, as always, for his  leadership and vision on behalf of his fellow veterans.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to support this amendment today, and I urge  all of my colleagues to join me in support.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the  amendment.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the  amendment sponsored by Congresswoman Lee and Congresswoman Lesko to  provide for childcare assistance to veterans receiving readjustment  counseling in a vet center.   The work done in vet centers is critical to veterans who are  struggling to readjust to civilian life following their military  service. I am glad that this amendment will make it easier for veterans  who lack childcare to seek the support they need in vet centers, and I  will be supporting this amendment.   That being said, expanding childcare assistance to include the  hundreds of vet centers across the country is a costly prospect.  Unfortunately, because the bill did not go through regular order, we do  not know just how costly this project will be.   I wish that we could have received reviews and cost estimates on this  proposal prior to voting on it and hope that, moving forward, bills  will have the benefit of work in committee before being moved onto the  floor.

Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close and  urge support of this bipartisan amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  Kentucky, my next-door neighbor, for doing this. We are really pleased  to have him on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Mr. Chair.   I rise in support of this amendment to require VA to study how the  provision of childcare assistance impacts access to and compliance with  care.   It is important that we closely monitor any taxpayer-funded program  to ensure that it is meeting its intended objectives, and I am grateful  for Congressman Barr's foresight in ensuring that we do this for this  program as well.   Congressman Barr has long been a strong supporter of our Nation's  veterans, and I am pleased to welcome him, as stated, to the Veterans'  Affairs Committee this Congress. I thank him for his leadership on this  amendment and hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting  this amendment.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  rise in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  Congressman Cisneros' and Congressman Welch's amendment to require VA  to conduct a study to assess the feasibility of VA-provided childcare  assistance for veterans receiving community care. This is a critically  important amendment.  [[Page H1428]]    For decades, VA has had the authority to refer patients to community  providers when veterans are unable to get the care they need in VA  medical facilities for various reasons. Last year, almost 40 percent of  appointments in the VA healthcare system occurred in the community.   Clearly, VA cannot meet every need of every veteran patient in every  community across this country without the assistance of community  partners. That is not the fault of the VA healthcare system. It is a  strength.   Veterans in need of childcare assistance should not be denied such  assistance when they are referred to a VA community partner rather than  a VA provider.   I am disappointed that another amendment offered by Congressman Case,  that would have simply lifted this barrier to care for those veterans  who must seek care through community partners, was not accepted.  However, I am encouraged that the issue will be reexamined through this  study.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment today.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I strongly support  Congressman Cisneros' amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    ROE of Tennessee.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Congressman Cisneros' amendment to  include physical therapy for service-connected disabilities under the  definition of ``covered health service.''   Caring for service-connected conditions is the reason the VA  healthcare system exists. Service-connected conditions should always  take priority. I thank Congressman Cisneros for recognizing this with  his amendment. I am proud to join him in supporting it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, caring for service- connected conditions is the reason the VA healthcare system exists. I  strongly support Congressman Cisneros' amendment and encourage my  colleagues to support it also.   I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Congressman  Rodney Davis, first of all, for his commitment to our Nation's heroes.   I was able and privileged to be in his district last year. I saw his  commitment to that and the respect that they have for him, and I want  to thank him for bringing this up. He does a terrific job for our  Nation's heroes in his district, and it was a privilege to be there.   I rise in support of Congressman Davis' and Congressman Panetta's  commonsense amendment. The bill we are considering today defines a  veteran who is eligible for childcare assistance as a veteran who is  ``the'' primary caretaker of a child or children. However, this  amendment rightly recognizes that most children have two parents and  either of them could be considered ``a'' primary caretaker of that  child.   I thank Congressman Davis and Congressman Panetta for that  clarification, and I am happy to support this amendment today.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  rise  [[Page H1430]]  in opposition, although I am not opposed.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Sablan's amendment to  include mental healthcare provided via telemedicine under the  definition of a ``covered health service.''   The VA healthcare system is an industry leader in telemedicine and  should be commended in using it to increase access to care for veterans  who would otherwise have to travel great distances on a regular basis  to receive the care they need.   I want to thank my good friend, Congressman Sablan, who is a tireless  advocate in the Marianas. He has been an amazing supporter of the  veterans there who really have very limited services. I thank him for  introducing this amendment to make sure that veterans accessing tele- healthcare are also eligible for childcare assistance, if needed.   I am pleased to join him in supporting this.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this  amendment to require an annual report on the processing of claims for  childcare assistance.   VA has made improvements in recent years in the speed at which  community providers are being reimbursed for the services they provide  to veteran patients, however, claims processing remains an area where  VA struggles; to be kind to them, struggles.   We must take steps to ensure that veterans and childcare providers  who are awaiting reimbursement pursuant to this bill are not left  waiting like many veterans and community providers have been  previously.   Mr. Chair, I am grateful to Congressman Cloud for his leadership and  sponsoring this amendment and I look forward to joining him in its  support.
