 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words,  and I am pleased that we have overcome numerous delays and are finally  passing a North American trade deal for the 21st century.   USMCA will create jobs, boost the economy, and strengthen our  relationship with our neighbors in Canada and Mexico. I want to express  my gratitude to Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and his team, and Gregg  Doud and his staff, for the hard work they have done on this agreement.   I also commend the President for delivering, yet again, for American  farmers and workers under USMCA. Under this agreement, ag products that  had zero tariffs under NAFTA will continue to be tariff-free. Our  farmers and ranchers will gain additional access to the remaining  protected sectors. Enforcement will be enhanced to ensure the agreement  is implemented correctly.   Updated dispute mechanisms will ensure the United States has prompt  access to a dispute settlement panel, when needed, to allow U.S.  businesses to compete on a level playing field.   This is a great bipartisan agreement that will bring huge benefits to  millions of Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support USMCA.   Finally, I thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady for all of  their great work on this. I know it was not easy, but you guys did a  really great work. I think the American people owe you a debt of  gratitude.
