 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Expanding Financial Access for Underserved Communities Act, which I  introduced today.   Over the past decade, affordable banking services have become more  difficult for many Americans to access due to the closure of physical  bank branches. Addressing banking deserts is an important element to  promoting equity across our entire economy.   I believe that credit unions can play a significant role in improving  access to affordable banking services in underserved communities  throughout our Nation.   That is why I am proud to introduce this legislation to allow all  federally chartered credit unions to expand their field of membership  to underserved areas. The bill would exempt business loans made to  borrowers located in underserved areas from the credit union member  business lending cap.   I am proud to join Chairwoman Maxine Waters in this effort. I hope my  colleagues will join me in support of this bill to promote economic  opportunity in low-income communities and communities of color.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO:   S. 4883. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to partner  and collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture and the State of  Hawaii to address Rapid Ohia Death, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
