 Mr. Speaker, at 7:48 a.m. on December 7, 1941, the  Empire of Japan deliberately attacked the United States--a sneak  attack--at our naval station at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.   This surprise attack was meant to cripple the United States Pacific  Fleet before we had the chance to do anything about World War II.  Rather than facing defeat, the American people--our soldiers, our  military, all of us--fought back.   In the end, it was the determined spirit of the American military and  the commitment of Americans to innovate and use all of our materials to  produce wartime products that ultimately led to an Allied victory.   Just a few short months later, on April 18, 1942, America struck back  with the Jimmy Doolittle Raiders telling the islands of Japan that we  are here and we are not going away. They were heroes there as well.   Mr. Speaker, 79 years later we honor the 2,403 servicemembers and  civilians who were killed that day--a day which President Roosevelt  said was a date which will live in infamy. We owe them a huge amount of  gratitude, and we also need to remember that our own military readiness  needs to be on constant alert and that we need to do everything we can  today to make sure that we as Americans are ready for any threat.                            ____________________
