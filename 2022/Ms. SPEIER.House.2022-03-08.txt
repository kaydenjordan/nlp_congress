 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity tonight  for a Special Order on this International Women's Day.   There are a lot of ironies about this day. We in the Democratic  Women's Caucus and the Bipartisan Women's Caucus could not let this day  go by without drawing attention to what is happening in Ukraine to  women, mothers, and children. The irony is particularly significant  because International Women's Day is a national holiday in Ukraine and  Russia.   The Administrator of USAID and former U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power  commented on this today. She referenced that the founder of  International Women's Day was a woman by the name of Theresa Malkiel.  She was a Jewish labor organizer in New York. She was born in what is  now Ukraine, and she emigrated to the United States to escape  persecution. Madam Speaker, 130 years later, Ukrainian women are now  being forced to leave their homes as well.   Now, we are heralding the incredible strength of Ukrainian women.  They are facing unimaginable horrors brought about by Vladimir Putin  and Vladimir Putin alone.   Last year, President Putin sent a message to women for International  Women's Day in Russia. He said: ``I wish you good health and success .  . . . And, of course, I would like you to have as many reasons for  smiles and joy as possible.''   I guess the question to ask Putin is: Does that apply to Ukrainian  women as well, the women you presume are Russian but are willing to  have them be forced into death marches because you feel compelled to  shell communities throughout Ukraine?   Last week, Vladimir Putin's forces killed a woman and two children in  cold blood as they attempted to escape over a bridge in Irpin, a suburb  of Kyiv, and he continues to order the shelling of evacuation corridors  as Ukrainian civilians attempt to flee. Over 1 million of them have  already left. It is going to be millions and millions more.   Let me just show you a couple of pictures, Madam Speaker. This is a  woman in Ukraine on International Women's Day, thanks to Vladimir  Putin. This is what Vladimir Putin thinks of women. These are the  smiles he wants to see on their faces, the joy he wants to see in their  eyes.   This man needs to be called out for what he is. He is a tyrant, and  he is committing premeditated war on the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian  women and children. He is doing so and committing war crimes as well.   Let me show you yet another picture, Madam Speaker.   This is one that is hard to look at. These are three dead women who  were trying to escape and were shelled down. They are now dead. They  have their suitcases and their backpacks. One is a small girl. This is  what Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine, and he must be called out for  it.   His bloodthirsty disregard for the lives of women and children has  never been more apparent. Last month, I was disgusted to hear him use a  crude rape reference to urge Ukraine to acquiesce to Russia's demands,  saying: ``You may like it. You may not. But you will have to endure it,  my beauty.''   Vladimir Putin said this: ``You may like it. You may not. But you  will have to endure it, my beauty.''   His senseless war has already caused nearly 500 civilian deaths, and  it is probably more than that, including 29 children, and it is  probably more than that. He has already forced 2 million Ukrainian  people, mostly women and children--in fact, about half of them  children--to flee their country.   On the news tonight was a story about an 11-year-old child whose  mother let him leave. He traveled 700 miles to get to a safe haven. His  mother, from some outpost somewhere in Ukraine, put up a video thanking  those who had taken her son into their arms and who had brought him to  safety. That is what Vladimir Putin is forcing Ukrainian families to  do.   The vast majority of these refugees, as I said, are women and  children who have left their husbands, their brothers, and their  fathers behind to fight. For the first time--for the first time ever-- half of these refugees are children.   Now, think about the scars that will take place in the minds of those  children over their lifetimes. These are children who should be home  playing in  [[Page H1365]]  their neighborhoods and heading off to school, not hiding in bomb  shelters and fleeing across borders, not crying in their mama's arms  for milk when all they can get is water.   Women and girls who are single and arriving at the border face an  increased risk of exploitation and abuse, including sexual violence,  gender-based violence, and trafficking.   Welcome to International Women's Day. Welcome to what Vladimir Putin  said he wanted, to put smiles and joy on the faces of women. Instead,  women are becoming victims of sex trafficking and rape.   The disruption of essential services and emergency medical care has  already affected the women in Ukraine. We have seen heartbreaking  reports of mothers giving birth in makeshift bomb shelters and  underground metro stations as Russia bombs Ukraine's cities.   The U.N. estimates that 80,000 Ukrainian women will give birth in the  next 3 months--80,000 of them. That is as many women who will give  birth as I have in one of my larger cities in my district. Many of  these women are going to do it alone without the support of their  family or their spouses, and they are going to do it without access to  medication or critical and lifesaving care.   This is the joy and smiles that Vladimir Putin talked about in his  address for International Women's Day last year. I don't know what he  said to the Russian women today. Did he send them flowers, give them  candy, and offer them gifts?   This is what he calls gifts to the Ukrainian women. The Russian  conflict in the Donbas region has already led to an increase in sexual  violence. In 2019, one in three Ukrainian women reported experiencing  physical or sexual violence, and the current crisis increases this risk  exponentially.   We have seen a horrific increase in sexual violence just in the past  2 weeks. In the city of Kherson alone, Russian soldiers raped at least  11 women, in some cases so brutally that only five of them have  survived.   We must elevate these stories and call Vladimir Putin out for what he  is. He is a misogynistic, evil dictator.   Nevertheless, Ukrainian women are fighting back. I am really in awe  of the ordinary, brave Ukrainian women who are leading the fight to  protect their country.   I am going to show you a picture now, Madam Speaker, of the Ukrainian  women. These are Ukrainian women. They represent almost 22 percent of  Ukraine's armed forces, which is one of the highest percentages in the  world. In the United States, the number of women serving in the  military is like 18 percent. It is 22 percent in Ukraine.   Many women, many mothers, are taking their children to the border to  hand them off to family members in Poland or Romania or other locales  and then going back in to join in the fight.   More women are joining the fight every day. They are teachers,  nurses, accountants, police officers, and grandmothers. The list goes  on and on. Even women members of the Ukrainian parliament, who just  1\1/2\ weeks ago were writing their country's laws, have taken up arms  in defense of Ukraine.   I guess we should all ask a question: Would we do that?   The Ukrainian parliamentary members are doing that. It is important  for us to have their backs.   I am proud that the United States has imposed unprecedented sanctions  and export controls on the Russian economy. I am proud of what our  President has done by solidifying the support of all NATO nations,  something that hasn't been done for a very long time.   NATO countries throughout Europe are stepping up in terms of how much  money they are committing to their defense. They all recognize that  this is about more than Ukraine. This is about freedom for all of  Europe.   I commend the Speaker for working quickly to bring a Russia energy  sanctions package to the floor and committing to sending $14 billion to  Ukraine to aid its military and assist with humanitarian responses. We  must bring the full weight of the U.S. Government and our allies to  bear in holding Putin accountable for his aggression and his violations  of international law.   Let me show you this picture, Madam Speaker. This is International  Women's Day. There is no joy on the faces of these people. There are no  smiles.   This is Vladimir Putin's war. He has every intention to annihilate an  entire population of people in Ukraine. This is not just an unprovoked  war; this is a premeditated, savage, murderous, and tyrannical attempt  of genocide.   I hope that we have the guts to call him out. We need to create our  red line, and our red line should be that every Ukrainian person who  wants to leave the country will have safe passage to a safe country  before another bullet or another missile is put into the air.   I hope we do not see the unthinkable happen in Ukraine.   God bless our Ukrainian women and children. God bless our Ukrainian  President. God bless the military in Ukraine who fights on and all  those who recognize that freedom is not cheap and freedom is not given.  If you want a democracy, you have to be willing to put your name, your  body, and your soul on the line to protect the community that you love.   Madam Speaker, I have the great and distinct honor to yield to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who is my colleague whom I adore.  She co-chairs the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus and has been  passionate about drawing attention to the fate of the Ukrainian people.                                time  2100     I thank the remarkable gentlewoman from Ohio, whose  passion and commitment to the Ukrainian people is just so evident. She  said that they will be victorious. I believe her because we are going  to make sure they are going to be victorious. We have their backs.   I am reminded of this comment by one Ukrainian woman, and she said:  Nobody thought this is how we would spend our weekend; a teacher from  the town of Dnipro told a cameraman as she and her neighbors made  molotov cocktails. She said: I planned to plant tulips and daffodils on  my backyard today. Instead, I learned to fire arms and get ready for  the next night of attacks on Kyiv. These women are strong and  committed, and we will have their backs.   It is now a great privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), co-chair of the bipartisan Women's Caucus and  a talented leader.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Dean) for her outstanding remarks.   Madam Speaker, there are many people to thank. There are many  organizations to thank.   When we look at who is bringing shelter and aid to the Ukrainian  people now, the nonprofit organizations around the world, CARE,  Catholic Relief Services, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization,  the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Rescue  Committee, Plan International, Save the Children, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF,  World Food Program, and World Health Organization. To all of them, we  say thank you.   Let's be clear: This is Putin's war. He will pay the price. His  vicious, premeditated attempt of genocide of the Ukrainian people will  not be tolerated.   Tonight, I want to close with this photograph of Ukrainian women in  uniform. They are fighting for their country, their future, their  children, and truly for freedom around the world.   Madam Speaker, I yield back.                            ____________________
