 Mr. President, last week, we celebrated the 100th  anniversary of Congress passing the 19th Amendment. This week,  coincidentally enough, we celebrate the birthday of the only woman to  vote on the 19th Amendment, Montana's own Jeannette Rankin.   Jeannette Rankin, who helped women in Montana and Washington, earned  the right to vote in 1914, 3 years before she became the first woman  elected to Congress and 5 years before she helped pass the 19th  Amendment, making her the only woman to vote for nationwide women's  suffrage.   I say ``nationwide'' because before Congress passed the 19th  Amendment, women had already won the right to vote in more than a dozen  States, almost all of which were west of the Mississippi. And that was  no accident.   The demands of frontier life were such that men and women often had  to work side by side in order to meet those demands, and they still do  that today. So it is no surprise that it was a western woman who led  the effort on the House floor to pass a constitutional amendment  granting women the right to vote.   As a freshman Member of the minority party, Rankin was denied the  chairmanship of the newly established Woman Suffrage Committee, but she  was named ranking member. The group went to work drafting a women's  suffrage amendment on the morning of January 10, 1918. The Capitol was  crowded with people to hopefully secure a seat in the House Gallery for  the suffrage debate. Rankin opened the debate with an impassioned  speech that  [[Page S3460]]  helped convince her colleagues in the House to pass the amendment. It  was passed by the thinnest possible margin.   Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass that amendment in that  Congress, but Rankin's victory in the House marked a major milestone in  the suffrage movement and laid the groundwork for the 19th Amendment's  passage just 18 months later.   Today, in honor of her birthday on Tuesday and the suffrage  centennial this past week, I would like to read an excerpt from that  impassioned speech that Representative Rankin gave on the House floor  more than 100 years ago.         Today, as never before, the Nation needs its women--needs       the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds.       Their energy must be utilized in the most effective service       they can give.        Are we now going to refuse these women the opportunity to       serve in the face of their plea--in the face of the Nation's       great need?        Deep down in the hearts of the American people is a living       faith in democracy.        Sometimes it is not expressed in the most effective way.       Sometimes it seems almost forgotten.        But when the test comes, we find it is still there, groping       and aspiring, and helping men and women to understand each       other and their common need.        It is our national religion, and it prompts in us the       desire for that measure of justice, which is based on equal       opportunity, equal protection, equal freedom for all.        This proposed amendment should be passed as an act of right       and justice to the women of America.        To my mind, this is one of the most important questions       that has been presented to Congress since I have been a       member.        One that has far more wide-reaching effect upon the people       of the country--insofar as what the country stands for and       what we stand for--than any other question since the writing       of the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of our       Constitution.        These are the people who are resting their faith in the       Congress of the United States because they believe Congress       knows what democracy means.        Can we afford to allow these men and women to doubt for a       single instant the sincerity of our protestations of       democracy?        How shall we answer their challenge, gentleman? How shall       we explain to them the meaning of democracy if the same       Congress that voted for war to make the world safe for       democracy refuses to give this small measure of democracy to       the women of our country?    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first of all, it is indeed a pleasure to  be on the Senate floor with the chairman of the VA Committee, Senator  Johnny Isakson. I think we all know we wouldn't be talking about the  blue water Navy legislation, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act,  without Johnny Isakson.   Johnny has been an incredible leader on the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee since he took it over, and I can't thank him enough for what  he has done to make this a reality. It has been a long time coming. If  there is anybody that deserves this to happen, it is the folks who  served in Vietnam. Quite frankly, the sacrifice that they made during  that war was like all other wars, and it was pretty darn incredible.   This victory is for the folks who were exposed to Agent Orange, and  Agent Orange, by the way, is a herbicide that was not handled properly,  and, quite frankly, causes real problems, and it has shown now that it  causes real problems among the men and women who handled it, who were  sprayed by it, who drank it, and who were exposed to it. So it is long  past time that we deal with those folks in a way that meets their needs  because of their sacrifice supporting that war.   I would just say that I come to the floor a lot, and I am  disappointed in the U.S. Senate almost every day because they don't do  what they need to do as far as checks and balances in this country. But  today I come and I say thank you to the U.S. Senate. Thank you to the  folks who didn't put a hold on this bill, who were able to push it  through, because, quite frankly, this rights a wrong that has been  perpetrated by a government that has ignored them for far too long.   Very quickly, since we do have the time, I just want to go through  what this bill does. It ensures that veterans who served just off the  shores of Vietnam are presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange,  just like those who served on land. The fact is that they were exposed.  The fact is that now this bill recognizes that.   It restores VA benefits to literally tens of thousands of blue water  Navy veterans who had their disability eligibility taken away back in  2002. It requires the VA to contact veterans who filed denied claims  and who are now eligible for retroactive benefits. That means that for  those folks who had their benefits taken away, the VA now needs to  contact them and say: Look, the playing field has changed.   It extends presumption of Agent Orange exposure to veterans who  served along the Korean DMZ, something we don't talk about much, and it  expands benefits to include children born with spina bifida due to a  parent's exposure in Thailand.   I have said this many, many times. Taking care of our veterans is a  cost of war. That is why we need to be very careful when we send our  troops into battle, because they are exposed physically and mentally to  things that normal people are never exposed to.  [[Page S3461]]    For years, I have heard from veterans who were counting on us to pass  the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act because, quite frankly, they  weren't getting the benefits that they were promised when they signed  up. When they were put in harm's way, the country turned their back on  them.   They are veterans like Mike Stone from Kalispell, who served as a  blue water sailor in 1974 and has since been diagnosed with a variety  of illnesses linked to Agent Orange, like diabetes and heart disease.  Now Mike Stone can receive the benefits he has earned.   This bill is for Mike and for so many veterans like him who have  waited so long for the government to deliver. Once again, under the  leadership of Chairman Johnny Isakson, we are able to live up to the  commitment to justice for the blue water Navy veterans in Montana and  across this country who have sacrificed to keep us safe and free.   I would urge the President to quickly sign this bill into law. It is  the right thing to do, and I am proud that the Senate has finally done  it.   I yield the floor.
