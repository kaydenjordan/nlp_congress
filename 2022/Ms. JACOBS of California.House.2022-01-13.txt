 Madam Speaker, our constituents sent us  here to deliver for them, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is  delivering for San Diego.   Recently, the Department of Transportation announced that $24 million  has been allocated to the San Diego International Airport, supporting  tourism for our international city and helping our economy recover.   But it is not just the airport. $4.8 billion in highway funding has  been allocated to California already, the first of more than $29  billion in road and bridge funding coming to our State.   Last week, I visited sites in my district, in El Cerrito, Kensington,  and Talmadge, where neighborhood roads were cracked, crumbling, and in  need of repair.   I have spoken with constituents, local officials, and small business  owners in La Mesa and El Cajon about the importance of transit,  walkability, and broadband because this may be the largest  infrastructure bill since Eisenhower, but it is also one that is  focused on the needs of the 21st century.   Connecting people by roads, transit, and high-speed internet can help  us cross divides and expand opportunity. And it makes our society  fairer, more sustainable, and more equitable.                            ____________________
