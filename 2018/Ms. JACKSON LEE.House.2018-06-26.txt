 Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and  Ranking Member Visclosky for shepherding H.R. 6157, the ``Defense  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019,'' to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 increases funding for the PTSD by $5  million.   These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard  to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in  underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature  wound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.   For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm's way, it  is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen  and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see  on a daily basis.   In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can  obliterate your best friend and right in front of your face.   Yet, you are trained and expected to continue on with the mission,  and you do, even though you may not even have reached your 20th  birthday.   But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the  stress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your  thoughts and memories.   And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the  enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep.   These are called flashbacks; a person having a flashback may lose  touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening  all over again.   Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD  also have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD.   These veterans have co-occurring disorders, which include depression,  alcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety  disorders.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 recognizes that these soldiers are first  and foremost, human, who live their experiences.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 will help ensure that ``no soldier is  left behind'' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward  hard to reach veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are  homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   I urge all Members to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, let me first thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky and the staff for shepherding this legislation.   My amendment provides flexibility for the Secretary of Defense to  allocate resources needed to provide technical assistance by U.S.  military women to military women in other countries combating violence  as a weapon of war, terrorism, human trafficking, and narcotics  trafficking, to ameliorate their impact on women and girls across the  globe.   More and more, we are seeing that, in the countries where terror is  perpetrated, more women are being allowed to be part of their military.   We know of the growing leadership of women in our military, rising in  responsibility and rank throughout all of the services.   As a member of the Afghan task force, which I co-chaired for a number  of years, I have seen women leadership dealing with peace around the  world.   The purpose of my amendment is to provide the Secretary of Defense  flexibility to work with military women in the United States, for them  to interact with military women face-to-face, one-on-one, as they work  to develop security measures that, in particular, will protect women  and girls.   Women and girls are more subject to human trafficking. They are more  subject to being victims of narcotics trafficking. They are more  subject to being victims of war and terrorism as they try to protect  their families.   I remember, in the early stages of the Afghan war and after the  attempt with the new President to begin to write a constitution in  Afghanistan, one of the issues was to elect more women at that time.                                time  1700    We did do that. I met those women who were in the Afghan Government.  But, tragically, in the period of time that we left to go to Iraq, many  of those women were killed as they went to their home districts.   So the idea of protecting women through women who are in the  military, or to develop strategies, is very important.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment to foster peace and relationships and the interaction between  women here in the United States, with their expertise, and women who  are now rising in various militaries in countries where terrorism is  raging, to be able to help those women as well.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their  devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives  to keep our nation safe and for their work in ensuring that they have  resources needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest fighting force  for peace on earth.   Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the  national goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on  earth.   The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 is to provide the  Secretary of Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to  provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women  in other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism,  human trafficking, narcotics trafficking.   Mr. Chairman, the United States is committed to combating violent  extremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of  terrorism.   The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and  technological capability that will aid not only in combating and  defeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent  persons, especially women, girls, and the elderly.   But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary  technical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very  quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or  norms of morality and decency.   Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant  terrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai  Peninsula which poses a threat to Egypt.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 help provide the Department of Defense  with the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries  on innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources  that promote the security of the American people and allied nation  states.   Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact  on women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on  us all.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by  terrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war,  affecting over twenty thousand women and girls.   Looking at the history of terrorism highlights the importance of  providing technical assistance through our military might, as this  enables us to combat terrorism which now can plague us here in the  United States.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1 will help curb terrorism abroad by making  available American technical military expertise to military in other  countries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their  country and to keep those terrorists out of our country.   Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of  terrorists.   These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care  providers, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the  diplomatic corps and the Armed Services.   This is why the technical assistance offered by our military  personnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local  forces to combat terrorism.   Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and  cannot not be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to  our national security and the security of the world.   Mr. Chairman, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and  the Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of  highest national priorities.   Collectively, helping our neighbors and their military build capacity  to combat terrorism, eradicate human trafficking, stop narcotics  trafficking and negate their impact on women and girls across the globe  serves our national interest.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 1.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for her  understanding and graciousness, as well as I thank the ranking member.  This is something I have worked on over the years.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize that terrorism,  human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and their impact on women and  girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on us all.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture, and human trafficking by  terrorists and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war,  affecting more than 20,000 women and girls. I am sure that number has  grown.   We are all well aware of the Chibok girls taken in Nigeria as victims  of Boko Haram. I am grateful for this amendment because the victims  have included Christians, Muslims, journalists, healthcare providers,  relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the diplomatic corps and  the armed services. Working with our women in the United States  military and our efforts with strategy will be an effective tool in  helping women across the world.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand my good friend's  challenges and his frustration, but I recognize that the area of which  he is speaking, which I have been to as well, is a frontier area. That  is an area where terrorists can be harbored.   But the Pakistani military has, over the years, been fighting against  terrorism. Pakistanis in Pakistan have, themselves, suffered at the  hands of terrorists. And if we take this amount of money, the  engagement and partnership that we have, the response to the United  States that is important, the collaboration with the forces in  Afghanistan will be diminished.   The Pakistani military has shed blood, has lost treasure in the fight  against terrorism. There are, of course, important improvements that  they can make, and I believe the funding has the kind of guidelines and  structures to do so to protect the Pakistani people against terrorism  as well. They want to live in peace.   So I would just say that it is important that we keep the engagement  and the dialogue as well as involvement of the Pakistani military in  fighting terrorism, and these resources are necessary for it to do so.
