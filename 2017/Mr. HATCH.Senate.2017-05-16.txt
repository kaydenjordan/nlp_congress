 Mr. President, peace and order are the indispensable  pillars of a stable society. They grant us security in our daily lives,  trust in our communities, and faith in our democratic institutions.  Where peace and order reign, so too does society thrive and prosper,  but none of that is possible without our Nation's 700,000 men and women  in blue.   Each and every day, these brave sons and daughters--brave souls-- stand up for all of us. Each and every day, they stand guard, ready to  do justice or risk harm--all on our behalf. So today I rise on behalf  of a grateful Nation to recognize them. Their performance is  exceptional, and their sacrifice is immense.   Far too often, we take our police officers for granted. Far too  often, we forget how hard it is to win and how easy it is to lose the  peace and order that we all enjoy, but our police officers never  forget. They are always at the ready. As we honor them this week, we  remember that the question is not ``What causes violence or what causes  crime?'' but rather, ``What causes peace, and what causes security?''   The answer is our men and women in blue.   In celebration of our National Police Week, I wish to express my  profound appreciation for our Nation's law enforcement community--the  courageous men and women who each day put the safety of others before  their own. Their success is impossible to fully measure. It cannot be  counted in crime statistics or etched into medals. It can only be seen  in the peace and order that their sacrifice makes possible.   Therefore, allow me for a moment to speak directly to our police  officers.   Trust that your selflessness does not go unseen, that your service  does not go unfelt, and that your sacrifice does not go unknown. We  appreciate you, we support you, and we honor you. Law enforcement is  among the noblest of professions. You are the brave guardians among us  who fight for peace and protect the vulnerable from harm. On behalf of  a grateful nation, I wish to thank you and your families for bearing  the burden, shouldering the sacrifice, and making us all proud.   Let it be known that I proudly back the blue.   This is a critical moment to show the police our support. We live in  a time when law enforcement officials are not only underappreciated but  often maligned and, quite often, openly disparaged. Day in and day out,  they suffer criticism and pressure. This week we let them know of our  respect and admiration.   Today, I wish to express my gratitude for our men and women in  uniform by sharing stories of their heroism. You see, we hear all about  police mistakes, and we hear wall-to-wall coverage of the  controversies, but we seldom hear about the acts of bravery and  professionalism that distinguish our police officers as the finest in  the world. In particular, I would like to relate the account of Utahns  Bre and Kayli Lasley, two sisters whose lives were saved by an on-duty  police officer.   In September 2015, a man armed with a knife climbed through a bedroom  window in Bre and Kayli's Salt Lake City apartment. Once inside, he  brutally beat both sisters before pulling out a knife and repeatedly  stabbing Bre. Just as the attacker raised his knife to Bre's throat,  Salt Lake City police officer Ben Hone charged into the room. He told  the intruder to drop his knife.   In that critical moment, with lives literally hanging in the balance,  Bre remembers:         That's when I saw the officer, and he was our angel . . . I       looked at the officer in his eyes, and he was so professional       and calm.    When the attacker refused to surrender his weapon, Officer Hone  raised his service pistol and fired, killing the armed intruder and  saving Bre's life. In that moment, Officer Hone was truly Bre's  guardian angel.   She remembers:         When [we] made eye contact, I knew I was safe. It's a       miracle that he had so much composure and was able to take       that shot.    In recognition of his heroism, Officer Ben Hone was honored by the  National Associations of Chiefs of Police and the American Police Hall  of Fame as the 2015 Law Enforcement Officer of the Year. I think it was  an honor richly deserved.   Officer Hone survived that day. For that, we give thanks, but the sad  reality is that many lose their lives in the line of duty. So today I  wish to honor those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice  and paid the highest price that society can ask. Our debt to them will  not--indeed, cannot--be repaid.   Among the fallen is Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Ellsworth, who  died only a few days after being struck by a car while on duty in Box  Elder County. We also mourn the passing of West Valley City police  officer Cody Brotherson and Greater Salt Lake Unified Police Department  officer Douglas Barney, who were both killed in the line of duty this  past year in Utah.   I express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of these  brave heroes and the countless others who have experienced similar  tragedies.   Although we cannot bring these officers back, we can honor their  legacies by committing ourselves to supporting their brothers and  sisters in uniform. To that end, I have introduced and cosponsored a  number of bills this Congress that are meant to assist law enforcement  as they serve our communities. These bills include the Rapid  [[Page S2951]]  DNA Act, the Probation Officer Protection Act, and the Child Protection  Improvements Act. Just yesterday, I joined Senator Coons in introducing  the U.S. Marshals Service Hiring Improvement Act, which was named in  honor of U.S. Marshals Service deputy Patrick T. Carothers, who was a  26-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service who died in the line of  duty in Georgia in November 2016.   Last week, I was grateful to see the Senate Judiciary Committee  favorably report my bipartisan bill--the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. This  critical legislation, which has garnered support from the National  Association of Police Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, and  the National District Attorneys Association, updates the law and  leverages advancements in rapid DNA technology to expedite analysis in  the FBI's Combined DNA Index System. If enacted, this commonsense  proposal will enable law enforcement to analyze DNA in record time,  reducing backlogs in rape kits and keeping violent criminals off of our  streets. By facilitating the use of rapid DNA technology, this bill  will also help to exonerate those wrongly accused of crime.   The Rapid DNA Act has received strong support from U.S. Attorney  General Sessions. During his confirmation hearing, Attorney General  Sessions said:         Rapid DNA analysis is a hugely important issue for the       whole American criminal justice system. It presents       tremendous opportunities to solve crimes in an effective way       and produce justice because it's the kind of thing that you       can't fake or mislead, so I am very strongly in favor of       it.''    In remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee, former FBI Director  James Comey said that the Rapid DNA Act ``will help us change the world  in a very exciting way,'' and it ``will materially advance the safety  of the people of the United States.''   Each time I talk to a police officer, I always hear nearly the same  thing. They have no need for fanfare or fame. All they need is the  public's support and the tools necessary to do the job. In  commemoration of National Police Week, let's make sure to give them  both. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing these bills and  in showing our heroes in blue the gratitude and admiration they  deserve.
