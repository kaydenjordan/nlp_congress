 Mr. President, this week, NASA Associate Administrator,  former astronaut, and my friend Colonel Robert Cabana announced his  retirement, effective December 31, after more than 38 years of public  service to NASA. In his current capacity as Associate Administrator,  Colonel Cabana served as the Agency's highest ranking civil servant,  third highest ranking NASA official, and the senior adviser to NASA  Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. Colonel  Cabana's legacy, among many things, includes a significant contribution  to the Nation's human spaceflight program and decades of energetic  leadership at the Agency. On a personal level, he played an important  leadership role within the astronaut corps, including as chief of  NASA's Astronaut Office when I was as an astronaut and during my  selection and early years at NASA. I am honored to congratulate Bob on  his retirement and thank him for his many years of service.   Born in Minneapolis, Bob graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy,  became a naval aviator, and graduated with distinction from the U.S.  Naval Test Pilot School in 1981. During his military career, he logged  over 7,000 hours in more than 50 different kinds of aircraft. He  retired as a colonel from the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2000.   Bob was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1985 and went on to log  38 days in space during four shuttle missions. He piloted the Space  Shuttle Discovery on missions STS-41 in 1990 and STS-53 in 1992. During  STS-53, the crew conducted microgravity research experiments that  helped pave the way for future operations aboard the International  Space Station. He commanded Columbia's STS-65 mission in 1994, and in  1998, his final flight, he commanded Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-88,  which was the first International Space Station assembly mission.   The International Space Station has been orbiting Earth about every  90 minutes and conducting groundbreaking science since November 2000  thanks to the contributions by Bob during STS-88. While at the Johnson  Space Center, he served as the lead astronaut in the Shuttle Avionics  Integration Laboratory, Mission Control Spacecraft Communicator-- CAPCOM--and as the director of Flight Crew Operations Directorate.  [[Page S5538]]    He went on to serve as the Deputy Director of the Johnson Space  Center, the Center Director of NASA's Stennis Space Center, and then  the Center Director at the Kennedy Space Center in 2007, where he led  its transition from retirement of the space shuttle to a multi-user  spaceport once again launching NASA astronauts to low Earth orbit and,  for the first time, doing so with commercial partners. He served for  more than a decade at the Kennedy Space Center until Senator Nelson  called him up to headquarters in 2021.   And as Associate Administrator of the Agency, Bob has led NASA's 10  Center Directors, as well as the Mission Directorate Associate  Administrators at NASA Headquarters in Washington. He has been the  Agency's chief operating officer for more than 18,000 employees and  oversaw an annual budget of more than $25 billion.   Bob's many achievements have been recognized with induction into the  Astronaut Hall of Fame and being named an associate fellow in the  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a fellow in the  Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He has received numerous personal  awards and decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and  the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award. He also is a recipient of  the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement's National Space  Trophy.   Thank you and congratulations to Bob for your many years of service,  your dedicated leadership at NASA, your contribution to our Nation's  spaceflight program, and your inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
