 Mr. President, I rise today to honor WHAS Radio on  entering its 100th year of service to the city of Louisville and  Commonwealth of Kentucky. WHAS started broadcasting on July 18, 1992,  and has covered numerous historical moments, including the first live  broadcast of the Kentucky Derby, Pearl Harbor, and Presidential  interviews. As one of the longest running radio stations in the  country, WHAS has won countless awards, including the Associated Press  and Peabody Awards.   During these past 100 years, WHAS has solidified its reputation as a  leader in crisis coverage, specifically severe weather. When an F4  tornado hit Louisville in 1974, WHAS traffic reporter Dick Gilbert  followed the tornado in his helicopter, giving listeners live updates  of the storm's location and resulting damage. During the Ohio River  flood of 1937, WHAS aired 115,000 messages, despite the electrical  power shutdown.   Since 1954, WHAS has served as the flagship station in the Crusade  for Children, which raises millions of dollars for children's charities  throughout Kentucky every year. In the 2022 telethon, WHAS helped raise  $5,133,684.69, making the Crusade one of America's most successful  local telethons.   A dedication to informing and enlightening the city of Louisville has  defined the first 100 years of broadcasting for WHAS. As we look toward  the future, I have no doubt that WHAS will continue to play an integral  role in keeping listeners all around the Commonwealth informed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Dennison's Roadside Market of Horse Cave, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Sometimes, a great idea will just present itself, as it did for Kathy  Dennison in her garden over 30 years ago. A tomato stand, she  suggested, right there on their front lawn. Though her husband was  skeptical at first, the first few years of their little tomato stand  business proved successful, so much so that the grass in their front  lawn was worn away from all the foot traffic. As the years went past,  their popularity continued to grow, and eventually, the Dennisons  realized they needed to expand their operation. The Dennisons, ever  resourceful, looked to their own land when considering expansion. Thus,  the couple renovated the old tobacco barn on their property to  facilitate their ever-growing business. Fast forward 20-some years  later, and the couple now owns and operates a full-fledged country  store, featuring in-season produce, jams, salsas, salad dressings,  baskets, mums, and other home decorations.   The Dennisons take special care to only sell local produce; so local  that much of it is grown on their own property. The store offers a full  bounty of goods, and if the produce is not grown on their own property,  it is grown on one of their neighbor's farms, making this market not  only a community attraction but a communal effort to serve Kentuckians  the finest produce available in Horse Cave. The selection of produce  offered at Dennison's Roadside Market changes throughout the year  depending on what is in season, so customers know that all the food in  the store is sold at their optimal condition. Dennison's Roadside  Market prides itself on selling fruits and vegetables within a week or  so of being picked from the farm. Their inventory is not confined to  food; they also sell pottery, candy, baskets, and other products made  locally, always adhering to the Dennison's philosophy of home-grown and  high-quality.   In the years between their little tomato stand and the large country  store it has grown into, the public response to Paul and Kathy's  business has been overwhelmingly positive. Dennison's Roadside Market  has been a great success, serving as the go-to store for locals in need  of groceries and acting as a prominent destination for tourists  visiting Kentucky. Tourists from as far as Australia have come to  Dennison's seeking authentic local produce.   As if operating their own store were not already enough work, the  Dennisons also run their own farm. When February rolls around each  year, Paul and Kathy begin their cultivation process, starting in the  greenhouse where they first sow their seeds. Some days, the couple work  as late as 8 or 9 p.m., maintaining their crops in order to maximize  the amount of fruit and vegetables available at harvest. Moreover, the  couple strives to make Dennison's a welcoming environment not for only  its customers, but for its employees as well. Those who work at  Dennison's Roadside Market describe it as ``an amazing place to work''  and ``something new all the time.''   Selling locally sourced goods is not the only way Dennison's supports  their local community. Dennison's often welcomes other small businesses  to utilize the open space on its property. Local food trucks will drive  from all around to offer their fare to the many customers shopping at  Dennison's Market. Their reach expands beyond the community of Horse  Cave, with Bucky Bee's BBQ of Cave City, KY, and Hawaiian Shave Ice of  Glasgow, KY, coming over to Dennison's to set up shop alongside the  market. Collaborating with other Kentucky small businesses not only  provides a fun and friendly atmosphere to their market, it also allows  Paul and Kathy Dennison to share in the bounty of their wonderful Horse  Cave community.   When a small business is as beloved as Dennison's Roadside Market, it  is hard for critics to ignore. Paul and Kathy's business has received  widespread acclaim, earning Best Farm Produce by the News-Herald,  second place in Best Farm Tourist Attraction by Kentucky Living, and is  currently a finalist for Best in Kentucky by Kentucky Living. Paul and  Kathy's resolute dedication and immense passion for their business is  the reason why Dennison's is able to offer the highest quality goods  each consecutive year. I want to commend this hard-working couple for  their dedication and resourcefulness, as they took what was a fertile  garden and grew it into an esteemed venture treasured by the entire  community. Congratulations to Paul and Kathy Dennison and to the entire  team at Dennison's Roadside Market. I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
