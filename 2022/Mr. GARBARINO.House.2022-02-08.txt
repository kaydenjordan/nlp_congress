 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3076,  the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021.   The United States Postal Service is in urgent need of reform. The  U.S. Postal Service provides an essential service to the American  people, but due to losses in revenue year after year, the long-term  viability of that service is in jeopardy. In fact, it is projected that  the U.S. Postal Service will run out of money completely by 2024.   This bill would institute reforms that would save the Postal Service  an estimated $46 billion over 10 years. Among other provisions, the  Postal Service Reform Act would require postal employees to enroll in  Medicare when they are eligible and to eliminate the unreasonable  requirement that the Postal Service prefund its retiree health benefits  75 years into the future.   Additionally, this bill would improve service by instituting  transparency requirements, promoting compliance with on-time delivery  of mail, requiring operation of at least 6 days a week, and expanding  nonpostal services.   We cannot turn a blind eye to the collapse of our postal system. I  urge every one of my colleagues to support this bill to prevent this.
