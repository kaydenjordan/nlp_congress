 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a stand in support  of H.R. 8, which takes a critical first step to ensure that every  person who purchases a gun undergoes a background check.   People should have the right to feel safe from gun violence in their  community, including at home, at work, and at school. Unfortunately,  that is not the case today in our country. Time and time again, our  communities have experienced gun violence due to the absence of  commonsense gun safety measures.   Only 12 days ago, five people, four of whom were my constituents,  left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in Aurora,  Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by an unspeakably  horrific act of gun violence.   It is time to take immediate action to help safeguard our communities  from gun violence, and today, for the first time in more than two  decades, the House of Representatives will vote on a major gun safety  bill, and I will support it.   H.R. 8 is a strong step toward making our communities safer, and I  look forward to continuing to work on commonsense legislation that  balances gun rights with the safety of our communities.                            ____________________
