 Mr. Speaker, policies have consequences. Over the last  2 years, we have seen a string of self-inflicted crises because of the  policies of my Democratic colleagues and this President.   Let me give you examples: $11 trillion over 2 years from my  Democratic colleagues, $6 trillion of which went to the national debt,  all of which lit the fuse on this inflation firestorm, this cost-of- living crisis that is punishing working families from coast to coast.  We have to stop the spending that is bankrupting this great country of  ours.   This President's dereliction of duty to uphold the laws of the land,  his failure to provide for a common defense, to defend our sovereign  borders, and to put the safety and security of the American people  first has created an unmitigated and unprecedented crisis at the  border, where we are being flooded with criminal activity and drugs  that are killing people--300 a day, the leading cause of death in the  United States.   We have a plan, and my Democratic colleagues are going to have to  respond to that. We are going to fund the government and keep it open,  but we are going to give you measures to secure the border and  prioritize the safety of the American people and reduce spending. We  are going to save this country and our children's future while we are  at it because that is the responsible thing to do not only for our  country and the citizens of our country but for future generations of  Americans who will inherit the whirlwind if we don't start reining in  this wasteful Washington spending.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Republican funding bill, and I  ask my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1230
