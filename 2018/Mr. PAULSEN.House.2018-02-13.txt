 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my strong support for  the Medicare Advantage program. I recently led a bipartisan letter with  298 Members of the House to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, or CMS, urging them to preserve and strengthen Medicare  Advantage. Millions of seniors rely on Medicare Advantage, and they  need access to the high-quality healthcare plan choices that Medicare  Advantage plans provide.   CMS will soon be issuing final policy and payment updates. These  changes will have widespread implications on Medicare beneficiaries  throughout the country. Our letter calls on CMS to preserve the  program's integrity and existing incentives for MA plans that will  offer high-quality, efficient, and patient-centered coverage options  for consumers.   Mr. Speaker, the Medicare Advantage program covers nearly 19 million  seniors across the country and provides care coordination, disease  management programs, out-of-pocket spending limits, access to  community-based programs, and additional supplemental benefits like  vision, dental, and even prescription drug coverage.   We need CMS to continue to strengthen and enhance Medicare Advantage  for our seniors.                            ____________________
