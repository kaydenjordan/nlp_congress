 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until  6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with last votes of the week expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspensions will be announced by the close of business  today.   The House will consider H.R. 1230, the Protect Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act. This bill ensures that victims of age  discrimination in the workplace can enforce their rights so that older  Americans are able to strengthen our economy by continuing to  contribute their talents to the workforce, a proposition that I  personally believe is very important.   In addition, the House will consider H.J. Res. 76, a Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval of the Department of Education's  borrower defense to repayment rule that leaves student loan borrowers  who were defrauded by their educational institutions with little or no  recourse.    That is a possibility, but they have not yet been  scheduled.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.   As to the issue of authorizations of military force consistent with  the War Powers Act and consistent with the Constitution of the United  States, which sets forth clearly that it is the Congress and only the  Congress that can declare war, we believed and still believe it was  necessary to move as quickly as possible to clarify that the  expectation of the Congress of the United States is that it would be  included in any conversation, discussion, and debate with reference to  whether or not we ought to take an act of war.   Without getting into the complexities, I would call your attention to  an extraordinarily good article that was in today's paper by Jim Webb,  the former Secretary of the Navy and a Navy Cross awardee who fought in  Vietnam and who served in the United States Senate, with reference to  whether or not legally the action that was taken by the President was  justified.                                time  1130    Let me say something, Mr. Speaker. I would hope this debate--and I  said this yesterday during the course of the debate--would not descend  into demagoguery.   I was very disappointed with a remark that was made by one of the  Republican Members of this House when he said, they are ``in love with  terrorists,'' referring to the Democrats, presumably, who were  proponents of assuring that the War Powers Act would be honored by the  President and with the constitutional requirement that we are the ones,  and only ones, who declare war. Not one of us loves terrorists.   He went on to say: ``We see that they mourn Soleimani more than they  mourn our Gold Star families.''   Now, that is interesting from, frankly, a member of a party whose  President criticized very, very sharply and directly a Gold Star  family, the Khans. It is ironic coming from a party whose President-- our President, but of the Republican Party--said he didn't respect John  McCain, one of America's great war heroes, who showed such courage.   So my point to the gentleman is that I would hope--Proverbs 19:5 says  this: ``A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who speaks lies  will not escape.''   I would hope the gentleman that uttered these comments would  apologize to every Member of this side of the aisle. The gentleman  correctly, just now, I thought, made a very calm and correct statement  with respect to that we ought to have a substantive debate.   I have criticized this Congress, others have criticized this  Congress, from both sides of the aisle, for not, over the last 30  years, passing Authorizations for Use of Military Force. The last one  we did, of course, was in 2001 and 2002.   The gentleman asked whether those bills may come to the floor. We  voted on them, as you know, previously. Those amendments passed. They  were in the National Defense Authorization Act to directly address the  issue of authorization of military forces and the expenditures of funds  in military action. Nobody laments the loss of Mr. Soleimani, who did,  in fact, not only plan, but execute and fund terrorist actions that  resulted in the loss of American life.   Having said that does not absolve us from the responsibility for  policies which are akin to or are acts of war. Without going further  into that, let me refer to what we did yesterday, and let me read from  this War Powers Act, Mr. Speaker.   Congressional Action, paragraph (c): ``Concurrent resolution for  removal by President of United States Armed Forces.   ``Notwithstanding subsection (b), at any time that United States  Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United  States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or  specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the  President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.''   That is what we passed yesterday. Many Republicans, Mr. Speaker,  said, well, this is an act that has no consequence. I would hope that  none of us believes that the expression of opinion by the Congress of  the United States by majority vote in each House has no consequence. If  that is the case, we are in a bad time in our democracy.   So, what we did yesterday was consistent with section (c) of section  1544 regarding congressional action, and it is exactly what we did  yesterday.   It will go to the Senate. It will have, as we understand from the  Parliamentarians in the Senate, privileged status, meaning that the  Senate will have to consider that, and also meaning that it can be  passed or defeated by a majority vote.   This is a serious time. Taking the kind of military action we took  was a serious step. Many of us were not very pleased with the lack of  substantive information that we received at the briefing this week.  Obviously, many Members of the United States Senate were not pleased as  well.   So I would say to my friend, Mr. Speaker, it is important that this  body, confronted with one of its most important and serious and  consequential decisions--that is, the declaration of war and military  action against another nation--that it be debated seriously without  pejoratives being projected at either side, without invective similar  to the one that I just read, and without the aspersions that somehow,  if you believe the Constitution of the United States requires the  Congress to act before we can take actions of war, that somehow that  implies that you are in bed with or temporizing about or favorable to  those who commit terror.   That is a McCarthy tactic. It is highly offense. And, if said on this  floor, would be subject to the words being taken down and the Member  not being allowed to speak again on this floor during that day.   Mr. Speaker, let me, in closing on this response, simply say to the  Republican whip that I agree with his premise that we ought to have a  careful, adult, substantive discussion about policies that may plunge  this Nation into war. That is our duty. That is what our citizens  expect of us.  [[Page H166]]    I think we had that yesterday. Strike that. I think in some instances  we had a serious discussion, but in some instances there was too much  invective that we were giving aid and comfort to terrorists.   That is a slippery slope if we cannot discuss what posture the United  States ought to be in and exercise our constitutional duties to decide  whether this Nation ought to go to war with a foreign country, with  another nation. Hopefully, we can have that in the future, because it  is one of the most consequential debates that this body ever has.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell the gentleman, again, that we may be taking  up additional legislation consistent with the War Powers Act. I believe  the Senate, hopefully, will, next week or--at the latest, I think they  have 15 days or 10 days to consider it and put it on the Senate floor  for a vote so that we can transmit to the President of the United  States Congress' view on how carefully we ought to approach these  issues.    Very frankly--I will say, sadly--there is much sentiment on this side  of the aisle that the Commander in Chief does not address these issues  carefully and thoughtfully and in concert with his advisers and the  advisers in the Congress of the United States. We had no consultation.  We didn't even have a notice, much less consultation of this action.   No one, I would close with, laments the loss of a life who has  sponsored, funded, and advocated terrorism. But this is not about him.  It is about us. It is about our Constitution. It is about our  responsibility. It is about how these decisions ought to be made.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I thank the gentleman  for calling that to my attention.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would call my attention to  those statements and the speakers of those, I would be happy to oblige  and talk to them.   I really do believe, Mr. Speaker, this issue should be handled in the  most responsible and respectful way possible, because it is one of the  most serious, if not the most serious, issues with which we will deal.  And we ought to deal with one another based upon the intellectual  arguments, the constitutional premises, and the law, not on  personalities or assertions of malintent.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Simply to focus on the Record and to make clear the Record, the 2002  Authorization for Use of Military Force to which the gentleman refers  authorizes the use of force: One, to defend against Iraq, not Iran; and  two, to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding  Iraq.   For counsel or the administration to argue that the 2002  Authorization for Use of Military Force authorized the action that was  taken, I think, is incorrect. That is what they do argue. It hasn't  been resolved by a court, but I believe, and I think many on my side of  the aisle and, frankly, I think many scholars around the country have  opined, that the 2002 authorization did not authorize that particular  act.   Again, no one laments the loss of Soleimani. Everybody agrees that he  sponsored, paid for and ordered committed acts of terrorism. And we  will continue to believe that the Congress needs to speak.   Whether or not a court would hold that the section that I just read  with reference to the President would have to take action in the event  that the Senate and the House adopt the concurrent resolution that we  passed yesterday, and that is now at the Senate and under the War  Powers Act will have to be considered by the Senate, and will be  subject to a majority vote, not a 60-vote threshold for passage.   I would hope that if Congress did that, that the President would  certainly take that into consideration and consult with the Congress on  any further action that he might take; unless, of course, and as the  War Powers Act authorizes, the President can and should, and the  military can and should take any actions necessary to defend itself in  the face of imminent threat and/or actual threat.    Mr. Speaker, in answer to the gentleman's question, the  expectation is that we will have, consistent with the letter just sent  to all of our Members, and instructions to Mr. Nadler, or suggestions  to Mr. Nadler, we do expect there to be legislation on the floor next  week with reference to what we call supplemental legislation for the  appointment of managers, the funding of the effort. And we expect the  papers will be sent sometime soon.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As the gentleman knows, of course, we have 275 bipartisan bills which  have been sent from the House to the Senate involving very, very  serious issues, dealing with the environment, dealing with wages, and  dealing with jobs, dealing with making our communities safer, dealing  with violence against women, dealing with equal pay for equal work,  which was something that John Kennedy signed in 1963, but is, today,  not a reality, unfortunately. So there are many issues I could name.  Obviously, a lot more, because there  [[Page H168]]  are 275 and we sent over 400 bills to the Senate and they sit untended.   Why? Because the Senate has been confirming judges.   Why? So they can put in judges that agree with their positions. That  is the irony of a party that was so intent, in my political life, in  making sure that judges acted only on the law. What philosophical  imprimatur has to be given to judicial appointments nowadays? And by a  majority leader who refused a President of the United States who  submitted a nominee, Mr. Garland, for 11 months.   It is inconceivable to me that any Founding Father thought, for 11  months--now, it has a been a few days since we passed impeachment that  we have sent those papers up.   For 11 months, a President of the United States, pursuant to his  constitutional authority and responsibility, sent a nominee to the  United States Senate; 11 months before the election. And the majority  leader said, tough. We are not going to consider it. We are not going  to allow the committee to consider it. We are not going to allow it to  be reported out to the floor and there is going to be no vote on it.    So, yes, there has been some delay, because in that context and in  the context of the majority leader working hand-in-glove with the  defendant, or the respondent, however you want to call it, in a civil  case, criminal case, hand-in-glove.   By his own admission he was not going to do anything that the  President didn't want him to do. It is like the prosecutor saying--or  the juror saying, I am not going to do anything that the defendant  doesn't want me to do.   So, yes, we have been very concerned, and are concerned to this day.  An honest trial--and that is what is the responsibility of the United  States Senate. An honest trial tries to elicit from both sides all of  the relevant evidence.   We are concerned that it appears that the Senate, certainly at this  juncture has made no decision to receive all the relevant evidence. We  think that is inconsistent with their responsibilities under the Senate  rules and to the American people. We lament that fact and we have been  trying to get from the Senate what are the rules?   Mr. Speaker, the other side talked a lot about process, about how  they needed to have this avenue, that avenue, and the other. That is  all we were asking because this is the trial, not the time when you  have, essentially, a grand jury deciding whether or not there is  probable cause that the President of the United States has abused his  power.                                time  1200    That is especially what our role is, as an analogy to a criminal  case. But there was no expression from the Senate that a normal process  to determine the truth of the allegation was going to be pursued in the  United States Senate.   The Speaker simply wanted to have that assurance. We have not gotten  it. The American people have not gotten it.   What has happened since we passed that resolution? A number of people  have come forward. Mr. Bolton, in particular, said that he will  testify. Other people have been identified as having relevant,  pertinent, firsthand knowledge, not hearsay, firsthand knowledge of the  allegations that are included in the Articles of Impeachment I and II.   I am hopeful that, in fact, the Senate, both Republicans and  Democrats, will come to an agreement that all the fact witnesses will  raise their hand to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.   The Senate is going to raise their hand under Senate rules and say  they swear to be impartial in consideration of the evidence, yet they  will not allow the evidence, apparently, at this point in time at  least, to be elucidated. I am hopeful that changes.   I expect, as I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, to the Republican whip,  that those papers will be transferred in the near term. I don't know  specifically when but in the near term to the Senate.   I am hopeful the American people will get what they deserve from the  United States Senate serving as essentially jurors and will be sworn in  as such by the Chief Justice, not by the Vice President presiding over  the Senate but the Chief Justice presiding over a quasi-legal, quasi- political process.   I will tell my friend that a letter has been sent. I do expect  legislation to be considered next week, which is necessary to proceed  with the process. I hope the process proceeds, Mr. Speaker, in a  judicial, fair way that allows all the evidence on both sides, from the  President's side and the House's side, which will carry the argument  justifying the Articles of Impeachment and the finding of fact that  those articles are, in fact, worthy of having the President of the  United States removed for abuse of power.   That is the issue. It ought to be argued fairly on both sides, and  the evidence ought to be adduced on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    First of all, the Constitution does not provide for a trial in the  House of Representatives, period.   However, Mr. Speaker, the minority continues to make the analogy of  what is done in the House: impeachment, analogous to an indictment,  making a charge and determining that there is probable cause.   Secondly, in the Nixon administration, there was a Democratic  Congress, and there was discussion back and forth. Guess what? The  President's witnesses came forward.   What happened in this case? The President said nobody can testify to  the Congress. I believe that was obstruction of justice, but that is  for the Senate to decide--certainly, obstruction of the Congress.   In the Clinton administration, the same thing happened. Witnesses  came forward, including, I believe, the Chief of Staff of the White  House. So it was a very different situation.   In addition, in both the Nixon and Clinton administrations, the  minority shoves aside the fact that there were special prosecutors that  had depositions of all the witnesses and were available in the United  States Senate at the time of the trial. So the Senate had full  information.   Thirdly, the gentleman does not either remember or assert, Mr.  Speaker, that the Judiciary Committee said to the White House counsel  that you can participate. There is time for you to come down. There is  time for you to call witnesses. There is time for you to make your  case. Mr. Cipollone, the White House counsel, notified the committee  they were not interested. Why were they not interested? Because, in my  opinion, their expectation is they were going to go to the Senate and  have the case dismissed without any evidence being adduced.   Mr. Speaker, I think that is unfortunate, but those are the facts.  That is what happened. If you make a further analogy of the grand jury,  the defendant plays no role in the grand jury, none, zero, zip, no  counsel, no witnesses in the room. The jury decides if there is  probable cause to believe that X committed an offense worthy of going  forward. That is what happens. There is no participation.   There was participation here. The President had opportunities here.  All the Republicans participated and could cross-examine the witnesses  that did, in fact, come forward in the Judiciary Committee, Oversight  and Reform Committee, Intel Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, and  Financial Services Committee.   I would hope that would happen in the Senate. If you want to know the  truth, Mr. Speaker, that is what ought to happen.   If it is just presenting information that is not relevant in this  trial, i.e., ``I did a good job on the economy. I did a good job on  foreign policy. I did a good job on protecting our borders.'' That is  the President's argument in a political sense. I understand that. But  that is not legally relevant information as to whether or not he abused  his power in particular in the phone call with the Ukrainians in which  he withheld money appropriated by the Congress of the United States to  help protect an ally, Ukraine, against incursion by Mr. Putin. I am  sure Mr. Putin was very pleased that that money did not go to President  Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.   We think that was an abuse of power. My friend the Republican whip  thinks it was not. I get that. That is what makes the world go around,  differences of opinion.   It is now in the Senate. That is where a trial is provided for in the  Congress. That is where witnesses should be provided. That is where  both sides ought to be able to make their arguments before the jury,  the United States Senate. Then and only then should the United States  Senate make a determination whether or not the allegations had merit  and warrant the consequences.   I tell my friend, when you make these analogies of what happened here  in the House, it is done. The whip may think it is bad, Mr. Speaker.  The whip may think it wasn't done correctly. But the proof in the  pudding will be: Is he urging the Senate to do what everybody in  America thinks of as a trial? That is what the Senate under the  Constitution is: the trier of the facts and law, presided over by the  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.   I would hope the gentleman would be urging as strenuously in the  Senate, where trial and proper procedures should be followed, as they  did here in the House.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, I don't know what analogy he  is using to process, but what he just said would effectively say, if  the witnesses weren't called and presented in the grand jury, then the  defense attorney can't call them, then the prosecutor can't call them.   That is absolutely untrue. I could use a harsher word of how lacking  in substance I think that representation is.   The Senate is now trying the case. The grand jury has sent the case  over there strong enough to have a significant majority of the House  vote for it, by the way, in a partisan sense, not a single Republican.  Well, there was a single Republican. As a matter of fact, there are  three or four who have talked to me privately--I will not mention their  names--but they didn't vote, as they talked to me.   But the fact of the matter is, what the gentleman's proposition is is  that if you didn't call the witnesses in the House, then you can't call  them in the Senate.   Now, the reason for that is because they don't want the witnesses  called, which is why the President told them, Don't testify in the  House.   They were asked to testify. And what happened when we asked them to  testify? No, you have to have a subpoena.   What happened when we had subpoenas when we talked to Mr. McGahn? He  went to court. And when he lost, he appealed, and they were going to  appeal to the Supreme Court. That takes forever.   The fact of the matter is there was certainly, from our perspective,  overwhelming evidence, not that he withheld money, but the reason he  withheld money.   Obviously in the cases cited by the minority whip, Congress had not  appropriated and directed that money to be sent to Ukraine. And, in  fact, President Obama gave significant aid. He didn't give them  missiles, but he gave significant aid and assistance to the Ukrainians.  But the fact of the matter is, we didn't direct him to send the money.   We directed this President to send the money. Why? As we have done  before on Russian sanctions very early on with Mr. McCarthy and I  cosponsoring legislation which directed the President to impose the  sanctions on Russia because we weren't confident that he would do so on  his own.   But the analogy that the gentleman continues to make as a  rationalization for why the Senate does not appear to be going to have  a fair, open trial-like, as the Constitution requires, with swearing to  be impartial, meaning they want to get at the facts and make a judgment  on the facts, he has not, Mr. Speaker, explained why he is not  recommending the same fairness that he wanted to have here.   He wasn't in charge. He says he didn't get it. I get that. But they  are in charge over there. And I would urge the minority whip to urge  the majority leader to have a trial as we would expect to have a trial  if either of us were under indictment. We would expect to be able to  call witnesses, and we would understand that the prosecution would call  such witnesses as they believe necessary and are relevant to the case.   That is a very important phrase I want to emphasize, ``relevant to  the case,'' because so many of the witnesses, like the whistleblower,  who is protected by our laws that we have passed from being exposed to  adverse actions, and the President says, Bring us the whistleblower.  The Republicans say, Bring us the whistleblower. The whistleblower  doesn't have any knowledge to testify on. They are correct: it was  hearsay.   He heard from somebody that the guy down the street committed a  crime. I didn't see it. He told me. So what do I do? I call up the  police and say, Joe Doe told me a crime is being committed down the  street. You better go see.    So I emphasize, Mr. Speaker, hopefully in closing, that we have  passed--Republicans all voted ``no,'' I get that. But the House of  Representatives believed by a majority vote that we had made a case for  probable cause. And under those circumstances, the Constitution says  the Senate will then try that case to determine whether or not, in  fact, the probable cause was accurate.   All we are asking is that it be done in a fair, open, and complete  manner. Because there was no Special Prosecutor, there was no way to  compel some of those witnesses who refused to come testify, who now,  John Bolton being the specific example, are saying, Yes, I will  testify.   Personally, I don't believe that the Senate majority leader wants  John Bolton to testify, but he clearly has firsthand knowledge, not the  whistleblower, not somebody told me, but firsthand knowledge. By the  way, when he heard about it, apparently he called it a drug deal.   So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the whip will urge the Senate to do what  he wanted done here, or perhaps take the position, they are wrong means  we can be wrong. Maybe two wrongs will make a right. That is not the  way we usually think of it, but I am hopeful that not only will the  minority whip, the Republican whip do that, I hope the minority leader  will do that. It would be good for the country.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for just one second  so I can clarify?    Mr. Speaker, we did not have a trial. The Constitution  does not require a trial. We are not the trial forum. The Senate is the  trial forum.   Certainly the gentleman has watched enough television trials, maybe  been in trials for all I know, I am a lawyer, so obviously I have been  in trials. That is the place where you call witnesses. That is where  the defendant has the right.   He has no right in the grand jury to call witnesses. He has no right  in the grand jury to be there. He has no right to have his lawyer in  the grand jury room.   Now, we afforded the President of the United States that right, and  he rejected it. His lawyer sent a letter to Mr. Nadler and said, Thank  you, but no thanks. We are not going to play.   So, Mr. Speaker, in my view, the minority leader, minority whip  continues to conflate the responsibility we had here in the House and  the responsibility the Senate has.   The Senate is the trier of facts, not the House. The House is the  determinant of whether there is probable  [[Page H171]]  cause, and we did that and it is over in the Senate, and it is their  responsibility and duty.   They lift their hands to swear they will be impartial, to get all the  relevant evidence--relevant evidence, relevant evidence--not just some  fishing expedition on either side, the prosecution or defense.   And with that, I hope we can end this debate, because it will be  endless if we do not, simply because we are not going to agree, Mr.  Speaker.   We have, obviously, very different perceptions as to what the duty of  the House was and very different perceptions that if we thought what we  did in the House was wrong, we ought to repeat it in the Senate.   I think the papers will be going to the Senate. The Senate will  decide what it is going to do. I hope the Senators comport themselves  as the Founders and the people would expect.    Mr. Speaker, I have nothing else at this time.
