 Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago, America enjoyed  the most promising economic expansion in our lifetimes, lifting  millions of Americans out of poverty, boosting wages for American  workers, and producing the lowest unemployment rates in 50 years.  Today, the American economy lies in rubble, with tens of millions of  Americans thrown into unemployment, poverty, and despair.   Now, that damage was not done by a virus. It was done by ordering  entire populations into indefinite home detention, shuttering countless  businesses, and desecrating the most fundamental human rights that our  Constitution demands our government to protect.   Now, we are told to follow the science and data. That would be nice,  for a change.   What does the science tell us about the severity of COVID-19? Well,  we know that about 80 percent of those who get it either have no  symptoms at all or experience it as a mild respiratory infection. In  New York, 74 percent of those who died were over age 65 and six one- hundredths of 1 percent were under the age of 18. Three-quarters of  those who died had underlying medical conditions.   So how does it follow the science to close the schools where it poses  the least danger while packing infected patients into nursing homes  where it poses the greatest danger?   Once epidemiologists began surveying general populations, they  discovered the disease isn't nearly as severe as the claims that set  off the global panic. Researchers at Stanford University surveyed the  population of Santa Clara, California, and estimated a fatality rate of  seventeen one-hundredths of 1 percent. New York serology tests revealed  a fatality rate of one-half of 1 percent.   So, simply stated, if you get the flu, your chance of survival is  99.9 percent; and according to these studies, if you get COVID-19, your  chance of survival is better than 99.5 percent.   So how does this science justify throwing nearly 40 million Americans  into unemployment?   Does the science support population-wide lockdowns?   In 2006, based upon an Albuquerque teenager's science paper, the Bush  administration proposed mass lockdowns in the event of a severe flu  pandemic. Leading epidemiologists warned at the time that: ``The  negative consequences of large-scale quarantine are so extreme that  this mitigation measure should be eliminated from serious  consideration.'' It wasn't.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has now admitted that 84 percent of  COVID-19 hospitalizations in New York are people who are either already  quarantined at home or are at nursing homes.   Statistical analysts, including Stanford University's Michael Levitt,  Tel Aviv University's Isaac Ben-Israel, Kentucky State University's  Wilfred Reilly, and Cypress Semiconductor's T. J. Rodgers, are finding  no significant statistical difference in the infection curves between  those jurisdictions that have destroyed their economies and those that  haven't. In fact, a study by J.P. Morgan has found an inverse  relationship as economies began to open back up.   A study of 318 outbreaks involving 1,245 cases in China found just  one outbreak that occurred outdoors, involving just two cases. Eighty  percent of the outbreaks occurred in people's homes. So how does it  follow the science to close outdoor venues and order people indoors?   Mr. Speaker, it is high time we considered how many Americans will  die because of the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Well Being Trust predicts up  to 75,000 ``deaths of despair'' due to suicide and drug and alcohol  abuse because of the lockdown.   In March, the Epic Health Research Network warned of a 94 percent  decline in breast, colon, and cervical cancer screenings. The Rape,  Abuse & Incest National Network reports a 22 percent increase in  children calling for help.   A 2011 Columbia University study funded by the National Institutes of  Health estimated that 4\1/2\ percent of all deaths in the United States  are related to poverty. So how does it follow the science to destroy  the livelihoods of millions of Americans, cut them off from their  social networks, force them into isolation, and plunge them into  poverty and despair?   Now, I don't blame public health officials. They have the luxury of  ignoring the effect of their policies beyond their area of expertise.  The responsibility rests, rather, with public officials who failed to  consider the catastrophic collateral damage that they have caused, who  became so drunk with power and so besotted with self-righteousness that  they lost any reference to common sense or any concern for the damage  they have done.                            ____________________
