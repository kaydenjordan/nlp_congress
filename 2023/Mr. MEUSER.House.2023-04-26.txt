 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas, the  chairman of the Budget Committee.   Mr. Speaker, we are debating a bill to accomplish goals, goals of  equal importance: Pay the Nation's debts and begin a discussion with a  plan so that we demonstrate to the American people that we in this  House will rein in the astronomically excessive spending of the past 3  years.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve and demand that we do this.  It is right and just. We must pay our Nation's debts. The American  people don't want to see the excesses continue. That sentiment is  pervasive.   Over the past 3 years, we have increased our national debt by almost  $12 trillion. Some was due to COVID, most due to ideology and complete  lack of fiscal restraint.   Mr. Speaker, our plan pays our Nation's debts, and we must, as well,  limit Federal excesses moving forward back to 2022 levels. We are not  talking about going into disasters here, 2022 levels with increases  moving forward. It saves money by largely reclaiming COVID funds--COVID  is over; those funds are available; they should be reclaimed--and by  creating growth initiatives, which we must have, Mr. Speaker, in order  to compete globally and assure the American Dream stays alive for our  children. The White House and this House must cooperate and do what is  right and just.
