 Madam Speaker, the House will vote again today  to reopen the United States Government and end President Trump's  government shutdown.   It is unwarranted and wrong to force our Coast Guard, TSA, Customs  and Border officers, air traffic controllers, and others to work  without pay.   One of my neighbors who runs a small business in Tampa in her  retirement years to support her son with mental disabilities advised me  that: As a tax preparer, I cannot get responses from the IRS that  affect my clients.   Another neighbor, who hoped to retire by year's end and is also  running out of hope, says: We are told there is no more funding after  January 18 for the courts, and our colleagues in the U.S. Attorney's  Office were not paid today, although they stay on the job prosecuting  criminals.   Our TSA officers, Customs and Border officers, and air traffic  controllers at Tampa International Airport are outstanding. Twelve-year  Officer Luis Mendoza advised me that: I have experienced previous  shutdowns and close calls, but I really feel that this one is going to  be a tough one to get through. The officers in Tampa are trying to hang  in there because we do believe in the oath we took to protect the  flying public and guard against threats. But many are trying to figure  out how to get through this.   Madam Speaker, I urge our Senate colleagues and President Trump to  take up our bipartisan bill and reopen this government.                            ____________________
