 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6602 would reauthorize the New Jersey Coastal  Heritage Trail Route through 2025.   H.R. 6602 would also instruct the Secretary of the Interior to draft  a strategic plan to enhance the trail route for the future, providing  opportunities to sustain this very worthwhile program.   I congratulate Representative LoBiondo for his hard work on this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge a  ``yes'' vote for this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2606 seeks to amend the 1947 Stigler Act by  removing the arbitrary blood quantum levels it established for Indian  land ownership. This will ensure that lands currently owned by the  citizens of the Five Tribes of Oklahoma will remain in restricted fee  status, regardless of their blood quantum levels or that of their  heirs.   The House has already passed this measure once, and I am happy to  agree to the changes that the Senate made to Mr. Cole's bill.   Upholding the sanctity of a Tribe's land base should be of utmost  importance to Congress and the Federal Government as a whole. A tribal  land base is not just about tax-exempt status or economic development,  both of which are vitally important to tribal communities. It is also  about construction of housing, schools, clinics, and eldercare  facilities, things that are extremely vital to the health and the well- being of tribal members.   It is also about recognizing a tribe's historical, cultural, and  spiritual connection to the land, land that they called their own until  it was forcibly or wrongly taken from them.   We need to ensure that tribal sovereignty and self-governance are  more than just talking points. There are real-world decisions that we  make that have very real consequences, so it is shameful that a dark  chapter in history is now repeating itself. I am referring to the dire  situation that is facing the Mashpee Tribe of Massachusetts.   The Mashpee have inhabited present-day Massachusetts and eastern  Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years. Their ancestors are the ones  who welcomed the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock, as well as the  people who aided these Pilgrims through the hard times of 1621 that we  now refer to as our First Thanksgiving.   Like many tribes, the Mashpee were intentionally and systematically  rendered landless through various actions by the States and the Federal  Government.                                time  1700    They have fought long and hard since that time to reestablish that  which was taken from them: their homeland. They fought first for  Federal recognition, which they finally received in 2009 after a 30- year struggle. They then fought to establish a homeland for their  people, which they finally did in 2015, when Interior approved their  application to take 320 acres into trust for the Tribe.   Things were looking optimistic for the Mashpee people. They  constructed a government center, which includes a school, courtrooms,  and multipurpose rooms, and they established a medical clinic facility.  They were planning to embark on economic development opportunities that  would help sustain the Tribal people and ensure their prosperity for  future generations. Then the rug was cruelly pulled out from beneath  them.   In 2017, the Department of Justice, under the Trump administration,  inexplicably refused to continue to defend the status of the Tribe's  reservation in court.   Then on September 7, 2018, the Department of the Interior issued its  first Carciary decision, in which it refused to reaffirm its own  authority to confirm the status of the Tribe's reservation. Interior  rejected clear evidence that the Mashpee were indeed under Federal  jurisdiction, evidence that was accepted as sufficient in prior agency  decisions.   This decision is devastating and unprecedented. It would mark the  first time since the dark days of the termination era that the United  States acts to de-establish an Indian reservation and make a Tribe  landless.  [[Page H10304]]    On our side of the aisle, we have been sounding the alarm for some  time that this would come to pass if we did not address the Carciary  issue, and yet the majority has refused to address that issue for  almost a decade.   Many other Tribes also face frivolous lawsuits on land that they have  had in trust for years, sometimes decades. These attacks on sovereignty  eat up valuable Tribal resources and funds, funds that could be instead  used on housing, healthcare, economic development, and a myriad of  other Tribal needs and concerns.   As a result of this, the Trump administration's decision, the Mashpee  and the Tribal government is on the brink of total dissolve. The legal  limbo that has been imposed by the decision is forcing the Tribe to  have to borrow thousands of dollars every day to keep its government  running. This has resulted in devastating cuts to essential services  and massive layoffs.   The majority of Tribal members are employed with the Tribe. Due to  this, the Tribal unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 49 percent. They  have had to essentially dissolve their police force except for one  patrol officer; they have laid off all Tribal court staff; they are in  the process of shutting down their elder services and addiction  treatment programs; and they are having to shut down their language  immersion school serving preschool and school-age children. This is  completely unacceptable and, sadly, avoidable.   If this were occurring with a State or a local government, my  colleagues across the aisle would have already remedied the situation,  and we could do just that. We could address this issue head-on by  simply reaffirming the trust status of Mashpee land. We could overturn  the misguided agency decision and give stability and sovereignty back  to the Mashpee people.   This is exactly what many of us on both sides of the aisle have  strongly advocated for months; however, the silence from Republican  leadership of the House is deafening. Legislation to affirm the Mashpee  homeland has existed for months, even before the Interior decision, yet  the majority has refused to move it.   Inaction is complacency, and the inaction of this body sets a  dangerous precedent moving forward for other Tribes that are having  their sovereignty challenged.   Many of us have worked diligently over the years to right the wrongs  of the past and rightfully return land back to Tribes. Mr. Speaker, I  implore our Republican majority to work with us now to ensure Mashpee  culture and its way of life survives.   Congress must affirm its Federal trust responsibility and ensure  Tribal sovereignty remains intact. We must not idly stand by as Tribal  people are on the losing end of another heinous wrongdoing--not on this  watch.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6652, as stated, authorizes the conveyance of  certain water facilities owned by the Bureau of Reclamation to the  Kennewick Irrigation District in Washington.   Before transferring the water facilities and associated lands, the  legislation wisely requires an assessment be completed under the  National Environmental Policy Act.   The bill also requires the Department of the Interior affirm that the  transfer won't have a negative effect on the environment or harm Tribal  trust resources before the transfer can take place.   Mr. Speaker, these are important safeguards. I applaud Congressman  Newhouse for agreeing to them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1520, known as the Modern Fish Act, expands  opportunities for recreational fishermen by encouraging the use of  multiple fisheries management tools. Importantly, S. 1520 keeps the  core conservation provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act intact by  making it clear that fisheries managers can use multiple tools, but  annual catch limits cannot be exceeded.  [[Page H10309]]    This bill encourages managers to think about how to manage fisheries  in a way that benefits both conservation and fishing access.   I applaud Senator Wicker and Senator Nelson for the hard work they  have undertaken to get this bill across the finish line. This bill is a  major improvement from the version that was introduced in the House  earlier this year, and I commend my colleagues in the Senate for  getting it to a place where all of us can support it.    This year, we have seen progress on recreational fisheries issues,  driven by advancements in technologies and data collection systems.  While the recreational fishing industry is vital to the economy of the  United States, the last thing we want is another tragedy of the commons  or policies that undercut that progress.   The changes made to S. 1520 meet the demands of the recreational  fishing industry while also ensuring access to sustainable fisheries.   I am thankful for the good faith effort shown on both sides of the  aisle and for a bipartisan bill that does not compromise the  sustainability of our Nation's fisheries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, S. 3530 renews the Museum and Library Services  Act to enhance the ability of libraries and museums to address  community needs, including workforce development, literacy, and  accessibility for individuals with disabilities.   The bill is supported by the American Library Association and the  American Alliance of Museums. This legislation strengthens the use of  data-driven tools to maximize the effectiveness of services; provides  technical support and assistance to help the libraries and museums with  data collection responsibilities; authorizes the 21st Century Museum  Professionals Program to recruit museum professionals from diverse and  underrepresented backgrounds; enhances collaborative efforts with  Federal agencies to fully meet the needs of Americans; and increases  services for Native Americans.  [[Page H10313]]    It is vital to ensure that our libraries and museums have the  necessary resources to modernize their services and continue to  solidify their role as technological hubs of our communities and as  access points in our communities throughout this country.   Libraries and museums ensure access to information for millions of  adults and children across this country, and I am thrilled that we have  the opportunity to promote their growth, expand their services, and  safeguard these critical institutions for generations to come.   I am proud to have introduced this legislation with Congressman Hurd  from Texas who introduced the companion legislation in the House and  fully support the passage of S. 3530, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
