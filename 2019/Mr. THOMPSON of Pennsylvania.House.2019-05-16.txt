 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize May as Community Action Month.   This year marks the 55th year since the Community Action Network was  established to help American families and communities overcome  obstacles to poverty. There are more than 1,000 Community Action  Agencies across the country that reach children and families in 99  percent of America's counties to help provide life-changing services  that create pathways out of poverty.   Every year, these agencies help tens of thousands of children and  youth with before- and after-school programs; more than 165,000  unemployed people get a job; almost 220,000 families find safe and  affordable housing; and about 6.5 million people, including seniors,  make their homes more energy efficient and lower their utility bills.   Earlier this spring, I was proud to introduce H.R. 1695, the  Community Services Block Grant Reauthorization Act of 2019, with  Congresswoman Betty McCollum.   This bill renews our Nation's commitment to reducing poverty through  locally driven, comprehensive approaches.   Madam Speaker, the Community Services Block Grant traces its roots  back more than 50 years ago to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.  This act established local Community Action Agencies to help identify  why people were in poverty and how to address it using public and  private resources, a great public-private partnership.   These agencies act as a safety net for low-income individuals and  families. Even more importantly, they help create opportunities for  people to move from poverty to independence. That is the true measure  of success as we look at these Community Action Agencies.   The Community Services Block Grant is the only Federal program with  the explicit goal of reducing poverty, regardless of the cause.  Unfortunately, this program has not been reauthorized in more than 20  years.   Our bill makes important updates that will strengthen the Community  Services Block Grant and the network it supports, including:   A new federally administered Community Action Opioid Response Grant  that will enable Community Action Agencies to fill service gaps and  respond to unmet needs of low-income individuals, families, and  communities affected by the opioid or substance abuse crisis;   A provision requiring Federal approval of State applications and  plans, with provisions to allow direct Federal funding of local  agencies if a State plan fails to meet Federal requirements; and   A renewed commitment to streamlining the program's stated purpose to  reduce poverty through support for Community Action Agencies that  improve economic security for low-income individuals and families and  create new opportunities in the communities where they live.   This bill will help more than 15 million low-income Americans and  provide resources necessary to help lift individuals and families out  of poverty.   Madam Speaker, it is time to reauthorize the Community Services Block  Grant, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, especially  during Community Action Month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, May is Mental Health  Month, a time when we are encouraged to break down the stigmas that  surround mental health.   Normalizing conversations about depression, anxiety, and other  conditions will help those affected by mental illness seek the quality  care that they need and deserve.   One group that is overwhelmingly impacted by mental health disorders  is veterans.   Unfortunately, we know that about 22 veterans commit suicide each and  every day.   Congress understands how dire the situation has become and is working  diligently to find a solution. Fortunately, we have made progress over  the past few years.   Last year's passage of the VA Mission Act significantly increased the  care available to our veterans, ensuring they have access to a medical  professional before resorting to suicide.   This is a step in the right direction, but more can certainly be  done.   These men and women answer the call of duty, and as a Nation, we must  care for them when they return home.   Until veteran suicide rates dwindle to zero, I will continue to work  with my colleagues to support veterans' mental health programs.                            ____________________
