 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the postcloture time with  respect to the Robinson nomination expire at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow and  that following the disposition of the Robinson nomination, the Senate  vote on the motions to invoke cloture on the Dugan and McGlynn  nominations in that order; further, that if cloture is invoked on the  Dugan and McGlynn nominations, the postcloture time expire at 3:30 p.m.  tomorrow and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations in that  order; finally, that if any of the nominations are confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, this morning in the Education  Committee, we had a really interesting discussion on intercollegiate  athletics--specifically on the proposals that are appearing in various  States to pay student athletes for their name, image, and likeness.   This is the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, and Senator  Wicker and his committee are considering whether there should be any  congressional action, but we were looking at the impact of the proposal  to pay student athletes on the tradition of the intercollegiate student  athlete in our country, and here is my own view.   If student athletes are paid by commercial interests for their name,  image, and likeness, that money ought to go to benefit all of the  student athletes at that institution. In other words, if the  quarterback at the University of Tennessee is paid $500,000 by the  local auto dealer to advertise the auto dealer, that money ought not go  to him; it ought to go for the benefit of all the student athletes at  the University of Tennessee, including the women's sports, the men's  sports, the minor sports, the major sports.   Student athletes shouldn't be on the payroll and be treated as hired  hands, in my opinion. I don't see a good ending to allowing a few  student athletes to be paid by commercial interests while most of their  teammates are not.   If young athletes want to be part of a team, enjoy the undergraduate  experience, learn from coaches who are among the best teachers in the  country, and be paid a full scholarship that helps them earn a degree  worth $1 million during their lifetime--that is according to the  college boards estimates--those earnings of that student should benefit  all student athletes at the institution. If a student athlete prefers  to keep the money, then that student athlete should become a  professional athlete.   We had a bipartisan discussion this morning. I want to thank Senator  Murray, the Senator from Washington State, who is the ranking Democrat  on our committee. Our committee always has diverse views, but we always  have good, civil discussions.  [[Page S5598]]    We had excellent witnesses from the University of Wisconsin and from  Utah State University. We had a representative of the players  association as well, and we had a track and field coach from Ohio State  University who has been Coach of the Year in the Big 10 for 4 years,  and they all had a point of view on this question.   The question is whether the tradition of an intercollegiate student  athlete is worth preserving, and if so, how do you do it? Specifically,  what would the impact be on that tradition if States pass laws allowing  commercial interests to pay student athletes for the use of their name,  image, or likeness?   Now, I have had two experiences that help me form my own opinion on  this. Here is the first one.   In 1960, during my sophomore year in college, I was exercising at  Vanderbilt University on the university's cinder track, and a man  watching me had in his right hand a big stopwatch. He introduced  himself as Track Coach Herc Alley, and he asked my name.   ``Did you run track in high school?'' he asked me.   ``No,'' I said, ``we didn't have track in high school.''   ``Why don't you run 100 yards for me,'' he said.   So I did.   He examined his stopwatch and said: ``10.1 seconds. That is very  good. I have three really fast boys on my 440-yard relay team. Why  don't you come be the fourth one?''   So I joined the Vanderbilt track team running the mile relay, the  440-yard relay, and the 440-yard dash. My job was to carry the baton  from the first fast boy to the third fast boy.   The next year, our team set a school record in the 440-yard relay.  That record will never be broken for one reason--because they now  measure the race in meters. So they don't run the 440-yard relay  anymore.   We sometimes practiced with some really speedy athletes. They were  students from what we called then Tennessee A&I across town. This is  before desegregation. These were Olympians. They included Ralph Boston,  Wilma Rudolph, and Wyomia Tyus. Coach Alley, our coach, had no  scholarships to offer. His teams rode buses to meets. Our cinder track  made it hard to establish fast times. Scraping together teams of  nonscholarship athletes, he produced several Southeastern Conference  track champions.   Coach Alley's enthusiasm that day gave me an experience that millions  of young Americans have had--that of being an intercollegiate student  athlete. Some of those athletes were good enough to win scholarships.  Senator Richard Burr is one. He is on our committee and was at the  hearing this morning. He had a football scholarship at Wake Forest  University.   My experience at Vanderbilt taught me a number of lessons, including  this one: When running on a relay team, be sure to choose two teammates  who can run faster than you can. That is not a bad recipe for being an  effective U.S. Senator either.   Now, as the college football season gets underway, even amidst COVID- 19, we are reminded of how important these games are to student  athletes, to their institutions, and to millions of spectators. The  fascination with sporting competition is nothing new, according to the  Knight Commission, which said in its 1991 report the following:         The appeal of competitive games is boundless. In ancient       times, men at war laid down their weapons to compete in the       Olympic games. Today, people around the globe put aside their       daily cares to follow the fortunes of their teams in the       World Cup. In the United States, the Super Bowl, the World       Series, college football and the NCAA basketball tournament       command the attention of millions. Sports have helped break       down bigotry and prejudice in American life. On the       international scene, they have helped integrate East and       West, socialist and capitalist. The passion for sport is       universally shared across time and continents.    So said the Knight Commission 30 years ago.   But concerns with problems in sports are also nothing new. The Knight  Commission was established in 1989 to address scandals in college  sports that were ``shaking public confidence,'' not just of big-time  collegiate athletics but the whole institution of higher education.   Well before that, in 1929, the Carnegie Foundation put out a report  that said recruiting had become corrupt, professionals had replaced  amateurs, education was being neglected, and commercialism reigned.  Before that, in 1906, partially in response to President Teddy  Roosevelt's criticism, the NCAA had been formed to protect the safety  of players and deal with corruption.   My second experience forming my opinion on today's hearing was my  participation and membership in that Knight Commission at the time I  was president of the University of Tennessee. Our commission  recommendation was that university presidents take charge of college  athletics and the huge amount of television money it attracted and  restore the academic and financial integrity of the program. As a  result, over the next several years, academic standards became more  stringent, financial support for student athletes increased, and  college presidents asserted more responsibility for financial  integrity.   What is especially relevant to today's hearing was that despite  today's problems surrounding intercollegiate athletics and the problems  then, the Knight Commission strongly endorsed keeping the student  athlete tradition. What it said is worth repeating also:         We reject the argument [the Knight Commission said] that       the only realistic solution to the problem is to drop the       student athlete concept, put athletes on the payroll, and       reduce or even eliminate their responsibilities as students.        Such a scheme has nothing to do with education, [said the       Knight Commission] the purpose for which colleges and       universities exist. Scholarship athletes are already paid in       the most meaningful way possible: with a free education. The       idea of intercollegiate athletics is that teams represent       their institutions as true members of the student body, not       as hired hands. Surely American higher education has the       ability to devise a better solution to the problems of       intercollegiate athletics than making professionals out of       the players, which is no solution at all but rather an       unacceptable surrender to despair.    Well, I hope those words from the Knight Commission 30 years ago will  guide how Congress deals with the newest issue threatening the concept  of student athletes, and that is allowing commercial interests to pay  athletes for use of their name, likeness, and image.   Already four States have enacted laws sanctioning such payments in  various forms. More than 30 other States are considering legislation.   Senator Wicker, as I mentioned, chairman of the Commerce Committee,  is considering whether there ought to be congressional action. Our  purpose was to look at the impact on the student athlete.   Who are the student athletes today? Well, it wouldn't make much sense  to talk about this if we didn't say who and what we are talking about,  so here it is. There are 20 million undergraduates in about 6,000  colleges and universities that exist in the United States today. Nearly  1,100 of those 6,000 colleges and universities belong to the NCAA. More  than 460,000 young men and women participate in 24 different sports  each year in about one-quarter of 1 million contests. About 300 of  those institutions play football and basketball at the highest level.  Fewer than 2 percent of athletes, student athletes, go on to play  professional sports, according to the NCAA. This means we are talking  about approximately 9,000 college student athletes who compete in a few  sports out of the more than 460,000 college athletes across 24 sports.   So the current controversy is about an even smaller percentage of  those 9,000 students who play football, baseball, or men or women's  basketball and whose skills--or the institutions for which they play-- make them attractive targets for recruiting offers that will combine  their scholarship dollars with endorsement money. For example, an  exceptional quarterback, pitcher, or running back might be offered a  $500,000-a-year endorsement by a car dealer in the same town as a  college with a big-time football, basketball, or even baseball program.   As the Knight Commission report said, student athletes are already  paid in the most meaningful way, with a free education. Athletic  scholarships are limited to tuition and fees, room and board, and  required course-related books, but this can add up to a lot of money.  It is $115,000 a year, estimates the University of Tennessee, per  student athlete, including room, board, student stipends, academic  support, meals, sports medicine, training, travel, and expenses.  [[Page S5599]]    Student athletes may also combine other sources of financial aid,  including Federal or State need-based aid, to help pay for the full  cost of attendance. These include Pell grants, for example, which could  be $6,300 a year, supplemental education community grants, work-study,  State grants based on need using Federal calculations, such as the  Tennessee HOPE Scholarship or the GI bill. About 92,000--or 20  percent--of the student athletes receive Pell grants also.   According to the College Board, the value of a 4-year undergraduate  degree is $1 million over a lifetime, and according to the NCAA, 88  percent of Division I student athletes will earn a 4-year degree   So the question at hand is, Should Congress act, or should varying  State laws govern payments for name, image, and likeness to student  athletes? Is a patchwork set of regulations worth the confusion it will  cause with unrestrained boosters, creative agents, the impact on title  IX on men's and women's programs, on a coach's effort, and most of all  on the tradition of the student athlete? That is the Commerce  Committee's job. We heard some interesting testimony this morning.   Based on my experience as a student athlete, as a member of the  Knight Commission, and as a university president, I offered these  suggestions:   The Knight Commission is correct to say that student athletes  shouldn't be on the payroll. They shouldn't be treated as hired hands.   Two, Congress should act but in a limited way--as limited as  possible--to authorize an independent entity, safe from litigation, to  write rules governing payments for the use of name, image, and  likeness. Congress should provide aggressive oversight of that entity  rather than try to write the rules ourselves.   Three, that governing entity ought to be the NCAA. I know, I know-- the NCAA is controversial, but if it is not doing its job, the  presidents who are supposed to be in charge of it should reform it.  Giving the job to a new entity would take forever. Giving it to an  existing entity like the Federal Trade Commission, without expertise  and without any responsibility for higher education, would make no  sense.   Now, as to the rules that I would hope the NCAA would write, here is  what I believe should be the overriding principle: Money paid to  student athletes for their name, image, and likeness should benefit all  student athletes in that institution. Following this principle would  allow the earnings to be used for additional academic support, further  study or degrees, more insurance options, and more support for injured  players and other needs. It would avoid the awkwardness of a center who  earns nothing snapping the ball to a quarterback who earns $500,000  from the local auto dealer. It avoids the inevitable abuses that would  occur with agents and boosters becoming involved with outstanding high  school athletes. It would avoid the unexpected consequences to other  teams in an institution because of the impact on title IX or the impact  on existing student aid available to athletes.   Such a principle would preserve the right of any athlete to earn  money for the use of his or her image, name, or likeness. It simply  says: If you elect to be a student athlete, your earnings should  benefit all student athletes at your institution. If you want to keep  the money and be someone's employee, go become a professional.   This system would create the same kinds of choices that today's NCAA  rules for college baseball require. A high school student must stay 3  years if he chooses to participate in a college baseball program. Take  Vanderbilt's baseball program. David Price, Sonny Gray, and Dansby  Swanson--Major League fans know they are all very successful  professional athletes--all were drafted by Major League baseball teams  while they were in high school. They could have earned a lot of money  going directly into professional baseball. Instead, they chose a  Vanderbilt education, 3 years of college experience, and the  opportunity to be taught by Coach Tim Corbin, a great teacher. If  Price, Gray, and Swanson had been permitted to sell their name, image,  and likeness while at Vanderbilt, under the principle I am suggesting,  their earnings would have been used for the benefit of all of  Vanderbilt's sports teams, men and women.   Applying such a principle to all intercollegiate athletics might  cause a few talented athletes to join professional leagues immediately  after high school. That is their right. But if that young athlete  prefers the college experience, the expert coaching and teaching, the  free education, the other academic support, and the undergraduate  degree that can earn $1 million over a lifetime, then their earnings  ought to benefit all the student athletes at the institution.   While the NCAA is making new rules, I suggest it ought to assign most  of the new television revenue that comes to institutions--let it go to  institutions and be used for academic support for student athletes  rather than continue to encourage inordinately high salaries for some  coaches.   As I said at the beginning, I don't see a good ending to allowing a  few student athletes to be paid by commercial interests while most of  their teammates are not. If they want to be part of the team, enjoy the  undergraduate experience, learn from coaches who are great teachers,  and be paid a full scholarship that could help them earn $1 million  during their lifetimes, their earnings should benefit all the student  athletes. If they prefer to keep the money for themselves, let them  become professionals.   I yield the floor.
