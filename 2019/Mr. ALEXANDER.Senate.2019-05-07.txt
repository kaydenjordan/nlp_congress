 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         Electronic Health Records          In 1991, the National Academies urged the       adoption of electronic health records to improve patients'       care. However, for many patients and for many doctors,       electronic health records have made care more complicated.        No one knows this better than Dr. Kelly Aldrich, who is the       Chief Clinical Transformation Officer at the Center for       Medical Interoperability in Nashville and whose husband,       Eric, experienced a life-threatening emergency that could       have been prevented if his electronic health records had been       interoperable.        Eric woke up one morning with a splitting headache and went       to see his primary care doctor, who sent Eric to the hospital       for a CT scan, the results of which prompted an MRI. Usually,       the hospital's electronic medical records system sends the       results of the MRI directly to Eric's primary care doctor.        But in this case the results were never sent, so 12 hours       after the test, Eric's doctor called the hospital and learned       that Eric had a tumor so large it was causing his brain to       swell and shift, putting him at risk of seizures, permanent       brain damage, and possibly death.        Eric, however, assuming no news was good news, was already       500 miles away, on his way to a fishing trip in Louisiana.       Eric went to Tulane Medical Center, which had to do another       MRI because they could not obtain Eric's original test       results because the two hospitals used different electronic       medical records systems. Eric flew back to Nashville, where       he had to have yet another MRI before entering surgery. Eric       later spent several weeks recovering in the ICU.        At multiple points during this traumatic experience, a lack       of interoperability between electronic health records caused       a life threatening delay of care, redundant tests, higher       costs, and additional pain.        This is the second hearing on the proposed rules       implementing the electronic health information provisions in       the 21st Century Cures Act. Improving electronic health       records is important to this committee.        In 2015, while working on Cures, we realized that our       electronic health records system was in a ditch.        This committee held six bipartisan hearings on how to       improve interoperability, and formed a working group that       recommended provisions in Cures to ban information blocking--      which is when some obstacle is in the way of a patient's       information being sent from one doctor to another.        And this year, this committee is working on legislation to       lower the cost of health care.        50 percent of what we spend on health care is unnecessary,       according to Dr. Brent James of the National Academics.       Electronic health records that are interoperable can prevent       duplicative tests --like Eric's repeated MRIs--and reduce       what doctors and hospitals spend on administrative tasks.        In March, the Office of the National Coordinator and the       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued two rules       to implement the electronic health records provisions in       Cures:        First the rules define information blocking--so it is more       precisely clear what we mean when one system, hospital,       doctor, vendor, or insurer is purposefully not sharing       information with another;        Second, the rules require that by January 1, 2020, for the       first time, insurers must share a patient's health care data       with the patient so their health information follows them as       they see different doctors; and        Third, all electronic health records must adopt publicly       available standards for data elements, known as Application       Programming Interfaces, or APIs, two years after these rules       are completed.        Last month, we heard from those who use electronic health       records, and here is what they have to say about the rules.       First, I asked our witnesses if these were good rules--and       all four said yes, the intent and the goal of the rules were       correct.        Mary Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council       said: ``Interoperability is not simply desirable, it is       absolutely necessary . . . These rules represent an important       and perhaps groundbreaking first step for true national       interoperability.''        I also asked our witnesses what one change they would make       to improve these rules. Mary cautioned about not rushing       implementation, saying, ``We don't want to prevent moving       ahead, or progress, but I think we also have to be very       cognizant of the challenges that providers and others are       facing trying to do this complex work.''        In 2015, I urged the Obama Administration to slow down       Stage 3 of the Meaningful Use program, which incentivized       doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records. The       Obama Administration did not slow down implementation, and       looking back, the results would have been better if they had.        The best way to get to where you want to go is not by going       too far, too fast.        I want to make sure we learn lessons from implementing       Meaningful Use Stage 3, which was, in the words of one major       hospital, ``terrifying.''        I am especially interested in getting where we want to go       with the involvement of doctors, hospitals, vendors, and       insurers, with the fewest possible mistakes and the least       confusion.        We don't need to set a record time to get there with an       unrealistic timeline. Because these are complex rules, I       asked CMS and ONC to extend the comment period, and I am glad       to see they have done so and want to thank our witnesses for       allowing more time for comment.        We also heard concerns about ensuring patient privacy. lf       the 21st Century Cures Act is successfully implemented,       patients should be able to get their own health data more       easily and send it to their health care providers.        Patients may also choose to send that data to third       parties--like an exercise tracking app on their smart phone--      but this raises new questions about privacy. Lucia Savage,       Chief Privacy and Regulatory Officer at Omada Health said,       ``I think the committee . . . is rightfully concerned about       privacy and security . . . None of this will matter if the       consumers don't have confidence, and their doctors don't have       confidence that the consumers have confidence.''        Dr. Christopher Rehm, Chief Medical Informatics Officer at       Lifepoint Health in Brentwood, Tennessee reminded us at the       hearing that these rules are ``not about the technology, it's       about the patient, their care and their outcomes.''        I am looking forward to hearing from the Administration       today about how they plan to implement these rules.                            ____________________     Madam President, Dr. James Billington was the 13th  person to hold the position of Librarian of Congress since the Library  was established in 1800. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan  and served under Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W.  Bush, and Barack Obama.   As Librarian of Congress Dr. Billington managed the Library of  Congress, which according to LOC, is the largest library in the world,  containing millions of books, recordings, photographs, newspapers,  maps, and manuscripts in its collections. It is the main research arm  of the U.S. Congress.   Dr. Billington doubled the size of the Library's collections during  his tenure from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million  items. He created the Library of Congress online, which helped bring  the Library into the digital age.   In 2003, Dr. Billington testified before the Senate education  committee at a hearing I chaired called ``Putting the Teaching of  American History and Civics Back in the Classroom.''   In his testimony that day, Dr. Billington said: ``During Alex Haley's  12 years researching his groundbreaking novel, Roots, he traveled the  globe to uncover his family's story, even taking a slow Atlantic  crossing to get some feel for what his ancestors went through on the  Middle Passage. He also spent many hours in the reading rooms of the  Library of Congress, poring over American Missionary Society files from  our Manuscript Collection.   ``For the first 190 years of the Library's existence, people could  access our vast collections only by traveling to Washington, D.C., and  by working in our beautiful reading rooms as Mr. Haley did, or by  tapping into our rich holdings secondhand, through books that made use  of our collections . . .   ``The technology revolution of the past decade has made it possible  for the Library to reach far beyond its buildings in Washington. We now  deliver 8 million interesting and educational multimedia documents,  maps, and images of American history and culture free of charge to  stimulate curiosity and humanize the study of history.   ``By exploiting the power of the internet and the incomparable  resources of our collections, the Library of Congress has emerged as  the leading provider of free noncommercial educational content on the  Web. Millions of educators, librarians, students, and lifelong learners  visit our Web sites daily for materials that once were available only  through our reading rooms on Capitol Hill.''   Dr. Billington's nearly three decades of distinguished service and  his efforts to bring the Library of Congress into the digital age will  help ensure that the Library will better preserve our Nation's history  and enlighten its people for many generations to come. His legacy will  be one of innovation and diligence.   After his passing in 2018, his successor at the Library of Congress,  Carla Hayden, said ``Dr. Billington has left an indelible legacy on the  institution he led passionately for 28 years. With his vigor for  philanthropy and tireless efforts to expand the reach and impact of the  Library, he achieved so much to advance the Library of Congress as an  enduring place for scholars and learners. He will be remembered as a  visionary leader, distinguished academic and, most of all, a great  American.''   At a recent Senate committee hearing, I spoke with Ms. Hayden about  Alex Haley and the importance of what he did: writing two bestselling  books on the African-American experience, the autobiography of Malcolm  X and his book, Roots, which tell the story of the African-American  experience in America. As Dr. Billington said, Alex did a lot of his  research at the Library of Congress, and he found the name and the date  of the slave ship that actually brought that ancestor to Annapolis in  the Library. I think Alex's example will help people understand how the  Library of Congress can be so useful to people who are trying to tell  the story of our country.   Ms. Hayden agreed saying, ``many notable films and books have started  with research at the Library of Congress. We want to emphasize the fact  that Alex Haley did research here, and also have his quotes about what  it felt like for him to be in that reading room.''   Alex Haley used to say, we should ``find the good and praise it.''  Dr. Billington's life's work will help countless Americans ``find the  good and praise it,'' when it comes to the history of our country.                            ____________________
