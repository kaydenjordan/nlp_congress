 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1464, I call  up the bill (S. 4524) to limit the judicial enforceability of  predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement contract clauses relating  to disputes involving sexual assault and sexual harassment, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on S. 4524.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 4524, the Speak Out Act, empowers survivors of  sexual misconduct by prohibiting the use of nondisclosure and  nondisparagement clauses that serve to silence survivors who entered  into agreements containing those clauses before a dispute arises.   Often buried in the fine print of contracts of adhesion that workers  and consumers sign every day to secure employment, goods, or services,  these confidentiality clauses have contributed to the culture of  silence in cases involving sexual misconduct. As such, they have  routinely enabled sexual predators to evade accountability.   The confidential nature of these clauses makes it extremely difficult  to fully diagnose the scope of this problem. Nevertheless, experts  estimate that more than one-third of workers in the United States are  required to sign a nondisclosure agreement in their employment  contracts.   This is particularly concerning because of the rampant nature of  sexual abuse in the workplace. An estimated 81 percent of women and 43  percent of men will experience sexual harassment in their lifetimes,  and more than half of all women report being subjected to unwanted  sexual activity while in the workplace.   But these appalling numbers do not even tell the full story. The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that the vast majority of  survivors simply never report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual  assault.   Today, we will take an important step toward fixing this problem by  banning the enforcement of nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses  agreed to before a sexual harassment or sexual assault dispute arises.  For the purpose of this bill, a dispute arises when a person chooses to  exercise their legal rights by asserting a claim of sexual harassment  or sexual assault in some official context, such as by complaining to a  government agency or by filing a lawsuit.   This legislation continues Congress' important work to protect the  rights of survivors to come forward and hold perpetrators accountable  for abuse.   Earlier this year, on a bipartisan basis, we enacted H.R. 4445, which  empowered survivors to decide whether they resolve their disputes in  court or through arbitration. That bill was an example of how Congress  can and should function. We worked together, across the aisle, to  identify a problem, establish a bipartisan solution to that problem,  and pass legislation to restore the rights of millions of Americans to  their day in court.   The Speak Out Act is an opportunity for us to work together once  again to end the oppressive culture of silence hiding sexual  misconduct, promote transparency and accountability, and make the  workplace safer for everyone.  [[Page H8519]]    This legislation has already passed the Senate unanimously, and it is  supported by a broad coalition of public interest organizations,  including the American Association for Justice, the National Alliance  to End Sexual Violence, RALIANCE, The Army of Survivors, the National  Domestic Violence Hotline, and the National Coalition Against Sexual  Assault.   I thank our colleagues, Representatives Frankel, Buck, Cicilline,  Jayapal, Griffith, Bustos, and Owens for their leadership on this  issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I only wish this bill did what the gentleman from Ohio says it does.  By his logic, we should never have passed the Americans with  Disabilities Act. We should have left it with the States. That  obviously didn't work.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel), the sponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, this bill goes so far; the gentleman from  North Carolina tells us, this bill goes too far. It goes so far, in  fact, that every Republican Member of the Senate voted for it. What a  bunch of radicals.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a member of the committee.     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa), a member of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, some have argued that the bill is not necessary  because the courts may already choose not to enforce NDAs in certain  cases. But this argument overlooks the reality that this scattershot  approach to forced NDAs in sexual assault cases leaves survivors  uncertain of their ability to tell their own stories without fear of  reprisal, and it continues to allow NDAs to be used as an intimidation  tactic by powerful corporations and abusers or as a coercive  requirement for employment or everyday services.   Without a clear message from Congress that forced NDAs will no longer  be enforceable in court, forced NDAs in employment and consumer  contracts are likely to continue to have a chilling effect on survivors  speaking out.   These contracts of silence limit the ability of millions of Americans  to come forward in the first place. They contain sweeping prohibitions  against any future negative statements about an employer. Standard  language in these terms limit a survivor's ability to communicate by  virtually any means, regardless of the truthfulness of the  communication, in perpetuity.   In many cases, confidentiality clauses cover the existence of an NDA  itself, meaning that even discussing the fact that one is bound by an  NDA could constitute a violation of a contract.   There are cases in which survivors choose to waive their right to  speak about their case. But that is a decision for survivors to make  for themselves based on the circumstances, not something that should be  forced upon them by their abusers or their enablers.   Last year, in a hearing that none of us will forget, the Judiciary  Committee heard from four survivors of shocking workplace sexual  harassment and assault. As they explained, after enduring horrific  abuse at the hands of their perpetrators, confidential clauses in  routine contracts prevented them from reporting and publicly disclosing  their abuse.   The Speak Out Act ends this outrageous practice once and for all.  Importantly, it does not prevent survivors from voluntarily entering  into settlement agreements that include NDAs. Instead, it simply  clarifies that these clauses cannot be enforced unless a survivor  chooses to agree to the clause after the dispute arises.   The Biden-Harris administration has issued a statement strongly  supporting this legislation, noting that: ``Prohibiting the use of  predispute NDAs and nondisparagement clauses will increase access to  justice and make the workplace safer for everyone.''   The United States Senate has unanimously passed this legislation.   I have heard the argument from some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle that we should leave this to the States and that the  national legislation impinges on States' rights somehow. This is from  the same people who urge a national ban on abortion.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to send this critical message to  the President's desk, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 4130, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Ted Deutch of Florida, for the  purpose of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.
