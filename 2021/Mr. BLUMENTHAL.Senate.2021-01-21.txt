 Madam President, today I rise to recognize  Ms. Helen Eugenia Hagan, a remarkable pianist and pioneer for BIPOC  women in music.   Her passion for performing began at a young age, and Ms. Hagan became  the organist for the Dixwell Avenue Congregational Church when she was  around 11 years old. Ms. Hagan's talents earned her a spot at the Yale  School of Music. In 1912, she was the first African-American woman to  graduate from Yale University.   At the request of General John J. Pershing, Ms. Hagan traveled to  France during World War I as part of a group led by preacher Henry H.  Proctor. Ms. Hagan was the only Black performing artist sent to France  during the war. Continuing to break barriers, she was also the first  Black pianist to perform a recital at a New York concert venue. Ms.  Hagan's compositions and concert work received outstanding praise. The  then-Dean of the Yale School of Music credited Ms. Hagan with ``rare  promise,'' and critics commended her creativity and originality.   Struggling to find work during the Great Depression, she took  graduate-level courses at Columbia University's Teachers College while  still giving performances. In 1933, Ms. Hagan took a teaching position  at Bishop College in Texas and gave private music lessons in New York.  She remained committed to musical composition, performance, and  education until her passing in 1964.   On February 6, 2021, the New Haven Symphony Orchestra will honor Ms.  Hagan with a History Award. Alongside Yale University, the symphony has  been dedicated to sharing the life story of this incredible woman, who  performed her ``Piano Concerto in C minor'' with them in 1916. This  award is a tribute to Ms. Hagan's extraordinary legacy, which will be  enduring.   I applaud her many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in remembering Ms. Helen Eugenia Hagan.                            ____________________
