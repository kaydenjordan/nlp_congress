 Mr. President, China is a 360-degree threat. They are  competing with us in every area--economics, technology, military,  diplomacy, information warfare. You know, we operated for the better  part of a decade under the idea that we should have parity in defense  and nondefense increases. I mean, this is a bipartisan thing. This is  Democrats and Republicans alike. We did this every year for--every 2  years as we did the Budget Control Act, and that was an agreement until  all of a sudden, somehow, we are changing from that.   So what Senator Shelby's and my amendment does is very simple. It  says that for every dollar that we increase nondefense spending, we  have the same amount of money that is going to increase defense  spending. I talked about this yesterday at some length.   How can you justify changing that policy when the greatest threat  that we are facing right now is China? You know, they are competing in  every area, and to leave that out conspicuously is not reasonable at  all. So I think that the--I remember that the majority leader and the  Speaker of the House back in 2019 said: ``Democrats have always  insisted on parity in increases between defense and non-defense.''   So why would they change now? And I don't think that they will change  now. So, again, I am unsure people understand what this is all about.  This is a very simple thing. It says that--our amendment says that for  every dollar we increase nondefense spending, we also increase defense  spending by the same amount. It is called parity. We have lived with  this right now for 8 years. We have been in agreement, and somehow this  has changed, as if the threat that we are facing right now with  economics, technology, diplomacy, information warfare are more  important than military. Military is the No. 1 threat.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
