 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H8404]]  bill (H.R. 777) to reauthorize programs authorized under the Debbie  Smith Act of 2004.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 777         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 777, the Debbie Smith  Reauthorization Act of 2019.   The Debbie Smith Act, named for a courageous woman who has fought for  the rights of survivors of sexual assault, is critical to helping  States process DNA evidence and reduce the Nation's large backlog of  untested DNA samples.   The law, which I helped author and enact in its original form in  2004, was developed in response to a crisis of untested DNA samples, a  problem that we have helped to reduce but which, unfortunately, still  requires our urgent attention today.   Over the past several decades, evidence from DNA samples has helped  us solve an increasing number of criminal cases and has been  particularly valuable in identifying the perpetrators of the horrible  and all-too-common crime of sexual assault.   The use of DNA evidence kits in sexual assault cases is critical, and  it is imperative that the evidence that is collected is analyzed as  soon as possible. When the evidence is collected and processed, the DNA  profile is added to the Combined DNA Index System so that matches  against other DNA profiles can be sought, increasing the scope of the  database.   By testing the DNA evidence left at the scene of a rape or sexual  assault, we can increase the likelihood of identifying the  perpetrators, making it more likely that they will be captured,  punished, and prevented from doing it again. This, in turn, allows  victims to obtain some measure of justice and society to take violent  criminals off the streets. DNA evidence also allows us, definitively,  to exonerate the falsely accused.   Over time, however, crime labs across the country, regrettably,  developed a large backlog of DNA samples that they had not tested, an  intolerable situation calling out for Federal action.   In response, in 2000, I cosponsored the passage of the DNA Analysis  Backlog Elimination Act, which provided $40 million to help States  analyze DNA evidence; and in 2002, I introduced the Rape Kit DNA  Analysis Backlog Elimination Act. This legislation authorized funding  to help police departments finance the testing of rape kits to reduce  the backlog. Working with my colleagues and with advocates, we  maintained the pressure to address this problem.   Then, in 2004, I was the original cosponsor of the Justice for All  Act, introduced by our colleague Jim Sensenbrenner. That bill included  many of the provisions of my 2002 bill.   Title II of that bill, named the Debbie Smith Act by Congresswoman  Maloney, authorized substantial funding for DNA testing and  strengthened the ability of State and local law enforcement  specifically to test rape kits. We subsequently reauthorized the Debbie  Smith Act in 2008 and again in 2014.   In recent years, the grants we have reauthorized under the Debbie  Smith Act have supported the work of crime labs to build capacity and  process DNA evidence, including evidence collected in rape kits, with  greater percentages of funding allocated to testing these kits provided  in subsequent amendments.                                time  1315    The act also supports audits of evidence awaiting analysis at law  enforcement agencies and charges the Department of Justice with the  task of maintaining national testing guidelines.   Despite these efforts, the rape kit backlog continues to be a major  concern, with a large volume of kits still untested in this country,  harming the survivors of sexual assault and jeopardizing public safety.  Therefore, we must continue the valuable programs authorized by this  important law.   That is why we included the reauthorization of this program in the  Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA reauthorization bill, developed by  the Judiciary Committee and passed by the House earlier this year.  Unfortunately, VAWA is languishing in the Senate.   While we take steps to separately pass the reauthorization of the  Debbie Smith program today, I again call on the Senate to fulfill their  responsibility to pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization  without needless additional delay. Therefore, I support H.R. 777.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that the  reauthorization of this bill has been sitting in the VAWA  reauthorization bill passed by this House many months ago, it has been  sitting in the Senate since then.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am a little puzzled by what I am hearing on the  floor today and, frankly, what I heard in committee this morning on a  different bill.   The gist of that is, well, we passed a bill, but we know it is not  exactly the way the Senate wants it; therefore, we shouldn't pass it.  We should only pass a bill exactly the way the Senate wants it;  otherwise, it is only for show.   On this bill, look what happened. This reauthorization was included  in the VAWA reauthorization, which we passed and sent to the Senate.   Ah, but that was political, we are told, because the Senate doesn't  agree in every respect with the VAWA reauthorization we passed, so they  won't touch it.   Well, I don't understand that. I always thought, from the time I was  in third grade, that they should pass their own version of the VAWA  bill. If it is different from ours, we go to conference.   But, no. No, we can't rely on them to do that. They have to have a  bill that they agree with totally, or they won't look at the subject no  matter how important.   Ah, but they introduced their own. They took it out of VAWA, and they  did their own Debbie Smith bill.   Fine. We are doing a Debbie Smith bill because we don't agree exactly  with what they did. They put in some new accountability provisions. We  have always had accountability provisions in the bill, still there. It  has always been the law. They are adding some new ones which we judge  to be unduly burdensome on small providers. It is a judgment.   We should pass this bill. They have passed a different version of the  bill. We can go to conference, iron it out. That is the way the process  is supposed to work.   My Republican colleagues seem to think that we should never talk to  the Senate; we should only pass a bill exactly the way they passed it.  Or if they haven't passed it exactly the way we know they will want it  and if we pass a bill differently, then it is just political posturing.  That is nonsense.   This reauthorization bill is a good bill. It is the way we think it  ought to be. If we pass it--they have already passed a different  reauthorization bill. I regret that they didn't pass the entire VAWA  reauthorization bill, but we can go to conference. We can iron it out.   If someone wants to argue that the provisions in that bill are  better, let them offer it here, but not be heard to say we should only  do exactly what the Senate wants. That doesn't make sense.   We are our own independent body. We were elected to do our job. This  is the way we want to do it. This is the way we think the bill ought to  be. We put it in the VAWA reauthorization bill. We have given up  waiting for the Senate on that one.   They passed a Debbie Smith bill in a version we don't entirely  approve of. We will pass our own version. We will get together. We will  see if we can agree on it. That is the way the process ought to work.   If we pass this bill, that is the way the process will work, and we  are more likely to get a reauthorization bill than by standing here and  saying: Don't pass this bill. Only pass a bill--which we won't do-- exactly in a form that we don't like, exactly the way the Senate wanted  it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, it is critical that we do all that we can to prevent  sexual assault and that we ensure survivors receive the essential  services they need, which is why we passed the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act earlier this year.   And I would remind my colleagues that the VAWA Act, which included  the authorization for the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act, expired  last September 30, 2018, when the Republicans had the majority in the  House, the majority in the Senate, and the President. So the fact that  it lapsed was unfortunate, but it was also the responsibility of the  Republican Party, which then had control of the Senate, the House, and  the Presidency to get its continuation, which they neglected to do.   We continue to urge the Senate to do the right thing and pass the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which includes the  Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act.   And we will also, again, today pass provisions to reauthorize the  Debbie Smith Act by advancing this bill today. In doing so, we reaffirm  our commitment to this important program.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support this bill, and to  continue to fight to support the more comprehensive measures in the  Violence Against Women Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
