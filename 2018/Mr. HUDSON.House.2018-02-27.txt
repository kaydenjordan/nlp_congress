 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the late  Reverend Billy Graham who is just the fourth private citizen to lie in  honor in the U.S. Capitol.   In 1918, Rev. Graham was born in Charlotte, North Carolina where he  was raised on a dairy farm. At the age of 15, the young Billy Graham  made his personal commitment to Christ during a tent revival meeting in  Charlotte. Following graduation from Wheaton College and his marriage  to classmate Ruth Bell in 1943, Rev. Graham began his ministry. While  his ministry would take him to every corner of the globe, Billy Graham  never forgot his purpose or his roots in the Old North State.   As the Lord's faithful servant, Billy Graham lived a simple life in  North Carolina with his dear wife Ruth and their five children. Yet his  ministry touched the lives of millions, as he taught God's word and  spread the good news of the gospel. It has been estimated he preached  to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and  territories, embracing innovation and new technologies to reach as many  people as possible.   Affectionately known as ``North Carolina's Favorite Son'' and  ``America's Pastor,'' Billy Graham's counsel was sought by presidents  and leaders throughout the world in times of despair and prosperity. No  matter his audience, he preached a constant message of finding  ``strength for the present and hope for the future'' in Jesus Christ.   I join with our entire community, state, nation and world in mourning  his passing, while rejoicing in the knowledge that Billy Graham is home  with his beloved Ruth in the presence of our Father in heaven.   Mr. Speaker, Reverend Billy Graham holds a special place in the  hearts of millions of Americans and people throughout the world. He is  most deserving of this honor and I urge our fellow Americans to join me  in paying their respects to America's Pastor and celebrating the life  of Reverend Billy Graham.
