 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor my dear friend, David  DiStefano. Since November 4, 2021, Dave has been serving the people of  Ohio's 15th Congressional District as our chief of staff.   Roughly 36 hours after I won the special election on November 2,  2021, Dave and I walked into an empty room in the Rayburn House Office  Building with no phones, no computers, and no staff. In fact, Dave and  I had to scramble just to find out what we were actually being asked to  vote on that evening.   In short order, with Dave's leadership and tireless work, we were  able to not only fill our staff positions, but we were able to fill  them with arguably the best team on the Hill and in Ohio.   While Dave officially left our office last Friday, you can rest  assure, Madam Speaker, that he won't be too far away. Dave and I have  been friends and colleagues for over 30 years. From introducing me to  my wife, Meghan, as well as being the godfather to my oldest son,  Prescott, Dave is more like family.   I wish Dave, his wife, Karen, and their son, Vince, all the best as  they embark on this new journey.   I will end by saying the simplest but sometimes most underused phrase  to my dear friend--even by me: Thank you.                            ____________________
