 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Missouri.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman has given us this opportunity tonight to  speak on the growing crisis at our southern border. It is a critical  issue that our friends on the other side of the aisle are simply  failing to address.   Over the course of this government shutdown, many have sought to  dismiss the very real challenges that we are facing regarding human  trafficking, sexual assault, and drug smuggling that clearly are  occurring. Thousands of people are making the dangerous journey to and  across our southern border, and this has been the result.    What these same opponents fail to mention is the perverse incentives  that exist for these crimes.   For example, our lax immigration laws have encouraged illegal  immigration.   For example, the dramatic increase in unaccompanied minors and  supposed family units at the border are a direct result of our catch- and-release policies.   The President made his case to the American people just a few nights  ago, and he addressed the urgent need for border security. He is  precisely right.   Securing our borders and protecting the American people must be a top  priority of this Congress. It is our duty. It is important to maintain  the strength and the sovereignty of our Nation.   A strong America is good not only for our national security and our  prosperity, but it is good for all people around the world. As the last  great superpower, we have to maintain our sovereignty and our strength,  and it is important to do exactly that.   Here are just a few of the most devastating facts, and we will hear  many of them tonight.   Last year, Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended 17,000  adults with existing criminal records.   In the past 2 years alone, ICE agents have arrested over 230,000  illegal aliens with a prior criminal history committed within our  borders. That is assault, homicide, and sexual assault--violent crimes.  Our border agents have arrested thousands of gang members and  traffickers, and they have rescued countless children from  exploitation.   By any objective measure, this is a humanitarian and a national  security crisis. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignoring the facts  or being dishonest.   Right now, so many of our friends on the other side are refusing to  do what they have supported in the past, simply because it is now in  line with President Trump's agenda.                                time  1715    When President Obama was in office, for example, all 54 Senate  Democrats voted for $46 billion in border security and hundreds of  miles in border fencing.   What has changed, Mr. Speaker?   That is an important question. Do our friends across the aisle need  to hear from the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of an  illegal alien? Do they deny that children being smuggled across the  border deserve reprieve?   Sadly, the legislation that has come before the House this week fails  to address the extraordinary crisis we face. This isn't an honest  attempt to end the shutdown. These aren't good faith negotiations. This  is a political stunt. These bills will not be considered by the Senate;  they will not be signed by the President; and everybody knows  [[Page H445]]  that. Rather than working on solutions, the Democrats here have chosen  to waste the people's time with these symbolic votes.   Not securing our border is an immoral act. What we have done here and  what we are doing here is immoral by failing to address this issue. I  commend the President and all of my Republican colleagues for taking  this stand.
