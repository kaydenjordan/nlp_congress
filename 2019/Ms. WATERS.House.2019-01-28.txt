 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am very pleased to have worked with Ranking Member McHenry on this  bipartisan bill, H.R. 624, the Promoting Transparent Standards for  Corporate Insiders Act.   The bill is designed to promote strong enforcement against financial  fraud by ensuring that corporate executives cannot indirectly and  illegally trade on material nonpublic information that they know about  their companies.    The Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits insider trading as a  fraud that hurts both company investors and the integrity of our  capital markets. Those accused of illegal insider trading may defend  themselves by using the SEC's rule for trading plans, Rule 10b5-1, and  state that any trades that occurred while they possessed inside  information were made pursuant to a pre-approved training plan. But the  rule for trading plans has several shortcomings that may allow  corporate insiders to get away with insider trading.   My bill would require the SEC to study whether to amend its rule for  trading plans to limit the ability of corporate insiders to, for  example, adopt multiple, overlapping plans or change their plans to  indirectly take advantage of inside information. The bill would then  require the SEC to report to Congress and revise its rules based on the  results of the study.   This bill is much needed as fraudulent stock sales by high-ranking  executives can erode confidence in our markets. For example, in  November of 2017, the CEO of Intel reportedly sold $39 million in stock  after he learned of two security flaws in Intel processors and within  days of revising his trading plan for the second time that year.   This bill is supported by investor and consumer advocates, public  pension funds, and State securities regulators, including Public  Citizen; Americans for Financial Reform; California Public Employees'  Retirement System, CalPERS; the California State Teachers' Retirement  System, CalSTRS; the Council of Institutional Investors; Healthy  Markets; and North American Securities Administrators Association.   I thank Ranking Member McHenry for joining me in reintroducing this  bill this Congress, and I urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), who is a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee and the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes), who is a senior member on the Financial  Services Committee and on the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I am  pleased that I was able to work in a bipartisan manner with the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the committee's ranking  member.   This bill shows that protecting our capital markets is something that  both sides of the aisle should support. The SEC is indeed our cop on  the block, and they need this bill and additional funding resources in  order to make sure that our markets and our investors are safe from  fraud.   Another thing that the SEC needs is stability. During the recent  government shutdown, the longest shutdown in American history, the SEC  essentially closed its doors, furloughing 94 percent of its staff and  suspending its enforcement efforts.   For 34 days the agency was forced to police the markets with a  skeleton crew of 110 enforcement staff. This may translate into  unacceptable delays in holding bad actors accountable and obtaining  relief for their victims.   The SEC wasn't the only agency impacted. The Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the Trump shutdown cost our economy $11 billion,  and $3 billion of that will never be recovered.   What is more, the White House wouldn't even rule out the chance of  another shutdown in 3 weeks.   Mr. Speaker, we should fully fund our government and focus our  efforts on bipartisan compromises like H.R. 624.   Again, I am pleased that one of the first bills to be brought to the  floor for a vote from the Financial Services Committee is a bill that  is cosponsored by Ranking Member McHenry that seeks to strengthen the  ability of the SEC to punish fraudsters and protect investors.   So, Mr. Speaker and Members, again, I am pleased to have had the  opportunity to work with the ranking member and to come together and  present a bill that is extremely important and will go a long way to  getting rid of insiders who would basically cheat the system.   So Mr. McHenry and I have not only worked on this bill together, we  developed a relationship some time ago. And I know that there are those  who are thinking that, oh, I don't know if both sides are going to be  able to get together in an atmosphere that really is not conducive to  getting along sometimes, but Mr. McHenry and I have shown that it is  possible, and we are looking forward to other opportunities.   We are not going to agree on everything and we are going to oppose  each other on some things, but this bill here today indicates that we  are willing to work together to try and see what we can do as  cosponsors and coauthors of important pieces of legislation that both  sides of the aisle should be supporting.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 502) to require the Comptroller General of the United States  to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces  are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services  associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 502         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H1224]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fight Illicit Networks and       Detect Trafficking Act'' or the ``FIND Trafficking Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)       2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, transnational criminal       organizations are increasingly using virtual currencies.        (2) In its 2015 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,       the Department of the Treasury concluded: ``The development       of virtual currencies is an attempt to meet a legitimate       market demand. According to a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago       economist, United States consumers want payment options that       are versatile and that provide immediate finality. No United       States payment method meets that description, although cash       may come closest. Virtual currencies can mimic cash's       immediate finality and anonymity and are more versatile than       cash for online and cross-border transactions, making virtual       currencies vulnerable for illicit transactions.''.        (3) Virtual currencies have become a prominent method to       pay for goods and services associated with illegal sex       trafficking and drug trafficking, which are two of the most       detrimental and troubling illegal activities facilitated by       online marketplaces.        (4) Online marketplaces, including the dark web, have       become a prominent platform to buy, sell, and advertise for       illicit goods and services associated with sex trafficking       and drug trafficking.        (5) According to the International Labour Organization, in       2016, 4.8 million people in the world were victims of forced       sexual exploitation, and in 2014, the global profit from       commercial sexual exploitation was $99 billion.        (6) In 2016, within the United States, the Center for       Disease Control estimated that there were 64,000 deaths       related to drug overdose, and the most severe increase in       drug overdoses were those associated with fentanyl and       fentanyl analogs (synthetic opioids), which amounted to over       20,000 overdose deaths.        (7) According to the United States Department of the       Treasury 2015 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, an       estimated $64 billion is generated annually from United       States drug trafficking sales.        (8) Illegal fentanyl in the United States originates       primarily from China, and it is readily available to purchase       through online marketplaces.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study on how virtual currencies and       online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex and drug       trafficking. The study shall consider--        (1) how online marketplaces, including the dark web, are       being used as platforms to buy, sell, or facilitate the       financing of goods or services associated with sex       trafficking or drug trafficking (specifically, opioids and       synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and       any precursor chemicals associated with manufacturing       fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) destined for, originating from,       or within the United States;        (2) how financial payment methods, including virtual       currencies and peer-to-peer mobile payment services, are       being utilized by online marketplaces to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking destined for,       originating from, or within the United States;        (3) how virtual currencies are being used to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking, destined for,       originating from, or within the United States, when an online       platform is not otherwise involved;        (4) how illicit funds that have been transmitted online and       through virtual currencies are repatriated into the formal       banking system of the United States through money laundering       or other means;        (5) the participants (state and non-state actors)       throughout the entire supply chain that participate in the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking (through online       marketplaces or virtual currencies) destined for, originating       from, or within the United States;        (6) Federal and State agency efforts to impede the buying,       selling, or financing of goods and services associated with       sex or drug trafficking through online marketplaces or       virtual currencies that are destined for, originating from,       or within the United States, including efforts to prevent the       proceeds from sex or drug trafficking from entering the       United States banking system through online marketplaces or       virtual currencies; and        (7) to what extent can the immutable and traceable nature       of virtual currencies contribute to the tracking and       prosecution of illicit funding.        (b) Scope.--For the purposes of the study required under       subsection (a), the term ``sex trafficking'' means the       recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining,       patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a       commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or       coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act       has not attained 18 years of age.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report       summarizing the results of the study required under       subsection (a), together with any recommendations for       legislative or regulatory action that would improve the       efforts of Federal agencies to impede the use of virtual       currencies and online marketplaces in facilitating sex and       drug trafficking.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 502, the Fight Illicit Networks and  Detect Trafficking Act, which would advance efforts to counter the  illicit uses of virtual currencies and marketplaces in drug trafficking  and sex trafficking.   The study in the report designed to drive action from government and  its partners is needed now more than ever.   In 2017, more than 70,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, a 10  percent rise from the previous year. The percentage of those deaths  from synthetic drugs like fentanyl and its analogs increased sharply as  well. It is said that Americans are now more likely to die from opioid  overdose than a car wreck, dropping our collective life expectancy.   Further, the International Labor Organization estimates that there  are 4.8 million people trapped in forced sexual exploitation globally.  Online marketplaces and cryptocurrencies facilitate this abuse, not  just abroad, but in our own communities, where victims are exploited by  bad actors, forcing men, women, and children into horrifying situations  from which it is difficult to escape.   The bill would require the GAO to study how online marketplaces and  virtual currencies are being used for drug and sex trafficking.                                time  1715    It will examine the participants in these trafficking supply chains  and how they cash in and out of their digital marketplaces, returning  their illicitly gained proceeds to the formal banking system.   The study will also tell us about existing Federal and State efforts  to impede such activities, so we can identify how to better tackle  these crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Vargas and Congresswoman Wagner for  introducing this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 502, the FIND Trafficking Act, is an important bill  in the fight against human trafficking and drug trafficking. There are  millions of victims trapped in forced sex exploitation globally, and  there were over 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in  2017.   This bill will study how virtual currencies and online marketplaces  facilitate human trafficking and drug trafficking, and it will study  the participants who are abusing these mediums. The research that  results from this bill will assist Congress in finding effective  measures to address these harmful, illicit trades.   Lives can be saved because of this legislation. Once again, I thank  Congressman Vargas and Congresswoman Wagner for introducing this  bipartisan legislation.   Again, this is the second bill that we have here on the floor today  where we have bipartisan cooperation. They are great bills that both  sides can support. Again, I am very grateful for the vision of  Congressman Vargas and Congresswoman Wagner, in introducing this  legislation, and I urge support for the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 56) to establish an Independent Financial Technology Task  Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing, to provide rewards for  information leading to convictions related to terrorist use of digital  currencies, to establish a Fintech Leadership in Innovation and  Financial Intelligence Program to encourage the development of tools  and programs to combat terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 56         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Duties.--The Task Force shall--        (1) conduct independent research on terrorist and illicit       use of new financial technologies, including digital       currencies; and  [[Page H1228]]         (2) develop legislative and regulatory proposals to improve       counter-terrorist and counter-illicit financing efforts.        (c) Annual Congressional Report.--Not later than 1 year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually       thereafter, the Task Force shall issue a report to the       Congress containing the findings and determinations made by       the Task Force in the previous year and any legislative and       regulatory proposals developed by the Task Force.       SEC. 4. REWARDS FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO TERRORIST USE OF                     DIGITAL CURRENCIES.

SEC. 5. FINTECH LEADERSHIP IN INNOVATION AND FINANCIAL                     INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM.         (a) Establishment.--There is established a program to be       known as the ``Fintech Leadership in Innovation and Financial       Intelligence Program'', which shall be funded as provided       under section 4(b)(2).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H1229]]    Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that this body will vote on H.R. 56, the  Financial Technology Protection Act, which passed the House in the  115th Congress. This bill would strengthen and expand efforts to deter  terrorists and illicit abuses of financial technology through  interagency coordination and research through collaboration with  private institutions and citizens.   As stated in last year's National Money Laundering Risk Assessment  from the United States Department of the Treasury, many  cryptocurrencies are being designed to make virtual currency  transactions untraceable and are increasingly being used by bad actors.   The talent and technological capabilities to track these transactions  must keep up so the government can identify terrorists, hackers, and  other criminals who try to hide their activities and proceeds using  cryptocurrencies and related exchanges.   This bill would establish a public-private sector task force, a grant  program to encourage the development of largely open-source tracking  technology, and a whistleblower reward program to counter terrorist  uses of digital currencies. Also, it would require the government to  examine how state and nonstate actors, including foreign terrorist  organizations, use these cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions, finance  terrorism, and launder money.   I thank Congressmen Budd and Lynch for reintroducing this bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), who is a strong leader and a strong voice on  the Financial Services Committee and the lead Democratic cosponsor of  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Budd and  Representative Lynch for the work that they have put forth on this  legislation, and I would like to take a moment to thank Mr. Lynch for  not only this legislation, but all of the efforts that he has put forth  on the Financial Services Committee that have benefited this Congress  and our country.   Let me just say that I rise again to encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote for H.R. 56, the Financial Technology  Protection Act. This bipartisan bill aims to improve our efforts to  deter terrorists and criminal abusers of financial technology,  including cryptocurrencies, through its support of interagency  coordination and research and through collaboration with private  institutions and citizens.   The measure created by this legislation will give the U.S. a better  understanding of how bad actors, including terrorists, use  cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions, finance terrorism, and launder  money. These state and nonstate actors are always looking for new ways  to get around our protective and investigative measures, and this bill  will help us to stay at least one step ahead.   So, again, my sincere gratitude and thanks to Congressmen Budd and  Lynch for reintroducing this bill, which was passed by this body in the  last Congress.   I would like to, again, follow up on statements that were made by the  ranking member, Mr. McHenry, to remind everyone that the first three  bills of this Congress that have been introduced by the Financial  Services Committee are bipartisan bills where we have shown that we are  willing to provide leadership and send a message to all of the Members  of Congress that we have to work hard to try and get good, viable,  strong legislation through this Congress, working together in ways that  perhaps we have not done before.    I am very pleased and proud to stand here as the chairperson of the  Financial Services Committee, helping to make sure that the first three  bills that we introduce are bipartisan and urging my support for these  bills and this bill now that it is before you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
