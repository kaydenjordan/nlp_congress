 Madam Chair, I am pleased that the four amendments I  proposed to this bill will be made in order. These amendments reflect  some of the most important priorities in my district.   First, they offer an amendment to increase funding for mental health  courts, which lower the recidivism rate for justice-impacted  individuals with mental illness.   My second amendment underlines the importance of modernizing the  National Institute of Standards and Technology's infrastructure. This  funding will help NIST remain a leader in driving economic growth in  Maryland's Sixth District and across the country.   The last two amendments put additional funding toward expanding rural  broadband deployment and combatting the opioid crisis in rural  communities, two critical priorities of western Maryland.   Madam Chair, I thank Representatives Riggleman of Virginia and Neguse  of Colorado for working with me on these amendments.
