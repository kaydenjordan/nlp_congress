 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Mobilize Recovery Across Georgia for their work during National  Recovery Month.   Mobilize Recovery Across Georgia is a traveling bus tour that is  crossing the State of Georgia throughout the month of September to  promote addiction recovery.   From 2019 to 2021, drug overdose deaths in Georgia increased by 55.9  percent. Over 800,000 Georgians are living in long-term recovery from a  substance use disorder.   Georgia is simply a snapshot of a nationwide epidemic that affects  countless lives, families, and communities each year.   This engaging and uplifting bus tour is designed to bring together  Georgia policymakers, local officials, and the 800,000 recovering  Georgians.   I thank Mobilize Recovery Across Georgia for bringing Georgians  together to celebrate recovery and for educating them on what resources  are available to them.                            ____________________
