 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S.J. Res. 11, disapproving the  EPA's proposed rule on new emission standards on heavy-duty trucks. The  Biden administration is proposing new regulations on heavy-duty trucks  that would dramatically raise costs on businesses and consumers.   These rules would require trucks to be equipped with expensive  emissions control technology beginning in 2027. The EPA estimates the  cost of the technology would be somewhere around $8,300 per truck, but  independent estimates say it could be more than $40,000 per truck.   This is a huge cost on businesses, especially small businesses who  rely on trucking to transport their goods. It will force them to raise  their prices or go out of business because they will have to pay more  for the supplies and inventories they need. In other words, it is more  inflation.   Consumers will have to pay more for everything from food to clothing  to building materials at a time when inflation is already at a 40-year  high.   Republicans in Energy and Commerce are calling on Congress to reject  these regulations. We simply can't afford them. The EPA claims they  need to address nitrogen oxide and other  [[Page H2528]]  pollutants, yet NOX pollutants have been reduced by 98  percent since 1988.   This is more of the blind drive to this green ideology, which is both  intellectually and environmental bankrupt. Cleaner air today is due to  advancements in engine and fuel technologies, better filtration, and  higher efficiencies.   The Senate passed this resolution to overturn this heavy-handed, job- killing rule. I urge the House to do the same.
