 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Jerry  Lewis Clark, also known as Red Dog.   Mr. Clark was born on March 31, 1943, in Savannah, Georgia, where he  began his life of service to others. He served for 25 years in the  military as an Army combat medic in Vietnam and in the Georgia Air  National Guard. He was a Purple Heart recipient for his heroics during  the Vietnam war, and he retired from the military as a senior master  sergeant.   Outside of his military service, Mr. Clark was a computer programmer,  an English teacher, a medical salesman, and a homebuilder. He also  worked as the minister of activity and director of operations at  Calvary Baptist Temple.   Mr. Clark's record shows what he truly was. He was a patriot. He was  a public servant. He truly had a servant's heart.   Mr. Clark is a hero who will be greatly missed by his community and  by his friends and his family.
