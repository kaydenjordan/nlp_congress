 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the St. Pete Pride  Parade for the significance to Pinellas County, Florida, and our LGBTQ  community.   Every June, for the past 15 years, the St. Pete Pride Parade has  brightened the streets of my hometown, leaving joy, love, and equality  in its wake. It has become one of the largest pride celebrations in the  country, hosting over 200,000 attendees last year alone; all possible,  thanks to our large, diverse LGBTQ community and city leadership that  understands this community as a source of our strength.   As we mark 1 year since the 49 souls were taken from us at the Pulse  Nightclub in Orlando, this pride is much more than a celebration. It is  a vibrant act of strength for a community that has endured persecution  simply for being who they are and who they love.   As St. Pete looks forward to the celebration this weekend, I wish the  community happy pride. Be loud and be proud because we are proud of  you.                            ____________________
