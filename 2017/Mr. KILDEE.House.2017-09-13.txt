 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 375, strike line 19 and all that follows through page       376, line 6.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chair, well, this amendment is actually quite simple.  It says that U.S. taxpayers should not subsidize coal-fired power  plants built in other countries.   Under the Obama administration, the Treasury Department issued  guidance saying that the United States, through multilateral  development banks, would no longer fund or support the construction of  such plants in foreign countries. Unfortunately, President Trump has  rolled back these efforts, and, in essence, the Trump administration is  saying to the American people that American tax dollars should go  overseas to subsidize fossil fuels and coal-fired power plants.   I support, as many in this body do on both sides of the aisle, the  efforts of multilateral development banks. In fact, the use of  America's power in that sense, through entities such as the World Bank,  is a great way for us to contribute to development across the globe and  use that soft power in a way that potentially keeps us from having to  go in a different direction. But we should not be using U.S. dollars on  projects that subsidize foreign sources of pollution that contribute to  increased carbon in our atmosphere and worsen climate change.   Now, there are some that say that the science is not settled on this  question. The people who are saying that, I am not quite sure where  they are getting their science. Climate change is real. We really don't  need a lot of evidence, even recently, to reinforce the notion that  climate change is real. Extreme weather events are real, and they are  making that point in ways that no discussion on this floor could ever  do. Unfortunately, experts are telling us it is only going to get  worse.   Congress should not be encouraging the use of American taxpayer  dollars to support coal-fired plants overseas. This amendment takes a  stand and says that we will not support these sorts of irresponsible  projects.   Here in Congress we continually advocate for the responsible use of  taxpayer dollars. And for the most part on this floor, we continue to  advocate for efforts that will reduce carbon emissions in order to  protect the environment, not just for ourselves, but for generations to  come.   Using American dollars to support coal plants in developing countries  is not responsible. It is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It  is not good for our environment.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.   I just encourage my colleagues to think about this as an opportunity  to stand up for the environment, stand up for responsible use of the  American tax dollar, and keep in mind that we work really hard here on  this floor to develop policy in this country that does not pass on to  future generations a planet that is at greater risk than the one we  inherited.   When it comes to the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars going overseas, we  ought to be able to clearly say that those dollars should be used in a  way that contributes to the development of those nations, but in a way  that does not undermine the quality of life across the globe and across  the decades and centuries to come.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).   The amendment was rejected.                 Amendment No. 223 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 223  printed in House Report 115-297.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 360, line 14, insert ``(increased by $500,000)''       before ``shall''.        Page 361, line 17, insert ``(decreased by $1,000,000)''       before ``, of which''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the managers of this  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, any Member of Congress or any elected official has had  the sad duty of going to a child's funeral. Most of us in the Christian  faith have heard maybe the same words said often in the place of  worship and in the funeral service, no matter who it is, and that is  that a child should not go before their parents. We have seen the  brokenness and, of course, the absolute despair of that family that has  lost a child.   Unfortunately, as we have found in Hurricane Harvey, when people have  looted victims of the hurricane, it is unfortunate that bad things can  happen to good people.   So the families of deceased children are victimized. They are  saddened by the loss of their child, whether it is an accident that is  tragic or a sickness; and then, because those names are printed and  become public, they are victimized again.   Alexis Agin was 4 years old when she died last year from a brain  tumor. As her parents grieved from their daughter's loss, someone else  paid attention to the details of her death, too. An identity thief was  easily able to get Alexis' personal information after she died. Her  parents had no inkling until they went to file their taxes, then to  their astonishment and despair, they learned that someone else had  already filed a tax return using Alexis' Social Security number and  claiming her as a dependent.   The Agins soon learned they were one of many. They said: ``Within an  hour of learning that my daughter's Social Security number had been  compromised and stolen, no fewer than 14 other parents whose children  passed away due to cancer contacted us and advised us that their  children's Social Security numbers, likewise, had been stolen.''   Americans are told to jealously guard their Social Security numbers,  but after one dies, the government goes public with that coveted  information. It is included on the Death Master List.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an article from ABC News  entitled ``When Loved Ones Die, Their Identity is There for the  Taking.''                        [From ABC News, May 8, 2012]        When Loved Ones Die, Their Identity Is There for the Taking                              (By Lisa Stark)         Alexis Agin was 4 years old when she died last year from a       brain tumor. As her parents grieved their daughter's loss,       someone else paid attention to the details of her death too.        An identity thief was easily able to get Alexis' personal       information after she died. Her parents had no inkling until       they went to file their taxes. Then, to their astonishment,       they learned that someone else had already filed a tax       return, using Alexis' Social Security number and claiming her       as a dependent.        The Agins soon learned they were one of many. ``Within an       hour of learning that my daughter's Social Security number       had been compromised and stolen,'' said Jonathan Agin, ``no       fewer than 14 other parents whose children passed away due to       cancer contacted us and advised us that their children's       Social Security numbers likewise had been stolen.''        Americans are told to jealously guard their Social Security       numbers, but after one dies, the government goes public with       that coveted information. It is all included on a Master       Death List.        ``This is a database of more than 8o million records that       the Social Security Administration maintains of all the       deaths in the country. And that information is actually       publicly available,'' said John Breyault at the National       Consumers League. ``Consumers can go online, on any number of       sites, and get full name, date of birth and full Social       Security number, which we call the holy trinity of personally       identifiable information.''        The list is used by banks, credit agencies and others to       try to prevent identity theft after someone dies. However, a       court case in the 197os forced the Social Security       Administration to make the list public, under Freedom of       Information Act laws. ``Unfortunately, dead people don't have       any privacy rights,'' said Breyault, ``That information, once       you're dead, is publicly available information.''        ``Within 3o seconds of learning that my daughter's Social       Security number had been stolen, I went online and found her       Social Security number,'' Agin told ABC News. ``All the       information is there.''        Breyault of the National Consumer League showed ABC News       just how easy it was. He sat down with me at a computer and       pulled up a wealth of information on my husband, who died of       cancer last year. My tax refund for this year has now been       held up because someone else filed a return, apparently using       my husband's Social Security number The Internal Revenue       Service said it might be a simple mistake by the other       taxpayer, not a case of identity fraud. The agency, however,       can't yet tell me for sure as it works to unravel the       situation.        Today on Capitol Hill, the House Ways and Means'       Subcommittees on Social Security and Identity Theft held a       hearing on this growing problem.        In his testimony, Russell George, the Treasury inspector       general for tax administration, told lawmakers that while       processing tax returns in 2011, the IRS managed to flag and       stop 940,000 returns that appeared to involve identity theft.       The refunds requested on those returns totaled $6.5 billion.        George told lawmakers, ``There is much more fraud that it       [the IRS] does not detect.'' The inspector general       ``identified approximately 1.5 million additional undetected       tax returns with potentially fraudulent tax refunds totaling       in excess of $5.2 billion,'' said George. Those refunds were       paid out. ``If not addressed, we estimate the IRS could issue       approximately $26 billion in fraudulent tax refunds resulting       from identity theft over the next five years,'' he testified.        The IRS told ABC News that it believes that five-year       estimate is ``far too high. The estimate was based on figures       from 2010, before the IRS instituted major changes in the way       it handles identity theft cases,'' the agency said. ``Our       increased compliance and prevention efforts mean we are       stopping more refund fraud than ever before.''        The Social Security Administration had recently taken steps       to cut back on the Master Death List information it releases       publicly, leaving off the decedent's state and ZIP code. And       the IRS said it has installed identity theft screening       filters on its computer systems to flag suspicious returns.       ``Fighting identity theft will be an ongoing battle for the       IRS and one we cannot afford to let up on,'' said Steven       Miller, an IRS deputy commissioner, in written testimony.        Late last year, the IRS established a special taxpayer       protection unit to help handle identity theft cases. But       George testified that those trying to file their 2011 taxes       found it difficult to get through to the unit. ``The unit       received more than 86,000 calls during the 2012 filing       season, but has only been able to answer about 21,000,'' said       George. And according to his testimony, the average phone       wait time for taxpayers was almost one hour.        Taxpayers caught in this mess are forced to prove their       loved one's identity to the  [[Page H7361]]       IRS. Agin said he had to provide evidence to show the IRS       that his late daughter was his child. Some cases have taken       up to a year to resolve.        Congress is considering a number of bills that would limit       access to the Master Death List For Agin and the hundreds of       thousands of other taxpayers who have been victims of this       fraud, it can't come soon enough. ``It's bad enough losing       your child to any type of disease, cancer in any manner,''       said Agin, ``but then have somebody steal their identify, the       last remaining vestige of your child, it's horrible.''    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, there is no dedicated person in the  IRS to deal with these broken and grieving families, so they simply  become victims. By the time they find out, someone has bought a house,  someone has taken their luxury vacation, got many credit cards, and  used this dead child to abuse this family again.   The Jackson Lee amendment is simple. What it does is it provides a  dedicated person, funding to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service for the  purpose of assisting the parents of a deceased child where that child's  identifying information has been stolen and fraudulently used on a  personal income tax return filed with the IRS.   It is a simple request, Mr. Chairman. If the Taxpayer Advocate  Service office is what it is, and if anyone has tried to use it,  including Members of Congress, we know there needs to be a dedicated  person just to answer the phone of the grieving parent who finds out  through IRS filing that they are being abused again and their beautiful  angel is being used for other and evil works of someone who would use  that deceased child to their advantage.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the  Jackson Lee Amendment to Division D of the Rules Committee Print 115- 31, which makes appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018, ``H.R. 3354, the  ``Interior and Environment Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018.''   I wish to commend Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Quigley for  their work in shepherding this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment is simple but provides an  important and necessary protection for grieving parents.   The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to ensure that the IRS Tax  Advocate Service has adequate resources to assist parents of a deceased  child whose Social Security Number was stolen by tax cheats and used on  a federal tax return to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).   The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to be a compassionate use of  IRS funds to help grieving parents navigate the process of reclaiming  their child's identity from tax cheats.   This amendment is necessary when we consider the story of little  Alexis Agin who was just 4 years old when she died of a brain tumor in  2011.   As her parents grieved, someone stole Alexis' identity to commit tax  fraud.   Alexis' parents did not discover the crime until they filed their  taxes.   The sad fact is Alexis' parents are not alone--they were one of at  least 14 other parents whose children died of cancer and learned that  their child's Social Security number had been stolen by tax thieves.   Nearly all of us understand the importance of safeguarding our Social  Security numbers, but after someone dies Social Security numbers are  published on a national online registry called the Master Death List.   The Master Death List registry exists to alert businesses and  financial institutions to not renew credit cards or create new credit  in a deceased person's name.   But it also alerts thieves of opportunities to steal identities and  commit tax fraud.   As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle identity thieves have  stolen the tax refunds of more than 490,000 dead persons since 2008.   The thieves typically claim that a dead person is their dependent  when they file tax returns.   In Fiscal Year 2012, the IRS initiated approximately 900 identity  theft related criminal investigations, triple the number of  investigations initiated in FY 2011.   Direct investigative time applied to identity theft related  investigations increased by 129 percent over that same period.   On July 30, 2013, in St. Louis, Missouri, Tania Henderson was  convicted of theft of government funds and aggravated identity theft  and sentenced to 144 months in prison and ordered to pay $835,883 in  restitution to the U.S. Treasury.   According to her plea agreement and other court documents, Henderson  stole the identities of more than 400 individuals, many of whom were  deceased, and filed fraudulent tax returns using their names and Social  Security account numbers.   The theft of identities of deceased children for the purpose of  committing tax fraud is a sad fact that too many parents have to face  while they are attempting to cope with the tragedy of losing their  child.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will help ensure that the IRS Tax Advocate  Service has the resources needed to assist these grieving parents with  filing the last tax return where their child's name will be listed as  being a member of their household.   I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee Amendment, which would  be a compassionate use of IRS funds.
