 Mr. Speaker, due to an unavoidable scheduling  conflict, I was unable to cast my votes on time.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 253,  ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 254, ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 255, ``Nay'' on  rollcall No. 256, and ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 257.                             personal explanation
