Without objection, it is so ordered.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, today I have been listening to the  diatribes against the repeal resolution we are working on, and I think  some things need to be answered.   The Republicans are not trying to throw 30 million people off of  their insurance. What we have seen over the time of ObamaCare is that  there were 30 million people who were uninsured when we started that  debate, and today there are 30 million people who are uninsured. Now it  is a different 30 million people. The 30 million people who couldn't  get insurance have insurance, and we want them to have insurance. And  the 30 million people who are now off insurance used to have insurance,  but they can no longer afford it. There has been a huge increase in the  cost of health care. That is not how it was supposed to be. The prices  were supposed to come down.   Yesterday we took the first step in fulfilling the promise of  repealing ObamaCare, which will pave the way for real health care  reforms to strengthen the doctor-patient relationships, expand choices,  lower health care costs, and improve access to quality, affordable,  innovative health care.   As I discussed yesterday, while Republicans will start by repealing  ObamaCare immediately, we will ensure a stable transition in which  those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage. This  will allow us to move step by step to a new set of reforms, listening  carefully to the advice of millions of Americans affected and making  sure we proceed wisely, doing no harm.   There is a common misconception that some of my friends across the  aisle have promoted. It is the idea that ObamaCare was a success and  that repeal will be tearing down a functioning program. That is not  true. ObamaCare has put our health insurance markets on the brink of  collapse in many parts of the country. And what Republicans face now is  an imperative to do something that the Democrats couldn't bring  themselves to do when they had control, and that is to fix the problems  they created.   ObamaCare became the epitome of a sacred cow for them, and any  changes, as you can see, unless done by Executive action, were out of  the question.   Interestingly, President Obama recently admitted in October 2016 at  Miami Dade College that the law has real problems and that, in his  words, ``There are going to be people who are hurt by premium increases  or a lack of competition and choice.'' That is the President of the  United States talking about ObamaCare. In that same speech, he went on  to call these issues ``growing pains.'' I think that is a troubling  [[Page S87]]  blind spot about this law that he and many of my Democratic colleagues  share. Millions are facing impossibly high health insurance premiums  for plans they may not even want to have. Costs are going up, and they  can't afford it. Somehow these casualties of ObamaCare don't deserve  relief, apparently; they are just written off as growing pains by the  authors of the law.   My colleagues will recall ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, who  was paid in a number of different ways, who was famously exposed in  2014 for stating, amongst other things, that while crafting this bill,  he believed that ``the lack of transparency is a huge political  advantage'' and that it ``was written in a tortured way to make sure  the CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.'' Mr. Gruber may have  succeeded in masking the consequences of ObamaCare to obtain passage,  but there is no way to hide the results.   A recent poll by the Gallup organization showed that more Americans  continue to disapprove--53 percent--than approve--42 percent--of the  law and that a majority of Americans want to see the law changed. Let  me highlight that point again. A majority of Americans want to see  ObamaCare either changed or replaced altogether. In fact, since passage  of ObamaCare in 2010, there has never been a majority of Americans  supporting the law. A quick glance around the Nation quickly explains  why. For more and more Americans, there is only a single insurer from  which they can select health plans, a monopoly. In fact, on Federal  exchanges, one in five consumers will only be able to select plans from  a single insurer. Many residents across the country only have one  choice of health insurer. That is including my home State of Wyoming as  well as the entire State of Alaska.   What does this lack of competition mean? Prices are surging for hard- working families who now have to choose between unreasonable insurance  rates or an unreasonable fine. That doesn't even include the deductible  problem we have. That doesn't even include the additional taxes and  prices people are paying as a result of other things that are built  into the law, which I will go into later--not in this speech.   The irony of a Democrat-led effort to help resulting in the creation  of a lose-lose proposition for families ran true to voters in the most  recent election when they voted for change. In Wyoming, some families  would be forced to pay more than 30 percent of their total income on  premiums to obtain health care coverage, which often includes  deductibles of over $1,000. One family faced premiums of more than  $1,600 per month. That is one family, $1,600 a month. As an  alternative, their tax penalty for not carrying coverage was only  $1,700 for the whole year. So guess what they did. They paid the fine  because they couldn't afford the insurance premium. They could also see  no way that they were going to be able to get a benefit from that.   For those lucky enough to be able to afford insurance, particularly  in the individual market, under the new health law, premiums are  expected to increase faster in 2017 than in previous years. Some States  will see insurance premiums rise by as much as 53 percent. I think that  makes it truly an emergency.   After discussing the why, it is important to talk about how we are  going to do this. Passing the repeal resolution we are currently  debating today will allow Republicans to use the budget reconciliation  process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and  unaffordable law. This is the exact same procedure congressional  Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of portions of  ObamaCare. Let me say that again. This is the exact same procedure  congressional Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of  portions of ObamaCare.   After Congress passes this repeal resolution, it can then move  forward on reconciliation legislation that will provide for the repeal  of ObamaCare and pave the way for real health care reforms. I think  Members are looking forward to an open and serious debate about the  future of America's health and its health care system and the  importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers. I think  that is something both sides can agree on, and that is what will  happen.   This resolution we are debating does two things. It recognizes the  point in the budget we are at considering the points of order and  things that happened up to this point in time. We are just recognizing  that is where this budget is. It still keeps in place the points of  order to maintain some control over our spending, but the significant  part is the repeal part. That is where we institute the reconciliation,  and all that is, is an instruction to two committees on the Senate side  and two committees on the House side. The two on the Senate side were  the Finance Committee--they are the ones who deal with all of the taxes  and the finance and the Medicare and the Medicaid, and they need to  save $1 billion over 10 years. That is peanuts around here. They will  do much better than that, I am certain. And then the HELP Committee-- Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--also has an instruction to save  $1 billion. That is it.   This isn't a debate over what the changes are going to be to  ObamaCare; this is a debate about whether we are going to give two  committees, which have jurisdiction over this situation, the ability to  consider it and bring us something. It has to conform with the budget  requirements, and that is going to save some money. That is why we have  a very low threshold, each of them saving $1 billion. That is the time  when we will have the debate on what is happening with health care. If  somebody wants to raise the threshold of the $1 billion for each of the  two committees, that would be perhaps acceptable--unnecessary but  perhaps acceptable. If somebody wants to change the budget, we are  going to have an actual chance to change the budget right after we  finish this process because there is a budget for 2018. We are already  a third of the way through 2017, and there are no spending bills  approved. That is wrong, but that is what this budget reflects. That is  where we are at this point in time on our spending. Hopefully, we will  do well on the new budget and come up with a plan that is going to pull  the United States out of the hole that we are in on our deficit  spending, which results in huge debt.    I would like to make that distinction. Deficit is our overspending.  Debt is the amount that we owe that we have to pay interest on--like  pouring money down a hole--and that interest rate is going up. We get  to make decisions on about $1 trillion each year, and the interest rate  right now spends $200 billion right now by itself--that is at about 1  percent. If it goes to 5 percent, which is the norm for the United  States, that would be $1 trillion dollars. That is the amount we get to  make decisions on. What shape will our country would be in if we have  to spend $1 trillion dollars on interest and that is all we have to  make decisions on?   We have to do something. Health care is affecting more people in this  country than anything else. So we will start immediately. We normally  have a recess that would begin from the time we reorganize until the  time the President is sworn in, but Republicans recognize that this is  an emergency. This is something that needs to be taken care of. So we  are going to stay around and get it solved.   We are going to do the processes we have to do. This is the first of  the processes. There is another more important step, which has to be  the actual savings part in order to do the reconciliation, and we are  going to do that.   We will hear all kinds of stories of ways that people have been  helped by health care, and we will hear stories about how people have  been hurt by this health care. We need to fix it for both of them.   So I think Members are looking forward to an open and serious  debate--I hope, a serious debate--about the future of America's health  care system and the importance of restoring the trust of the  hardworking taxpayers. I hope that is something we can both agree on.   Thank you. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?   If no one yields time, time will be charged to both sides.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m.  there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, prior  to the vote in relation to Kaine amendment No. 8.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    I yield the floor.                               Amendment No. 8    The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally  divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 8, offered by the  Senator from Virginia, Mr. Kaine.   The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, this amendment is corrosive to the privilege  of the budget resolution, meaning that it is outside the scope of what  is appropriate for a budget resolution. Any inappropriate amendment  could be fatal to the privilege of this resolution, which would destroy  our efforts to repeal ObamaCare. In other words, a vote in favor of  this amendment is a vote against repealing ObamaCare.   In addition, this amendment is not germane to this budget resolution.  This budget resolution is much more focused than a typical budget  resolution. The Congressional Budget Act requires that the amendment to  a budget resolution be germane. Since this amendment does not meet the  standard required by budget law, a point of order would lie. As such, I  raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1 and ask unanimous  consent that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the  amendment by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Paul, proposes       an amendment numbered 1.    (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 4, 2017, under  ``Text of Amendments.'')   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, would the Senator mind if it comes off of  the resolution time?    Mr. President, would the Senator mind if it comes off of  the resolution time?    Mr. President, would the Senator mind if it comes off of  the resolution time?
