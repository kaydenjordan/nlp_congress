 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill.   This legislation includes the bipartisan AIR PUMP Act, which I  introduced earlier this year alongside Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley.   Our legislation would require the FAA to issue guidance to air  carriers on providing protections for flight crews to pump breast milk  during noncritical phases of flights.   All workers deserve the right to pump breast milk in the workplace,  including flight attendants and pilots. Currently, they are the only  workers who do not have this protection.   Flight crew workers should be able to have reasonable break times to  pump. They should also have a designated place that is shielded from  view and free from interference. This bill also ensures that the FAA's  pumping guidance will not incur significant costs for air carriers. It  helps increase the diversity of the workforce and ensures working  mothers have needed flexibility.   Mr. Chairman, I thank T&I Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking Member Rick  Larsen for their support of the AIR PUMP Act and their bipartisan  approach to the FAA reauthorization bill.
