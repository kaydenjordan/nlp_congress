 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support in of S. 4900, the SBIR and STTR  Extension Act of 2022.   The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Businesses  Technology Transfer, or SBIR and STTR programs, are vital to the  success of many small entities and have helped create thousands of new  jobs by fostering innovation and stimulating the economy through  cutting-edge research. SBIR and STTR's mission is to support scientific  excellence and technological innovation for small businesses.   For the last 40 years, these programs have helped firms develop new  technologies that have directly assisted Federal agencies meet their  R&D needs. The American warfighter is no doubt stronger due to these  programs.   However, a recent Department of Defense report revealed foreign  adversaries have been exploiting the SBIR through shell companies,  planted government researchers, and state-sponsored talent programs.  The report found that the People's Republic of China has become a large  beneficiary of SBIR and STTR. This is unacceptable, and the status quo  must not continue, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1415    The programs must have heightened awareness and protections in place  to prevent nefarious abuse. This legislation, crafted over months of  negotiations, provides significant reforms to combat malign foreign  influence and protect our small businesses from Chinese acquisition of  innovation technologies.   Specifically, this bill mandates that agencies establish strong due- diligence safeguards to assess security risks and prevent influence  from bad actors. It requires companies to disclose any business ties,  investments, and contracts with China, and it gives agencies authority  to deny any application if certain relationships are deemed a risk to  national security.   In addition to safeguarding small businesses from China, this bill  curbs abuse by multiple award winners, or SBIR mills. Mills are firms  that consume a disproportionate number of awards but have low  commercialization rates. These mills will have to meet enhanced  performance standards in order to apply for new awards. These  benchmarks will hold mills accountable and ensure that the programs are  focusing on commercializing projects and attracting more private  capital investments.   Finally, S. 4900 strengthens congressional oversight, increases  public transparency, and safeguards taxpayer dollars during a time  where government overreach has run rampant, and transparency has been  limited.   These reforms are a win for small businesses and will protect U.S.  R&D and innovative technologies.   I thank Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Lucas, Chairwoman Eddie  Bernice Johnson, as well as Senators Cardin, Paul, and Ernst for  working in a bipartisan manner to ensure these programs are  reauthorized before the end of the month.   I encourage all my colleagues to support S. 4900, which unanimously  passed the Senate last week.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the Republican  leader of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), a valuable member on the  Small Business Committee and a strong advocate for entrepreneurs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), a very valuable,  experienced member of our Committee on Small Business and another  strong advocate for the entrepreneurs of our economy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood), one of our newest Members who  has joined our committee and is doing a fantastic job representing  small businesses and is another strong advocate for the entrepreneurs  of our country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   The SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022 will reauthorize the programs  for 3 years and address congressional concerns by establishing research  security measures, increasing transparency and oversight, and focusing  on commercialization.   I think, as you have heard the speakers this afternoon, in my mind,  we have two big problems that we are solving here. Besides the  extension of these programs, which I think are important to the  national defense of our country, for one thing, I think it also helps  spur entrepreneurial and investment technology that I think is vital to  our country, and we stop the use of some of these programs as ATMs for  different companies. I think we also put a stop to the Chinese abuse of  these programs, as well.    I think those are the two highlights that are really important in  these programs. They have done a good job of putting protections in  place. I think that we are strengthening these protections, as well as  protecting R&D and protecting our taxpayer dollars to make sure they  are being spent effectively and efficiently.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 4900, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
