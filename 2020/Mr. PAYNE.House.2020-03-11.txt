 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a scoring  sensation in my district, Rakiyah Sellers. The senior guard at College  of Saint Elizabeth scored her 1,000th career point in February.   She began her basketball career at the Ivy Hill Elementary School in  Newark, New Jersey. From there, she continued to shine as a standout  player for the Lady Jaguars of Newark's Arts High School.   Her scoring milestone came in a Colonial States Athletic Conference  semifinal. Her team, College of Saint Elizabeth, beat Notre Dame of  Maryland University 76-51.   In the conference final, Rakiyah had 4 points, 2 assists, 2 blocks,  and 3 steals. Unfortunately, her Eagles of Saint Elizabeth lost to the  Keystone Giants 72-61, but that does not dim her accomplishment. She is  a shining star of Newark, and I am proud to highlight her today.                            ____________________
