 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation. This very  important legislation, the Paycheck Protection Program, has proven to  be a great program that has saved many small businesses in the First  Congressional District of Georgia, and there  [[Page H1944]]  are many small businesses that still need this program. Therefore, the  extra funding that we are sending here today is going to be utilized  and utilized in a great way by these small businesses.   Also, there are $75 billion in there for hospitals, and hospitals-- particularly rural hospitals--are extremely important in this scenario  as well. We need to make sure that money gets to them.   Oh, by the way, speaking of hospitals, Madam Speaker, heroes come and  go but legends last forever. We have heard that before. Today, our  heroes are wearing white lab coats. They are our doctors, our  pharmacists, our healthcare workers, our nurses, who are providing  healthcare services, risking their own health in order to provide these  healthcare services to our citizens. I thank them for that. Our country  thanks them for that. Their service will be legendary.   And finally, Madam Speaker, for all of those in the First  Congressional District and throughout our country who have lost loved  ones, our thoughts and prayers are with you.
