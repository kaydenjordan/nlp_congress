 Mr. Speaker, years ago, I began running for Congress  because I believed that hardworking Americans shouldn't have to pay  three times what people in other countries pay for the same exact  medicines.   I ran for Congress because I believed that none of our constituents  should have to pay $20,000 a year for insulin, a medication they quite  literally cannot live without.   I ran for Congress because I believe that Minnesotans deserve a  Representative who will fight to lower the cost of drugs, even in the  face of millions of dollars in attack ads funded by Big Pharma.   My fellow colleagues, this week we have a real opportunity to make a  difference in our constituents' lives, to save American families  thousands of hard-earned dollars every single year, while finally  standing up to an industry that has raked in record-breaking profits at  the expense of hardworking Americans.                                time  1015    We cannot allow this opportunity to pass us by.   Empowering Medicare to negotiate drug prices would not only grant  long overdue relief to struggling constituents but save the American  taxpayers billions of dollars annually.  [[Page H6075]]    We may not get everything we wanted in this package, but we must take  the power back from Big Pharma. Big Pharma has had way too much power  over this town for way too long. This is our opportunity to demonstrate  to our constituents that we work for them, not for Big Pharma. We  cannot return to our districts without delivering on our promise to  lower the cost of prescription drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do what is right and fight for  these critical provisions in the Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
