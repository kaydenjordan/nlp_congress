 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FDA  Reauthorization Act, FDARA as it is called.   It could not be more evident that the time has come for Congress to  reckon with the growing problem of exorbitant drug prices. Every few  months sees the headlines about another extreme price hike, as was just  mentioned. Some unscrupulous pharmaceutical CEO buys the rights to  produce drugs that have been on the market for decades, usually where  there are no competitors, then, seemingly overnight, they raise the  price astronomically.   In the case of Daraprim, a drug that is used by some transplant  patients and people living with AIDS, the price went from $13.50 per  pill to $750. That is outrageous, a price increase of 5,000 percent.  For this drug and many others, the drugs have been off patent for ages  and there is no generic competitor on the market.   Competition from generic drugs saves patients and the government  billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, generic drug  manufacturers who want to bring these markets to competition face a  long approval process, steep costs, and uncertainty. This FDA act  reckons with that.   It is time for Congress to act, also, on those unscrupulous  providers. Gus Bilirakis and I introduced a bill providing competition  to drive down those costs. We provide new incentives for generic drugs  to come to market and reform the process.   I am in support of the bill.
