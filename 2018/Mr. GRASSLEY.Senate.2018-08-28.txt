 Mr. President, I am writing to recognize a longtime  member of my staff, who will shortly retire from public service, after  honorably serving me and the people of Iowa for over 35 years.   Fred Schuster joined my staff in 1984 as my regional director in Des  Moines, IA. He had been president of the Iowa State University student  body and a member of ISU's Cardinal Key Honor Society. He had also been  president of the College Republicans of Iowa.   In 1987, I asked Fred to move to Waterloo and become the regional  director. During this time, Fred was elected president of the largest  Kiwanis club in North East Iowa and served as its lieutenant governor,  covering seven other clubs. He was appointed to the Cedar Falls Library  Board and was elected an officer each year he served. He was also  selected to be on the North East Iowa regional library board. In 1999,  there was a devastating flood in northeast Iowa, the recovery from  which resulted in a significant shortage of drywall in the region. Fred  worked to get suppliers to provide extra drywall to the Waterloo area  stores. One of the companies instead provided two semi loads for free,  which was distributed by the Area Agency on Aging to those in greatest  need.   In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Fred to be the Region 7  Director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services covering  the States of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and  [[Page S5989]]  Kansas. At its peak, there were over 600 employees at HHS in that  region. Fred traveled extensively, visiting with the Governors and  State and Federal officials and testified before congressional  committees. Fred was ranked overall the best regional director in each  of the last 3 years he served.   Following Fred's service in the Bush administration, he returned to  work as my State business and economic liaison. Part of his  responsibilities was to raise funds and plan an ambassadors tour I had  been hosting every other year at that time to foster and facilitate  greater awareness of Iowa's workforce and exports with those assigned  to the U.S. Embassy in Washington from nationals around the world.  Iowa's an exporting State with outstanding manufacturing and leading in  agriculture commodities. Even though 2009 was a challenging economic  time, Fred raised more than enough to cover the cost of the  ambassadors' airfare to and from Washington, DC, renting three  commercial tour buses, and organized lodging for the diplomats,  security detail, and staff. He organized the cultural, educational,  manufacturing, and agricultural sites for the ambassadors to visit.   In January 2011, I asked Fred to become the regional director in my  Cedar Rapids office, the role he presently holds. Fred again took an  active role in the recovery from the flood of 2016, visiting the  numerous communities and businesses damaged by the floodwaters.   Fred Schuster will retire from my office after more than 35 years of  service to me and my office, the U.S. Senate, and the people of Iowa,  effective September 11, 2018. His honest, thoughtful, helpful, and  insightful wisdom and advice have been valuable to me and to everyone  with whom he connected. His absence will be a loss to my office, but I  am glad that he will have more time to spend with his daughters,  granddaughter, and friends, as well as to visit the remaining of the 50  State capitols and Presidential historical sites. I greatly value  Fred's friendship and his commitment to public service, and I wish him  well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a lot of my colleagues, I rise to  speak for a short period of time about our deceased colleague, Senator  John McCain.   I begin my remarks by paying my respect for our colleague and friend,  Senator John McCain. A great American has died.   Senator McCain represented the people of Arizona and the United  States of America with great honor, always holding his ground and  sticking to his principles. ``Sticking to his principles'' have been  the words used by more colleagues since his death than any other  description of him. Senator McCain was tough and tenacious, both as a  32-year Member of the U.S. Senate and also as a member of the U.S.  Navy. His grit and determination as a prisoner of war in Vietnam are  legendary and ought to be an inspiration. For the rest of his life, he  understood from his own experience what it takes to keep a country  safe, and he stood up for the security of the United States, and, in  turn, that was standing up for the security of the world.    He prioritized those in uniform and the veterans who safeguard our  Nation. I had tremendous respect for Senator McCain's leadership of the  Armed Services Committee and for the many ways he led on the No. 1  responsibility of the Federal Government: our national defense.   Senator McCain and I served in the Senate together since 1986. Even  after he became ill last year, Senator McCain's charisma was as strong  as ever. At Christmastime, he greeted me with an oft-repeated joke he  had since he was a candidate for President and traveling around Iowa.  He learned a lot about Iowa, and this greeting was something like:  Well, Chuck, I had my glass of ethanol for breakfast. He would often  say to me something he learned in Iowa about advertising by the John  Deere corporation: Nothing runs like a Deere. Of course, being from  Iowa, I liked to hear that sort of greeting, and it was often that he  said those things to me.   As I stand here today with his Senate desk close at hand and draped  in his  [[Page S6001]]  honor, my wife Barbara and I share our condolences with Cindy McCain  and Senator McCain's entire family. Senator McCain sacrificed so much  of himself for his country, and we are grateful for his lifetime of  service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise on another matter that I have  addressed the Senate on quite frequently lately, and that is about  Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   One week from today, Brett Kavanaugh will appear before the Senate  Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing.  After reviewing Judge Kavanaugh's very extensive record, I am convinced  he is perhaps the most qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme  Court.   Some of my colleagues on the other side, including all of the  Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee, have asked that I delay  Judge Kavanaugh's hearing. They have asked me to delay the hearing  because of legal issues surrounding some of President Trump's former  associates. It is absolutely not clear to me what one has to do with  the other. But this is, by my account, at least the third strategy  Democratic leaders have used to try to delay Judge Kavanaugh's hearing.   Liberal outside groups, if you recall, announced their opposition to  every one of the 25 potential nominees before the President made his  decision. Those 25 potential nominees were, for the most part, given to  the people of the country probably 6 months before the President's  election. No other President has told you the types of people he was  going to put on the Supreme Court and given you those examples. Some  Democrats joined these outside liberal groups, and many others  announced their opposition immediately after the nomination.   The minority leader, before he even had a chance to meet with Judge  Kavanaugh or review Judge Kavanaugh's record, said that he would fight  the nomination with everything he has.   Democratic leaders' first strategy was to try to argue that the Biden  rule, which bars the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices in a  Presidential election year, also applies during midterm election years.  This was a strange argument to make given that many of those Senators  argued in 2016 that the Biden rule didn't even exist for Presidential  elections.   Fact checkers and outside observers widely rejected their argument.  The historical record was clear: The Biden rule has never applied  during midterm election years.   The second strategy Democratic leaders pursued was to attempt to bury  the Judiciary Committee in irrelevant paperwork--mountains of it. I  have discussed the issue at length previously, so I will only give you  a bottom line. The bottom line is, we have received more pages of  documents from Judge Kavanaugh's time as an executive branch lawyer  than we did from any previous Supreme Court nominee. In fact, we have  already received over 430,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh's executive  branch legal records, which is nearly as many as the last 5 nominees  combined. This is on top of the 307 opinions he wrote and hundreds more  he joined as a judge on the DC Circuit over the past 12 years. The  public already has access right now to every one of those more than  10,000 pages of judicial writings, as well as the nearly 18,000 pages  we received in connection with his judicial questionnaire. Those were  supplemental to the 110 pages he filled out in the questionnaire. By  the way, that happens to be the most robust questionnaire ever issued  to a Supreme Court nominee.    Democratic leaders now are asking me to delay Judge Kavanaugh's  hearing because of some of the President's former associates' legal  troubles, but this is just another obvious and opportunistic attempt to  push the confirmation process past the midterm elections. After all,  both Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer were  confirmed while President Clinton was personally under investigation  for the Whitewater controversy. In fact, Justice Breyer was confirmed  while President Clinton's personal documents were under grand jury  subpoena. Moreover, between June 1993 and February 1999--a period  during which President Clinton faced significant legal jeopardy--the  Senate confirmed 248 district judges and 50 circuit judges for lifetime  appointments.   It is clear that the Democratic leaders' latest attempt to delay the  confirmation is unsupported by law or history.   Another reason Democratic leaders have focused on these issues is to  divert attention from the great record and abilities of Judge  Kavanaugh. They know that Judge Kavanaugh is exactly the type of  Justice the American people want because that is what the Constitution  calls for--somebody to interpret the law, not to be a superlegislator.   Judge Kavanaugh has served for 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals--a court many consider to be the second most powerful court in  our country. During that time, he authored more than 300 opinions and  joined hundreds more. The Supreme Court has in at least a dozen  separate cases adopted legal positions advanced by Judge Kavanaugh in  his opinions. Historians of the Supreme Court would say that is a very  impressive record.   Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated that he understands the proper role  of a judge. I also would say he sees himself as a judge and not a  superlegislator. In numerous opinions and in speeches and publications,  Judge Kavanaugh has eloquently expressed that judges must find and  apply the law as it is written, not how they wish the law were written.  If they followed how they wish the law were written, that would fall  into a category where I would say a Judge becomes a superlegislator.   Judge Kavanaugh recently said this on that point: ``When courts apply  doctrines that allow them to rewrite the laws (in effect), they are  encroaching on the legislature's Article I power.''   If you ever wonder why judges shouldn't be superlegislators, that is  because they have lifetime appointments. If you don't like what they  do, you can't vote them out of office; whereas if the legislating is  done by the Congress of the United States and you don't like the laws  the Congress passes, you can vote those Members of Congress out of  office.   Judge Kavanaugh has also argued that judges must apply the same  approach to all cases. He said this: ``Like cases should be treated  alike by judges of all ideological and philosophical stripes,  regardless of the subject matter and regardless of the identity of the  parties to that case.'' Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record reveals that  he follows his own advice. He decided cases based on his understanding  of law as written, not his own personal policy preferences or who the  litigant is.   In addition to his impeccable qualifications and record of  achievement, Judge Kavanaugh has shown a dedication to public service,  mentorship, and diversity. He spent all but 3 years of his legal career  in public service. He volunteers his time to coach both his daughters'  youth basketball teams, and he serves meals to the homeless with  Catholic Charities. Judge Kavanaugh is a proven mentor to law students  and young lawyers. Judge Kavanaugh has taught courses at Harvard Law  School on separation of powers and the modern Supreme Court since 2008.   The Senate Judiciary Committee received a letter in support of his  confirmation from his former students. They wrote this:         We . . . represent a broad spectrum of political and       ideological beliefs, as well as perspectives on judicial       philosophy. We may have differing views on political issues       surrounding the confirmation process, but we all agree on one       thing: Judge Kavanaugh is a rigorous thinker, a devoted       teacher, and a gracious person.    But this letter goes on with other things that are important about  Judge Kavanaugh, so I quote again:         Both inside and outside the courtroom, Judge Kavanaugh       evinced a genuine warmth and interest in his students and       their careers. . . . He was exceptionally generous with his       time, making himself available to meet with students not only       to discuss the class, but also to assist with their scholarly       writings or to offer career advice. In many instances, he has       continued to provide advice and support long after the class       ended by writing letters of recommendation and serving as a       valued mentor. In our view, his genuine interest in helping       young lawyers demonstrates a deep commitment to the legal       community as a whole.   [[Page S6002]]     That is from students of his of differing political views.   Federal judges also play an important role in mentoring the next  generation of lawyers. They typically hire four new law clerks each  year to help them research and decide cases. A law clerk is like a  judge's right arm. A judge's law clerks know the judge better than  anyone else. Day in and day out, law clerks work closely with a judge  in chambers every day on complex legal issues.   Judge Kavanaugh has clearly taken seriously his mentorship role with  his clerks. His former law clerks submitted a letter to this committee  strongly supporting his confirmation. They wrote:         It was a tremendous stroke of luck to work for and be       mentored by a person of his strength of character, generosity       of spirit, intellectual capacity, and unwavering care for his       family, friends, colleagues, and us, his law clerks. . . . He       is unfailingly warm and gracious with his colleagues no       matter how strongly they disagree about a case, and he is       well-liked and respected by judges and lawyers across the       ideological spectrum as a result. . . . He always makes time       for us, his law clerks. He makes it to every wedding, answers       every career question, and gives unflinchingly honest advice.       That advice often boils down to the same habits we saw him       practice in the chambers every day: Shoot straight, be       careful and brave, work as hard as you possibly can, and then       work a little harder.    That is from his law clerks.   One of the areas where Judge Kavanaugh has had a particular impact is  his commitment to diversity. More than half of his law clerks have been  female. Indeed, during one year, all four of his law clerks were  female, which was a first for the DC Circuit.   Judge Kavanaugh's female law clerks sent the committee a letter.  These law clerks wrote:         We know all too well that women in the workplace still face       challenges, inequality, and even harassment. Among other       things, women do not enjoy a representative share of       prestigious clerkships or high-profile legal positions, but       this committee and the American public more broadly should be       aware of the important work Judge Kavanaugh has done to       remedy those disparities. In our view, the Judge has been one       of the strongest advocates in the Federal judiciary for women       lawyers.    Additionally, Judge Kavanaugh has a track record of recruiting and  hiring diverse law clerks from the best law schools. It is clear that  he cares about expanding opportunities to unrepresented groups in the  law. The legal profession should be open to anyone, regardless of where  they grew up or where their parents emigrated from. Judge Kavanaugh's  clerks reflect this important principle.   In sum, Democratic leaders committed 1 month ago to oppose Judge  Kavanaugh's confirmation. They have thrown a lot against the wall to  try to delay his confirmation, but none of it sticks. Judge Kavanaugh  will have his hearing next week, and I am looking forward to it.   Based upon my review of Judge Kavanaugh's extensive record, it  appears that he is extremely qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. He  understands the proper role of a judge in our constitutional system,  and he has devoted time to serving his community and improving the  legal profession.   I yield the floor.
