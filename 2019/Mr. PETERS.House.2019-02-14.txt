 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero whose  motto should inspire us all: You Never Quit.   Michael Monsoor wrote those words with a permanent marker inside the  hat he wore during his BUDS training in Coronado. The lettering has  faded but, displayed throughout the newly commissioned USS Michael  Monsoor, the hat and its message will continue to inspire sailors for  years to come.   In 2001, Michael enlisted in the Navy and set out to become a Navy  SEAL. An injury derailed his first attempt, but Michael never quit. He  returned, completed basic SEAL training, and was assigned to SEAL Team  Three.   While deployed in Iraq, Michael ran forward, not away, from incoming  gunfire to protect his teammates; and, when the time came, Michael  threw himself upon an enemy grenade to save his team because Michael  never quit.   For his service, he was awarded the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, the  Purple Heart, and the Medal of Honor. His legacy perseveres in the  proud vessel stationed in San Diego.   Fair winds and following seas to the sailors who will call the USS  Michael Monsoor their home, and may we all never quit.                            ____________________
