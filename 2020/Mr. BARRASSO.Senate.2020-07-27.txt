 Mr. President, at the 108th Wyoming State Fair, Senator  Enzi and I will have the pleasure of introducing Brad Boner as one of  the 2020 inductees of the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. He is a man  of honesty, hard work, and strong leadership. I am proud to say Mr.  Boner exemplifies the ideals of the Wyoming way of life through his  immense contributions to Wyoming agriculture.   Mr. Boner has demonstrated his deep-rooted commitment to the Wyoming  community and, above all, his family. He is supported by his wife  Laurie and three children, Braden, Meghan, and Ryan. After graduating  from the University of Wyoming with an ag business degree, Brad  returned to Glenrock, WY, where he still ranches at the M Diamond Angus  Ranch alongside his two brothers, Rob and Jeff, and their father, Bob.   Mr. Boner's involvement in agriculture goes far beyond production. In  fact, his dedication and passion for the industry are evident through  his active involvement in both cattle and sheep industries on local,  State, and national levels. Brad is the current American Sheep Industry  Association secretary and treasurer, as well as president of both the  Wyoming Wool Growers and Wyoming Angus Association. Brad has served in  various capacities whenever he has been called upon, often sacrificing  valuable time on his home ranch. Brad serves as the supervisor of the  Converse County Conservation District, Wyoming Animal Damage Control  Board, and American Sheep Industry ``Let it Grow'' committee. Brad's  dedication to the State and the industry has not gone unnoticed. In  2014, he was recognized as a University of Wyoming College of  Agriculture ``Outstanding Alumni.''   In addition to serving in many capacities to the benefit of Wyoming's  sheep ranching community, Brad steps up and serves as an articulate  spokesman on moving the sheep industry forward. One of the most  noteworthy accomplishments is Brad's active role in forming the  Mountain States Lamb Cooperative, including serving as MSLC's first  chairman and current chairman.   Mr. Boner is not only a leader in Wyoming's strong agriculture  community, but a wonderful mentor to the youth across our State. He  believes sharing his love for agriculture with students is the best way  to ensure the continuation of this great industry for generations to  come. I would agree. I think that the greatest accomplishment is the  mentorship that we can provide to the young folks of this country, and  this is exactly what Mr. Boner continues to do. Through the Future  Cattle Producers of Wyoming program, he donates a heifer to a student  applicant that wants to learn about the industry. This program assists  students in becoming involved in cattle production and helps them  establish their own herds.   In addition to assisting many students on the agriculture front, for  more than 30 years, Brad has dedicated his time to his community by  refereeing basketball games from middle school to intermural college  games. He also helped coach the boys and girls traveling teams to  support his children. As Peter Camino, former president of the Wyoming  Wool Growers Association, observed, ``He has worked diligently to  solidify a future not only for himself, but the future of generations  to follow.''   Brad's humble character and dedication to agriculture have truly made  an impact and helped grow our agriculture community. I think I speak  for many when I say I am truly grateful for his leadership,  contributions, and caring demeanor that has so graciously blessed our  State in many ways.   With Brad Boner's constant diligence to improve and impact his  community, it is with my great honor to induct him into the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame. He represents every positive attribute of a  leader in Wyoming agriculture and the Code of the West. He has  represented Wyoming's interests with dedication and honor. It is  because of people like him that the agricultural community in Wyoming  has a bright and productive future. My wife Bobbi joins me in  congratulating the outstanding individual, Brad Boner, who is a 2020  inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
