 Madam Speaker, it is my honor to rise and celebrate the  life of one of the greatest Florida men to have ever lived: Lewis Bear.   Lewis was a legend for all times. He was a prolific businessman and  an even more prolific philanthropist. Lewis was CEO of Florida's oldest  privately held company, the Lewis Bear Company. It was started by his  grandfather in 1876. Lewis grew this small family grocery distribution  business to one of Florida's largest beer distributors. If you have  cracked open a beer in my district, there is a pretty good chance that  Lewis moved it.   Lewis' generosity did not stop with libations. Through the Lewis Bear  Family Foundation, he donated tens of millions of dollars to local  organizations and charities, including hospitals and nonprofits focused  on curing childhood cancer. He single-handedly protected the Deepwater  Horizon oil spill settlement funds for northwest Florida and saw that  the money was used for lasting economic development.   I know that Lewis will be sorely missed by our family and by his  family, especially by his wife, Belle, and their three children: Lewis,  Cindi, and David.   Northwest Florida will never be the same without Lewis Bear. We are  certainly grateful that we had my friend for 82 years.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans don't know a single Syrian, and so people  watching this debate might wonder, how has it come to be that Syria has  become the great platform of great power competition in the world?   It begins in 2011, during the Arab Spring, when Assad, who is  undeniably a madman and a despot, opens fire on his own people  protesting. Then part of the Syrian Army defects; they engage in  warfare against Assad, and all of a sudden, they have a whole lot of  weapons and money being sent from the rich gulf monarchies, through  Jordan, into Syria.    So Iran is not just going to watch this. Assad is their ally. They  activate Hezbollah, they then invade Syria. So now you have Jordan, the  gulf monarchies, Iran.   But wait, Russia is pitching their vision of the world as a regime  preservation force, whether you are Maduro or Assad. So they get  involved.   What do they get for their time?   A warm-water port in the Eastern Mediterranean.   So we have got Russia, the gulf monarchies. Israel starts to get  worried about Hezbollah and Iran, so Israel cuts a deal with Russia to  keep Iran out of southern Syria.   If it doesn't get any worse than that, now all of a sudden, you have  got the Kurds who declare war on Syria, and it makes it a little messy  that the Kurds are also in conflict with Turkiye, which is a NATO ally.   Then somehow the United States in 2015, says, you know what? We need  to get involved in this mess in Syria.   Since we have been there, we have seen Americans die. We have seen  tens of billions of dollars wasted.   What is hilarious about the 2001 AUMF--that the neo-conservatives  wave around like some permission slip for every neo-conservative  fantasy of turning an Arabian desert into a Jeffersonian democracy--is  that that very 2001 AUMF would justify attacking the people that we are  fighting against and the people we are funding because both have ties  to al-Qaida and, of course, the 2001 AUMF dealt with al-Qaida.   All this talk about a reemergence of ISIS; I would encourage my  colleagues to go read the inspector general's report of the last  quarter that indicates that ISIS is not a threat to the homeland. And  with the Turks conducting operations in Syria against ISIS, with Assad  and Russia having every incentive to create pressure on ISIS, I do not  believe that what stands between a caliphate and not a caliphate are  the 900 Americans who have been sent to this hellscape with no  definition of victory, with no clear objective, and purely existing as  a vestige to the regime change failed foreign policies of multiple  former Presidents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my patriotic colleague, Mr. Zinke of Montana,  gave up the game when he said ISIS will never be gone. So, presumably,  the position of those holding that viewpoint is that we have to stay in  Syria forever, maybe make it the 51st State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms.  Greene), a member of the Homeland Security Committee and the House  Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, before yielding to my colleague, I would  observe that we have done a lot for the Kurds: $1.5 billion. We can  love the Kurds, but it is not a marriage. It is not until death do we  part. It seems as though the Kurds have made book with Assad and that  that would provide a structure for them to continue to exist.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mills), a patriotic American who served in our military, who served in  Iraq and Syria, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and my  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats alike have been  citing the 2001 AUMF. It is important to note that there are Americans  fighting in Syria today who were not born when the 2011 AUMF was  approved. About 9 out of every 10 of us in the House of Representatives  weren't here to vote on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, Syria is such a mess. We are sometimes  funding both sides in the same battle.  [[Page H1178]]    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an L.A. Times piece titled: ``In  Syria, militias armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA.''                    [From the L.A. Times, Mar. 27, 2016]   In Syria, Militias Armed by the Pentagon Fight Those Armed by the CIA               (By Nabih Bulos, W.J. Hennigan, Brian Bennett)         Syrian militias armed by different parts of the U.S. war       machine have begun to fight each other on the plains between       the besieged city of Aleppo and the Turkish border,       highlighting how little control U.S. intelligence officers       and military planners have over the groups they have financed       and trained in the bitter five-year-old civil war.        The fighting has intensified over the last two months, as       CIA-armed units and Pentagon-armed ones have repeatedly shot       at each other while maneuvering through contested territory       on the northern outskirts of Aleppo, U.S. officials and rebel       leaders have confirmed.        In mid-February, a CIA-armed militia called Fursan al Haq,       or Knights of Righteousness, was run out of the town of       Marea, about 20 miles north of Aleppo, by Pentagon-backed       Syrian Democratic Forces moving in from Kurdish-controlled       areas to the east.        ``Any faction that attacks us, regardless from where it       gets its support, we will fight it,'' Maj. Fares Bayoush, a       leader of Fursan al Haq, said in an interview.        Rebel fighters described similar clashes in the town of       Azaz, a key transit point for fighters and supplies between       Aleppo and the Turkish border, and on March 3 in the Aleppo       neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsud.        The attacks by one U.S.-backed group against another come       amid continued heavy fighting in Syria and illustrate the       difficulty facing U.S. efforts to coordinate among dozens of       armed groups that are trying to overthrow the government of       President Bashar Assad, fight the Islamic State militant       group and battle one another all at the same time.        ``It is an enormous challenge,'' said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-      Burbank), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence       Committee, who described the clashes between U.S.-supported       groups as ``a fairly new phenomenon.''        ``It is part of the three-dimensional chess that is the       Syrian battlefield,'' he said.        The area in northern Syria around Aleppo, the country's       second-largest city, features not only a war between the       Assad government and its opponents, but also periodic battles       against Islamic State militants, who control much of eastern       Syria and also some territory to the northwest of the city,       and long-standing tensions among the ethnic groups that       inhabit the area, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen.        ``This is a complicated, multi-sided war where our options       are severely limited,'' said a U.S. official, who wasn't       authorized to speak publicly on the matter. ``We know we need       a partner on the ground. We can't defeat ISIL without that       part of the equation, so we keep trying to forge those       relationships.'' ISIL is an acronym for Islamic State.        President Obama this month authorized a new Pentagon plan       to train and arm Syrian rebel fighters, relaunching a program       that was suspended in the fall after a string of embarrassing       setbacks which included recruits being ambushed and handing       over much of their U.S.-issued ammunition and trucks to an Al       Qaeda affiliate.        Amid the setbacks, the Pentagon late last year deployed       about 50 special operations forces to Kurdish-held areas in       northeastern Syria to better coordinate with local militias       and help ensure U.S.-backed rebel groups aren't fighting one       another. But such skirmishes have become routine.        Last year, the Pentagon helped create a new military       coalition, the Syrian Democratic Forces. The goal was to arm       the group and prepare it to take territory away from the       Islamic State in eastern Syria and to provide information for       U.S. airstrikes.        The group is dominated by Kurdish outfits known as People's       Protection Units or YPG. A few Arab units have joined the       force in order to prevent it from looking like an invading       Kurdish army, and it has received air-drops of weapons and       supplies and assistance from U.S. Special Forces.        Gen. Joseph Votel, now commander of U.S. Special Operations       Command and the incoming head of Central Command, said this       month that about 80 percent of the fighters in the Syrian       Democratic Forces were Kurdish. The U.S. backing for a       heavily Kurdish armed force has been a point of tension with       the Turkish government, which has a long history of crushing       Kurdish rebellions and doesn't want to see Kurdish units       control more of its southern border.        The CIA, meanwhile, has its own operations center inside       Turkey from which it has been directing aid to rebel groups       in Syria, providing them with TOW antitank missiles from       Saudi Arabian weapons stockpiles.        While the Pentagon's actions are part of an overt effort by       the U.S. and its allies against Islamic State, the CIA's       backing of militias is part of a separate covert U.S. effort       aimed at keeping pressure on the Assad government in hopes of       prodding the Syrian leader to the negotiating table.        At first, the two different sets of fighters were primarily       operating in widely separated areas of Syria--the Pentagon-      backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeastern part of       the country and the CIA-backed groups farther west. But over       the last several months, Russian airstrikes against anti-      Assad fighters in northwestern Syria have weakened them. That       created an opening which allowed the Kurdish-led groups to       expand their zone of control to the outskirts of Aleppo,       bringing them into more frequent conflict with the CIA-backed       outfits.        ``Fighting over territory in Aleppo demonstrates how       difficult it is for the U.S. to manage these really localized       and in some cases entrenched conflicts,'' said Nicholas A.       Heras, an expert on the Syrian civil war at the Center for a       New American Security, a think tank in Washington.       ``Preventing clashes is one of the constant topics in the       joint operations room with Turkey.''        Over the course of the Syrian civil war, the town of Marea       has been on the front line of Islamic State's attempts to       advance across Aleppo province toward the rest of northern       Syria.        On Feb. 18, the Syrian Democratic Forces attacked the town.       A fighter with the Suqour Al-Jabal brigade, a group with       links to the CIA, said intelligence officers of the U.S.-led       coalition fighting Islamic State know their group has clashed       with the Pentagon-trained militias.        ``The MOM knows we fight them,'' he said, referring to the       joint operations center in southern Turkey, using an       abbreviation for its name in Turkish, Musterek Operasyon       Merkezi. ``We'll fight all who aim to divide Syria or harm       its people.'' The fighter spoke on condition of anonymity.        Marea is home to many of the original Islamist fighters who       took up arms against Assad during the Arab Spring in 2011. It       has long been a crucial way station for supplies and fighters       coming from Turkey into Aleppo.        ``Attempts by Syrian Democratic Forces to take Marea was a       great betrayal and was viewed as a further example of a       Kurdish conspiracy to force them from Arab and Turkmen       lands,'' Heras said.        The clashes brought the U.S. and Turkish officials to       ``loggerheads,'' he added. After diplomatic pressure from the       U.S., the militia withdrew to the outskirts of the town as a       sign of good faith, he said.        But continued fighting among different U.S.-backed groups       may be inevitable, experts on the region said.        ``Once they cross the border into Syria, you lose a       substantial amount of control or ability to control their       actions,'' Jeffrey White, a former Defense Intelligence       Agency official, said in a telephone interview. ``You       certainly have the potential for it becoming a larger problem       as people fight for territory and control of the northern       border area in Aleppo.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Luna), a veteran and also a military spouse of one of our  brave patriots who fought in Syria.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to my remaining time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues how many more  remaining speakers they have and are they prepared to close?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, much of the discussion today has revolved around whether  or not withdrawing from Syria will ignite some new ISIS caliphate. We  have pointed out time and again to inspector general reports saying  that is unlikely.   I am not entirely sure that our having troops in Syria deters ISIS  more than it is a recruiting tool for ISIS.   Moreover, President Trump said that if Russia wanted to kill ISIS,  then we should let them. I think there is wisdom in that.   Both Assad and Turkiye are in stronger positions today to put  downward pressure on ISIS. Maybe if we weren't giving weapons to people  shooting at Assad, then Assad would have every incentive to be able to  engage ISIS in a way to ensure that it doesn't come back.   We have to also acknowledge Syria and Iraq are the two countries on  the planet Earth where we have done the most to fund ISIS. We give  weapons to these so-called moderate rebels--which I actually thought  was an oxymoron--and it turns out that they are not so moderate.  Sometimes the rebels we fund to go fight Assad turn around and raise  the ISIS flag.   So it is quite silly to be saying we have to withdraw to stop ISIS  when it is our very presence in Syria in some cases that has been the  best gift to ISIS.   There are groups like al-Nusra and associated entities that are like  our frenemies when they are in Syria, and then they cross over the  border into Iraq and they become full-fledged jihadists posing a so- called threat to the homeland. There are 1,500 different groups in  Syria, so today's friend is tomorrow's ISIS.   There is no real clear delineation as to what the enduring defeat of  ISIS means.   Do we have to keep 900 Americans in Syria until the last heartbeat  stops of the last person who holds some sympathy for ISIS?   I would certainly hope not. It would mean we would have to be there  forever.   Israel has made their deal with Russia to be protected, the Kurds  have made their peace with Assad to be protected, and what we see among  this quagmire is that there is really not a role for the United States  of America in Syria.   We are not a Middle Eastern power. We have tried this time and again  to build a democracy out of sand, blood, and Arab militias, and time  and again the work we do does not reduce chaos. Oftentimes it causes  chaos, the very chaos that then subsequently leads to terrorism.   My colleagues and my staff who have served in Syria and my  constituents tell me that often these anti-ISIS raids are just raids of  local thugs and drug dealers who have some cousin that is in ISIS, and  it is not appropriate to put Americans at risk.   Often our Americans are guarding these oil fields where the Iranians  are sending Kamikaze drones, and I am shocked that we have not had  escalatory accidents or even more casualties for our U.S.  servicemembers.    So if this is all one big Georgetown School of Foreign Service essay  exam about great power competition in Syria, then you go tell that to  the parents of the Americans who have to sleep tonight in Syria, and  who have to guard oil fields with Iranian drones coming at them, that  they are necessary to preserve the balance of power. That is not true.   The Kurds have an opportunity to pave their path. Let's pave ours.  And if we are so worried about threats to the homeland, how about we  actually focus on our true point of vulnerability, which is not the  emergence of some caliphate, it is the fact that terrorists are  crossing our southern border on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We  seem far less concerned about that than we undeniably should be.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution to  reassert Congress' power to speak on these matters of war and peace. So  often we come to the floor and we debate frivolities. This is one of  the most important things we can be talking about: how we use the  credibility of our fellow Americans, how we spend America's treasure,  and how we spill the blood of our bravest patriots.   We have stained the deserts in the Middle East with enough American  blood. It is time to bring our servicemembers home.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
