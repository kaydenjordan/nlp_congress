 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to celebrate the exceptional  leadership and commitment to service by Phyllis J. Edwards, who I  warmly refer to as Director Edwards. She has dedicated her work to  protect and advocate for the underrepresented communities within  Michigan's 13th District Strong, specifically our senior citizens in  Detroit.   Director Edwards was the executive director of Bridging Communities  in southwest Detroit for over a decade, and prior to that, she was the  social service program manager for more than 30 years within the Wayne  County Department of Health and Human Services.   Her work and proactive community involvement has made an immeasurable  impact on the lives of countless residents. As a longtime Detroit  resident, her efforts to improve the quality of life for our seniors  demonstrated her love, commitment, and compassion for community-based  work.   Please join me in recognizing her many outstanding contributions to  Michigan's 13th District Strong as we wish her well on the next chapter  of her life.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I would thank Chairmen Quigley, Meeks, and  McGovern and their staffs for working with me on this critical  amendment and for their leadership throughout this process.   I also thank the incredible Congresswoman Lee for joining me here  today to speak in support of this critical policy change, and, of  course, Congressman Crawford who submitted this change as a Republican- led bipartisan amendment to the FSGG appropriations bill in 2017 and  has been a great advocate on this issue over the years.   This is an amendment that is critical, and it builds on more than a  decade of efforts by bipartisan Members of the House and Senate and the  farm industry leaders across the country.   As Cubans face one of the most painful crises in three decades,  forcing tens of thousands of Cubans to spend long hours each day  waiting in lines in hopes of finding food, our amendment would provide  temporary relief to them as well as U.S. farm exporters by suspending  enforcement for 1 year of the prohibition and extending credit to Cuban  food buyers.   This amendment makes sense for two reasons.   First, the Cuban people are contending with significant food  shortages, as I mentioned. By allowing Cuban importers to buy U.S. food  products on credit, we can help ease the suffering of everyday Cubans  and build good will between our peoples. Simply put, it is the most  humane thing we can do right now and the right thing to do.   Second, the amendment would also help American ag producers as well  by removing trade barriers that put them at a competitive disadvantage  with countries thousands of miles away, like China and Vietnam.   For my home State of Michigan, and many others across the country,  this amendment effectively opens up a new market of about 11 million  people for our farmers and for their exports.   I know Michigan's director of Agriculture and Rural Development, Gary  McDowell, noted that our State's farmers seek great opportunities for  products such as dry beans, apples, dairy products, and poultry that  are major staples of the Cuban diet.   This amendment is good for our Cuban people, as well as good for the  American farmers, and the right thing to do.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to please support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I said, this amendment would help alleviate  the suffering of the Cuban people. It also is very important to note  that this is identical to a bipartisan Republican-led amendment  submitted just a few years ago.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, while I understand and share some of the  concerns, the reality is the embargoes aren't working and have failed  to achieve any of its aims for over a half a century.   I think my colleagues, all of us, at least agree that there is no  more principled reason to engage than to ease the suffering of the  Cuban people who are currently again suffering from huge amounts of  food shortages.   I think it is critically important to understand there is trade  happening now, but in cash. This would again allow the access to credit  to be able to do it in a way that allows farmers in not only Michigan  but across the country who are asking us to help them do more and  export and allow them to address some of the food shortages that help  the Cuban people so much more.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons I urge my colleagues to please vote  ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Chair, this is only about food. The Members in  opposition are claiming to stand with the people of Cuba, but this is  our opportunity to support the Cuban people and help them right now.  When we take this opportunity to vote ``yes,'' we show that the U.S.  isn't the enemy of the Cuban people during their time of need. At the  same time, we are helping our local farmers right here. Vote ``yes.''
