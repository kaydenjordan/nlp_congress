 Mr. President, I rise to commend Rev. Joseph Baker  of St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church for his lifetime of  service to the Chattahoochee River Valley and the State of Georgia. For  the past 30 years, Pastor Baker has been a beacon of hope and service  for members of the communities he has served since answering the call  to preach in 1993. After relocating to Atlanta from Orlando to continue  his higher education journey, Pastor Joseph Baker served as senior  pastor of Saint Paul AME Church in Canton, GA, and both Saint Mary's  AME and Townsley Chapel AME Churches in Savannah, GA. Since July 2013,  Pastor Baker has served the Columbus community as the 52nd pastor of  St. James AME Church at the local, conference, and episcopal levels. He  also serves as dean of the Southwest Georgia Annual Conference Board of  Examiners and as a member of the Southwest Georgia Annual Conference  Board of Trustees, Support of Presiding Elders and Ministerial  Classification.   A product of the Suwannee County School System, the University of  Central Florida in Orlando, and Turner Theological Seminary at the  Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, Pastor Baker  continues to find ways to open doors of opportunity for others through  access to education. For example, Pastor Baker established a  partnership with Columbus Technical College to offer GED studies at St.  James AME.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend and recognize St. James AME  pastor Rev. Joseph Baker for a lifetime of service on behalf of the  State of Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend Moises Velez of  Macon, GA, for his years of service to Georgia's Latino community.   Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Velez founded ``Que Pasa,'' the first  Spanish newspaper in the Macon community. Mr. Velez's vision of keeping  newly arrived immigrants informed about vital services available to  them in Middle Georgia and across the State quickly transformed the  newspaper into a trusted news source for the Latino community on  important issues like health care, immigration, and education. ``Que  Pasa'' keeps the growing Latino community in Middle Georgia informed  about news and events statewide. Mr. Velez's success led to his  recognition as one of Georgia's 50 most influential Latinos by the  Georgia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 2022. Mr. Velez is a  representation of the extraordinary contributions of Georgia's Latino  community.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend and recognize Moises Velez for  his contributions to Georgia's Latino community and years of service to  the Macon community.                            ____________________
