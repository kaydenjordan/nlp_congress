 Mr. Chairman, it has been an incredible honor to  serve the people of the great State of Georgia and the 10th District  for the last four terms. This is my last time addressing you as fellow  colleagues here from the House floor within these hallowed Halls of  Congress.   There is no question the history and the marvel of this place, our  Nation's capital, is something that never ceases to amaze me. I cannot  express how deeply grateful I am to have had the tremendous privilege  to represent the 10th District of Georgia among the ranks of so many  incredible men and women before me and to play a small role in shaping  our Nation's history.   With God as my guide, I have set out in the last 8 years to not only  represent Him well but to represent Georgia's 10th District and our  country well.   I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to extend a heartfelt  gratitude to many in my life who are so important and who have made  these last 8 years so meaningful; certainly, my wife, Dee Dee.   We all know this is not an easy place for family, and I cannot  express to her the deep love and appreciation I have for the incredible  support that she has given me. Our two daughters, Anna and Sara, their  husbands, and our four grandchildren as well, have stood by me, and us,  through all of this so much, and I love and appreciate them more than  words can say.   Our staff, both here in D.C., and in Georgia, have been among the  best here in Congress. I say a heartfelt thank you for serving our  constituents and for fighting our battles here in Washington with such  integrity and honor. What a team you have been. You certainly have made  me look better than I am, and I am deeply appreciative of that.   My colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, it has been an honor  to serve, and I particularly express my gratitude and love for those  fellow men and women within the Freedom Caucus whom I have come to love  tremendously. It has been such an honor to serve with each of them, as  well.   Obviously, without the guidance of God and my faith and those around  me, we certainly would not have been able to accomplish many of the  things we have been able to do here. But as a pastor prior to coming to  Congress, my focus here so much has been on moral matters; things like  life, faith, and family, protecting the rights of Americans.  Specifically, the right to freely worship without fear of intimidation  of harassment has constantly been on the forefront of my life and  continues to be. And although I am departing from this current post, I  cannot stress enough the importance of those who will be here for the  118th Congress to continue fighting for the repeal of the Johnson  amendment.   We all know that the First Amendment is for every American citizen,  the right to speak, to uphold those beliefs in the public square. And  certainly those beliefs, the epicenter of it, if you will, is certainly  in churches and the centerpiece of that is in the pulpits. And our  government has no right entering the pulpits of America determining  what can and cannot be said. So I urge my colleagues to continue  fighting that good battle.   Another piece of legislation that I introduced my very first year  here was the sanctity of human life, which sought to declare that the  most fundamental right that we have is the right to life. And I have  introduced this bill, in fact, every Congress, every session since we  have been here, and I look forward to being able to pass that on to  those who continue the fight.   While it has been of utmost importance to focus on ending abortion, I  also felt it is important to memorialize the 63 million lives that have  been lost. That is why I introduced a bill to instruct that the United  States flag be flown at half-staff on January 22 of each year in honor  of the unborn who have lost their lives.   If we ever forget history, it is bound to repeat itself, and if we,  God willing, see the end of abortion, we need to likewise remember  those who have given their lives, the innocent, in this struggle, in  this battle.   At the heart of it all, it is my prayer that our country will see a  spiritual  [[Page H9732]]  awakening. I am convinced we can't resolve all the problems in this  country by passing another piece of legislation or throwing another  trillion dollars at a problem. We need the good hands of the Almighty  God to guide us through these days, and we need a spiritual awakening.  That certainly is my utmost prayer.   Mr. Speaker, I wish each of my colleagues continued success here in  Congress and a Merry Christmas to each one.                            ____________________
