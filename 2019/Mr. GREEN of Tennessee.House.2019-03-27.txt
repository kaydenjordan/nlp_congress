 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration  of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a  commonsense bill to protect the smallest and most vulnerable among us,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.

I am proud to stand with President Trump in defense of our ally,  Israel. I am grateful he chose to recognize the Golan Heights as a part  of Israel and proud we now officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's  capital.                            ____________________
