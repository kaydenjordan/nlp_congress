 Madam Speaker, the voters of Virginia sent a  message 2 weeks ago because they were scared to death of the  continuation of these radical Biden policies, the radical policies of  Governor Northam in Virginia, scared to death of the continuation of  that that was represented by the potential election of Terry McAuliffe.  Did the Democrat majority hear that message? No.   When this phony infrastructure bill is implemented, that was passed 2  weeks ago, we will have $30 trillion in debt, which equates to $90,000  per American.   For my friends across the aisle, who are economically illiterate and  not good at math, the $30 trillion worth of debt is a 3 with 13 zeros.  Please don't tell them what comes after a trillion.   But it is not just the spending of this $2 trillion to $4 trillion.  They don't even know what it will cost because we don't have a score.   It is 150 new programs. It is growing the welfare state. It is trying  to get more people dependent on the Democrats for their sustenance,  separating work from income, massive amnesty for tens of millions of  illegal aliens in our country, and hundreds of billions of dollars for  the Green New Deal.   This is the Bernie-AOC budget forcing us into electric vehicles. It  will massively increase utility, gas, and fuel prices. It will  massively increase inflation, as we continue to have too many dollars  facing too few supplies, too few goods, too few services, as a result  of their policies.   But they are tone-deaf economically. They want to bankrupt the future  of our country with this massive, continued spending. It is bad for  America, and everyone should vote ``no.''
