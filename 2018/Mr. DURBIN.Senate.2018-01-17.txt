 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Flake from  Arizona and Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, for bringing this timely  issue to the floor.   We are facing an attack on an American institution--an attack on our  freedom of the press. Sadly, the President is making an award of some  kind to what he considers to be corrupt media, but I am afraid, once  again, his actions will cast a shadow over our constitutional  commitment to the basic freedoms we enjoy in America.   We all know why freedom of the press was included in the Bill of  Rights: because the Founding Fathers--those who crafted those critical  words that have led us for more than two centuries--believed there  should be an accountability, accountability when it came to the  government, its actions, and to public officials. That accountability  sometimes is painful, as Senator Flake has acknowledged. Many of us, as  Members of the Senate, House, and other political roles, really hate to  receive certain phone calls and questions from members of the press,  but it is part of our responsibility, as public servants, as public  officials, to be accountable to the public. That is what freedom of the  press is about. I think that is the part that troubles and worries and  pains the President the most; that he will be held accountable for the  things he has said and the things he has done.   This notion of ``fake news,'' unfortunately, is a phrase which is  being used, as Senator Flake noted, by despots and authoritarians  around the world to try to silence critics and to silence the press in  their countries. We cannot allow this regimen of ``fake news'' and  ``alternative facts'' and words like those to diminish our commitment  to the basic constitutional protection of freedom of the press. It is  essential to the future of our democracy.                                 Immigration    On January 11, last Thursday, I was invited to a meeting at the White  House to discuss the issue of immigration. Sadly, at that meeting,  there were things said by the President and those who were with him on  the issue which I believe constituted an attack on another basic  element of American history: the history of immigration.   We are a nation of immigrants. That diversity that has come to these  shores from all across the world is a diversity which makes us strong.  We consider our land of origin, whatever it may be, but we love the  land we live in. That was what immigration has meant to us and to  previous generations for so many years.   Words spoken by the President at that meeting were stunning and, in  some respects, disgusting to think that the President would make the  comments he did. For the sake of our Congressional Record, for the  Senate, and for those who are watching, I will not repeat the  President's words. They have been reported in the press, but I want to  go to the heart of his criticism.   He was raising a basic question as to whether the United States  should continue to be open to immigration from all around the world. I  believe we should. Americans believe we should. We know that men and  women, even of humble circumstances, who come to the United States  determined to make a life, to make a future, and to help their families  have made a profound difference in our country, in terms of its past  and its future, and they have come from every corner of the world.   Senator Lindsey Graham was at that same meeting on January 11. He  spoke up when the President uttered those infamous words which have  been reported, and he noted that when it came to his family, they came  from one of the countries the President described, and they came with  little or nothing to offer, but they wanted to be part of America. They  came here and made a business, made a life, made a future, and brought  to the Senate an extraordinary Member representing the State of South  Carolina. Many of us can tell the same story.   My mother was an immigrant to this country. She was brought here in  1911 at the age of 2 from Lithuania. Lithuania was not exactly a  prosperous nation in those times. It was under the thumb of a Russian  czar, and it is one of the reasons my family left. One thing my  grandmother carried with her on that trip, and I still have today, was  a Roman Catholic prayer book, written in the Lithuanian language, which  had been banned by the Russian Government. She secreted this away in  her luggage and brought it to the United States because she knew, and  we know, that there is freedom of religion in this country, and no  government was going to stop her from saying her prayers in her own  language. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is  America's story.   What the President said in the White House last week did not  recognize that fundamental truth; that people just like my mother and  my grandmother and just like Lindsey Graham's parents came to this  country not because they were engineers, Ph.D.s, or wealthy people,  they came here with the desire to build a life and to build a nation,  and they have done it.   When we hear all this talk about merit immigration, let's have merit  selection of the people who are coming to these shores--of course,  there are certain experts we bring in with certain visas to fill needs  in business and research, but, by and large, we bring to this country  people who are desperate to be part of our future, and we also bring  people who want to be part of their family.   We hear this phrase, ``linked migration''; that somehow or another,  if we bring one immigrant in, they are going to bring in 100, and some  of them may not be desirable. What we find overwhelmingly is just the  opposite is true. It is family unification. It is building the strength  of a family. Isn't that fundamental to who we are as Americans?   I know, in my family and many others, relatives who came in from  other places really strengthened our family unit and gave us a chance  to help one another have a chance to succeed.   Now we face a critical moment--a critical moment on the issue of  immigration. I listened to the Republican leader come to the floor  today, Senator McConnell, and when he speaks of DACA and the Dreamers,  he uses the words ``illegal immigration.'' Technically, I suppose it is  illegal. Those we are talking about are undocumented, but we have drawn  a distinction over the years as to what happened to these young people  and why they should be seen differently.    They were brought to the United States as infants and toddlers and  children--at best, teenagers--who had no voice in whether they were  coming to this country. Did they break the law by overstaying a visa or  crossing the border? Well, technically, of course they did, but should  they be held culpable today? Should we deport these young people or  give them a chance to be part of our future? This is not some idle  philosophical discussion. This is a discussion made real by this  administration, the Trump administration.   It was September 5, of last year, when this President announced he  was going to repeal DACA--the program started by President Obama to  protect these young people living in the United States. Seven hundred  eighty thousand of them have enrolled, and President Trump said, as of  March 5, 2018, that program will be ended. Then he turned and  challenged the U.S. Congress: Pass a law. If you don't like what I have  done with this Executive order, pass a law.   So here we are, over 4 months later, and the question has to be asked  of the Republican leaders in the House and  [[Page S219]]  the Senate: What have you done to answer the President's challenge? The  answer, quite honestly, is precious little, if anything.   The Republican leader comes to the floor today and says: There is no  hurry. We can get to this later. It will not expire until March 5. What  he ignores is the obvious: 15,000 protected young people lost that  protection during this period since September 5--122 a day are losing  that protection.   Fortunately, last week, a California court stepped in and said: Stop  taking away the protection of DACA from these young people. So we have  a temporary stay, being challenged by the Trump administration, which  protects these young people for now, but that protection could end in a  court decision tomorrow. That is the reality of life for young people.   Yesterday, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we asked the Secretary  of the Department of Homeland Security: Do you believe the President  can extend his March 5 deadline for the end of DACA?   She said: No; the President said he doesn't have that authority.   Well, I will trust her statement and her judgment on that, but it  further should put to rest this argument made by Senator McConnell that  we have all the time in the world to deal with this issue.   Let me tell you, on March 5--the deadline imposed by the President.  As of March 5, horrible things will happen to innocent people. One  thousand young people a day, protected by DACA, will lose their  protection. I had one of them at the hearing yesterday. She is a young  woman who has used her extraordinary skills to apply to medical school,  and Loyola University Stritch College of Medicine accepted DACA- protected young people for the first time. There are 28 of them in  their ranks.   She wants to be a doctor. She has helped people in underserved areas  throughout her young career, but we know--everyone knows--that becoming  a doctor means serving a residency, working those long hours to learn  what it means to face clients or patients in a clinical setting. To  become a resident, you need to be employed to take that job.   If this young woman, who has devoted so many years of her life to her  dream of being a doctor, loses the protection of DACA, she cannot apply  for residency. She is finished. There will be no further progress in  her medical education. That will happen, starting on March 5, to 1,000  young people a day. So I would say to Senator McConnell, the Republican  leader, there is a sense of urgency. We can't put this off.   The good news is, six U.S. Senators--three of us on the Democratic  side and three on the Republican side--have been doing what no other  committee has done, no other Senators have done. We put together a  bipartisan compromise that moves us forward on this DACA issue. It is  something that took 4 months, and they weren't an easy 4 months. They  were difficult. We had to debate some of the hardest issues and come to  an agreement. I ended up giving ground on some things which I wish I  didn't have to, and I am sure those on the Republican side feel the  same way, but that is why we were sent here--weren't we?--Democrats and  Republicans, to find a solution to the problems that face us, and this  is a very real problem.   So now the Republican leader comes to the floor and says: We don't  have time to discuss this. We have to get out of here at the end of the  week. Well, I disagree with him. We have enough time to do it.   Take a look at this empty Senate floor and tell me we don't have  enough time to take care of the DACA issue. Tell me we don't have an  opportunity to come to this floor and bring the Senators here and do  what we were elected to do--to debate this issue, to vote on this  issue, to solve a problem in America. This empty Chamber is testimony  to the fact that the Senate has done precious little for the last year  and plans to do just about the same during the course of this year.   I am proud to be a Member of the Senate, but I will tell you, I was  prouder in the days when we actually debated measures on the floor, we  ended up passing legislation to deal with America's challenges and  problems, instead of what we face today--an exchange of speeches in an  empty Chamber. So we have work to do.   This morning, I went over to the Department of Defense and met with  Secretary Mattis. I respect him. He is our Secretary of Defense and was  a four-star general in the Marine Corps. The man has served his country  with distinction. He talked about what is going to happen to the budget  of the Department of Defense if Congress doesn't act. We told him we  want to get this job done, but we also said to Secretary Mattis: There  are other elements of this government, there are other issues before us  that need to also be brought forward.   You heard Senator Schumer from New York, the Democratic Senate  leader, come to the floor and turn to Senator McConnell and say: Why is  it always a take-it-or-leave-it when it comes to these measures? Why  aren't we sitting down, on a bipartisan basis, to come up with a good  way to move forward?   It has been 119 days into this fiscal year, and we still don't have a  budget for the United States of America. That is not just embarrassing,  it is scandalous. To think that we have over $1 trillion that needs to  be debated and spent, and we haven't been able to do it, and we are  one-third through this fiscal year. The net result of that, of course,  is to waste precious taxpayer dollars and the energy of our elected  officials who want to be applying that energy to solving problems  rather than the problems Congress creates.   We can do this, and we can do it on a bipartisan basis. Senator  Lindsey Graham and I, along with four of our colleagues, have a measure  we are going to present to the U.S. Senate. The purpose of that measure  is to make it clear we are ready to debate, we are ready to move  forward, and we are ready to solve this problem that faces hundreds of  thousands of young people across the United States of America.   Some can call it illegal immigration, as Senator McConnell has,  others have called it amnesty. Whatever they wish to call it, 80  percent of Americans believe we can solve this problem.   As you walk around the Capitol and the Capitol buildings, you will  see young people who may step forward to introduce themselves. Many of  them have never been to Washington before. I met one yesterday who had  driven for 35 hours to come here. Why was she standing in the corridors  of the Dirksen Building on Capitol Hill? She is a Dreamer. She is  protected by DACA. Her whole life is hanging in the balance as to  whether this Congress will actually do something to solve the problem.   She and others have come forward to challenge us. We should accept  that challenge, and we should meet it this week. We should say to  President Trump: We have met the challenge that you put forth just 8  days ago, when on Tuesday of last week you said to us: Send me a bill,  and I will sign it. I will take the political heat. And don't take a  lot of time to do it.   We met that challenge with this bipartisan measure that we proposed,  and now we challenge others on the same issue. Come forward with your  proposal. Come forward with your idea. If you don't, at least give us a  chance to present this bipartisan measure, which we have worked on long  and hard, to solve this critical issue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I share the  news that Deacon James William Meeks passed away last Christmas Eve at  his home in South Holland, IL. A longtime resident of the Chicagoland  area, he was 90 years old.   James William Meeks was born and raised in the Mississippi Delta town  of Carrolton. Before moving to Chicago, James worked as a short-order  cook at a hotel in Mississippi. One day, he met a young lady by the  name of Esther  [[Page S248]]  Mae Smith, who also worked in the hotel. They fell in love and, in  1947, married at the courthouse on their lunch break.   When James and Esther migrated north to Chicago, he found work at  Kentile Floors as a forklift operator--a job he would hold for the next  four decades--but his true passion was an unwavering devotion to his  faith. In 1957, James became a deacon at the Shiloh Missionary Baptist  Church and later helped his son, Pastor James T. Meeks, get his start  as a preacher at Salem Baptist Church. Deacon Meeks was a father figure  to the entire community, and his powerful handshake, from years of farm  and manual labor, served as a reminder to the youth at Salem Baptist  that, if they were planning on hanging around street corners, getting  into trouble, he would be watching.   Whether it was at Salem Baptist Church or the streets of Chicago,  Deacon Meeks inspired so many young people to preach and simply do good  deeds. It has been said that, when you heard Deacon Meeks' sermons,  ``you knew that the life that was behind the prayer, matched the words  that were in the prayer.'' As a child, his son James recalled riding in  the car with his family one Sunday morning. They were on their way to  church, when his father noticed a woman stranded on the side of the  road. Without hesitation, Deacon Meeks, in his Sunday suit, pulled over  to lend a helping hand and fixed the woman's car. Grateful for his  kindness, the woman offered Deacon Meeks some money. He politely  declined. James and his siblings began yelling out the window, urging  their father to take the money. When Deacon Meeks got back into the  car, he shared a simple, but powerful message with his children: ``You  don't do everything for money.'' Deacon Meeks was a man of rock-solid  values.   I want to offer my prayers and condolences to Deacon Meeks' wife of  more than 70 years, Esther; their four children; Annie, James, Delores,  William; their 10 grandchildren; 15 great grandchildren; and 1 great- great-grandchild. That is a legacy in which to be proud.   I will close with this: It was said at Deacon Meeks' memorial  service, ``It's lucky to have somebody who makes it hard to say  goodbye.'' Well, it is hard to say goodbye to Deacon Meeks today, but I  count myself lucky to have known him as a friend. Deacon James William  Meeks will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I want to say a few words about a  Chicago icon--and one of the most admired journalists on television-- Joel Weisman. This Friday will be the 40th anniversary of WTTW-Channel  11's longest running show, ``Chicago Tonight: The Week in Review,'' and  it will be Joel's farewell broadcast.   Since 1978, Joel has beamed into Chicago's living rooms to help us  all digest the news of the week. Throughout the series' four decades,  Joel was there every step of the way: Joel has been with WTTW since  1973, starting as its political editor and commentator on ``The Public  News Center.'' A lifelong Chicagoan and graduate of the University of  Illinois and Chicago-Kent College of Law, Joel has dedicated his career  to informing the people of Chicago.   Every Friday night, Joel has welcomed fellow journalists to a  roundtable discussion on the critical topics of the week. Oftentimes  with humor, Joel has been Chicago's self-described ``reporter, editor,  traffic cop, and referee.'' He just has one simple rule: The panelists  have to be nonpartisan and diverse. Today, unfortunately, this is hard  to find on television, but as he said in his retirement announcement,  ``No one in journalism has been given the trust and editorial control  of a show for that length of time.'' There is a reason he has been in  that chair for 40 years. Joel Weisman has class and is a man of  integrity. He insists the show represents just that. Well, I am here  today to say, it absolutely does. Joel Weisman is a true newsman.   Joel Weisman has had an amazing career. Prior to joining WTTW, Joel  worked for the Gary Post-Tribune, the former Chicago American, Chicago  Sun-Times, and was a Midwest correspondent for the Washington Post. His  work earned him Emmy, Peter Lisagor, Jacob Scher, and Associated Press  awards. He has been inducted into the Silver Circle of the Chicago/ Midwest chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and  Sciences. That is not all. Joel Weisman also has been nominated twice  for the Pulitzer Prize for his investigative reporting. If you think  there is nothing more Joel can fit into his incredibly busy schedule,  you are wrong. In addition to being a fulltime journalist, he also runs  a fulltime law practice that specializes in media talent  representation.   I want to congratulate Joel Weisman on his distinguished career and  thank him on behalf of the city he loves for his outstanding work and  service to the Chicagoland area. He loves Chicago, and Chicagoans love  him. Although he is retiring, Joel is not staying out of the political  conversation. He will continue his service to his community and work as  an attorney, focusing on media law. I am heartened that Joel will  remain a powerful voice in the community, and I wish him and his family  all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from  South Carolina. We have worked together for years, mainly on this  issue. I want to tell you that he has demonstrated extraordinary  insight and extraordinary courage time and again. I know we wouldn't  even be standing here in this conversation without him.   Lindsey, thank you. I know some of the challenges that I have put  before you made life more difficult, and I hope you understand that I  always knew you wanted to come to yes, you always wanted to fix this  problem.   One of the things that you said that I would like to share is the  passion we feel on this side of the aisle for the security of America.  This morning, I was  [[Page S259]]  invited for a breakfast with Secretary Mattis at the Department of  Defense. I was happy to vote for his confirmation. He is another  patriot, a man who served as a four-star general in the Marine Corps. I  respect him very much, and I want to help him.   As the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I  know what these dollar figures mean. It isn't just numbers on a page.  We are talking about what Secretary Mattis told us this morning. A  delay, another CR--the fourth CR this year--costs the Pentagon millions  of dollars--millions of dollars to maintain the same spending level  they had last year. That is wasteful.   How many families across America say: I am going to write exactly the  same checks in January 2018 that I wrote in January 2017. That is  mindless, and that is where you are with a CR. We just keep repeating  the same things over and over at great expense.   We owe it to the Department of Defense, we owe it to the men and  women of the military, and we owe it to the people we represent to keep  this Nation safe.   I agree with Senator Graham. We cannot ignore that there are other  things that are priorities and have importance. In the nondefense area,  to think that we would shortchange the Department of State--an agency  of government which you have responsibility for in the Appropriations  Committee--is a shortsighted effort that even Secretary Mattis would be  quick to say makes no sense at all. We should be giving our Department  of State the resources and people they need to make sure we are dealing  at the area of diplomacy as opposed to war. That is just one example.  Add the FBI. Add the Department of Homeland Security. They all need to  be properly funded.   We cannot run the Government of the United States of America--the  strongest and biggest economy in the world, one of the most powerful  nations in the world--lurching from week to week and month to month  without a budget. For goodness' sake, I plead with the Republican  leadership in the House and the Senate, give us something we can work  on together. A good place to start this--look for bipartisanship. There  are Democrats willing to sit down and work with you to solve the  problems. But when we are given a ``take it or leave it'' budget  proposal for 4 weeks at a time, it is a terrible way to run a country.  I hope the leaders come to that same conclusion.   Let me zero in on the issue that brings most of us to the floor  tonight, which was addressed by Senator Graham. I have been at this for  a while, a long while. My goal is to make sure that those who were  brought to this country as children, who grew up in this country and,  as Bob Menendez has said so forcefully and effectively, pledged  allegiance to that flag every morning in the classrooms across  America--I have been fighting for years to give them a chance to be  part of America, the only country many of them have ever known. It has  been a struggle.   When I couldn't pass the Dream Act or get 60 votes in the Senate, I  went to President Obama and begged him to help, and he did. He created  DACA. By Presidential Executive order, he created an opportunity for  ultimately 780,000 young people to step up and get protection from  deportation and the right to legally work in America. It has been an  amazing experience.   As Senator Graham said, it is hard to pick any large population in  this country and not end up with some people who would embarrass you or  some bad apples, but I will tell you consistently, over and over again,  these young people, these Dreamers, these young people protected by  DACA, have shown us over and over again why they have earned our  confidence and trust. They worked so hard to be part of this country.   Those of us who were lucky enough to be born here never went through  what they have gone through--learning that you are undocumented,  realizing the doors are closed automatically no matter how good you are  and how hard you work--and they kept at it. I want to tell you, we  should be proud of them, and we should embrace them as the future of  America because they bring so many talents, skills, and good values to  our country.   With the DACA Program in place and all the people protected, the new  President came in and said: I am going to end it. On September 5 of  last year, he announced that it would end as of March 5 this year, and  as of October 1, they would stop renewing the DACA protection.   What has happened is that 16,000 of these DACA-protected young people  have fallen out of protected status. Luckily, a California court last  week said: Keep protecting them until we resolve some of the issues. So  they have a temporary, momentary protective order that they can turn to  when it comes to this California decision, but there is no certainty of  what happens next.   When I hear Senator McConnell and others come to the floor and say  there is no hurry, I invite them to meet some of these young people. I  met a group in New York. There were about 12 of them in college, DACA- protected. They are working to get through college because they don't  qualify for any program assistance because they are undocumented. As  they went around the room, they said: Senator, we want to each tell you  something.   Five hundred days.   Four hundred and twenty days.   Each one of them was telling me how many days they have left of DACA  protection before they were subject to deportation and could no longer  legally work in America. To say there is no hurry is to overlook the  obvious. These young people are torn apart. Their families are torn  apart because of our lack of action.   Senator Graham and I decided to do something about it, and we invited  some good friends to join us. On the Democratic side, Michael Bennet of  Colorado and Robert Menendez of New Jersey--we have been through this  war before when we worked on comprehensive immigration reform. On the  Republican side, Senator Gardner of Colorado; Senator Flake of Arizona,  who is on the floor; and Senator Graham. And we worked at it for a  long, long time. We had moments that looked like we were going to fall  apart and never reach a conclusion, and we finally came together.   Last Tuesday, a week ago, when the President invited 26 of us to the  White House and made his plea that we do something, we decided to sit  down and do it, and we did. In a matter of 24 to 48 hours, we reached a  final agreement on this bipartisan approach to deal with this issue of  DACA. That is what we presented to the President when we went to the  White House last Thursday.   I couldn't agree with Senator Graham more that the President of last  Tuesday is the one we need again--that President who said to us that  what we are doing is an act of love; that President who said to us:  Send me a bill. I will sign it, and I will take the political heat;  that President who agreed with us that you couldn't do everything in  immigration reform in one bill but you had to divide it. He agreed with  that. I agree with him. That is the way we should move forward.   I hope the President listens to Senator Graham and others in his own  party and steps up and helps us finish this responsibility.   Let me say a word or two about another effort underway. At that  meeting 8 days ago, Tuesday of last week in the White House, there was  a suggestion that the leaders in the Senate and the House, both  parties, should sit down and see if they can come up with an  alternative. That was headed up by Kevin McCarthy of California. I like  him. I don't know him well. I have not worked with him on many things.  But I will tell you he is a positive person. He is trying to come to a  conclusion on something that might work, and we met today in his office  to talk about it. At the meeting was Senator Cornyn of Texas, who is  the whip of the Republican Senators; myself; and Steny Hoyer, the  Democratic whip of the House of Representatives. With us were Gen. John  Kelly and Secretary Nielsen of the Department of Homeland Security. We  met for about an hour and a half. It was the first attempt at a  substantive meeting that we had had since this group started meeting 5  days ago. In the meantime, our staff had met four or five times, but  this was the first time that Senators and Congressmen had sat down  across the table. Needless to say--and no surprise to all of us because  we have been through  [[Page S260]]  this so many times--we really couldn't agree on the basics of how we  were to get started here.    I said to Congressman McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House:  This is hard work. This is heavy lifting. This takes time. People have  to be convinced and have a chance to state their points of view. We  don't have that much time. We are dealing with a deadline of January  19, and that happens to be just around the corner, 2 days away. We are  also dealing with a deadline of March 5, which, sadly, could be a  deadline, if we fail to meet it, that could see many people's lives  changed.   I have continued to meet with this group, but I tell them over and  over: We already have a bill here in the Senate. We have a bipartisan  bill.   We addressed all of the issues that the President raised when we had  our meeting in the White House on Tuesday of last week. This is a  starting point. In fact, I think it is a good end point for us to point  at.   Let me thank Senator Graham for expanding the number of Republican  sponsors. I do the math in the Senate. I have said that, as the whip of  the Senate, I learned all of the skills I needed for this job in the  first grade--how to count to 60. That is what it takes, many times in  the Senate, to move controversial issues forward.   We have 49 Democratic Senators. I believe they are all prepared to  vote for this compromise that we have before us, this bipartisan  compromise. As of today, we have seven Republicans who have joined us  in this effort. The math is simple. We have 56 Senators who are ready  to move forward on this issue. It will only take four more, and I  believe they are there. I have spoken to Republican Senators who have  said: Maybe I cannot sponsor it, but I sure want to see it pass.   I think, ultimately, if we are given a chance to vote on this measure  and move it forward, we can do it on a bipartisan basis. It will be one  of the few times--rare times--that it will happen around this Chamber.  In doing that, we are going to solve the problem that the President  challenged us with--to replace DACA. It is a good approach, the one  that we put together. I don't like all of it, but that is what  compromise is all about.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in a bipartisan effort to make  sure that before we go home this week, we move forward on this DACA  issue so that we can say to these young people: We hear you; we  literally feel your pain; and we want to be there to make sure you have  a future in America.   I yield the floor.
