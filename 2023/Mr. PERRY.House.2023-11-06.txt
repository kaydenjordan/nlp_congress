 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment reduces the funding level for  the National Surface Transportation and Innovation Finance Bureau to  the fiscal year 2022 level, saving $6.75 million.   This office was created by the FAST Act solely to help entities apply  for Federal subsidies for transportation projects. It has become so  complicated, and there are so many different programs, that now we have  to have an entity that navigates interested parties through it.   In fiscal year 2022, this program was funded at $3.8 million. In this  House bill, just 2 years later, it is funded at $10.55 million.   Let's think about that. We are lending out so much money from the  taxpayers that we need to use taxpayer dollars to create an office to  assist people looking to take those loans.   This office is supposed to streamline and improve the application  process for DOT's credit assistance programs, according to the  Department of Transportation website. These programs, which include  TIFIA and RRIF credit assistance programs, have very favorable terms  for the borrower. Unfortunately, they have unfavorable terms for the  taxpayer.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1945     Mr. Chairman, these programs, unfortunately, often finance  projects that have little or no value to interstate commerce.   This is the Federal Government. The Federal Government exists to do  things that the State and local governments can't do, but yet the State  and local governments can do these things. They just choose not to. I  don't blame them. Why would they when the Federal Government will pay  for them?   I will give you some examples:  [[Page H5455]]    It includes $606 million in TIFIA assistance to the Moynihan Train  Hall project in New York City to relieve congestion at Penn Station.   It includes $99 million in TIFIA assistance to the city of Bellevue,  Washington, for 12 multimodal roadways to support the new Bel-Red  neighborhood in the heart of the city. It is great for those cities. I  am sure it is wonderful, but that project alone included 25,000 linear  feet of sidewalk and 21,000 linear feet of dedicated and separate bike  lanes, all within one city.   They weren't crossing State lines. People in Pennsylvania are paying  for the one in Washington, people in New Mexico, Florida. They are not  there, though. They just get to pay for it.   It also includes $908 million in TIFIA assistance to a regional rail  project that only traverses through three counties in Texas.   What region is that? I guess that is the Texas region, right? It is  not the Southwest. I mean, it is technically, but this doesn't cross  any State lines. There is no interstate nexus here. There is no reason  for the Federal Government to be involved.   I am sure these projects and many more funded by these programs are  appreciated by the residents of these areas. I am absolutely certain of  it. I am also sure that I am in the minority when I say there should be  fewer of these programs to redistribute taxpayer-funded subsidies  across the country. We simply can't afford them. We simply can't afford  them.   I know I am going to be a broken record, but we are going to hear the  broken record of $33 trillion in debt and climbing every single day at  exponential rates unseen before in history. At a bare minimum, instead  of creating an increasing funding for an office to manage the web of  bureaucracy of these subsidy programs, why don't we actually cut these  programs, especially the duplicative ones?   My colleague on the other side of the aisle says it exists to help  them apply and successfully develop projects. I am sure it does. I am  sure they develop the projects just to receive this money. That is why  they do it, because this thing exists. Maybe the project wouldn't exist  if it weren't for this first.   He says it requires expertise. I am sure it does because it is  complicated. It is so complicated that we have a bureau now just to  navigate these things for grant recipients and would-be grant  recipients and funding recipients. We can't afford this. We don't need  this, and I urge adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let's be clear. The gentleman who spoke just  before me that just rode the train in from New Jersey today should have  no problem with this amendment because it does nothing to the Northeast  Corridor. However, what it does do, it cuts the over $776 million in  funding for the National Network of the National Railroad Passenger  Corporation.   I understand that the President has an affinity for passenger rail,  especially Amtrak. Amtrak's 15-year vision released in 2021 mirrors  that enthusiasm, plotting out an ambitious 39 new routes in the next 15  years. The problem is, it can't be said enough here in Washington, we  are out of money. We are borrowing money to pay these bills.   The behemoth IIJA passed just a few years ago contained billions in  funding directly for both the Northeast Corridor, which the good  gentleman from New Jersey just talked about, but also the National  Network.   This doesn't include billions of dollars going to passenger rail  grant and loan programs at DOT, many of which Amtrak has been and  remains eligible for at this moment. It doesn't include it. This  amounts to at least $4.4 billion for Amtrak across both accounts. They  are already getting that, $4.4 billion per year, preauthorized,  prepaid. Why in the world would we continue to pump money into a budget  line item that will automatically get generous support for the next few  years at least? Like I just said, $4.4 billion.   Furthermore, this ignores that sucking chest wound of Amtrak's  finances. Even before the pandemic, Amtrak's ticket revenue wasn't  meeting its operating expenses; and now after the pandemic, numbers  look even more grim. In FY22 Amtrak ran an astounding $886 million  operating deficit, $806 million of which was from the National Network,  easily the lion's share. We simply must stop the bleeding.   While I didn't vote for the Biden blowout infrastructure bill, it did  contain a supplemental appropriation of $3.2 billion per year for FY22  through FY26 for Amtrak's National Network. They are already getting  that $3.2 billion.  [[Page H5456]]    This amendment simply cuts $776 million contained in this bill, the  bill that we are trying to move today, this bill, from the National  Network.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, we absolutely do need investments in passenger rail,  but private companies won't do it because it loses money. Amtrak is  happy to do it because it is not their money. It is our money. It is  our taxpayers' money. They get up early in the morning while it is  still dark out, pack their lunch, and head off to work so they can pay  the taxes for an operation that lost $886 million in FY 2022--$886  million.   You know who lost their job when they lost $886 million of the  taxpayers' hard-earned money? Nobody. Nobody lost their job. It doesn't  matter.   What happens is we came in and we are asking for more money. We  already talked about the billions they are already getting, and this is  adding insult to injury for everybody who has to pay for it.   It is awesome to have rails that go across the country. It is one of  the founding principles of our country, opening the West. However, it  wasn't the government that did it. It was entrepreneurs. It was people  who speculated and risked their capital. Then the people who rode the  trains paid for them. However, people who aren't riding the trains are  paying for them, and they don't have any more money.   Do I want to see them close? I certainly don't. I don't want to see  these lines ended and these services ended, but if we keep going, $33  trillion, I don't know when the breaking point is, but everything is  going to end at some point. We could learn a lesson, trim the waste,  fix things that we can fix, so we can avoid everything stopping, but I  guess we are going to head over the cliff.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2000     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes over $130 million in  transit infrastructure grants for the earmarks contained in this bill.   Even though many of my colleagues have chosen to request earmarks, or  using the current euphemism, community project funding, I remain  opposed to the use of this funding for local projects.   The corruptive and wasteful earmark process represents what I believe  are the worst of our taxpayers' dollars being spent on projects that  oftentimes have no Federal nexus whatsoever.   Take some of the grant projects being funded in this bill using  transit infrastructure grants:   $1.05 million for the rehabilitation of the Baldwin Park Train  Station in Baldwin Park, California. I am sure it is beautiful. I am  sure the residents love it. People in Pennsylvania don't know where it  is and don't want to pay for it.   $790,000 for the West Anaheim zero-emission microtransit project. I  am not even sure what that is. Maybe I would be sure if I was in West  Anaheim, but I am in Pennsylvania. I am not planning on traveling there  anytime soon, but apparently my tax dollars are.   $850,000 for the City of Phoenix Valley Metro microtransit. The City  of Phoenix is beautiful. I have been there. I haven't used the  microtransit project, but I get to pay for it, and so do all my bosses.   $850,000 for the Norwalk Transit System bus stop equity project in  Norwalk, California. I am sure it is beautiful. I am not sure what the  equity project is. I would rather not pay for it, and neither would the  folks that sent me here. They don't want to pay for it either because  they don't have any money, and neither does this government.   Now, there is no doubt that some of the earmarks funded in this bill  will benefit some folks around the country. However, again, many of  them have no Federal nexus. State and local governments should be doing  these things, not the Federal Government.   I bet nearly all of them are already eligible for some form of  Federal transit spending anyhow. They don't need an earmark, and they  can compete like everybody else on that boondoggle. We don't need this  boondoggle on top of that boondoggle.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand that it received guidance. It  doesn't matter to me if it the received guidance.   As a matter of fact, it seems to me based on the examples I gave you  that the guidance is flawed, which is why I voted against this when we  started this session and we crafted the rules. I voted against all of  this because I knew this was going to happen.   I don't cast any aspersions to Republicans or Democrats in this. I am  not going to name any names. I am not mad at anybody here. I think it  is bad for the whole country, and it is a bad way of doing business.   As to the safety aspect, I guess when you don't have any real  argument to make about the projects themselves and the alleged Federal  nexus, you throw the old safety--like, of course, everybody on this  side of the aisle, we want to be unsafe. We love to be unsafe. We want  everybody to be unsafe just like we like to breathe dirty air and drink  dirty water, and people somehow believe that. Nothing could be further  from the truth.   If the only way we can be safe is by bankrupting the country, I  wonder how this country made it this far. We made it pretty far without  bankrupting ourselves, but yet, we can make it no further.   I guess that is what we are going to learn here with this process on  this bill. Too much money. Too much borrowing. We can't afford it. No  Federal nexus.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike the funds for  the Capital Investment Grant Program.   For the past decade, the Capital Investment Grant Program has led to  the misallocation of funds to the most expensive projects without  regard to the project's financial viability or expected ridership,  which would seem to me to be kind of important.   By overextending their resources in search of Federal grant funding,  transit agencies fail to consider the impact this will have on their  ability to provide existing services.   While this was true before the pandemic, it is of particular concern  in the post-pandemic environment. FDA data shows 2023 ridership came in  a little over 50 percent of 2019 levels, so there is little need to  build out additions to the transit system before we can ascertain the  long-term impact of the pandemic and the interest in public  transportation generally on ridership.   People aren't riding, yet we are going to build more of this stuff.  That seems, I don't know, a little counterintuitive to me.   Congress now has provided in excess of $100 billion in annual and  emergency spending to public transit agencies over the pandemic era  period.   There is a reason for that. We need to slow down and determine where  future ridership is headed before we continue to throw good money after  bad into capital projects we can't afford, are unnecessary, and will  never be sustained.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, no one here is anti-mobility. We are anti- bankruptcy. We want everybody to be able to go where they need to go  when they need to go there.   We can't afford these projects. The fact is the only way they can be  done is if the Federal Government pays for them. It would probably be  done no other way, which begs the question: If it is the only way they  can be done, are they really affordable? Of course, they are not. It is  how we ended up $33 trillion in debt, for things like this.   Again, we are not opposed to anybody, any State, any locality  investing in their community to do these things. The Federal Government  simply doesn't have the money to do it anymore.   The gentleman talks about the return on investment. Well, the return  on investment doesn't come to these projects because if it did, they  wouldn't be seeking all this money every single year.   Return on investment doesn't come to the taxpayers. We just keep  spending and spending and spending. Somebody in this place, somebody in  this body, somebody in this town has to pick somewhere to start saving  some money.   We don't have any problem with the rest of everything we do picking  the winners and losers, but there can never be any losers when it comes  to funding in this place except for the taxpayer.   They get to lose because no one cares about them. I am here to say I  care about them. We have got to stop this.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2015     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes $150 million in  grants from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, known  as WMATA.   This area that we are operating in, that we are speaking about, is  full of highly educated professionals, many of whom work for the  government or government contractors and associated jobs. Some of the  surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia have some of the highest  median incomes per county in the country. It is pretty affluent around  here.   Like many transit agencies, even before the pandemic, WMATA had an  unsustainable budget outlook and operation, getting 53 percent of its  budget through State and local subsidies--not through fares of all the  well-to-do folks around the area riding, but through subsidies.   If you were to run a business where you only made 47 percent of your  budget in revenues, you would be out of business pretty darn quick.   During the pandemic, most Federal agencies sent their workers home.  Even so, WMATA received over $2 billion from pandemic-era legislation  to keep it afloat. Nobody was riding because everybody was sent home,  but this place sent them $2 billion to keep paying the bills when  nobody was riding--only in Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, only in  America.   We are now post-shutdown, and Federal workers are still not going to  the office. A recent GAO report showed that 17 of the 24 Federal  agencies surveyed used an average of 25 percent or less of their  headquarters building capacity right here in Washington, D.C. That is  75 percent of the space in these headquarters buildings around here  that taxpayers are paying for with no benefit because 75 percent of it  is empty. Not only are they paying for a building nobody is in, but  they are paying for a transit system that is taking no one to work in  these places.   WMATA said that in May of this year, rail ridership reached only 50  percent of pre-pandemic levels on weekends and 89 percent on weekends.  Mr. Chairman, 50 percent of pre-pandemic is half. It just now reached  half of pre-pandemic levels in May of this year.   After Federal COVID relief for WMATA is exhausted, the Metro's budget  deficit will be $750 million in fiscal year 2025 and $830 million in  fiscal year 2026.   When is it going to end? When?   WMATA's leadership says that the deficit results from inflation,  collective bargaining agreements, and, importantly, $288 million from  decreased ridership.   Well, I can't do anything about those things, but I can try to do  something about the exorbitant amount of money we are losing, that the  taxpayers are sending into this black hole and getting nothing for it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, reckless? We just heard from the gentleman  right before me about how dangerous it is to ride in the National  Capital's transit system. People come here and it is dangerous to ride  on the transit system of their Capital. That is reckless.   This transit system is expecting to get this $150 million in grants,  and they are still going to lose $750 million in 2025 and $830 million  in 2026. They are still going to lose that even with the $150 million  because they have no interest in trying to make this solvent.   Why should they? They keep on getting bailed out by the good people  from around the country who can't even go to their Nation's Capital and  be sure that they won't be beaten up, robbed, or worse on the transit  system. It is unacceptable. There ought to be some accountability.  There ought to be any accountability.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this shouldn't be hyperpartisan. My friends  on the other side of the aisle, I am sure they like taking the train. I  am sure their constituents and their bosses do, as well. Having other  people pay for it is an awesome circumstance. Everybody would want  that.   We all like things for free, but things aren't free. We have to pay  for things in this country, and we are out of money, Mr. Chairman.   It shouldn't be hyperpartisan, and it is not hyperpartisan. Those in  this room would have you believe that, but there are people on both  sides of the aisle who know that this thing is inefficient, wasteful,  dangerous, and, yes, indeed, reckless.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2030     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
