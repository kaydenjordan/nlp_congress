 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Masjid Al-Haqq in Newark, New  Jersey, on its 25th anniversary.   Founded on June 18, 1992, and headed by Imam Muhammad, Masjid Al-Haqq  has dedicated 25 years of service to the community, and I want to thank  them for an outstanding job.   Masjid Al-Haqq provides the most reputable Muslim journal newspapers  on a weekly basis in the city of Newark, without fake news, and sends a  large contingent of Newark Muslims to the Muslim Convention held in  Chicago each year during Labor Day weekend.   Every December, the Masjid also holds a ``Time to Reflect'' weekend,  where the community gathers for workshops and family activities. The  services they provide impact the lives of many around our community.   I once again offer my sincere congratulations for a job well done.  Happy 25th anniversary.                            ____________________
