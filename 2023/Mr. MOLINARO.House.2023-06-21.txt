 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity this afternoon to speak on  my  [[Page H3034]]  amendment to the underlying bill, which, as we know, does help to  unlock the growth and prosperity of our Nation's small businesses and  their employees.   My amendment is simple and straightforward. It will ensure that small  businesses and employers, particularly those in rural communities  across the country, are made aware of tax-advantaged flexible health  insurance benefits. Employers, especially in the rural areas like the  ones I represent in upstate New York, should have the tools to provide  their employees with various options to lower their healthcare costs  and to access quality care.   As a member of the House Committee on Small Business, I know the  unique challenges businesses in rural communities and those  businessowners and employees face every day. With a comprehensive focus  on rural areas, we can help ensure that all businesses, regardless of  their ZIP Code, have equal opportunity to provide affordable, high- quality healthcare benefits.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this amendment.  I urge its consideration, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Chair, this amendment, as a reminder to my  colleagues across the aisle, is simply meant to broaden access and  educate small business owners all across this country as to the  benefits that are available to them to access affordable, quality  healthcare.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
