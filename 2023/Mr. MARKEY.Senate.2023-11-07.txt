 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  support of the nomination of Ms. Julia Kobick to the United States  Court for the District of Massachusetts.   Today, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on Ms. Kobick's nomination,  and, soon, we will vote on her confirmation. With a successful vote,  Ms. Kobick will become the 150th Biden nominee to be confirmed as a  judge.   Julia Kobick is a rising star in Massachusetts legal circles. A  Massachusetts native, she earned her bachelor's degree in government,  with honors, from Harvard College. She began her career as a public  schoolteacher to New York City's second and third graders. While  teaching, she earned a master's in elementary education at Pace  University. She went on to obtain her law degree, magna cum laude, at  Harvard Law School.    Ms. Kobick then clerked at every level of the Federal judiciary-- first, with Judge Dennis Saylor on the District Court of Massachusetts,  then for Chief Judge Michael Chagares on the Third Circuit Court of  Appeals, and, finally, for the great Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the  U.S. Supreme Court.  [[Page S5389]]    In 2013, following her clerkships, Ms. Kobick joined the  Massachusetts Attorney General's Office. She worked there until 2021 as  an assistant attorney general in the constitutional and administrative  law division. Her practice spanned a range of substantive areas,  including healthcare, child welfare, administrative law, and  constitutional issues. Since the summer of 2021, Ms. Kobick has served  as deputy State solicitor, where she has primarily handled civil and  criminal appellate litigation.   Ms. Kobick has received support from a number of groups, including  from Massachusetts trial and appellate judges, former Massachusetts  attorneys general, and her clerk colleagues at the U.S. Supreme Court-- clerks who worked for Justices nominated by Presidents of both parties.  Many of Ms. Kobick's supporters cite her dedication and character,  alongside her superior skill and judgment. Unsurprisingly, the American  Bar Association has given her its highest rating of ``well qualified.''   Perhaps the best evidence of Ms. Kobick's fitness to serve on the  district court is the enthusiastic support her nomination has received  from her own opposing counsel. A cadre of attorneys who has litigated  cases against parties Ms. Kobick represented has praised her  ``meticulous advocacy'' across a variety of legal proceedings.   From oral arguments before State and Federal trial court judges to  appellate arguments before the First Circuit Court of Appeals and the  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the very lawyers who faced off  against her in court have said that ``her legal abilities and intellect  are first-rate as shown through the clarity and persuasiveness of her  written and oral advocacy.'' They have lauded her preparedness and  performance under pressure, her thoughtfulness as a colleague, and her  skill in diffusing ``any contentious situation.''   Over the course of her career, Ms. Kobick has embodied the highest  standards of the legal profession. True to her roots as a public  schoolteacher, Ms. Kobick has mentored public interest-oriented law  students at my alma mater, Boston College Law School, and has served as  a mentor with The Appellate Project, an organization that matches  attorneys with law students of color who are interested in appellate  advocacy.   Senator Warren and I are proud to have recommended Julie Kobick's  nomination to President Biden, and we proudly speak in favor of her  nomination before the full Senate today. She is a dedicated public  servant of the highest caliber, and she will bring a rare level of  legal talent to the bench. Her unquestionable integrity, her impeccable  reputation, and her depth in both humility and skill make her uniquely  suited for service as a Federal district court judge.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on cloture and then on  confirmation. This will be a judge all of you will be proud you have  voted for.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I have six requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
