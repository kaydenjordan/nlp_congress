 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Commissioner Billie Dean from the city of Apopka.   Mr. Dean was a guiding light for Apopka.   From bravery in Korea, to the classrooms and commission, to the  forefront of racial integration in the South, Commissioner Dean was a  champion for his community.   He was a local hero for his work to revitalize South Apopka and to  fight for justice. As a teacher and a commissioner, he made the future  of Apopka his ultimate cause.   There is no higher praise for a public servant than the love of his  community. Apopka loved him, and he loved Apopka.   Madam Speaker, we are grateful for a life well lived.                            ____________________
