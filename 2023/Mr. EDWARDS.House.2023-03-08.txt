 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 140,  Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act, and I applaud and  appreciate Chairman Comer bringing this bill forward.   In a recent hearing held by the Oversight and Accountability  Committee with former executives from Twitter, a clear and very  disturbing pattern emerged: A coordinated effort between a privately  owned social media giant and the Federal Government to suppress  critical reporting ahead of the 2020 Presidential election.   Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government and its legions of unelected  bureaucrats must not be the final decisionmaker of what information  Americans can and cannot read.   The onus is on Congress to provide a way to effectively prevent  Federal bureaucrats from suppressing lawful speech. This bill, H.R.  140, would do just that.   For almost 100 years, the Hatch Act has served as an important  barrier against taxpayer-funded employees participating in political  activities while on official time, and added suppression of free speech  to its list of prohibited activities.   I urge strong support for this legislation, and I am encouraged by  Chairman Comer's commitment to thoroughly investigate the ever- increasing encroachment by Big Tech companies into the privacy and  First Amendment rights of millions of Americans.
