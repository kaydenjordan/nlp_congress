 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize Van  Hemert's Dutch Oven Bakery of Boone, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Van Hemert's Dutch Oven Bakery was founded by husband and wife duo  Denny and Terri Van Hemert in 1983. The bakery's motto is, ``A Little  Dutch in the Heart of Iowa,'' and the Van Hemert's have accomplished  that. Operating as a full-line scratch bakery, Van Hemert's Dutch Oven  Bakery is famous for their Dutch letters, which are made by creating a  light pastry shell and filling it with homemade almond paste. Although  they craft a wide range of letters, they claim that the Dutch letter  ``S'' is their most popular. They also offer other Dutch pastries on  their menu including almond horns, Dutch windmills, and creme horns. In  addition to Dutch pastries, they also have pies, muffins, donuts,  cakes, and seasonal items on the menu.   Another unique aspect of the bakery is that their menu is more than  just pastries and sweets. They have goods for all occasions, including  homemade bread, a breakfast and lunch menu, and a ``Koffie Haus'' with  a wide range of caffeinated beverages.   Van Hemert's Dutch Oven Bakery has been recognized for their hard  work. They have locations in Boone and Ames, IA, and were named by the  Iowa State Daily in 2016 and 2017 as the student choice best bakery.  They have even been recognized nationally, placing fifth in the Dawn  Food's America's Sweetest Bakery competition in 2017.   Van Hemert's Dutch Oven Bakery's commitment to providing quality  pastries in central Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate the Van  Hemert family and the entire team at Van Hemert's Dutch Oven Bakery for  their continued dedication to providing Dutch sweets and treats to  Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________
