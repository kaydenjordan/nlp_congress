 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, and I want  to commend and congratulate my two good friends, Chairman McCaul and  Ranking Member Thompson, and the members of the Homeland Security  Committee and their staff for their work on this important bill.   This Congress, eight committee chairmen agreed to work together on  the Department of Homeland Security reauthorization. I did so because  securing our Nation's homeland is extremely important to the American  people. I also believe it is our duty to work together to support  fellow chairmen on their priorities, especially large reauthorizations  like this.   The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up two  authorizations in our jurisdiction that are included in this bill: the  U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   The Coast Guard authorization supports service missions to enforce  all Federal laws on the high seas and in U.S. waters. It does so by  providing a variety of acquisition authorities to help lower costs,  requiring a land-based unmanned aircraft system program, eliminating  redundant training requirements, and providing the Coast Guard parity  with other armed services in matters related to healthcare and  retirement.   On FEMA, the bill provides the first ever reauthorization of the  agency to ensure accountability and strong congressional oversight. It  includes a number of provisions to help address 21st century challenges  to disaster preparedness and response and to support energy response  personnel.   Both of our reauthorizations were bipartisan efforts and approved  with bipartisan support. Again, I thought it was important to move  these measures through the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure to support Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson  and their legislative priorities. I want to thank them both again for  their work. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  0930
