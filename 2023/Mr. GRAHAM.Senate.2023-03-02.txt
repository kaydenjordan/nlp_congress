 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an  incredible legal professional and public servant--Jack L. Rives, who is  stepping down from his position as executive director of the American  Bar Association after almost 13 years. While Jack's strategic vision  and caring leadership will be missed, he leaves behind a legacy of  exceptional public service and commitment to protecting the rule of law  and increasing access to justice.   The ABA is the largest voluntary association of lawyers and legal  professionals in the world. Jack began his service as its executive  director on Law Day--May 1--2010. He has been responsible for  developing and implementing the association's strategic goals and  programs and policy initiatives adopted by the ABA's board of governors  and house of delegates.   Jack has also overseen the ABA's more than 1,050 talented employees  working at its headquarters in Illinois, at its Washington, DC, office,  and at program sites in California, Texas, and about 60 countries  throughout the world. During the pandemic, he took great care of the  ABA staff by strategically managing the challenges associated with  moving to a fully remote environment and then back into the various  offices with a hybrid workforce, all while maintaining high employee  morale and avoiding any pandemic-related layoffs.   During Jack's tenure, the ABA has significantly expanded its domestic  and international grant programs, thereby also expanding the incredible  impact they have in helping people and justice systems globally.   For example, the ABA's Free Legal Answers platform--launched in 2016  as the first and only national pro bono legal advice portal--has now  expanded to 41 jurisdictions, with over 11,000 pro bono attorneys  registered to respond to the more than 250,000 civil legal questions  posted by low-income Americans, especially in the wake of recent crises  caused by the pandemic, natural disasters, and rising inflation.   ABA leaders, members, and State bar colleagues meet with their  elected officials in Washington, DC, at least annually to advocate for  important issues like funding the Legal Services Corporation, enhancing  the judicial security for our Federal judges, and preserving the public  service loan forgiveness program--a critical program that inspires  lawyers to work in eligible public service positions for at least 10  years, often in rural communities, so more Americans have access to the  legal help they need, where they need it--especially during the height  of the COVID-19 pandemic when so many faced unexpected challenges.   In the international arena, Jack helped reorganize the ABA's primary  international development, human rights, and United Nations entities  into one cohesive Center for Global Programs. Under his leadership, the  Center has grown its international portfolio to encompass more than 100  democracy, human rights, and governance programs in 60 countries. It  has also significantly expanded its impact through high-profile  programs like Justice Defenders and Trial Watch, a partnership with the  George and Amal Clooney Foundation that focuses on monitoring trials of  at-risk human rights defenders.   Jack is a role model for legal professionals at all stages of their  professional careers, always making time to meet with the many lawyers,  law students, and interns who seek his advice. The ABA President  recognized Jack's dedication and impact recently by saying that upon  his departure, Jack will leave the ABA positioned to provide  unparalleled service to lawyers worldwide and to advance the rule of  law in the U.S. and globally. Jack's staff tell me they will miss his  caring leadership and support, as well as his frequent communications  on what was happening in the organization, his accessibility, and his  willingness to answer all questions. I am not surprised by the amazing  impact Jack has had at the ABA because I had the privilege to serve  with him in the U.S. Air Force for decades, and I saw firsthand the  extraordinary leadership, management, and people skills he had at the  most senior levels of the military.   Jack was born in Georgia and received both his bachelor of arts in  political science and his law degree from the University of Georgia. To  this day, he remains a loyal and avid fan of his Georgia Bulldogs.  Following graduation from law school, Jack began his 33-year career in  the Air Force as a judge advocate. He served as the Judge Advocate  General of the U.S. Air Force, the senior U.S. Air Force attorney, and  was the first military attorney to attain the three-star rank of  lieutenant general. Jack led about 4,600 military and civilian lawyers  and legal professionals worldwide. Among his many military awards and  decorations are the Distinguished Service Medal with oakleaf cluster  and the Defense Superior Service Medal.   The American Bar Association and our entire Nation have been lucky to  have had a champion for the rule of law like Jack Rives. He has not  only been successful throughout his impressive career, but also has had  a significant impact on people's lives, many of whom he will never  meet. I feel fortunate to have crossed paths with Jack over the  decades, both in his civilian and military leadership roles, and I wish  him and his wife Marie both happiness and success in this next chapter  of their lives. I also thank Jack for his years of service and his  selfless commitment to improving the rule of law and our  profession.                            ____________________
