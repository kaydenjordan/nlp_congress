 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from the great  State of Pennsylvania for helping cofound the Blue Collar Caucus and  just doing a tremendous job. As you know, the hardworking men and women  of Pennsylvania, and particularly the Philadelphia area, have been so  responsible for many of the things that have really made our country  what it is, many of the great public works, many of the amazing  museums, and many of the amazing things, bridges, just things like that  that people take for granted that there was someone that built those  things, there was someone that toiled possibly in the heat and in the  snow, but they were able to bring home a good wage doing it. They were  able to take care of their families. They were able to send their kids  to college.   I love when the gentleman talks about his family and the sacrifices  that the gentleman's parents made working in a blue-collar job that  ultimately helped him go to one of the most prestigious universities-- Notre Dame. So I just really appreciate the fact that the gentleman  appreciates the hardworking men and women that really make this country  great.   We need to do more for them. One of the ways that we can do more for  them is to pass an infrastructure bill. I don't think that there is any  doubt about that.   We know that this is Infrastructure Week. With roughly $700 billion a  year that is being invested at the local, State, and Federal level,  infrastructure is vitally important to our economy. We have to have  good infrastructure to meet the basic needs of the American people.  That may sound like quite a bit of money, but we can't spend enough  [[Page H4304]]  money to repair and replace our crumbling roads, bridges, and other  critical infrastructure.   I listened to Elizabeth Esty last night, one of our colleagues from  Connecticut, talk about the dangers that are involved in not investing  in infrastructure and some of the deaths that tragically have occurred  on American roads because of collapsing bridges and things like that.  That is not what we want.   We need for the American taxpayer to have confidence that the roads  that they are driving on and that the airports that they are using are  up to date, that we have the best ports, that we have the best transit  systems in this country, and that we have the money to keep those  things world-class systems and efficient systems in our country. They  have to be safe.                                time  2000    According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one out of  every five miles of highway pavement in our Nation is in poor  condition. That is an estimated 56,000 of the Nation's bridges that are  structurally deficient. Think about the truck driver who drives every  day, think about the person who makes their living on the road. Think  about how many families want their loved ones to travel on safe roads.  Think about all of the families who depend on their loved ones to make  a living on those roads. That is how they put food on the table at the  end of the week, at the end of every 2 weeks, at the end of the month,  however they get their check. They need to be safe. Those families need  to know that those hardworking men and women who work on those roads  every day and use them to help fuel American exceptionalism, they need  to know that those roads are safe.   Some estimates say that modernizing our infrastructure to meet our  needs is going to require an additional $5 trillion in Federal spending  over the next decade. Federal investment in infrastructure is an  economic boost that can also create good-paying jobs for blue-collar  workers.   I have to tell you, many were encouraged, a lot of people that I  know--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--they were very encouraged  when the Trump administration floated the idea of a $1 trillion  infrastructure plan. But instead of presenting a detailed  infrastructure plan that puts Americans back to work, the Trump  administration has basically offered a plan that lacks details. It  doesn't really go into how we are going to get this done.   The reports that I have seen say that the Trump plan, if you want to  call it a plan, like I said, contains very few details. It contains tax  incentives for private industries that make up as much as 80 percent of  the cost of the bill.   Let me tell you two reasons why that is bad. It would simply enrich  companies that would have built their projects anyway, and the only  private investment it would encourage is for projects that contain a  funding stream such as toll roads.   I have to say, if toll roads are the only choice that people have,  they will maybe take them. But I know that a bipartisan group of  Texans, and I saw this especially when I was in the State legislature  before I came to Congress, they are really upset with toll roads. They  feel we have too many of them, and they want to see the infrastructure  investment that we need in this country to get our roads back up to par  and to help relieve congestion.   Encouraging private investment in infrastructure is not necessarily a  bad idea, but it requires the proper oversight and the selection of the  right kinds of projects. I have to tell you, there is a bipartisan  group that believes in that. Both the Obama administration under  Secretary Foxx and the Bush Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, they  both agree that public-private partnerships are only able to address a  small segment of what is needed.   Without careful attention, we risk wasting taxpayer funds by giving  big tax breaks to companies on the backs of hardworking American  families.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk some more later about job creation  and about Davis-Bacon and about some other things that need to be  addressed, but I want to be sure that we hear from another one of our  colleagues and friends from the Rust Belt, Ms. Marcy Kaptur who is  here. So I am going to turn it back over to you so you can introduce  her. When she talks about what is going on in the heartland and in  Ohio, she works directly with those men and women who work in  manufacturing and who work in construction. I bet you she has some  things that we need to hear about dealing with infrastructure and how  it can help our States and help our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Boyle. I really  appreciate the points he has made tonight, just so timely. It is so  important that we talk about those things during Infrastructure Week  and the Blue Collar Caucus and the role that the caucus is playing in  pointing out a lot of these things that need to be talked about.   Again, when you talk about the infrastructure bill, if we had a  legitimate trillion-dollar infrastructure program and it were enacted,  we could put the United States back on a prerecession job growth path  and, some people say, create close to 11 million jobs.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, infrastructure spending  today--that is what we spend on infrastructure spending right now--is  directly responsible for about 15.5 million direct and indirect U.S.  jobs, and you are talking about average salaries of $68,000 per year.  That is 28 percent above the U.S. median income. We know that  infrastructure jobs pay well. There is absolutely no doubt about that.   Investment in infrastructure also adds more indirect jobs in  manufacturing, logistics, transportation, and an increasing demand for  steel, glass, concrete; and all those things get the job growth growing  in America.   According to Georgetown University, more than half of the new  infrastructure jobs will go to high school graduates and even high  school dropouts. So many of our young men who find themselves dropping  out end up in the incarceration system, but we know that, if we can  find high school dropouts a job and they are not left behind due to  economic changes and economic factors, we can help those young men.   According to that same analysis, jobs and occupations that are  expected to grow with greater infrastructure investment pay more than  typical wages for high school graduates. Engineering and management  jobs, which usually require higher levels of education, also offer good  opportunities. However, even construction and transportation jobs  associated with infrastructure projects provide higher earnings than an  average job for high school graduates. The Blue Collar Caucus advocates  not only more jobs but, again, better quality jobs.   I used to hear people talk around the dinner table or the domino  table or the card table when I was growing up. People wanted to know  where the good jobs were, how can you get on at a good job. That is  what I am talking about: how we are going to create more of those.   The Davis-Bacon Act, you heard Representative Boyle talk a little bit  about that earlier, about how important that is. We should be troubled.  When you start talking about good jobs, good-paying jobs, we should be  troubled that congressional Republicans have taken steps to repeal the  Davis-Bacon Act.    I want to talk a little bit about the Davis-Bacon Act, but first I  want to talk about why the Davis-Bacon Act is important. A lot of times  in Washington, D.C., we start talking about these terms. People at the  Chamber of Commerce, they know what Davis-Bacon is, but maybe the  average person has no idea what Davis-Bacon is.   People don't come up to me at the Dollar Store in Fort Worth and say:  Hey, Congressman Veasey, hey, Marc, what are we going to do to protect  Davis-Bacon? But people do stop me at the Dollar Store and say: Hey,  Marc, what are we going to do about putting some more money in our  pockets?   That is what Davis-Bacon is all about. That is where the Republicans  fail the American worker.   The Davis-Bacon Act requires that certain contractors and  subcontractors responsible for carrying out Federal contracts pay their  laborers and mechanics the prevailing wages for the area. That is what  I am talking about when I say putting more money in your pocket,  putting more food on the table, being able to make that light bill,  being able to make that car bill, being able to make that truck  payment.   I want to sell more cars. We have a General Motors plant in  Arlington, Texas, that makes some very good SUVs, good-paying union  jobs, good union-made SUVs, American-made SUVs, and you don't get that  with lower rates. You get that with the prevailing wage rates that  Republicans are trying to do away with. That is what everybody needs to  understand.   Ensuring workers are paid a fair wage is extremely important,  especially for blue-collar workers. Prevailing wage laws provide  protections for both construction workers and the taxpayers. They  ensure that all contractors bidding on public construction  [[Page H4308]]  projects will pay family-supporting wages and that they also ensure  projects will be built to the highest standards by skilled, safe, and  well-trained construction workers.   Numerous studies have shown, contrary to the claims of corporate  interests, that Davis-Bacon wage protections do not increase taxpayers'  costs. That is the one thing that you are going to hear from  Republicans and downtown business interest people when they want to  keep income inequality growing in this country instead of trying to  stop income inequality is that Davis-Bacon drives up wages because it  allows families to put more food on their table. I think that is a  doggone shame.   Fairly paid craftsmen added value to our investments in  infrastructure, and Davis-Bacon must continue to be included in any  infrastructure plan. Repeal of Davis-Bacon would decrease the quality  of blue-collar jobs, and that is a loss that we cannot afford. A repeal  of Davis-Bacon would decrease the amount of money that you take home  every week or that you take home every 2 weeks, however often you get  that check, however often you look for that direct deposit so you can  make those bills. If we repeal Davis-Bacon, you will not be making  those bills as easy as you were before.   You need to let your Republican Member of Congress know that you want  to bring more money home, that you want these prevailing wages, that  you do not want to lose these, that it would be absolutely devastating  for your family.   Another area that Blue Collar Caucus has talked about, another area  that we are going to continue to talk about and that Congress should  press forward on in great speed is the Buy America provisions. They  have to be in any infrastructure package that we pass.   Buy America generally requires that projects carried out by State and  local governments use U.S.-made iron and steel and that they also  require domestic production and assembly of other manufactured goods be  made right here in the good old USA.   These projects--again, mainly highways, public transportation,  aviation--are vitally important to our economy, and ensuring that these  projects are made with quality American-made goods means that we get  better value and that we put our own people to work. All of this means  more and better jobs for hardworking Americans out there.   As we set about rebuilding America's infrastructure, we have to make  sure that we are building an economy that works for everyone and not  just the corporate interests in this country because, again, we have to  do something about income inequality in this country. It is very real.  Productivity is up. People's paychecks are stagnant. That is why people  still feel the economic pinch and the economic pain, because they see  the growth, they see the technology, but they don't see their paychecks  getting any fatter--but they do feel themselves struggling more and  more and more. We have got to change that.   I would like to again thank Representative Boyle just for being an  advocate for the hardworking citizens in the Philadelphia area in his  district, just for being a voice on this, and other Members of Congress  that came out tonight--Ms. Kaptur, Mr. Lipinski, and others--because we  know that this is important.   We have to keep talking about this. We cannot continue to let the  American worker fail. We cannot continue to let the American worker's  dollar not grow while we see our economy grow and while we see new  technology and fat cats getting rich, seeing corporate America getting  rich but the average, everyday American just continues to fall further  and further behind. It has to end. It has to end.   Congress needs to work together to do something about that. I am glad  that the Democratic Party in the United States House of Representatives  is taking the lead on this issue.
