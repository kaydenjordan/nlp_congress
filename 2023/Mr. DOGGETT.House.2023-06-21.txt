 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Millions of Americans are finding the security and the peace of mind  that comes from having access to a family physician through the  Affordable Care Act. If the gentleman has been listening to the  American people, he has turned a tin ear to the 16 million Americans  that have now enrolled in the marketplaces under the Affordable Care  Act.   Republicans, unwilling to accept the success of what they demeaned as  ObamaCare, Republicans who failed more than 60 times in this House to  repeal ObamaCare, who failed three times in the Supreme Court to  undermine ObamaCare, have now embarked on a new strategy, which is to  circumvent and undermine the invaluable protections of the Affordable  Care Act.                                time  1530    With this bill, Republicans are demanding that every individual who  gets stuck in one of these newfangled plans that they have is denied  protection from having their insurer exclude preexisting conditions, no  assurance of coverage for essential medical care, and no assurance of  affordability.   I offered an amendment to correct one part of this defective bill to  give Americans statutory protection, so they are not back in the old  pre-Affordable Care Act period of losing coverage when they needed it  most because they had something the insurance company defined as a  preexisting condition, but that was rejected.   At the time, they claimed that was their intent, but when you look at  the specific statutory language, there is no doubt that the protection  for preexisting conditions and essential conditions is excluded from  their legislation.   These so-called Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement  Arrangements, ICHRAs, are about as convoluted as the name suggests.  They are as my grandson, Canyon, would say, they are icky.   Handing people a voucher and telling them to go shop for coverage  follows the same ill-conceived Republican approach to sabotage  Medicare, which they continue to promote in their latest budget.  Instead of giving Medicare beneficiaries guaranteed coverage, they  would give seniors a voucher with declining value and tell them to go  find coverage.   Instead of the guaranteed, comprehensive coverage workers now  receive, this bill would force so many people to find healthcare in a  sea of junk, exposing them to misleading marketing and aggressive  brokers. An estimated 2 million workers would be immediately impacted  by this sorry bill, and with another provision that is in the bill that  directs the Treasury Department to go out and promote access to junk  plans, we could expect these numbers of impacted workers to increase.   Inevitably, the result is bare-bones, junk insurance that misleads on  coverage, has high out-of-pocket costs, and abandons those with  preexisting conditions. The policy's fine print takes away all the bold  promises of the marketing. Those who need coverage the most will be  unable to afford it or receive minimal junk coverage.   In a Nation that is as rich as America, going broke shouldn't be a  side effect of trying to get healthcare, but exposing more people to  financial ruin is exactly what this kind of legislative approach will  achieve.   This misguided scheme suffers, I think, from a form of preexisting  condition itself. It is called amnesia, because they forget the  conditions that  [[Page H3023]]  existed for so many Americans in this country before the Affordable  Care Act became law. Situations like those who contacted me from Texas:  Someone who had been a victim of domestic violence declared to have a  preexisting condition; an infant born with some preexisting condition  denied the coverage that they need; any number of excuses when coverage  was needed the most because of preexisting conditions.   That is why I thought it was so important to amend this legislation,  and the refusal of my Republican colleagues to clarify that now sends  forward loud and clear that that is their objective.   There is even more ick to the ICHRA bill that is being introduced,  and that is the opportunity that is created for class discrimination.  This bill legalizes that discrimination. My amendment would have  prevented that also.   Employees that are out there on the assembly line; those who are in  the chicken processing plant, or the meat-packer, or out in the  cornfields; they are in the dirtiest, most difficult, and usually the  lowest-paid jobs. They can be treated one way under this bill, while  the executives sitting off in the office tower are treated another and  getting an entirely different kind of coverage because of the way they  have written their bill.   Lower-wage workers who would be eligible, in fact, for a better  policy under the Affordable Care Act with a no-premium or low-premium  policy, would instead be required to search for a policy with more  holes than safety net.   Finally, we discover something on which Republicans are pro-choice. I  didn't think they were pro-choice on anything, but the genuine choice  they provide is to the employer, not to the employee, a choice to  divide employees into the haves and the have-nots; providing employer  coverage to some and leaving others to fend for themselves.   Predictably, that burden will fall on the low-wage workers and the  sick employees that employers don't want to cover. One survey already  of employers found that 60 percent of large firms intended to offer  ICHRA to only low-wage workers. That is icky.   To prohibit discrimination by employers and junk plans alike, the  amendment I offered would have offered protection. This bill, as it  stands, does not. It should be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman has repeated his stated intent to provide the  protection that his bill denies, and I would refer him, again, to page  3, line 2 of this bill as it was presented in committee, and the  failure to refer to section 2791(b)(5) of the Public Health Service Act  means that that protection will not be there. It could easily have been  added if that were the true intent. It is omitted.   Same page, line 12, the failure to include guarantees against  nondiscrimination is not there.   He is concerned about federalizing healthcare. Well, all that I want  to do is set a minimum Federal standard that no person in this country  will be denied because of a preexisting condition the healthcare that  they deserve. That is what the Affordable Care Act was designed to  achieve, not only for those in the marketplace, but beyond.   Secondly, I want to ensure that different classes of employees are  not treated differently. Let me just describe a little more of what is  involved there.   Just as they would allow insurers to discriminate against a newborn  with a  [[Page H3024]]  heart murmur and call that a preexisting condition, their bill would  permit an employer to discriminate against their own employees.   Just to give you a practical example. We have a lot of chicken  processing plants down in northeast Texas. If there is a facility out  there where the chicken pluckers are chasing the chickens, removing the  feathers that are flying, those tough, dirty, hot jobs processing them  may be managed by a group in some high-rise in Dallas or Tyler.   Well, this bill, as it is written, will allow those executives to get  their group health insurance policy with all the protections against  preexisting conditions and being able to see, perhaps, a concierge  service for their healthcare. But the folks that are down there chasing  the chickens and plucking the chickens, they get an ICHRA. All they get  is ick. That is wrong.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me respond to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. He says there is  nothing in this bill about preexisting conditions and discrimination,  and he is absolutely right. That is the whole failing of this bill. It  does not include the protections that are necessary to ensure that no  American is discriminated against on the basis of preexisting  conditions and that no employer can discriminate among groups of its  employees.   He also says this is going to open more opportunities for more people  to get health coverage. I would point out that studies have shown that  95 percent of the people who are in these icky plans now once had good  group health coverage. My concern is that we will see even more people  lose their good group health coverage and be put into an icky plan.   As for the Small Business Flexibility Act, I am for the Treasury and  others educating all employers and employees about their rights and  opportunities, but I think this part of the overall package is very  slanted. Treasury needs to be out there educating employers, some of  whom may not know themselves the limitations that these junk plans have  and how much they will disserve their employees. We need education of  employees on how to understand whether their employer's offer of  coverage meets the minimum standard and is truly affordable for the  [[Page H3025]]  purposes of being able to otherwise enroll in subsidized marketplace  coverage. I think there are limitations on that portion of the bill as  well and that it, therefore, should be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The chairman of our committee says that there were great gifts to  insurance companies. What the Build Back Better bill did was to give  individuals additional tax credits. Some Republicans call those tax  cuts, but they were credits given to people to be able to afford  insurance. As a result of that improvement, many more Americans got the  insurance that they need.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I say to the chairman, he is absolutely correct. I referred to the  Build Back Better instead of the American Rescue Plan. It is easy to  get confused about them. The American Rescue Plan was, of course,  signed into law and has helped so many Americans. However, we always  know that whatever the name, Republicans are against all of them, as  they were, and voted unanimously against all of the opportunity that  they created for millions more Americans to get and keep health  insurance and provide themselves security.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I focused on one part of this entire package of bills, but together  it is truly a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the Affordable Care  Act. Being unable to repeal it, having nothing but nothing care to  replace it with is really kind of a death by a thousand cuts, making  healthcare less accessible and affordable for so many at-risk workers.   The bills in this package include a codification of the Trump-era  rule that allows employers to offer these ICHRA plans to their  employees instead of employer-sponsored health plans.   Under this plan, employers may offer a voucher and force their  employee to shop for their own coverage.   Under this bill, employers are permitted to pick and choose among  their employees and discriminate against some with their vouchers.   This bill also includes an expansion of the association health plans,  which my colleague from Virginia will discuss at greater length. That  has been a standard tenet of Republicans' assault on the Affordable  Care Act. It is a provision that would allow self-employed individuals  and small businesses to circumvent the guarantees of the Affordable  Care Act and steer consumers into shoddy coverage that does not cover  the healthcare they most need when they need it, the essential health  benefits.   It also does not offer them protection against preexisting conditions  or age or the fact that before the Affordable Care Act was adopted,  women were discriminated against at a great rate and often denied the  coverage that they needed or it was priced so high they could not  afford it.   The bill would also preempt State regulation of association health  plans and disrupt risk pools as these plans do not have to follow  standard premium-setting rules and risk adjustment. This bill is  similar to the Trump administration rule that was struck down in 2019.   If you are beginning to recognize a pattern here, this is all Trump,  Trump, Trump because he is still the Pied Piper for the Republican  Conference, as we just saw in this disgraceful presentation about our  honorable colleague Adam Schiff.   This package also contains a provision to encourage employers to  offer self-funded plans, which are not required to comply with ACA  protections, again, on preexisting conditions, on essential health  benefits, and more. Most employers do not want to take on the risk of  offering a self-funded plan. However, by expanding stop-loss coverage,  which sets a catastrophic amount the employer will be responsible for,  and then covers any other costs that may come up from covering their  employees, self-funded plans will be more attractive.   This legislation prevents Federal and State governments from  regulating stop-loss coverage and risks more employers opting for self- funded plans that do not protect healthcare consumers.   Finally, without providing any additional resources, this legislative  package tells the Treasury Department to educate employers about how  great these new icky plans are and their health reimbursement accounts,  which would bar workers from more affordable coverage under the  marketplace already available.   At the heart of this effort is just the perpetual push by House  Republicans to weaken the protections of the Affordable Care Act, which  have prevented financial ruin for so many people and assured access to  healthcare for so many people.   Under the provisions of this bill, employers can form association  health plans to skirt some of the requirements of the ACA like the  essential health benefits. State and Federal regulators will be  hamstrung in their ability to protect small businesses and workers in  self-funded plans.   Utilizing these icky ICHRA plans, employers can also push those with  preexisting conditions, women, and older workers into the individual  market with vouchers while keeping their younger and healthier  employees on employee-sponsored insurance. Therefore, the sick get  treated differently.  [[Page H3026]]  Those who have disabilities, who have had long-term chronic conditions,  could be treated very differently and put at great risk.   I think for all these reasons that this legislation should be soundly  rejected. This is an opportunity to defend all that the Affordable Care  Act has meant to Americans and offer that opportunity to more people  rather than deception that is the hallmark of this bill and following  the Trump approach that junk insurance is what would be most available  to Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Madam Chair, I would say to the gentleman from Michigan,  I am sure there are many Republicans who want to assure good healthcare  to all people. The problem is with this specific bill.   The one-page amendment that I offered could have guaranteed these  ICHRA employees that they would face no discrimination among classes of  employees and no barrier of preexisting conditions.   That clarification would have solved this problem, and their failure  repeatedly to accept that one-page amendment, with no explanation other  than that they wanted to do the same thing, or that it was duplicative,  betrays the promise of this bill and suggests that discrimination and  denial of coverage based on preexisting conditions is what Americans in  these plans will face.   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, our colleague from  Missouri (Mr. Smith) closed by saying that his goal is to cut red tape.  Well, that is a goal that I think all of us can share, but I am afraid  that this bill, as written, will only throw more Americans into the red  and into medical debt, which is already high despite the protections  that we have provided to date.   There are so many families overwhelmed by medical debt, and some who  will be denied the opportunity to get the protection they need from  their healthcare providers because they simply cannot afford it.   Madam Chair, I would say at the appropriate time I will offer a  motion to recommit to this bill and send it back to committee. If the  House rules permit it, I would have offered this motion with an  appropriate amendment to the bill.   My amendment would ensure that this bill does not take effect unless  the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that this bill  will not result in anyone losing access to coverage of essential health  benefits or see their healthcare costs rise, the very objective that  the gentleman from Virginia has been discussing.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.   Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3799 to the Committee on  Ways and Means with instructions to report the same back to the House  forthwith, with the following amendment:   Add at the end the following new title:                          TITLE VI--EFFECTIVE DATE       SEC. 601. EFFECTIVE DATE.         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the       provisions of this Act and the amendments made by this Act       shall not apply unless the Secretary of Health and Human       Services submits to Congress a certification that such       provisions and amendments will not result in--        (1) individuals losing access to coverage of essential       health benefits (as defined for purposes of section 1302(b)       of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C.       18022(b))); or        (2) higher costs to individuals for coverage that includes       such benefits.     Madam Chair, I hope my colleagues will join us in  supporting it, recommitting this, pursuing the objective of better  healthcare for all, and protecting all Americans from preexisting  condition barriers, and ensuring they are not the subject of  discrimination.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment has a rather nominal effect in not improving what is a  very bad and deceptive bill.   It is appealing to talk about rural areas. I am concerned about those  rural areas, about the chicken pluckers, about the meatpackers, about  the field workers, and the way they will be discriminated against under  this bill.   I will elaborate on that. While this is mainly a Republican caucus  that follows the seditious pied piper who was our President, in this  case, even under the Trump administration, when they considered this  kind of proposal, the Treasury Department, the Labor Department, and  the Health and Human Services Department came together and recognized  the danger of discriminating against different classes of employees.   Ultimately, unfortunately, the Trump administration did not provide  the protection against discrimination, so that people who are working  in rural areas under this bill may be discriminated against by their  employer as a result of this legislation.   It is the failure to have clear language in this bill to prevent such  discrimination against rural workers, in favor of those who are in the  office towers managing everything, that is at the heart of our  opposition, as well as the refusal to provide protection and guarantees  against people being denied as a result of their preexisting  conditions.   Rural Americans are more likely to die from heart disease, cancer,  stroke, unintentional injury, and respiratory disease. Yet, we would  take our sickest workers, our most vulnerable low-income workers, and  deny them a comprehensive employer plan with many protections and allow  them to be the subject of discrimination.   There has already been too much discrimination against rural areas  and rural workers. We ought to prevent it, not make it worse.   There are no guarantees that these people can find any coverage with  their ICHRA plan, let alone affordable and quality coverage.   I think rural Americans deserve far better than this amendment to try  to put a patch on a very sorry bill that undermines the protections of  the Affordable Care Act that has offered great benefit to so many  Americans, and I urge everyone to vote ``no.''   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I would say that the only education that would be really  helpful on this bill would be to educate both employers and employees  about all the shortcomings of this bill.   Educating employers that they ought not to be discriminating against  classes of workers and treating the rural, hardworking employees there  at lower wages differently where they get an ICHRA policy that denies  them preexisting conditions, that denies them the essential benefits  under the Affordable Care Act, while the folks in the city in  management get treated differently--they get a concierge kind of  treatment that is not available to the rural workers. Just educating  about this bill, which allows that discrimination, would not accomplish  much of anything.   I think what we are going to see with this kind of legislation is  more and more workers in rural areas, as well as urban areas, who face  discrimination and who face great medical debt because these plans are  so weak. They are junk insurance that will deny the benefits that most  people need.   Educating about them, if truthful education, if not the kind of  deception that is buried in this bill, educating about them will only  tell people the limitations and the shortcomings. Otherwise, it will be  a kind of education that covers up, as this bill does, the great harm  that is being done in denying folks access to a family physician with  the protection that is there.   Remember that in moving to these ICHRA plans, we already know that 95  percent of those that are in ICHRA plans today, that have this icky  kind of coverage, are people who once had good group health insurance  that I would like to see available to more Americans.   Again, I urge my colleagues to definitely vote ``no'' on this  amendment and vote ``no'' on this sorry bill and support our motion to  recommit.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The ACTING Chair. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I don't believe that we have noted yet in the course of  this debate the great irony, the fact that this is called the CHOICE  Arrangement Act, that we have some pro-choice Republicans here who want  to give employers the choice and allow them to discriminate against  different classes of their own employees. All of this is happening the  same horrible anniversary week of the Supreme Court's wrongful decision  to overturn decades of reliance upon Roe v. Wade and to eliminate the  right to an abortion with an effect on women's healthcare that is so  far-reaching that it is affecting our colleges of medicine across the  country and delivery of healthcare to women who may never have been  involved in the slightest way with an abortion.                                time  1700    They called this healthcare freedom today. I call it the repression  and the interference with the basic healthcare rights of women.   By the terms of their own amendment, patients and doctors should make  healthcare decisions, not government bureaucrats or insurance  companies. The CHOICE Arrangement Act comes at the same time that they  interfere with what happens in our bedrooms and our doctors' offices  and, most recently, even in our kitchens.   They would sentence patients under this basic legislation with  preexisting conditions to a future of very few choices and no freedom.  With no choices for adequate and affordable healthcare, this  legislation guarantees one kind of prescription and one kind of  prescription only, and that is a prescription for personal bankruptcy  and unlimited medical debt from policies that do not provide essential  healthcare benefits.   It is really a shame that, in a country as wealthy as ours, we still  have millions of citizens who go without health coverage. Over 30  million Americans, in fact, lack coverage, and many in our home State  of Texas lack coverage because of the fact that our State legislature  and Governor were never willing to provide the guarantee we anticipated  with the Affordable Care Act of Medicaid expansion as most States have  done.   Patients do not have a choice, do not have freedom when they suffer a  heart attack or are diagnosed with a dreaded disease or a broken arm,  and they lack insurance coverage that provides them the benefits that  they need.   Under this amendment, which is a sense of Congress resolution that  really doesn't accomplish much of anything, this bill is not improved.  Americans would have so much skin in the game they would get burned  just as the Republican dirty fossil fuel plan would burn up our planet.   It is not just the Affordable Care Act that is being targeted today.  There is reference to socialized medicine of the kind that Newt  Gingrich once attacked in this body when he suggested Medicare should  ``wither on the vine.''   Contrary to Republican attacks, we have heard about public insurance  programs. Seniors on Medicare value their Medicare as do the 16 million  people who signed up for the Affordable Care Act this year.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this is the freedom resolution on the week  that we have the anniversary of the anti-choice Dobbs decision as part  of the CHOICE Arrangement Act.   Well, I am reminded of the lyrics of a famous Janis Joplin song:  ``Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.'' No choice is  left. No freedom is left. This is our future under Republican plans--so  much to lose, nothing left tomorrow.   We need to protect more Americans from the dangers of health debt and  bankruptcy. We need to ensure broader coverage. There is a huge  coverage gap that is leaving perhaps as many as 2 million Texans  without coverage because of the failures and ideological objections of  our State Republican government.   Those Americans deserve the same protection that 16 million Americans  got when they signed up for the Affordable Care Act this year. They  have access to a family physician that is so very important. They have  access to the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act, getting  access to the kind of care that they need to ensure their family is  secure.   I believe that there are many improvements that are necessary in the  Affordable Care Act. We were limited in being able to make those  improvements when all we had for more than a decade were 60-plus  Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.    Let us reject this bill and this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this legislation, I  recognize the importance of our engagement with Taiwan economically, as  well as our military presence to deter conflict and to maintain safe  passage through the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. These are  international waters.   This incomplete trade agreement that we take up is a modest first  step and can only be enforced after the approval by this Congress. The  work that we are already doing with Taiwan benefits businesses across  America. Taiwan is already our ninth largest goods trading partner with  over $90 billion in two-way trade during 2020.   We have seen the People's Republic of China, unfortunately, violently  suppress democracy in Hong Kong, breaching its claim that it would  support one country and two systems. We have seen, apparently, over a  million Uyghurs who have been placed in concentration camps. There is  every reason to be concerned by the threats the PRC has made about the  future of democracy in Taiwan.   The opportunity tonight is not only to speak up for Taiwan, but as  Chairman Smith indicated, to reaffirm the role that Congress plays not  only with Taiwan, but with all of our trading partners.   No administration, neither Democratic nor Republican, can adopt  trading agreements that are enforceable without Congress exercising its  constitutional responsibility for international trade. We will not  yield that authority. It applies not only here, but to every trading  partner.   We do, as we move forward in supporting Taiwan economically and  militarily, need to recognize as well that it is not a matter of  abandoning Taiwan to talk with China, to seek to avoid war with the  People's Republic of China, which would be disastrous for the entire  world. While effective military deterrence, strong deterrence is  essential, this trading engagement is important. Our diplomatic power  is also important, and, in that regard, the recent Republican attacks  on Secretary of State Blinken for attempting to normalize diplomatic  relations in Beijing are outrageous and totally counterproductive.   As a member of the Taiwan Caucus here in the House, I salute  Taiwanese Americans, particularly their contribution to my hometown of  Austin, and to the valuable insights that they have given me about the  importance of our relationship with Taiwan.
