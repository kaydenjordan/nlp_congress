 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize  the tremendous and meaningful work of Howard Simon, executive director  of the ACLU of Florida.   Mr. Simon is retiring this year following a distinguished career  defending civil rights and civil liberties that lasted longer than that  of any other ACLU leader in the country. Prior to his appointment as  executive director of the Florida affiliate in 1997, Mr. Simon led the  fight to defend civil rights and civil liberties in Michigan, where he  served as ACLU director for 23 years.   His 21 years at the ACLU of Florida make him the longest serving ACLU  director in the country, and his cumulative 44-year career as a State  director is the longest in the ACLU's 98-year history.   As a student at City College of New York in 1965, Mr. Simon joined  fellow student leaders to travel to Selma, Alabama, to march for voting  rights alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This experience started a  decades-long career fighting for the rights guaranteed to all Americans  under the United States Constitution.   In his time as executive director at the ACLU of Florida, Mr. Simon  oversaw landmark work defending the rights of LGBTQ Floridians,  protecting immigrants, reforming our criminal justice system,  protecting free speech, preserving women's health, and strengthening  the right to vote. The rights that Floridians enjoy would not be the  same without the tireless work of this champion of liberty.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Howard Simon my dear friend, and I  join my fellow Floridians in thanking him for his thoughtful and  compassionate work to safeguard our civil liberties and for helping to  make the United States a more perfect union for us all.                            ____________________
