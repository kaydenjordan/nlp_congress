 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Trump  administration's recently announced action of peeling back the many  layers of the Affordable Care Act. For millions of hardworking  Americans who have carried the burden of this law, relief is finally on  the way. President Trump's first order of business was to issue an  executive order to begin reversing the damages of the Affordable Care  Act and start to minimize costs for consumers.   Under the ACA, premiums have skyrocketed while access to health care  has dwindled for many Americans, including many of whom reside in my  own California's First District. The American people have spoken. They  want this disastrous law repealed. Grand claims of 20 to 30 million  newly covered are obscured by the fact that over 6 million would rather  pay the penalty because they can't afford the Affordable Care Act.   The quick action taken by President Trump will aid our efforts in  Congress to both repeal and replace the ACA with something better. The  American people have suffered through the nightmare that is ACA.  Luckily, they won't have to do so for much longer.                            ____________________
