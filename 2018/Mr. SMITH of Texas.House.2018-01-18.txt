 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President highlighted  examples of media bias and irresponsible news stories. All Americans  should call out purveyors of fake news and point out slanted coverage.   The President is certainly correct in using the term ``fake news'' to  describe the media when they intentionally misrepresent his comments  and take them out of context. They intentionally omit relevant facts  and only report one side of the story, and they intentionally promote a  liberal agenda.   In a democracy, the media have a profound responsibility to give the  American people the facts, not tell them what to think.                            ____________________
