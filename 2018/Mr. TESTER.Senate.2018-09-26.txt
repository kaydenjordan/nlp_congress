 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory of  an outstanding Montanan and leader.   Elizabeth Fullon served as interim dean at Montana State University  Billings City College, an Air Force Reservist, and an advocate for  veterans and students in Montana.   Like many of us, Elizabeth was deeply affected by the September 11  attacks. A member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard at the time,  she was on base when the planes hit and worked for months around the  clock in the aftermath.   Her service eventually brought her to Billings, where she wanted to  find a way to honor the first responders who gave so much that day.  Anyone who has been to Montana's 9/11 Memorial at City College has seen  the fruits of her labor. Elizabeth secured a grant to bring a 612-pound  I-beam from one of the Twin Towers to Billings to serve as the  centerpiece for the memorial.   The memorial serves as a reminder of the selflessness of the 9/11  first responders and as a reminder of those who lost their lives on  that horrible day. Elizabeth's efforts in making the memorial possible  ensure Montanans can pay tribute and respect the brave Americans who,  then and now, rush into danger whenever it calls, to keep us safe.   Elizabeth's legacy was one of service, and I stand today to thank her  and to ask that we remember her by taking a moment to honor the heroes  in each of our lives.                            ____________________
