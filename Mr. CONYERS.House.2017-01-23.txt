 Mr. Speaker, within hours of taking the oath as  President of the United States, Donald Trump signaled that his much  touted ``New Deal for Black America'' is just the same ``old deal'' of  discrimination, voter suppression and establishment entitlement. In  politics, as in life, actions always speak louder than words. And the  speed of his repudiation of the inclusive agenda of the Obama  administration shouts his intention to turn back the clock on civil  rights for a broad swath of our nation.   Since the Supreme Court suspended the application of Section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County Case, African American  communities around the nation have fought the passage of discriminatory  voter identification laws as part of a scheme to suppress the vote. The  states of Texas and North Carolina have been particular battlegrounds,  where important victories were achieved in the federal courts. The work  of civil rights advocacy groups received important support from the  Voting Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division in reversing some of  the most aggressive state-passed voter suppression plans.   As many have feared, the election of Trump threatens to produce a  radical change in support for voting rights from the White House.  Unlike even President George W. Bush, who signed the reauthorization of  Section 5 of the VRA, Trump has exhibited an hostility to voting rights  not seen since the Civil Rights era.   By Friday afternoon, lawyers for the Department asked for a delay in  the hearing scheduled for tomorrow on the Texas voter ID case, citing  the change in presidential administrations. The motion noted that  ``Because of the change in administration, the Department of Justice  also experienced a transition in leadership, . . . and requires  additional time to brief the new leadership of the Department on this  case and the issues to be addressed at the hearing before making any  representations to the Court.'' It is generally expected that DOJ will  reverse course in the case.   This case is a bellwether of what can be expected from a Trump DOJ on  civil rights. Given the size of Texas and the precedential impact of  the case, the stakes in this litigation could not be higher for the  minority community.   The voting law at issue in the case, known as SB 14, set strict  requirements for permissible ID to vote. While it included such  identification as a driver's license, passport and a concealed handgun  license, it excluded identification like federal government or student  IDs.   In July, the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans  ruled that the law violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because  it disproportionately affected minorities. The Department of Justice  had previously argued that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and  was intended to directly impact the abilities of minorities to vote, as  more than 600,000 minorities lacked the ID necessary under state law to  vote.   The belief that the Civil Rights Division will change position and  will be under attack is well founded. Last Thursday, it was reported  that the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Violence  Against Women Grants and the Legal Services Corporation would be target  for elimination and the Civil Rights Division would have its funding  cut as part of Trump plan for reducing the size of the federal  government.   Most troubling, it was also reported that John M. Gore, an attorney  who led the legal teams on several key cases attacking civil rights,  would be the head of DOJ' s Civil Rights Division as the Deputy  Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.   Gore was one of the defense attorneys who argued in court on behalf  of North Carolina's legally dubious and discriminatory anti-transgender  bill HB2. The bill blocks transgender people from using public  bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The bottom line here  is that Gore was on the side of discrimination in the country's most  high-profile LGBTQ rights case of the past year. (Many will recall that  this legislation generated a huge economic backlash against the state,  including the relocation of major sporting events).   His record of being a legal champion for discriminatory causes  appears to be a highlight of Gore's legal career. One of his main areas  of expertise appears to be defending redistricting plans against claims  of civil rights violations, with his online bio boasting of a number of  successful such defenses.   One of the most high-profile civil rights cases Gore has litigated in  recent years is the Florida Purge case. This case brought many of us to  the floor to denounce yet another attempt at voter suppression that was  designed to alter the balance of state politics. The state of Florida  was found to have violated the National Voter Registration Act with a  systemic purge of voters it suspected of being non-citizens. As the New  York Times wrote of Florida's voter restriction attempt:         The program to identify and remove noncitizens from the       rolls prompted a national outcry and several lawsuits in 2012       because it was riddled with mistakes and was being pushed       through months before the election. A number of people on the       lists, which were sent by the state to county election       supervisors, were, in fact, citizens (including the two lead       plaintiffs in the lawsuit).    Just as we opposed the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions to serve as  Attorney General, we must similarly build a record against John Gore to  head the Civil Rights Division. We simply cannot entrust our legacy  civil rights statutes to any person who has shown a lack of sensitivity  and balance in protecting the interests of justice in our society.   Though Trump's inaugural speech invoked an image of my home City of  Detroit, I fear what his vision will mean for my community and vow to  continue the struggle for jobs, justice and peace. He stated that ``the  time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.'' I take  him at his word and his actions send an unmistakable message: His  action is to appoint a defender of discrimination to head the Civil  Rights Division. His action is to retreat from an agenda on Community  Oriented Policing. His action is to undermine affordable healthcare.  His action is to appoint cabinet officials who fail to represent the  mosaic that is America.   The Congressional Black Caucus took to this floor tonight to outline  our response to the President's Inaugural Address & New Deal for  African-Americans. While our views may not find much in common, I  believe we can agree on this: the time for talk is indeed over and the  hour for action has arrived. This caucus will not stand idly by while  an administration attempts to turn back the clock. The greatness of  America is found in its diversity, inclusiveness and empathy. That is  why we are the beacon on the hill. Whether we fly, walk or crawl, we  are committed to moving this nation forward and will not turn back.  [[Page H606]]
