 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and legacy of U.S. Capitol Police Officer William Evans.   This week, we pay our respects to Officer Evans' life of service as  he was remembered with a congressional tribute and lying in honor in  the United States Capitol rotunda.   Officer Evans was a beloved father, husband, brother, son, and  friend.   He was a dedicated officer, joining the U.S. Capitol Police on March  7, 2003, and servicing for 18 years. In addition to patrolling the  north barricade, Officer Evans was a member of the Capitol Division's  First Responder's Unit.   Officer Evans was a member of our Capitol family, and I want to send  my heartfelt condolences to the Evans family for their loss.   Mr. Speaker, let's take this time to remember Officer Evans and to  thank each and every member of U.S. Capitol Police and National Guard  members here on the Capitol Grounds for their continued service to keep  us safe.                            ____________________
