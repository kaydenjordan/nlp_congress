 Mr. Speaker, every student deserves the opportunity to  receive an education that empowers them to excel. They are our Nation's  future and should have the opportunity to attend a school that best  suits them, whether it is public or private, charter or other.   This week is not about placing private education over public school  education. Many Americans have access to great public schools, but many  do not. School choice increases options available for families and  incentivizes improvement of all schools.   Nobody knows what is best for their children more than a parent does,  and a student's ZIP Code should not determine their destiny. School  choice policies are a great equalizer and increase opportunity for  students no matter where they live.   Education savings accounts, like those recently implemented in Iowa,  and my colleague Adrian Smith's legislation, the Educational Choice for  Children's Act, which provides a tax credit for those who fund  scholarship awards for K-12 students, are two examples of policies that  will increase opportunity for millions of children across America.   As a Member of Congress, I look forward to supporting such proposals.                            ____________________
