 Madam Speaker, there comes a time to dispel the myth  that we must choose between women's rights and children's rights. Now  is the time because we can protect both.   Sadly, abortion reveals society's inability to love, to protect, and  to care for the most innocent and helpless among us.   When we devalue life, our society suffers. When we deem some to be  nonessential, we devalue their lives.   I am strongly pro-life, and I consistently stand up for the rights of  the unborn and the born.   Our society is willing to and does care for the mother in need.  Perhaps she is scared and alone. Americans across the country reach out  to help mothers and the children that they are nourishing in their  wombs.   I must rise today to express my grave concern that our Democrat  colleagues' proposed spending bill lacks crucial protections that  ensure that taxpayer funds do not pay for abortions.   Without this protection, taxpayer-funded abortions not only harm us  as a society but violate the religious freedoms of thousands of  Americans.   The longstanding, bipartisan Hyde amendment ensures just that, that  taxpayer funds do not go toward abortion. However, the Democrats'  currently proposed multitrillion-dollar build back broke plan does not  contain those lifesaving protections.   In 1994, then-Senator Joe Biden wrote, ``Those of us who are opposed  to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.''   In God we trust.                            ____________________
