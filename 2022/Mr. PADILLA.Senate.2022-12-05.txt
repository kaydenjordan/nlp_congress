 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the bill  that I introduced today to help ensure the financial stability of  smaller credit unions.   Congress created the Central Liquidity Facility in 1978 to improve  the general financial stability of credit unions by serving as a  liquidity lender to credit unions experiencing unusual or unexpected  liquidity shortfalls.   Unfortunately, under current law, smaller credit unions often do not  have access to the critical tool that could help them address liquidity  shortfalls, especially amid higher interest rates.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with  Senator Cramer to allow corporate credit unions to buy Central  Liquidity Facility capital stock for a chosen subset of its members  rather than all of its members for the next 5 years. This would provide  greater flexibility for smaller unions to use the Central Liquidity  Facility's services.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill to meet the  needs of our Nation's 5,000 credit unions and the communities they  serve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Mr. Graham):   S. 5185. A bill to amend the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to make  improvements to that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.
