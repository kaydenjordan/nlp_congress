 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protecting  Our Kids Act.   Over the last 20 years, we have lost thousands of lives--thousands of  lives--  [[Page H5376]]  to mass shootings. Gun violence is now the leading cause of death of  children in America. Let me repeat: Gun violence is now the top cause  of death of children in America.   This legislation is not perfect, but if we can save one, two, three  lives by passing this legislation, then it is worth our effort.   It is our obligation to pass this legislation. Our thoughts and  prayers are not enough. We have to act and act now, and I call on my  colleagues to join us in voting in favor of protecting our kids.
