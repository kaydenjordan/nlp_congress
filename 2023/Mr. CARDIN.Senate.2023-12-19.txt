(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 12-39; Date: July       20, 2012; Implementing Agency: Army.  [[Page S6056]]         Funding Source: National Funds.        (iii) Description: On July 20, 2012, Congress was notified       by Congressional certification transmittal number 12-39, of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of 4 UH-60M Black Hawk Helicopters, 10 T700-GE-      701D Engines (8 installed and 2 spares), warranty, support       equipment, spare and repair parts, personnel training and       training equipment, publications and technical data, U.S.       Government and contractor technical assistance, and other       related logistics support. The estimated cost was $235       million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $170       million of this total.        On July 28, 2017, CN 0M-16 reported the inclusion of eight       (8) H-764ACE Embedded Global Position System (GPS)/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) units as MDE. Although the value of       the EGI was included in the total value of the case and the       original notification, it was not enumerated as MDE in the       original notification. Upgrading the status of this equipment       to MDE did not result in a net increase in cost of MDE. The       total case value remained $235 million.        On October 17, 2018, CN 0Q-18 reported the addition of two       spare Embedded Global Position System (GPS)/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) units valued at $371,970. These       additions did not result in an increase to the MDE cost of       $170 million or to the total case value of $235 million.        On April 21, 2021, CN 21-0H reported the addition of the       following additional MDE items: 1) eight (8) UH-60M Black       Hawk helicopters in standard USG configuration with       designated unique equipment and Government Furnished       Equipment (GFE); and 2) seventeen (17) T700-GE-70lD engines       (includes 1 spare). The following non-MDE items were also       included: H-764ACE/EAGLE+429 Embedded Global Position System/      Inertial Navigation Systems (EGIs); AN/APX-117A       Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponders; AN/ARC-201E       RT-l478E (or designated replacement); MXF-4027 radios (or       designated replacement); Aviation Mission Planning Systems       (AMPS); Engine Inlet Barrier Filter (EIBF) System; External       Rescue Hoist (ERH); C-406 Emergency Locator Transmitter       (ELT); LRIP Crew Chief Gunner Seats; basic aircraft warranty;       CONUS and OCONUS air worthiness support; calibration       services; spare and repair parts; aviation and peculiar       ground support equipment; communication equipment;       publications and technical documentation; personnel and       equipment training; site surveys; special tools and test       equipment; U.S. Government and contractor technical and       logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The addition of these items       resulted in a net increase in MDE cost of $240 million,       resulting in a revised MDE cost of $410 million. The       additional non-MDE items resulted in a net increase of $100       million. The total estimated case value increased to $575       million.        On November 21, 2022, CN 0S-22 reported the inclusion of       the following MDE items to replace the previously notified,       now unavailable/obsolete H-764ACE/EAGLE+429 EGIs: ten (10)       Embedded Global Position System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation       Systems (EGI). The estimated total value of the added MDE       items was $1,350,000 but did not increase the MDE cost of       $410 million. The estimated total case value remained $575       million.        This transmittal reports the inclusion of an additional       eight (8) Embedded Global Position System (GPS)/Inertial       Navigation System (EGI)+429 with SAASM and/or M-Code (MDE).       The estimated total value of the added MDE items is       $1,350,000. These items will not increase the MDE cost of       $410 million. The total case value will remain $575 million.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided       because the additional MDE items were not enumerated in the       original notification. The inclusion of this MDE represents       an increase in capability over what was previously notified.       The proposed sale will support Thailand's ongoing effort to       modernize its armed forces by updating its military       capabilities and improving interoperability with the United       States and other allies.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       helping to improve the security of a Major Non-NATO ally       which is an important force for political stability and       economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The Sensitivity of Technology Statement contained in the       previous notification applies to items reported here.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 18, 2023.                            ____________________
