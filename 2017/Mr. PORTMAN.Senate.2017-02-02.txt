 Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about a problem  that is affecting every single one of the States represented in this  Chamber and every one of our communities. It is one that folks back  home are, unfortunately, experiencing and, frankly, we don't talk  enough about this in Washington. It is this epidemic of heroin and  prescription drug abuse.   How bad is it? We just learned very recently that for the first time  in 23 years, life expectancy in the United States has gone down, and  there is no question that the surge in heroin and prescription drug  addiction is one of the reasons. In fact, the demographic that saw the  biggest drop in life expectancy was among middle-aged White women--the  very group that has been hardest hit by the heroin and prescription  drug epidemic in overdoses and overdose deaths. Unbelievably, this  epidemic is actually driving down life expectancy in our great country.   It has been pretty dramatic. The number of heroin users in the United  States has tripled since 2007, and the number of heroin overdoses has  tripled just since 2012. It has gotten to the point where we are now  losing one American life about every 12 minutes to this epidemic. So  during this talk today, which will be about 12 minutes, we expect  another American to die of a heroin overdose.   Congress has begun to act, and I applaud the House and the Senate for  that. We have acted over the last year to do a couple things. One is  that, in the appropriations bill that passed at the end of last year,  we put more money aside for treatment. So States are now receiving  grants--$500 million this year, $500 million next year. These grants  are needed. It is going to the hardest hit States. It is going to  States based on their need, which I think is very important, because  some States are hit harder than others. My colleague from Ohio is here  on the floor, and he has been very involved in this issue as well. My  State has been one of those States hardest hit. Some think that Ohio  now has the highest number of overdoses when we add prescription drugs,  heroin, and synthetic heroin, like fentanyl.   Second, last summer Congress took what I think is the biggest step we  have taken in decades in terms of fighting this issue when we passed  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The President signed it  into law. It is already helping with regard to providing more  prevention efforts, treatment, and long-term recovery. It is also  helping our law enforcement and other first responders to be able to  handle this growing crisis.   We fully funded this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--also  called CARA--this year, and now we need to ensure that the new  administration that has just come in continues to effectively implement  this program as quickly as possible.   Just in the last few weeks, three of CARA's grant programs got up and  running. One is funding for drug courts. Those who are involved with  drug courts back home already know this, but it is a very effective way  to take those who are in the criminal justice system because of a drug  issue--prescription drug and heroin issues in particular--and get them  into a diversion program where they can get treatment, with the risk of  going back to incarceration if they do not stay clean. This is really  working well in some of our communities in Ohio. They are also using  interesting new techniques, including a medication called VIVITROL, to  keep people off of their addiction.   Second, we have just put in place for the first time ever programs  for recovery support services. Again, in this legislation, CARA, we  funded long-term recovery. So it is not just a detox center, not just a  treatment center that might be short term, which they usually are, but  longer term recovery, including getting people into sober housing,  providing them with people who will support them and encourage them.  That, we have found out, keeps people from relapsing and is incredibly  powerful.   Third, there has been a grant to empower States and local governments  to help fight this epidemic.   This is all-important. It is real progress. But our work is far from  done. In fact, there are five more CARA grant programs yet to be  implemented.   Again, I call on the new administration to do so urgently. I know  they are focused on this issue. We just need to get these programs up  and going to help our communities right now.   Near my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, the Winemiller family of Wayne  Township had a pretty tough Christmas. They were missing a son and a  daughter because of heroin. Over Easter weekend last year, Roger  Winemiller found his daughter Heather dead of a heroin overdose in  their bathroom. She left behind an 8-year-old son. Then, just 5 days  before Christmas, Heather's brother Gene--a father of three children  under 18--died of a heroin overdose. Gene started abusing painkillers  when he was in his early twenties. He became addicted, and when the  pills were too expensive, he switched to heroin, which is cheaper and,  really, more accessible.    Unfortunately, this is a fairly common story in my home State and  around the country. We are told this is how four out of five heroin  addicts in the United States started on heroin--prescription drugs.   Heather and Gene both got clean several times. Heather was clean for  3 years before she relapsed and died. These were vibrant people; they  loved life. Heather loved gardening, and she was a huge Ohio State  Buckeyes fan. Gene loved rock music, hunting, and fishing. But they  both made the tragic mistake of trying these drugs, and it changed  their lives forever.   Gene Winemiller's funeral took place at Blanchester Church of Christ  in Blanchester, OH. I know Blanchester, OH, pretty well. It is a small  community of about 4,000 people. The very next day, there was another  funeral in that same church in this small town of 4,000 people for a  heroin overdose. As Gene's dad Roger puts it, ``I can't emphasize  enough: No one--no one--is immune from this epidemic.''   Unfortunately, he is right. It knows no zip code. It is in the rural  areas. It is in the suburban areas. It is certainly in our inner  cities. It is everywhere.  [[Page S650]]    Take Cleveland, in Northeast Ohio, for example. Cleveland medical  examiner Thomas Gilson said that ``2016 was an unprecedented year.''  The number of overdoses in Cleveland doubled in 2016 compared to 2015-- doubled. Overdoses are happening all over the Cleveland area. More than  150 heroin overdose deaths happened in the city and another 150  happened in the suburbs, kind of evenly split. It is everybody, every  group, every age group--African American, White, Hispanic.   Take Dayton, OH, in Southwest Ohio, as another example. In Dayton  last year, there were more than 2,500 overdoses, about 7 a day. About  half of the victims were men, and about half were women--some in the  cities and some in the suburbs, with 60 percent in their thirties and  forties and 40 percent who were either younger or older than that. So  this is happening all over our State and all over our country--in  cities, suburbs, inner cities, and rural areas and to rich and poor,  old and young alike.   In 2015, Ohio statewide experienced a record 3,050 drug overdose  deaths, which is a 20-percent increase from 2014, and more than  quadruple the number of overdose deaths in 2000. In 2015, we lost an  Ohioan every 3 hours to this epidemic. Sadly, the toll was even higher  in 2016. We don't have the final numbers yet.   One of Ohio's economic assets, of course, is our location. We are  centrally located. It is great for transportation. They say half of  America's consumers are within 1 day's drive from Cincinnati,  Cleveland, and Columbus. Unfortunately, that central location also  makes us very vulnerable to drug traffickers.   Last year, Ohio State troopers confiscated nearly 160 pounds of  heroin. Depending on the potency, that could be equivalent to more than  $50 million--or more than 180,000 injections--of heroin. That is nearly  triple the amount of heroin seized the year before. The Ohio State  Highway Patrol also confiscated a record-level number of illegal  painkillers and methamphetamines last year.   We have to thank our law enforcement officers because they are saving  lives every day by keeping this poison out of our communities,  certainly, but also helping to reverse the overdoses with this miracle  drug called naloxone or Narcan. In 2015, the last year we have numbers  for, Narcan was administered 16,000 times. Think about that: 16,000  people were saved who could have died of an overdose, thanks to our  first responders and their professionalism. We don't have numbers yet  for 2016, but, again, it is going to be, unfortunately, far higher than  that.   The Washington Post recently published a report on the heroin  epidemic in Chillicothe, OH, where there were more than 300 overdoses  last year, and where a single police officer, Officer Ben Rhodes, says  that he used naloxone to reverse an overdose more than 50 times. One  church in Chillicothe, Zion Baptist Church, recently had funerals for  three overdose victims in 1 week. I know Chillicothe. It is a small  town of about 21,000 people.   Heroin and prescription drug painkillers are flooding our communities  to meet a rise in demand. CARA, this legislation I talked about, will  reduce that demand by increasing access to treatment for those who need  it and preventing new addictions from starting in the first place  through better prevention and education efforts.   After CARA became law, I introduced bipartisan legislation to take  another step. This is called the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose  Prevention Act, or the STOP Act. Again, it builds on CARA because it  helps reduce the supply of drugs coming into our communities.   Some of the deadliest drugs coming into Ohio are synthetics--drugs  such as fentanyl, carfentanil, or U4, essentially synthetic heroin that  is made in a laboratory somewhere. Guess where these drugs are coming  from: overseas. Boy, they are incredibly powerful. Fentanyl can be more  than 50 or even 100 times as powerful as heroin. According to the Drug  Enforcement Agency, it takes about 2 milligrams to kill you.  Carfentanil is even more powerful than that--up to 10,000 times as  powerful as morphine. It is so powerful that it is used primarily as a  tranquilizer for large animals like elephants.   Heroin bought on the street today in Ohio and elsewhere is often  laced with these drugs to make it more potent. Roger Winemiller, the  Dad I talked about a few moments ago who lost his two kids, compares  buying heroin to playing Russian roulette because you never know the  potency of the drug that you are buying. Many of these spates of  overdoses in our urban areas in Ohio are because of the mix with  fentanyl and carfentanil.   These fentanyl deaths in Ohio have increased nearly fivefold in the  last 3 years. Three years ago we had about 1 in every 20 overdoses in  Ohio because of fentanyl. Now it is one in five. We expect it soon to  be one in three. You can see where this is going.   I talked a minute ago about the trafficking of drugs on our  interstate highways. That is a serious problem, but so is the problem  of traffickers shipping these drugs through our mail system to our  communities to meet this growing demand.   Just yesterday the U.S.-China Commission released a report about the  trafficking of Chinese fentanyl into this country. The report says:         The majority of fentanyl products found in the United       States originate in China. . . . Chinese law enforcement       officials have struggled to adequately regulate the thousands       of chemical and pharmaceutical facilities [laboratories]       operating legally and illegally in the country, leading to       increased production and export of illicit chemicals and       drugs. Chinese chemical exporters . . . covertly ship drugs       to the Western hemisphere.    That is from a report just yesterday. Right now these drugs are  difficult to detect before it is too late. Part of the reason is that,  unlike private carriers such as UPS or FedEx, the Postal Service does  not require information about packages. If you are a private carrier,  you have to have electric customs data for packages coming into the  country, saying where it is from, what is in it, where it is going.  This means the U.S. Postal Service is a more attractive way for  traffickers to get these dangerous drugs like fentanyl or carfentanil  into our country. It shouldn't be this way. It doesn't have to be this  way.   The STOP Act would close that loophole and make the Postal Service  require advanced electronic data. Where is it coming from? What is in  it? Where is it going? That information on these packages before they  cross our borders would be incredibly helpful. It is common sense. It  would help stop these dangerous synthetic drugs from being trafficked  into the United States, and it would save lives. That is what our law  enforcement officials are telling us.   I know the scope of this epidemic is daunting. It is in your State of  Indiana. It is in my State of Ohio. Its consequences are hard to even  think about because it is about the overdose deaths, but it is far more  than that. It is about people not being able to live out their dream.  It is about higher costs for law enforcement. It is about crime. It is  about our workforce and people not being able to go to work and not  being able to find workers who are drug free. It is about so much that  affects our communities.   Yet there is hope. We have to work here in Congress to continue to  promote legislation and policies that will help us to achieve the dream  of turning this tide around. The STOP Act that I talked about is going  to help keep some of that poison out of our communities and increase  the cost of heroin. That is good.   These synthetic heroin increases are really concerning. Treatment is  incredibly important, and it can work. I have met so many people across  Ohio who have beaten their addiction--people who are now back on their  feet, back with their kids, back with their families. It is hard, but  with treatment and a supportive environment, particularly this longer  term recovery, it can be done.   Last year I met with Aaron Marks in Columbus, OH, at a conference  held by the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities.  Aaron is from Cleveland, a suburb called Beachwood. He began using  prescription painkillers as a freshman at Beachwood High School. He was  just 13 years old.   Again, it is a story that is all too common. Often because of an  accident or injury, people start using these pain pills.   He was smart, had good grades. He got into the University of  Cincinnati, a great school. One day at UC he ran out  [[Page S651]]  of pills. A fellow student who was living in the same dorm room offered  him something else. He said: It is cheaper; it is called heroin.   He tried it. Soon, he had sold virtually everything he owned to buy  more. Finally, with the help of Glenbeigh treatment center in  Cleveland, OH, Aaron got clean and has stayed that way for more than a  decade. Aaron is now a successful manager of business development at  American Express.   We can have a lot more success stories like Aaron's if we all  engage--all of us. Washington, DC, is not going to solve this problem.  It will be solved in our communities. It is going to be solved in our  families. It is going to be solved in our hearts.   Washington, DC, can play a more constructive role. In passing this  legislation, it makes sense to give people the tools they need to be  able to fight this scourge. The role is put the right policies in  place, like the STOP Act, like fully funding treatment, like fully  funding CARA in the coming months. We can then bring down the demand  for these dangerous drugs, and we can keep these poisons from coming  into our communities and build on the progress that Congress has made  over the past year. Let's not let up until we finally turn the tide of  this epidemic and begin to save lives.   I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.
