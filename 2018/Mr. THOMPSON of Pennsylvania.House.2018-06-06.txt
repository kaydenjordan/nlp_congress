 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 74th  anniversary of the Allied D-Day invasion of France to honor the bravery  of our Armed Forces who served in that operation.   73,000 Americans took part in Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944.  This operation secured a beachhead on the European continent that began  the liberation of France and then the rest of Western Europe.   Sadly, the United States suffered more than 6,000 casualties in this  operation. Ultimately, thousands more U.S. servicemembers would fall in  the coming weeks and months liberating the rest of Western Europe from  German control.   The courage, bravery, and sacrifice displayed by our military on this  day continues to serve as an example for the cost of freedoms that we  enjoy in the United States today.   Mr. Speaker, I recently had the honor and the privilege of attending  a wreath-laying ceremony on Omaha Beach in Normandy at the Normandy  American Cemetery in France.   This memorial serves as a constant reminder to the world that the  United States will fight and die to protect the freedoms of not just  American citizens, but for citizens around the globe.                            ____________________
