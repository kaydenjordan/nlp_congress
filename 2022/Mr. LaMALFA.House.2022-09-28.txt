 Mr. Speaker, I am pointing to a map here showing the  several fires we have had in Northern California. This is only a small  snippet. There is much more besides that that I could show you.   This is mostly in my district, the First District of Northern  California here over several years. The Dixie fire being the big one  here last year, about a million acres. The Camp fire that a lot of  people have heard about that consumed the town of Paradise back in  2018; but there are many others.   So what am I talking about here today? The idea that rural America  isn't worth saving; isn't worth having. So as we contemplate fire after  fire and the recovery from there, there are those who are questioning  should we have rural towns anymore; should we have people living in  them; should we help them recover?   I go back to the root of the problem. First, I think the answer is  yes because we need rural towns. We need people out there that are the  productive people that used to do amazing things before regulations and  environmental groups shut them down; we would not have the products  that come from these areas.   So, not only rebuild them, but let's do the things that help them to  thrive. Because it isn't just about some jobs in a rural town, it is  also about everybody in this country prospering from the products that  come from there.   What am I talking about? In this area, timber, lumber products, paper  products. Heaven knows, we use a lot of paper around here. Do we want  that to come from the United States, from our workers, from our  productive lands, or do we want to continue as the United States, for  some reason, is the Number 2 importer of wood products in the world.  And yet, we are burning millions of acres across the West every year.  Why is that?   I could also say mining used to occur more heavily here and in other  parts, anywhere from Minnesota all through the Western States, as well.   And farming, which is under attack. The water is being taken away  from many of the farmers in my district and in California in general  because it is going for environmental purposes.   So yes, rural America feels under attack. So a recent Los Angeles  Times article comes out saying, should billions continue to be spent  rebuilding burned towns? This is the case for calling it quits.   I appreciate the L.A. Times is covering the fires that affected  California; most recently, the Dixie fire in the town of Greenville,  which is 75 percent wiped out from that fire; the town of Paradise 4  years before, 90 percent wiped out.   But I wish they would tell the whole story. They didn't tell my part  of the story. Yes, it is difficult to keep asking for money back in  D.C. to come help, whether it is one of my disasters--I am sure my  colleagues in the South like right now are dealing with in Florida. Do  they enjoy having to come back to help get rebuild money for Florida  after the hurricanes they are dealing with, or flood or what have you?   No, they don't enjoy that, and I don't think we want to have to ask  taxpayers for it.   But fire is something we can manage. We can't manage the weather. We  can't stop hurricanes. We can't stop other things like that. But do we  have the ability to manage our forests in such a way that towns would  not be subject so much to immediate wildfire; harvesting buffers around  them; putting fire breaks up, things like that.   And then when you do rebuild the town, they are building them with  newer, better materials for the housing and things like that. There are  underground power lines, so it is not going to be the same town that  went up a hundred years ago that started out as a timber town, as a  mining town, or even an ag town.   So it does improve. It does get better. It is worth the value  because, the bottom line is, even though we want to blame climate  change and say that is the big problem, we have got to kick people out  of rural areas; we have got to kick them out of these communities  because of climate change.   Well, if the climate is changing, then what are we going to do about  it? Are we going to not have timber products? Are we going to not  ensure the safety of those areas? Because we still need these people  out there producing these products. If you want to have electric cars,  someone has got to do some mining somewhere, right?   And the mandate keeps coming down the pike in my own State and more  and more around the country, and we are not going to have those  products. We are not going to have wood and timber products, paper  products coming from somewhere besides being imported; and you know  what happens when we get too dependent on import. Ask anybody getting  natural gas in Europe what that looks like.    Our food; everybody is seeing food prices skyrocketing at the  shelves, and sometimes that very shelf is empty. With all the acres  that got left out because the water got taken away this  [[Page H8125]]  year in California, food shelves are going to be even more empty and  prices even higher.   Someone in rural America has to be producing something. So for people  to say that well, climate change, times are changing, we have to shift  in a new direction, and we don't need these people there, and we don't  need these towns there, we do need these towns. We need them there, and  we need to help them to thrive by letting them manage the timber to  begin with.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Ian barrels toward the Florida  coast, residents are boarding up their homes, packing up their  families, and rushing to evacuate.   Across the State, FEMA is unloading barrels of fuel from our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve on evacuation routes to help those leaving  to fuel up. That is the correct intent of our Strategic Petroleum  Reserves, to help people in the event of a severe weather event or  other disaster.   But there is reason to be concerned now that the SPR, as it is known,  is now at its lowest point since 1984 because of President Biden's  policy. For nearly 2 years he has been halting leases for domestic oil  and gas production, paused pipeline development, and launched a  regulatory assault on U.S. energy development and financing, all while  releasing our strategic reserves in order to combat rising prices-- thinking that amount is really going to do so. They have been shipped  overseas in some cases.   This is unconscionable. We are in the middle of a hurricane season.  What will we do when our reserves are eventually depleted and people  are actually stranded?   In my district in northern California we don't have hurricanes, but  we are too familiar with natural disasters. Each summer residents are  forced to flee due to catastrophic wildfires, and this winter they were  even trapped in their homes without electricity due to snowstorms.   We need plentiful electricity: natural gas and oil. It is a matter of  life and death for many, and SPRs need to be used properly.                            ____________________
