 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact that is having in  New York's 27th Congressional District.   When Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump started  working on tax reform, Democrats immediately began attacking the bill  before it was even written. They deliberately spread lies to the  American people, which caused chaos and confusion, in an effort to  derail our progress.   The working families in western New York now know the truth because  they have seen an increase in their paychecks. The Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act is making our economy stronger and benefiting American families and  businesses, both big and small.   The business community is responding and taking action by giving  raises, bonuses, and other employee benefits as a direct result of tax  reform. In western New York, thousands of workers are reaping the  benefits.   M&T Bank, in Buffalo, increased the base wages for hourly employees,  gave all employees 40 hours a year in paid time off to volunteer in  their community, and significantly increased contributions to the M&T  Foundation.   Pioneer Credit Recovery in Arcade, New York, gave a $1,000 bonus to  each of their 800 employees.   Evans Bank in Hamburg also gave $1,000 bonuses to non-senior level  employees and increased charitable donations.   Everett J. Prescott, Incorporated, gave $1,000 bonuses to employees  with more than a year of service and $250 bonuses to employees with  less than a year of service.   Financial Institutions of Warsaw gave employees a bonus of $500.   LiDestri Food and Drink in Rochester gave all of their 1,200  employees in their five U.S. facilities an extra full paycheck.   Environmental Construction Group in Albion, New York, gave each of  their 50 employees a $500 bonus.   National chains that employ many of my constituents have also given  bonuses: T.J.Maxx, Walmart, AT&T, Home Depot, Chipotle, Lowe's,  Starbucks, U-Haul, FedEx, Apple, and the list goes on and on.                                time  2000    The liberal left calls these pay increases and bonuses crumbs, but my  constituents know tax reform is a significant win.   Because Republicans have reformed our complicated and outdated Tax  Code, our children and grandchildren will be able to participate in a  growing economy. The truth is tax reform is a positive step in making  America great again.
