 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a law  enforcement officer hero from Nevada who made the ultimate sacrifice  serving our community: Officer Truong Thai.   Last October, while responding to a late-night domestic disturbance,  Officer Thai was shot and killed at the age of 49, leaving behind his  father, brother, four sisters, his daughter, Jada, and an entire  community of law enforcement officers who relied on his mentorship and  support.   A 23-year veteran of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department,  Officer Thai's colleagues describe him as someone who could have served  in the highest levels of the department as a sergeant or a lieutenant.  Instead, he chose time and again to serve at all hours of the day and  all hours of the night on the front lines of our communities because  what he cared about most was keeping people safe.   Officer Thai represented the best of our law enforcement, someone  willing to put his life on the line for his community, but also a  family man who never stopped giving back.    He coached girls' volleyball and enjoyed playing with his daughter,  Jada. He went on fishing trips with colleagues and their children. He  never hesitated to help someone in need.   We should all be grateful for the service of Officer Thai and  inspired by his dedication and generosity as we remember his service.   In addition, I take a moment to honor the sacrifices of far too many  other law enforcement officers from Nevada, also lost in the line of  duty, including: The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department,  Detective Justin Michael Terry; Officer Edward Aaron Contreras, Jr.;  Sergeant Douglas Michael King; Officer Philip Carl Closi; Bailiff  Gerald Raymond Smith from Pahrump Justice Court; and Officer Ray Edward  East from Walker River.   This week, I thank our law enforcement officers for their service and  remember those like Officer Thai, whose dedication to his community and  family we will never forget.

Ms. Heard is a sixth-grade teacher at Sedway Middle School and an  innovative leader who is constantly thinking of ways to engage her  students outside the textbook.   When students struggled after the pandemic, she designed a schoolwide  math competition, complete with pep rallies and digital workspaces, to  create learning incentives and help students track their progress and  goals over time.   Ms. Heard also leads outside the classroom. She regularly  collaborates with school staff to assist with everything from bus  tickets to emotional support to food for her students.   I could not be more proud to represent teachers like Ms. Heard, and  to know that our next generation of leaders is in such great hands. I  thank her for all her hard work, and I congratulate her on her well- deserved honor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the incredible southern Nevada teachers who  deserve our appreciation, not just this week, but every week.                            ____________________
