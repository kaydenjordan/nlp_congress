 Madam Speaker, this morning, I wish to address the  American people and thank them for their hard work and their  outstanding effort that funds our government and our Active Duty  military personnel and veterans who have kept us safe, our law  enforcement, our first responders, and all those who go to work every  day making sure we are safe in our communities, safe in our Nation, and  safe around the world.   I also want to thank all the people that go to work every day to earn  a living and support their families. And, yes, those are the people,  all of them, that provide the revenue by which America can operate,  something I think President Biden has forgotten.   He has been in Washington, D.C., for half a century, and he proposed  a budget earlier this week that spends $73 trillion over the next 10  years and increases our national debt by 50 percent by the year 2032.  Under that budget, the debt will be $45 trillion.  [[Page H3976]]    And to say what the President said, a budget will show you your  values. Well, evidently, he doesn't value our next generation.   We all want our children to do better than we did and have it better  than we did. How can they do that when he proposes to saddle them with  so much debt?   When you look at the national debt that we have, it is held by the  public, it is held by foreign governments, and some of it is called  intragovernmental debt, which means it is debt that is held by other  government agencies.   The Social Security Administration holds about 13 percent of our debt  currently. I think this budget puts our seniors at risk and their  ability to live a good life in retirement on a program which they  funded for so many years from their paychecks.   So, we look at the budget. I have read through it. All these items  should be a red flag for anybody that wants to support this.   It is not supporting America's values. It is not supporting our next  generation. It is not helping our seniors. It is helping priorities  laid forth by a man who has been in Washington, D.C., for 50 years.   Evidently, he has gotten used to spending more than what the revenue  brings in in our country.   I remember President Reagan. This is, I believe, the 41st anniversary  of the assassination attempt. I think President Reagan, when someone  would say, He is spending like a drunken sailor. Then the President  would say, Well, at least the sailor is spending his own money.   We are entrusted with the money that the government takes from the  citizens of the United States. We need to use it responsibly. We need  to invest it in their priorities and not in the priorities of the  people inside the beltway.   I think he is too far out of touch, and quite frankly, there are a  lot of things that we can't afford.   What we should be looking at is protecting life. We should be looking  at being responsible so that our kids are not saddled with so much debt  and that our seniors can retire and count on a program they funded  their entire lives.   We have already seen the real cost of President Biden's tax-and-spend  policies at the pump, in the grocery store, on the farm, and on Main  Street America.   It is time we stopped leaving a financial disaster for the next  generation and put together a budget that meets the needs of the  American people, not the needs of President Biden and Speaker Pelosi.                            ____________________
