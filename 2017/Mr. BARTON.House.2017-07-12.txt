 Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone, along with subcommittee Chairman Burgess and subcommittee  Ranking Member Green for their excellent leadership on this piece of  legislation.   If you look at the front page of The Washington Post this morning,  you will see on the left-hand column the story about a miracle living  drug to help cure cancer in children that have leukemia.   In the legislation before us, as the chairman just pointed out, there  is the RACE for Children Act, which was introduced by Congressmen  McCaul, Butterfield, and Mullin, and which I am a original cosponsor,  that will make it possible to help children sooner.   This particular drug that is discussed on the front page of The  Washington Post took decades to develop and has just now been approved.   How many thousands of children have died while that drug was being  developed?   The legislation before us includes, as I said, the RACE for Children  Act, which will make it possible to bring these innovative drugs to  market much more quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I commend all the leaders and the members of the  committee for this bipartisan piece of legislation, as Mr. Pallone has  just pointed out. I am proud to vote for it, and I encourage all  Members of the House to do the same.                                time  1345
