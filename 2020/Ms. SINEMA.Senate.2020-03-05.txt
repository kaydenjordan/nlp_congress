 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of Lawrence ``Larry'' Hammond, a tireless advocate for justice who  passed away in Phoenix, AZ, on March 2, 2020. Larry was a respected  attorney and the senior partner of the investigation and criminal  defense group at Osborn Maledon in Phoenix. Throughout his career, he  worked to defend the wrongly accused and marginalized.   Larry founded the Arizona Justice Project in 1998 while he was a  member of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice. The organization  focuses on representing indigent Arizona inmates whose claims of  innocence or manifest injustice have gone unheeded. Under Larry's  leadership, AJP has received over 6,000 requests for assistance and  currently handles 40 to 50 cases in post-conviction proceedings.   Larry's legal career was legendary. After earning his juris doctor at  the University of Texas, he served as clerk to Judge Carl E. McGowan of  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, as well as Supreme Court  Justices Hugo Black and Lewis Powell, Jr. In the 1970s, he represented  the NAACP in their effort to desegregate Tucson schools. He was also a  special prosecutor during Watergate and helped negotiate the release of  American hostages in Iran while he served as a first deputy attorney  general in the Office of Legal Counsel.   Not surprisingly, Larry received many prestigious awards throughout  his career, including the Department of Justice's Exceptional Service  Award in 1980 and the American Inns of Court in 2013. He was inducted  into the American College of Trial Lawyers in 2013.   I had the honor of meeting Larry when I was a law student at Arizona  Student University and worked with the Arizona Justice Project. Larry  was a generous mentor, a studious researcher, and a fierce defender of  the Constitution. I will miss him dearly.   Larry is survived by his wife Frances, their children, Brooke, Blake,  and Amanda, and nine grandchildren. He will be missed by other family  members, friends, and the entire Arizona legal community. Please join  me in honoring his memory.                            ____________________
