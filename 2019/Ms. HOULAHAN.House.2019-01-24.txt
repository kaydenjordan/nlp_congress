 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of Megan and  Rick, and their children, from Pennsylvania's Sixth.   Rick answered the call after 9/11 to join the Air National Guard. He  was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and Afghanistan in 2008, and then hired as  an air traffic controller on a veteran preference. Currently, the  family's only income is Rick's.   In day 34, Megan now is selling items online to try to get income for  their family because they have no idea how long this shutdown will  last. She has called their daughter's preschool to see if they can  withdraw her and get a refund for the remainder of the school year. She  now has an appointment with SNAP this week for food assistance for her  and her family.   Rick loves his job. He takes pride in what he does, but this is  taking a toll on him as well. The family's last-ditch plan is to pull  from their 401(k)'s and  [[Page H1191]]  incur severe penalties to be able to keep a roof over their heads.   This tragedy is playing out in household after household in my  community.   I am a third generation veteran. Border protection is an imperative  and a real issue, but a shutdown is not the answer. I rise for the  people like Megan and Rick, because shutting down the government is  failed policy.                            ____________________
