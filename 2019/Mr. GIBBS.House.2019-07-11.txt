 Mr. Chairman, since the beginning of this year, so much of  our time in this Chamber has been used to move one messaging bill after  another.   Many of these bills are thinly-veiled attacks on the President, but  this amendment goes above and beyond.   Under this amendment, the Department of Defense is prohibited from  staying at any property owned by President Trump or his family.   To be clear, this is not a prohibition on the Department of Defense  utilizing facilities owned by any President; this amendment is about  Donald Trump, President Donald Trump. It explicitly names the President  over 50 times. Fifty times in this amendment the President is named.   This amendment says the DOD can't do for President Trump what it does  for every President in the past: facilitate Presidential travel.   This is a new low. In 2016, the GAO found the Department of Defense  spent more than $2.8 million facilitating a 4-day trip for President  Obama, which included a Florida vacation.   While the bulk of the Department of Defense's spending on  Presidential travel is airfare, the Federal employees who are staffing  the trip need to eat and sleep.   When you travel with President Obama, you can eat and sleep wherever  is most convenient and most cost-effective, but when you travel with  President Trump, you had better pack a sandwich and a sleeping bag,  because you can't buy a hot meal or reserve a hotel room because  everything is usually so full.   This is an unreasonable restriction on the DOD and on this  administration.   The focus on who owns the facility instead of which facility meets  the needs and mission of the Department is disgraceful.   A number of people travel with the President and the Cabinet, and  they need the flexibility to choose the best facilities. Placing  unnecessary restrictions on these choices for political motivations  impedes the Department's mission.   As was just stated by my colleague from Colorado, this President  donates his presidential salary to charity.   And he doesn't have time to worry about what the Department of  Defense is doing because he is making America better.                                time  1645    We have the lowest unemployment in decades. We have got wages going  up. We have got a strong economy.   He is working on trade deals. He is fighting for every worker out  there, every farmer, every business; and I don't think he really has  time; and it is about time that the other side of the aisle moves on  and realizes who is the President of the United States, and the great  things that are happening in this country, and not doing such juvenile  tactics of restricting the Department of Defense to where they can go;  because this would also include an employee of the Department of  Defense not being able to use the expense account if something comes  up.   He has got assets all around the world. It might be more applicable  to be at a Trump facility. He has got things in Istanbul, the  Philippines, all around the world, and you never know. We shouldn't tie  the hands of the Department of Defense. It is up to them to make those  decisions, and not for us to put ridiculous restrictions on.   So I sincerely urge defeat of this amendment for many of the reasons  I simply have said. In the standards of this body, this is the lowest  standard. We have gone to a new low.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
