 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Protection Act.   Across this Nation, we are faced with an ugly, obscene, inescapable  truth: gun violence is a public health emergency.   My bill would, for the first time via Federal legislation, prohibit  any State that wants to compete for grant funding from the Department  of Justice from restricting the ability of a local government to enact  tougher gun laws. My hope is that we can finally give local governments  the freedom to protect innocent citizens and first responders while  making our neighborhoods safer, regardless of what their State  legislature thinks.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this vital public  safety legislation.                            ____________________
