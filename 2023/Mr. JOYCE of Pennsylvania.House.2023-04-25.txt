 Mr. Speaker, for nearly three decades,  Chairman Bud Shuster represented the people of central Pennsylvania  here in the Halls of Congress.   After leaving Congress in 2001, Chairman Shuster returned home to  Bedford County, Pennsylvania, where he remained active in his service,  teaching at a university level, working on his farm, and spending time  with those he loved.   When I first decided to run for office, I called Bud and asked him  for his advice. For the next hour, he talked to me about what an honor  it is to serve in the United States Congress, what an honor it is to  sit in committee, what an honor it is to work on the issues that matter  most to the families in Pennsylvania.   Bud Shuster ran unopposed for his seat eight times in the decades  that he served, a testament to how much the communities that he  represented cared for him and recognized that they would have no  greater champion in Washington.   For 6 years, Chairman Shuster held the gavel on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, where he fought to build roads, bridges,  and waterways that Americans still rely on each and every day.   His drive and determination helped to bring our infrastructure into  the 21st century, paving the way for innovation and new development in  Pennsylvania and across the United States.   When I would drive home to Pennsylvania on Interstate 99, the road  that Bud Shuster built and the road that bears his name, I would often  call the former chairman and, once again, ask for his advice. We would  talk about his farm, what votes had occurred, and when votes were  upcoming the next week.   I will miss those calls, and all of us will miss the man known simply  as Mr. Chairman.   Over 4 billion trips are taken on American highways each year, and  each one of those travelers owes a certain amount of respect to the  commitment that Bud Shuster showed to transportation and infrastructure  in America.   Personally, my wife, Alice, and I will miss Mr. Chairman and miss  what he did for those of us in central Pennsylvania.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for nearly three decades,  Chairman Bud Shuster was a tireless champion for the people of central  Pennsylvania. He truly earned the nickname ``Mr. Chairman'' as he led  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee into the 21st century,  spearheading infrastructure projects that have stood the test of time  and remain standing today, not only in Pennsylvania, but throughout the  United States.   Chairman Shuster's vision and his leadership built the roads, the  bridges, and the waterways that have allowed our communities and our  Nation to thrive. On behalf of all the Pennsylvania delegation standing  here with me this evening, I ask for a moment of silence to honor the  late chairman, Bud Shuster.                            ____________________
