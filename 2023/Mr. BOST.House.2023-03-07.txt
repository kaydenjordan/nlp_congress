 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 502) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs repays members of the Armed Forces for  certain contributions made by such members towards Post-9/11  Educational Assistance, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 502         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPAYMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR                     CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD POST-9/11 EDUCATIONAL                     ASSISTANCE.         (a) In General.--Section 3327(f)(3) of title 38, United       States Code, is amended by striking ``together'' and all that       follows through ``(as applicable),''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on August 1, 2023.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``November 28,       2031''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 502, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative Banks' bill,  H.R. 502, as amended. I am pleased to support Representative Banks'  bill to ensure that all servicemembers who have paid into the GI Bill  are properly repaid. This bill would close the financial loophole that  prevents at least 25,000 Active-Duty servicemembers from receiving the  repayments they are due.   Under current law, a servicemember who switches from Montgomery to  the Post-9/11 GI Bill would lose $1,200 that they paid into the program  if they exhausted their benefits while still on Active Duty. Veterans  who exhaust their benefits already receive the $1,200 back.   Representative Banks' bill would fix this policy to ensure that  servicemembers and veterans who are pursuing a higher education degree  are treated equally.   Servicemembers have earned this benefit by protecting our country.  They should not be short changed just because they are getting an  education while still on Active Duty.   This bill would include a short-term extension of VA home loan  funding fees to fully offset the cost of this bill.   I thank The American Legion for bringing this problem to our  attention. I also thank Congressman Banks for reintroducing this  important bill that will make a big difference for thousands of Active- Duty servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 502, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), the sponsor of this legislation.  [[Page H1125]]         Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation. I also want to join with the ranking member in  telling the Senate that this is a really good bill and that they should  take it up right away. We want to encourage them to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 753) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to use on-site  regulated medical waste treatment systems at certain Department of  Veterans Affairs facilities, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 753         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Creation of On-Site Treatment Systems Affording       Veterans Improvements and Numerous General Safety       Enhancements Act'' or the ``VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements       Act''.       SEC. 2. USE OF ON-SITE REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE TREATMENT                     SYSTEMS AT DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     FACILITIES.         (a) Identification of Facilities.--The Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall identify Department of Veterans       Affairs facilities that would benefit from cost savings       associated with the use of an on-site regulated medical waste       treatment system over a five-year period.        (b) Regulated Medical Waste Cost Analysis Model.--For       purposes of carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall       develop a uniform regulated medical waste cost analysis model       to be used to determine the cost savings associated with the       use of an on-site regulated medical waste treatment system at       Department facilities. Such model shall be designed to       calculate savings based on--        (1) the cost of treating regulated medical waste at an off-      site location under a contract with a non-Department entity;       compared to        (2) the cost of treating regulated medical waste on-site,       based on the equipment specification of treatment system       manufacturers, with capital costs amortized over a ten-year       period.        (c) Installation.--At each Department facility identified       under subsection (a), the Secretary shall secure, install,       and operate an on-site regulated medical waste treatment       system.        (d) Regulated Medical Waste Defined.--In this section, the       term ``regulated medical waste'' has the meaning given such       term under section 173.134(a)(5) of title 49, Code of Federal       Regulations, concerning regulated medical waste and       infectious substances, or any successor regulation, except       that, in the case of an applicable State law that is more       expansive, the definition in the State law shall apply.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  753, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 753, as  amended, the VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements Act. I am proud to  reintroduce this bill this Congress.   This bill will require the VA to conduct a medical waste cost  analysis at VA medical centers nationwide. This would identify VA  facilities where it would be more cost-effective to install waste  incinerators on-site rather than contracting a third party to ship  medical waste to be destroyed off-site.   Only around 20 percent of our VA facilities have a medical waste  system installed. My bill would change that. In return, it will save VA  tens of millions of dollars annually.   By supporting my bill, we would create a safer and cleaner  environment at our VA hospitals. We would also be better stewards of  taxpayers' dollars without diminishing services to our veterans.   Our Nation's veterans deserve the safest medical practices, and  nothing, including waste management, should fall short of that. This  bill is a win-win.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me today in support  of H.R. 753, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 815) to amend title 38, United States Code, to make certain  improvements relating to the eligibility of veterans to receive  reimbursement for emergency treatment furnished through the Veterans  Community Care program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 815         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Removing Extraneous       Loopholes Insuring Every Veteran Emergency Act'' or the       ``RELIEVE Act''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR                     EMERGENCY TREATMENT FURNISHED TO VETERANS.         (a) Eligibility Requirements.--Section 1725(b)(2)(B) of       title 38, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``,       unless such emergency treatment was furnished during the 60-      day period following the date on which the veteran enrolled       in the health care system specified in subparagraph (A), in       which case no requirement for prior receipt of care shall       apply'' before the period.        (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to emergency treatment furnished on       or after the date that is one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``December 28,       2031''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  815, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 815, the RELIEVE Act, as  amended.   This bill would close a loophole by covering emergency room medical  expenses for veterans that are newly enrolled in VA care.   Under current law, VA does not reimburse veterans for emergency care  received in the community if they have not visited a VA facility within  2 years. This policy includes veterans who are newly enrolled in the VA  healthcare system but may not be considered active patients.   As a result, inactive veteran patients and their families could be  met with undue payment burdens if they receive urgent medical treatment  outside the VA.   Representative McMorris Rodgers' bill, H.R. 815, as amended, will  correctly close this gap in emergency room services. This will help  those in need at their most vulnerable time by extending VA  reimbursement for 60 days after the veteran's enrollment in the VA  healthcare.   As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a veteran, I have  heard from fellow veterans who have been wrongfully affected by this  confusing policy. One of my top priorities in Congress is to ensure  that veterans receive necessary care without worrying about payment  burdens and bureaucratic red tape.   I thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), and the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.  Pappas) for introducing this commonsense legislation that takes care of  our Nation's veterans by making sure they receive the care that they  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 815, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1226) to amend title 38, United States Code, to allow for the  electronic request of certain records, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1226         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wounded Warrior Access       Act''.       SEC. 2. ELECTRONIC REQUEST OF CERTAIN RECORDS MAINTAINED BY                     THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Electronic Record Requests.--Section 5702 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b)(1) The Secretary shall establish and maintain a       secure website or online tool for a claimant or a duly       recognized agent or representative of that claimant to submit       an electronic request for such records.        ``(2) The Secretary, upon receipt of a valid request made       through the website or online tool established under       paragraph (1), shall provide to the requestor--        ``(A) not later than 10 days after receipt, confirmation of       such receipt; and        ``(B) not later than 120 days after receipt, such records       requested in the form selected by the requestor.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 5702(a) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking ``in       writing'' and inserting ``in writing, including an electronic       request submitted through the website or online tool       established under subsection (b),'';        (2) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (3) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) the format in which such copy is desired, including       whether in printed form or by downloadable file.''.        (c) Deadline; Establishment of Website or Online Tool.--Not       later than one year after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall establish the       website or online tool required under section 5702(b)(1) of       title 38, United States Code, as added by this Act, and, to       the extent practicable, the Secretary shall utilize existing       online resources of the Department of Veterans Affairs for       the purposes of such establishment.       SEC. 3. WARNINGS TO CLAIMANTS UNDER LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE                     SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS REGARDING                     UNRECOGNIZED REPRESENTATIVES.         (a) In General.--Section 5901 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``Except'';        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Warnings About Potential Predatory Practices.--(1)       The Secretary shall ensure that, each time a claimant under a       law administered by the Secretary logs in to a website or       online tool of the Department, such website or online tool       issues to the claimant, in plain language--        ``(A) a warning about individuals who seek to act in       violation of this chapter;        ``(B) a link to an online tool of the Department through       which the claimant may report such an individual;        ``(C) a link to an online tool of the Department through       which the claimant may search for a recognized agent,       attorney, or other entity recognized by the Secretary for the       preparation, presentation, or prosecution of any claim under       laws administered by the Secretary; and        ``(D) a link to a website or an online tool of the       Department providing final decisions on discipline of agents,       attorneys, and entities, described in subparagraph (C), by       the Secretary for violations of this chapter.        ``(2) The Secretary shall provide all information under       paragraph (1) in the following languages:        ``(A) English.        ``(B) Spanish.        ``(C) Tagalog.        ``(D) The seven other languages most commonly spoken in the       United States.''.        (b) Implementation.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall carry out subsection (b) of such section, as added by       subsection (a) of this section--        (1) after consulting with stakeholders (including veterans       service organizations recognized under section 5902 of such       title) regarding the wording of the warning under such       subsection; and        (2) not later than one year after the date of the enactment       of this Act.  [[Page H1128]]            SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  1226, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1226, as amended.   This bill will require VA to establish a secure online tool which  veterans can use to request a copy of their VA claims file or C-file.   Veterans may want to see their records to ensure the VA received all  the evidence they submitted. They may also use this information to  decide whether to appeal VA's decision.   Currently, veterans must travel to the regional office to view their  records, which is inconvenient, or they can request a copy by mail,  which can take weeks or even months.   I support this bill because it would make it easier for veterans to  get their VA records in a timely manner.   Furthermore, I have heard increasing concerns from veterans about bad  actors attempting to con them out of their benefits. This is  unacceptable.   H.R. 1226, as amended, would require VA to educate veterans about  predatory actors when they log into the VA website. These warnings will  prevent veterans from being taken advantage of.   I appreciate Representative Aguilar's leadership on this issue. I  urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also encourage my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
