 Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8404, the  Respect  [[Page S6845]]  for Marriage Act. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Senate  companion version of this measure, S. 4556, which has been introduced  by Senator Feinstein.   The House passed this legislation by a bipartisan vote of 267 to 157  in July 2022, and the Senate is now poised to pass this legislation  with a strong bipartisan vote as well.   In 2010, Maryland began to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages  that were legally performed in other States. And in 2012, Governor  Martin O'Malley signed a law guaranteeing Marylanders the freedom to  marry regardless of their gender, which was later upheld and confirmed  by the voters of Maryland in a statewide referendum.   In 2015, the Supreme Court held in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges  that the Constitution protected the right of same-sex couples to marry  and therefore granting this right nationwide. Let me quote just a few  passages from this historic decision, written by Justice Anthony  Kennedy more than seven years ago: ``Especially against a long history  of disapproval of their relationships, this denial to same-sex couples  of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm. The imposition  of this disability on gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and  subordinate them. And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process  Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the fundamental  right to marry.''   Justice Kennedy concluded in part that: ``No union is more profound  than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity,  devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people  become something greater than once they were. As some of the  petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that  may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women  to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do  respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment  for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in  loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions.  They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution  grants them that right.''   So why are we here today, if Obergefell is still the law of the land?  We are here because the Supreme Court of the United States decided to  strip away a woman's fundamental reproductive rights this summer. The  Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision--and a half century of  associated precedents--in its radical Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health  Organization decision.   In that decision, Justice Thomas wrote a concurrence which warned  that the Court should ``reconsider, [in future cases], all of this  Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold,  Lawrence, and Obergefell.'' These decisions protected the right to  access contraception, the right to have same-sex relations, and the  right to enter into a same-sex marriage, respectively. Do most  Americans really want to turn back the clock on these civil rights, in  terms of being able to responsibly plan the size of their family, make  personal medical and healthcare decision with their doctors, and fall  in love and marry their partner of their choosing, regardless of their  gender? I don't think so.   The dissent in Dobbs correctly pointed out: ``The lone rationale for  what the majority does today is that the right to elect an abortion is  not `deeply rooted in history': Not until Roe, the majority argues, did  people think abortion fell within the Constitution's guarantee of  liberty. The same could be said, though, of most of the rights the  majority claims it is not tampering with.''   The dissent continued: ``The majority could write just as long an  opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, `there  was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain  [contraceptives].' So one of two things must be true. Either the  majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does,  all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century  are insecure. Either the mass of the majority's opinion is hypocrisy,  or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the  other.''   I am therefore pleased that the Senate came together in its best  traditions to form a bipartisan working group--led by Senators Baldwin  and Collins--to codify the right to be married regardless of your  gender and to rescind Federal laws to the contrary that are still on  the books. I thank Leader Schumer for giving this working group  additional time after the mid-term elections to reach compromise  language that enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate, which can  overcome a filibuster.   According to the Human Rights Campaign and a recent Gallup poll, 71  percent of Americans now support marriage equality, compared to only  about 27 percent in 1996, when President Clinton signed the Defense of  Marriage Act--DOMA.   As Senators Baldwin and Collins recently wrote in a compelling op-ed:  ``Individuals in same-sex and interracial marriages need, and should  have, the confidence that their marriages are legal. These loving  couples should be guaranteed the same rights and freedoms of every  other marriage . . . This legislation has earned bipartisan support in  Congress because it grants same-sex and interracial couples the  certainty that they will continue to enjoy the same equal treatment  under federal law as all other married couples. . . . [W]e should be  able to agree that same-sex and interracial couples, regardless of  where they live, both need and deserve the assurance that their  marriage will be recognized by the federal government and that they  will continue to enjoy freedoms, rights and responsibilities that come  with all other marriages.''   This legislation has three major components. First, this legislation  would formally repeal the Defense of Marriage Act--DOMA--of 1996.  Section 2 of DOMA purports to allow States to refuse to recognize valid  civil marriages of same-sex couples. Section 3 of the law carved out  all same-sex couples, regardless of their marital status, from  benefitting from any Federal statutes, regulations and rulings  applicable to all other married people. This provision denied same-sex  couples roughly 1,100 Federal benefits and protections.   Second, the legislation establishes that ``place of celebration'' is  the standard of recognition for Federal benefits of a same-sex  marriage, in terms of recognizing a marriage as legal if valid in the  State it was performed. The legislation would also guarantee Federal  marriage benefits if a State rescinded same-sex marriage recognition.   Third, this legislation guarantees that legal marriages are given  full faith and credit by every other State. Article IV, section 1 of  the Constitution provides that ``full faith and credit shall be given  in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of  every other state, and the Congress may be general laws prescribe the  manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved,  and the effect thereof.'' This section of the legislation additionally  gives the Attorney General enforcement authority to carry out its  provisions and creates a private right of action for any harmed  individual.   The compromise language in the Senate measure clarifies that it will  have no adverse impact on religious liberty and conscience protections.  The revised legislation would explicitly protect all religious liberty  and conscience protections available under the Constitution or Federal  law, including but not limited to the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act. The amendment clarifies that nonprofit religious organizations  will not be required to provide any services, facilities, or goods for  the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.   President Biden is absolutely correct when he stated: ``The right to  marriage confers vital legal protections, dignity, and full  participation in our society. No person should face discrimination  because of who they are or whom they love, and every married couple in  the United States deserves the security of knowing that their marriage  will be defended and respected.''         The Biden administration supports passage of this       legislation, stating that ``H.R. 8404 would repeal the       Defense of Marriage Act, an unconstitutional and       discriminatory law, and would enshrine the right to Federal       recognition of marriage for same-sex and interracial couples.       This legislation would strengthen civil rights, and ensure       that the promise of equality is not denied to families across       the country.''        The Senate should pass this legislation and send it to the       House for its consideration and  [[Page S6846]]       passage in December. I am hopeful that President Biden will       sign this legislation into law before the 117th Congress       adjourns sine die. This would be another major bipartisan       accomplishment for this Congress and mark an important step       forward on our unfinished march for civil rights, as we       strive to form a more perfect union, establish justice, and       guarantee equal rights and equal justice under the law for       all Americans.
