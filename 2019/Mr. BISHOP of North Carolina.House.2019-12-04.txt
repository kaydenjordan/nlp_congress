 Mr. Speaker, at 2 p.m. today, the  Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of  the United States will hear the Lumbee Recognition Act, which would  afford the Lumbee Tribe long-overdue Federal benefits. Although the  Federal Government provided partial recognition to the Tribe in 1956,  the Lumbee remain excluded from Federal benefits and legal status.   This bill is no symbolic gesture. No other recognized Tribe is denied  the right to self-government and sovereignty. Full recognition will  finally allow the 55,000 Lumbee I represent to have fair access to the  benefits and programs available to all other recognized Tribes.   As a State senator, I sponsored legislation to clarify the status of  the Lumbee as a State-recognized Tribe to ensure access to appropriate  grants and programs. Now, I am proud, as a United States Congressman,  to continue to fight for the Lumbee Tribe on the Federal level. In  fact, cosponsoring this crucial legislation was one of my first  official acts in Congress.   I applaud my colleagues, Representatives Butterfield and Hudson, for  introducing this important legislation to right this fundamentally  unfair wrong. I look forward to casting my vote on the House floor to  give the Lumbee the recognition they so rightfully deserve.                            ____________________
