 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Frank ``TowKar'' Appice, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, avid  motorcyclist, and active member of our community.   He passed away in 2017, but he is not forgotten. I am so proud that  we recently named a street after him on Staten Island.   Frank was the founder and chairman of the board of Rolling Thunder,  Chapter 2 New York, as well as an integral part of creating two  chapters in Brooklyn.   Frank always wanted to use motorcycling to give back to our  community, particularly our veterans. Every year, he oversaw the  Disabled American Veterans support run for Chapter 2 New York, raising  over $75,000 for disabled veterans.   It is a fitting honor that his wife and children have formed a  scholarship fund in his honor. This fund will continue Frank's passion  for supporting veterans, ensuring that children of veterans or students  who volunteer with veterans organizations can afford an education.   This scholarship ensures that we will always remember and learn from  Frank and his legacy of service.   Frank, we will continue to honor you and your work.   God Bless Frank, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this blatant attempt to help foreign agents subvert our  democracy.   Madam Speaker, we stand at the crossroads of history. Foreign enemies  have attacked our elections in a sweeping and systematic fashion, and  they are continuing to do so.   We are faced today with a very simple question: Should Iran, Russia,  and China be allowed to interfere in our elections? Should they have  more of a say in who gets elected than our constituents?   Let me tell you my answer. Our soldiers did not fight our enemies  overseas just to watch them try to corrupt our democracy here at home.  I am not sure when that became a controversial position, but it is a  damn shame that it has.   Protecting America should not be a one-party issue. It should be what  unites us, not a cause for petty games.   But once again, the minority party has decided it is more important  to practice the kind of politics that put them in the minority in the  first place. They have decided, yet again, to play another political  stunt, just like they played this morning in the SCIF. It is the same  exact thing.   That is your choice. My choice is to stand up to say American  elections are for Americans only.   The SHIELD Act puts forward critical reforms to improve our defenses  against foreign influence and interference. The bill strengthens  reporting requirements, closes loopholes, and deters illegal foreign  activity in our elections.   I can understand if some of my colleagues are worried that they  cannot win on a fair and level election playing field, but for all  those who believe in free and fair elections, who swore an oath to  protect and defend the Constitution, I urge you to reject this MTR and  stand with the United States of America.
