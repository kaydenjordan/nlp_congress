 Madam President, I rise today to commend Pastor  Han  [[Page S907]]  Byeong Cheol, senior pastor of the Korean Central Presbyterian Church  of Atlanta, for his years of service and advocacy on behalf of  Atlanta's Korean American community. Since 2009, Pastor Han has led the  Korean Central Presbyterian Church's missionary work and has dedicated  his time to spreading the gospel to his local Korean community and the  entire region.   Two years ago, following the horrific spa shootings in which three  members of Georgia's Korean American community lost their lives, Pastor  Han demonstrated strong leadership by bringing faith leaders together  to speak out against acts of hate and help the community heal. At a  time when acts of violence toward Asian Americans are on the rise  across our Nation, Pastor Han is stepping up to spread awareness about  the rise of hate crimes, educating people on how to use faith to bring  about positive change, and guiding his community forward.   Georgia's Korean American community is strong, and even in the face  of vile attacks, their resolve has not broken. Pastor Han and the  Korean Central Presbyterian Church community are prime examples of  that. As we commemorate this solemn anniversary, may we find solace in  those in our community like Pastor Han who have turned tragedy into  healing.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Pastor Han Byeong  Cheol for his years of service to Georgia's Korean American  community.                            ____________________
