 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this USA  FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020.   This bill strikes just the right balance between protecting our  national security and strengthening civil liberties. It preserves  critical tools used by authorities to investigate international  terrorism and foreign intelligence matters, but also makes significant  reforms to enhance privacy and transparency.   I would like to quickly highlight some of the important privacy  protections included in the bill.  [[Page H1631]]    For example, the FBI may no longer be able to keep business records  collected under FISA indefinitely. Those records would have to be  destroyed after 5 years, except in very narrow circumstances.   The government will also have to provide notice to individuals whose  business records are used in a criminal case or other proceeding unless  the proceeding's adjudicator finds that disclosure would harm national  security. Individuals who receive notice would then be able to  challenge the legality of the government's collection, a right that  should be maintained when intrusive national security authorities are  used to gather evidence.   In addition to these privacy enhancements, the bill also requires  greater transparency about how the government uses FISA. The bill  imposes a 180-day clock on declassification of significant opinions  issued by the FISA court and requires the government to look further in  its historical records than it has done before.   Moreover, the bill enhances transparency in the intelligence  community's annual public reports so we get a better sense of when the  government conducts U.S. person queries into FISA data.   These are but some examples of the important transparency and private  reforms contained in this bill. These reforms are all accomplished  without negatively impacting our national security.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.
