 Mr. Chairman, I love this country. The  heart and soul of our country is our financial system.   This bill is a dangerous bill to our economy. Let me tell you why.  First of all, it takes away all of our consumer protections. I want to  give you an example.   Before we had Dodd-Frank, a bank that is insured by the taxpayers  could go in and use their customer's money. They could take their  customer's money out to invest in risky bets, and then when the bets go  south, it is the taxpayers that have to pick up the freight.   Secondly, let us use this example. Because of the impact and the  complexities of our financial system, so much of the cause and effect  of the downturn were the big banks. What Dodd-Frank did was provide a  test to be able to go in and simulate and confer with the bank to  prevent it from going overboard.   Wake up, America. I have talked with our Senators and they have  assured me that this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate.
