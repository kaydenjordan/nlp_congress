 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 524, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 461) condemning the use of elementary and  secondary school facilities to provide shelter for aliens who are not  admitted to the United States, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 461, a resolution  condemning the use of elementary and secondary school facilities to  provide shelter for aliens who are not admitted to the United States.   Round condemnation of adult, illegal migrants sharing facilities with  schoolchildren would be supported by both sides of the aisle but for  one simple reason. It would require Democrats to confront the tragedy  of their own making at the southern border.   The rhetoric from the left deploys flowery language to address the  flooding of migrants into our country. It is a scam.   Democrats must confront reality. There are real human consequences to  losing operational control of our southern border. Democrats have  plunged our southern border into chaos, trafficking, and bloodshed.  [[Page H3089]]    Last year, 2.76 million migrants illegally crossed our southern  border. Over 800 of them died making the journey.   Customs and Border Protection also seized 14,700 pounds of fentanyl  in fiscal year 2022. In a year in which 110,000 Americans fatally  overdosed on drugs, each pound of fentanyl missed by Customs and Border  Protection has the potential to kill over 200,000 people.   The encounters, the deaths, and the trafficking are a three-, four-,  and five-time increase over the last year of the Trump administration.  We have a deadly opioid epidemic, a human trafficking epidemic, and an  overall humanitarian epidemic at our southern border, all stemming from  the Biden administration's policies.   H. Res. 461 is a crystal-clear rebuke of the chaos at the border.                                time  1200    It applies to K-12 institutions because, make no mistake, Democrats  are making elementary, middle, and high schools a battleground for  chaotic border policies.   In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams planned to house migrants in up to  20 current and former public school gymnasiums. In Chicago, local  leadership is reportedly considering housing hundreds of illegal  immigrants in a shuttered high school.   Housing migrants in public schools is not a new occurrence. CNN, CBS,  and the New York Post have all uncovered instances of this already  happening across the country. For Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul,  these plans are a mere formalization of their unwillingness to enforce  the law. This is what Republicans mean when we say every State is a  border State and every town is a border town.   Moreover, the collateral of this broken policy are America's  schoolchildren. It is completely unacceptable. Turning schools into  housing centers for illegal immigrants distracts schools from their  mission.   Schools should be focused on helping students recover from  devastating pandemic-era learning loss. We know that children are  suffering in the wake of the pandemic. Math and reading scores have  plummeted to their lowest level in years. Forcing schools to shelter  illegal immigrants will not help with that.   Additionally, hosting illegal immigrants on school campuses poses a  significant safety risk to schoolchildren and compromises schools'  ability to secure their own campuses.   Furthermore, using school gymnasiums as housing for illegal aliens  may impede children's access to safe recreation and physical education.  It may force children to spend their entire school day with little  exercise and may disrupt the ordinary routines of the school day.   As always with the Republican Party, threatening the safety of our  children is a nonstarter. We are voting on a resolution today to  condemn the threat posed to our children.   Our resolution condemns the breakdown of law and order at the  southern border. It condemns the lawlessness perpetuated by blue cities  and States like New York.   I hope the entire body votes for the passage of H. Res. 461 and sends  a message to America that there is no substitute for a secure border.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), the author of this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Williams), a member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 461.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, to sum up the debate, H. Res. 461 does four things. It  sends a clear message about our values. It condemns lawbreaking where  Democrat politicians have failed to do so. It tells parents that we are  on their side. Most importantly, it reiterates that public school  facilities should be used for educating children, not housing illegal  immigrants, because the academic success and safety of America's  students must be put first.   Therefore, I urge the House of Representatives and Congress to pass  H. Res. 461, and I yield back the balance of my time.
