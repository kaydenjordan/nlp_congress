 Madam President, in Tennessee, our hearts are  absolutely breaking for the families and the communities that have been  impacted by the storms that raced across our State this weekend. We are  mourning the loss of six Tennesseans--two children in that number--and  dozens of individuals have been injured and hospitalized. The storm  left thousands without power. It destroyed homes and businesses.   I want to express my thanks to the first responders, the emergency  management officials, and the volunteers who immediately jumped into  action to support these families and to help those who have lost their  businesses, their homes, and the families of those who lost their  lives. They have made such a difference. Each and every one of these  volunteers and officials has made such a difference in what is going to  be a very long road to recovery.   My team has been in touch with the White House, with the Governor's  office, with local elected officials, and we are working to ensure that  the full force of the Federal Government mobilizes behind these  communities in order to help them recover.
