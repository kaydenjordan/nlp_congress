 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Larsen for allowing me this time  to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill before us, H.J.  Res. 7.   I am pleased that President Biden announced this week that he will  end the COVID-19 national emergency declaration on May 11. This will  provide a reasonable path to winding down the pandemic measures without  leaving States and cities caught off guard with sudden shifts in their  budgets.   COVID was a once-in-a-lifetime emergency, and an abrupt end to the  spending under the emergency declaration would cause chaos for  Americans. The wind down aligns with the administration's previous  plans to give cities, States, businesses, and taxpayers at least 60  days' notice prior to the termination of the emergency declaration.   Mr. Speaker, this is sensible policymaking, and it is a welcome  change from the prior administration's frantic, poorly-considered, and  dangerous approach to any sort of emergency, including COVID.   I agree with the President's plan to wind down the emergency  declaration, and I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  agree with this plan, as well. Why?   Because this bill was rushed to the floor without allowing our  committee to review it, without soliciting input from any of the cities  or States that would be impacted. Nobody has been working with the  Senate or the White House to find a solution that makes sense.    Mr. Speaker, the majority knows that abrupt shifts are  bad. Yet, they are free to vote for a bill which they know would cause  chaos. They also know that it won't be considered by the Senate.   I can forgive a messaging bill; we all do that from time to time.  What is so galling about the bill before us today is that it shows just  how far outside the mainstream the Republican Party is.   The American people want commonsense solutions that protect our  economy, not a far-right agenda driven by the most extreme voices in  their party. It is the same voices that brought us yesterday's anti- vaccine bill.   Who knows what other secret promises the Speaker made to the  extremists to secure the gavel?   Let's get the bill over with because we all know that it is not going  anywhere.    Mr. Speaker, we can then get on to debating the majority's  economic plans, like a 30 percent national sales tax or holding the  debt limit hostage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' so we can stop  wasting time with this nonsense and get back to the work for the  American people.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Black History  Month. This month, we celebrate the tremendous contributions of African  Americans to the growth of our Nation.   Just one example of that contribution is the beautiful edifice that  we are in today. It was built by people who were uncompensated for  their work, but it is a beautiful testament in our Nation's example.   Black History Month started as Negro History Week in February of  1926. That week was chosen because it included the birthdays of  President Lincoln and famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass.   In 1976, they expanded it and created Black History Month.   Today, African Americans make a difference in every aspect of  American life and highlight the fact that the African-American story is  the greatest success story in our Nation's history.                            ____________________
