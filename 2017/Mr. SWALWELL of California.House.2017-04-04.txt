 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R.       1343 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions       to report the same back to the House forthwith with the       following amendment:        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 3. PROHIBITION.         Any exemption, safe harbor, or other authority provided by       this Act or a regulation issued pursuant to this Act shall       not apply to an issuer if the issuer or a director, officer,       or affiliate of the issuer has withheld information from       Congress relevant to its investigation of any collusion       between persons associated with the Russian Government and       persons associated with the presidential campaign of Donald       J. Trump to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States       presidential election.   [[Page H2676]]     The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell) is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his  motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment  to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   Russia attacked our democracy this past Presidential election. This  motion asks Members of this House: Do you want to do something about  it? Do you want to do all you can to make sure it doesn't happen again?                                time  1615    If you do, support this amendment. If you don't, vote against it, and  watch Russia and other adversaries of ours with similar cyber  capabilities carry out similar attacks, and the very democracy that we  treasure will erode before our eyes. But I believe we are a better body  than one that would let another country attack us and then divide us.   What does this motion to recommit do? It requires any company-- particularly, I am concerned about financial institutions--to cooperate  with all investigations into collusion between President Trump, his  campaign, his family, his businesses, and anyone on his team and  Russia's interference campaign during the 2016 election.   The evidence is overwhelming. In the 2016 election, Russia ran a  multifaceted electronic interference campaign against our democracy.  They used paid social media trolls. They hacked Democratic emails and  disseminated the information in those emails through cutouts like  WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. They had a clear preference for Donald  Trump as their candidate. It was ordered by their own President,  Vladimir Putin.   And most concerning for every person in this House--should be--they  are sharpening their knives, and they intend to do it again. That was  the final finding in the intelligence report. They are sharpening their  knives and intend to do it again not just to the United States, but to  our allies like France and Germany, who are a part of the best check on  Russia, the NATO alliance.   Why are we concerned about finances and companies cooperating with  the United States in this investigation? Well, we know from the  Kremlin's playbook that they use financial entanglements as a means to  recruit individuals or to peddle influence.   Why are we concerned about financial ties among Donald Trump and his  team? Because unlike any Presidential candidate in the history of our  Presidential elections, there are an unprecedented amount of personal,  political, and financial ties to a foreign adversary. They include, but  are not limited to:   Paul Manafort, where it is alleged he was paid by pro-Russian Ukraine  Government individuals and also paid up to $10 million a year by  Vladimir Putin's associates;   Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who should have known  better as the former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,  should have known about Russia's playbook and their ability to  influence people, but after leaving the DIA, went over to Moscow, sat  next to Vladimir Putin, and was paid by Russia's propaganda tool,  Russia Today, also known as RT, who General Flynn would have known is  an arm of Russia's intelligence services;   Donald J. Trump, Jr., who said in 2008, in terms of high-end product  influx into the United States, Russians make up a pretty  disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets. In Dubai, and  certainly with our project in SoHo, and anywhere in New York, we see a  lot of money pouring in from Russia;   President Trump, who has invested in the past in Russia: over half a  dozen trademarks granted to him in Russia, a vodka brand he tried to  peddle in Russia, a Miss Universe contest that he held in Moscow in  2013, and Russia has invested in our President. There are Russian  businessowners who have bought condos in his Trump Tower building.  There are loans from banks that have paid fines for laundering money  through Russia. There is a home sale in 2008 where the President reaped  129 percent in profit. He bought a home in 2004 in West Palm Beach for  $40 million; sold it in 2008, as the real estate market was collapsing,  for over $90 million; sold it to a Russian businessman known as the  fertilizer king. No one else in that ZIP Code reaped a profit of 129  percent.   So why are banks particularly relevant for this motion? We know they  are used by Russia to move money and extend influence. Their  cooperation will be crucial to understanding how Russia finances its  interference campaign.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit  and get to the bottom of exactly what happened with Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
