 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of two of my  amendments that are included in this en bloc.   Amendment No. 333 authorizes a long-overdue China watcher program  within the Department of State. This program aims to monitor and combat  Chinese malign influence across economic and political sectors in  certain high-priority countries.   The People's Republic of China is challenging the United States at  multiple levels and remains a threat to our vitally important interests  across the globe. The threats posed by the PRC demand greater  resources, which is exactly what this amendment delivers.   My second amendment, No. 343, establishes a program for the  Department of the Air Force to develop a proof-of-concept quantum  network testbed. This will support the incredible work the Air Force is  doing around the country, including the information directorate in  Rome, New York, which is in the heart of my district in New York.   The establishment of this program will deepen the military's  expertise in cutting-edge quantum computing. It will enable the United  States to compete globally with our adversaries, dominate the virtual  battlespace, and counter emerging threats.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for the  work they put into shepherding this bill through Congress and rejecting  partisan cuts to our Nation's military that were proposed by the  administration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this en bloc.
