 Mr. Speaker, like so many others, I have been dismayed  about the administration's actions, ripping thousands of children from  their parents' arms at our border.   Let's make one thing clear: Yesterday the President didn't fix the  immigration problem, and this House is not going to fix the problem  here today.   People are coming to our border, fleeing oppression and violence,  turning themselves in, and asking for our help. This administration's  response is to try to deter these immigrants by matching the cruelty  they are fleeing.   We have to acknowledge the truth of what is happening. Children are  being caged. Families are suffering long-lasting emotional and mental  trauma, being used as pawns in the President's political games.   Every day for months, our neighbors living here under DACA have  continued to face uncertainty. This is nothing short of inhumane,  barbaric, and, frankly, immoral.   Moving kids from DHS cages to DOD cages doesn't solve the problem.  Building a wall doesn't solve the problem.   Let's get our priorities in line. End the President's disastrous  policy and pass the Dream Act.                            ____________________
