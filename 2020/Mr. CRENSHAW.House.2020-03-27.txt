 Mr. Speaker, businesses large and small, through no  fault of their own, are failing. We told them to shut down and workers  are losing their jobs.   Let me clear something up for everyone. A loss of a job is a loss of  a job whether from a large business or a small business, and it is  devastating for families.   Americans need help. Thankfully, this bill covers it all, from direct  aid to accelerated loans. But when every day counts in a crisis, this  bill was delayed by Democrats unnecessarily for a totally unrelated  progressive wish list. I don't get mad, but this made me mad. And, in  the end, the final bill today is barely different than last weekend,  and the Record will show that.   But we have it now, and we should pass it now. It will soften the  upcoming hardship. But we must not be complacent, for we have more  difficult decisions ahead: How will we balance the opening of society  with the pandemic?   It is a tough question, and we won't be able to answer that question  if the antics of this week continue. The country will move forward  together as Americans, not as petty, opportunistic partisans.
