 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Herbert  Paul Douglas, Jr., who passed away as the oldest Olympic medalist in  the United States at 101 years old.   Herb Douglas won the bronze medal for the long jump in 1948 at the  Summer Olympic Games in London. For 2 years, he attended my alma mater,  Xavier University of Louisiana, and later went on to earn his  bachelor's degree in physical education and his master's in education  from the University of Pittsburgh. Xavier University also awarded him  an honorary degree in 2011.   As a student athlete, esteemed businessman, Olympian, and community  leader, Herb Douglas excelled and made us proud. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
