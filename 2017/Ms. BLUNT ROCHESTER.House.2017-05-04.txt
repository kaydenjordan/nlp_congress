 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from AARP which makes clear  [[Page H4156]]  health care will be sabotaged under this bill, and healthcare costs for  older Americans will ``dramatically increase.''       [From the House Democratic Leader's Press Office, May 3, 2017]    AARP Press Release: New Changes to the AHCA Makes a Bad Bill Worse!         Dear Representative: Older Americans care deeply about       access to and affordability of health care. With the addition       of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to       share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)       and urge you to vote NO. Changes under consideration that       would allow states to waive important consumer protections--      allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans       with pre-existing conditions more because they've had cancer,       diabetes or heart disease--would make a bad bill even worse.       This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50-64       who have a deniable preexisting condition. The Upton       amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium       increases for those with pre-existing conditions.        Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been       expressing serious concerns about the impact that this       legislation will have on older Americans. The Congressional       Budget Office (CBO)'s last estimate further demonstrates the       harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of       our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care       Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare;       dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket costs for 50-      64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance       market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate       against those with pre-existing conditions; substantially       increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put       at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and       poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access       long-term services and supports and other benefits.        Our members and others 50 years of age and older care       deeply about health care and want to know where their elected       leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming       vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform       our members, and others over age 50, how their elected       officials voted. We'll communicate the results of the vote in       our widely-circulated publications, in e-mail alerts, in our       online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all       Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in       its current form.                                   Medicare         The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current       law that have strengthened Medicare's fiscal outlook,       specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent       payroll tax on higher-income workers. Repealing this       provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance       trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish       Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50-64 have a pre-      existing condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in       the non-group market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently       eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage       through either the federal health benefits exchange or a       state-based exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA,       the number of 50-64 year old Americans who are uninsured has       dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would       be a significant step backwards and result in millions of       older Americans who cannot afford their health care,       including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO       estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose       coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans       would lose coverage over the next 10 years.        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical 50-64 year old seeking coverage       through an exchange has a median annual income of under       $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for       health care. We have serious concerns--reinforced by the CBO       estimate--that the bill under consideration will dramatically       increase health care costs for 50-64 year olds who purchase       health care through an exchange due both to the changes in       age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires       uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than       younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in       current tax credits for older Americans. CBO concluded that       the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people       and force many into lower quality plans.        Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable       age tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change       showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by       up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced       the tax credits available for older Americans to help       purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill's changes to       current law's tax credits alone could increase premium costs       by more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000.       Overall, both the bill's tax credit changes and 5:1 age       rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older       Americans. In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old       earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by       $12,900--758 percent--from $1,700 to $14,600 a year.        Current law prohibits insurance companies from       discriminating against individuals due to a pre-existing       condition. The bill would repeal pre-existing condition       protections and would once again allow insurance companies to       charge Americans more--we estimate up to $25,000 more--due to       a pre-existing condition. As a result, the 4o percent of 50-       to 64-year-olds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable       preexisting condition risk losing access to affordable       coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to       address the impact of premium increases for those with pre-      existing conditions, would do little to mitigate the massive       premium increase for some of the most vulnerable Americans.       AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the law's pre-existing       condition protections which benefit millions of Americans.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid       funding by $880 billion over 2017-2026, about 25 percent less       than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital       safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of       individuals, including over 17.4 million low-income seniors       and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the       program for critical health care and long-term services and       supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such       as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and       transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities       now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and       cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and       services for this vulnerable population.        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community-based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens.     Mr. Speaker, I know in these polarized times we  often forget our actual connections to each other, but we are all  connected. A sick, uninsured employee affects the bottom line of a  small business. Uncompensated care in the emergency room, we all pay  the bill. When a child from an uninsured family goes to school with an  undiagnosed virus, not only does it impact his or her ability to learn,  it impacts other kids and puts them at risk. We are all connected.   As Martin Luther King so powerfully said: ``We may have come over on  different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''   Mr. Speaker, it is time we start rowing together. Unfortunately, this  bill fails to recognize this. It still fails that we are connected,  and, instead of bringing us together, this simply divides us by  providing less coverage, imposing an age tax, forcing people to pay  more, and stripping key protections.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1628.
