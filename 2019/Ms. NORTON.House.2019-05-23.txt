 Mr. Speaker, the House will not be in session next  Monday, Memorial Day. That day has very special meaning for the 700,000  residents in the Nation's Capital.   The District of Columbia is one of the oldest jurisdictions in the  United States. That means that residents of the Nation's Capital have  fought and died in every war, including the war that created the United  States of America: the Revolutionary War.   I have come to the House floor today to particularly recognize, on  Memorial Day coming, the denial of full participation in their  government through statehood, not only to the District of Columbia's  residents, but to our present Active-Duty servicemembers, our National  Guard members, our reservists, our many veterans and their families who  are residents of the District of Columbia.   Their service and sacrifice, along with that of Americans across the  breadth of this land, but especially their sacrifice, is unparalleled  and, therefore, deserves special mention: unparalleled because those  who served, those who died, those who continue to serve to protect our  country do so without full and equal rights in their own country.   Later, I will be speaking about what their sacrifices have meant to  our country, but as I come to the floor, I start by paying special  tribute to the sacrifices that the residents of the Nation's Capital  have made for 218 years.   I will be going, this coming week, with the Mayor of the District of  Columbia, with the city council chair, with the entire government, to  what is called the D.C. War Memorial. This pristine, beautiful memorial  is dedicated to those who lost their lives in World War I.   It is the only memorial--indeed, it is the only edifice--on The Mall  that is dedicated to people in one district, and for very good reason:  because that district is our Nation's Capital; because those whose  names appear on that memorial--I think there are 400- or so names--died  without full representation and died giving that kind of  representation, the kind of democracy, the kind of democracy that  others have.                                time  1315    Our country, of course, prides itself on its democratic traditions,  but we must remember that the country was founded seeking democracy,  not as a democracy.   When it was founded, only White men who held property could vote.  That means that the majority then could not vote and did not have their  democratic rights. So we have to, with some humility, approach our own  standing as a democracy. May I remind us all today that it took 132  years after the Nation's founding for women to get the right to vote.   When half the population didn't have the right to vote, I am sure  Members came to this House floor saying what a wonderful democracy it  was. Well, it wasn't.   What is important about our country is our aspiration to become the  democracy that the Framers themselves hoped we would come--they hoped  we would become because even they had created a constitution where an  African American was counted as three-fifths of a man. That was a  compromise.   They created this country knowing, believing, that those of us who  sit in this House, in the Senate, and Americans throughout the country  would make our democracy a real democracy over time.   It has taken 218 years, and still counting, for the District of  Columbia and its residents to achieve statehood, including voting  rights and all the rights that come with equal citizenship.   We are the only democracy in the world where the residents who live  in the Nation's Capital don't have the same rights as everyone else in  that country.   I am not pessimistic today. We are just 5 months into the new  Congress, and we are already beginning to break ground with those old  traditions.   In March, the House passed H.R. 1, as we call it. That is our all- democracy, prodemocracy bill, still trying to achieve full democracy  throughout the United States. I will say a bit about H.R. 1 shortly.   It has findings, extensive findings for D.C. statehood, which means,  since it passed by more than a majority, that most Members of the House  are already on track and on the Record for D.C. statehood.   I am grateful that Speaker Nancy Pelosi 3 days into the new term  issued a very powerful statement, the head of the House, endorsing  statehood.   I am grateful to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who unveiled a  sweeping proposal to bring democracy to our country. His proposal is  interesting because it included only three issues: combating voter  disenfranchisement through the Voting Rights Act, establishing national  automatic voter registration laws; and the third one, support of D.C.  statehood.   I think that says a great deal about what the priority of bringing  full democracy to the Nation's Capital means to the Nation.   I am grateful to Chairman Elijah Cummings, the chairman of the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform, who has announced that he will hold  a hearing on D.C. statehood and will bring the bill to the floor this  year.   It is worth hearing a few words from Speaker Pelosi, to show the  commitment of our party to full democracy.   The Speaker said: ``The right to vote and to equal representation is  the foundation of our freedom and a core pillar of our democracy. For  too long, the residents of the District of Columbia have served our  Nation in uniform, paid taxes, and contributed to the economic power  and success of our country while being denied the full enfranchisement  that is their right.''   I am encouraged today because while it takes 218 votes to pass the  D.C. statehood bill, already 5 months into this new majority, we have  204 cosponsors. We are very grateful and very proud of that very strong  showing of support for democracy in the Nation's Capital.   To elaborate a bit on the significance of being in H.R. 1, which  documented findings for why the District of Columbia should have  statehood, to put that in context, just look at the other matters that  were in this enhancing democracy bill, because they didn't have  anything to do with D.C. statehood.   And yet, D.C. statehood is in this enhancing democracy bill, which  includes such matters as supporting the adoption of paper ballots to  protect our election infrastructure from cyberattacks, increasing donor  disclosure requirements, strengthening campaign oversight, expanding  early voting and voting by mail, ending partisan gerrymandering,  requiring all Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates to publicly  disclose their tax returns--until this President. For decades, others  have, of course.   You can see those issues are about enhancing democracy in the larger  sense. It says everything about the priority of this Congress that H.R.  1 also includes making sure that the residents of the Nation's Capital  have the same and, indeed, equal rights with other Americans.   We are well on our way to nationalizing the fight to D.C. statehood,  nationalizing, because my one frustration, that we have faced and  continue to face, that most residents, most Americans, think that those  who live in their Nation's Capital have the same rights they have. That  is what I mean by the need to nationalize this important issue.   What polls show is that it is inconceivable to the average American  that there would be any Americans who don't have the same rights that  they have. Of course, that is the case.   That is why, periodically, I come to the floor to make sure and  remind the House of this anomaly, that we are the only country that  does not give those  [[Page H4159]]  who live in its capital the same rights as others in their country.   I am heartened by the many national organizations that, as I speak,  have come on to endorse statehood for the District of Columbia.   As I was, literally, coming to the House floor, a staff member rushed  behind me to add another one. It is up to 20.   I will bet by the time I get back to my office in the Rayburn  Building, the number will be even beyond 20 because they have been  coming on ever since we put out the word. They represent millions of  people and can help Americans to know what they do not know.    These are the national organizations that by the time I came to the  House floor had endorsed D.C. statehood: Common Cause, Public Citizen,  National Active and Retired Employees Association, Sierra Club, People  For the American Way, International Association of Machinists and  Aerospace Workers, Planned Parenthood, Demand Justice, Indivisible,  Americans for Democratic Action, Demos, NORML, NETWORK, Stand Up  America, Demand Progress, United Food and Commercial Workers,  Democratic Coalition, National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, and Human  Rights Campaign.   These are organizations whose numbers go into the many millions that  can help us by making sure Americans know what many would be ashamed to  find out, that they live in a country where people who live in their  Nation's Capital don't have the same rights they have.   What a diverse city this is, about half Black, half White, many high- income people--yes, its share of poor people like every city--top 10 in  economic growth, bursting at the seams with more people moving in every  day, the kind of National Capital Americans have every right to be  proud of.   Until Democrats captured this House, even our self-government, the  right to govern ourselves in the District of Columbia, was under  attack. I had to fight off bills that eliminate important laws in the  District of Columbia. What did they have to say about our local laws?   For example, a favorite has been attempts to wipe out all the gun  safety laws in the District of Columbia. I have been able to defeat  these bills--almost all of them--even while I have been in the  minority.   But why should I have to come to this floor to say to Members of the  House that these are local matters?   This is a national body. Stay out of our business.   There were laws that would have repealed our Local Budget Autonomy  Act, where we deal only with spending matters resident alone pay for.   A law they tried to erase a recreational marijuana. Ten states allow  recreational marijuana, which the House has allowed.   They tried to wipe out abortions for low-income women. They tried to  wipe out our Death with Dignity Act. These, of course, are rather  progressive matters.   Death with dignity, for example, after seeking the advice of a  physician, and with only 6 months to live, allows people to take their  own lives, with pharmaceuticals provided by a physician. That is not  the case for every jurisdiction.   By the way, the majority of American people support this right. But  if you disagree with it, Congress can't do anything about it anywhere  else, only in the District of Columbia.   I could name several other bills. We were able to defeat all of these  bills away except two. One is the marijuana commercialization act. We  were able to save the ability to possess 2 ounces but not to do what  those 10 states already do, which is to regulate it and tax it.   Marijuana should be regulated, not just sold. Why does the House not  want that? Of course, to sell and legally tax marijuana, if you don't  do that, people will smoking marijuana anyway.   We have six universities here. Do you think people aren't smoking  pot?   The Republican priority has always been local control. That is their  mantra. They even want the Federal Government often out of the business  that the Federal Government must be in.   We have indicated that we would like that mantra to apply to the  District of Columbia as well.                                time  1330    At the same time, we are on a dual track. At the same time that we  are trying to get statehood, we have not gotten full control of our own  city because the Congress, as I have just indicated, can intervene.   So, at the same time that we are trying to get statehood, which would  do the whole thing, we are also trying to use the Home Rule Act simply  to get what every other jurisdiction has: a local prosecutor, for  example; the right to declare clemency for local residents, local  control of local courts, etc.   So we are on two tracks: statehood, which would give us the whole set  of rights that the rest of the country has; and using the Home Rule  Act--and the District has had home rule since 1973--simply getting the  kinds of rights that do not require statehood but that other  jurisdictions have passed locally.   I have gotten three bills passed this term. I got them passed in the  first 3 months. And note that, even when I was in the minority in the  last Congress--I was voted the most effective Democrat in the Congress.  The commentary noted that Norton--does not have the final vote on the  House floor.   I got back my vote in the Committee of the Whole. I now vote for the  District of Columbia when the House meets in the Committee of the  Whole. I was able to get that right when I first came to Congress.   And if this is believable, when the Democrats lost the House,  Republicans took back even that vote, the DC vote in the Committee of  the Whole, even though it had been approved by the courts of the United  States. It was granted by the House; therefore, it could be taken away  by the House. It was taken away by the House before.   Getting full and equal rights for the District of Columbia is  personal to me because I am a native Washingtonian--indeed, a third- generation Washingtonian.   I cannot help but tell the story of my great-grandfather, a runaway  slave from Virginia. He came to the District of Columbia when they  still had slavery, when, of course, it didn't have any home rule or  statehood.   The District was being built. This Capitol building was being built.  Work was being done on the streets, and people were anxious to hire  anybody they could find. Richard Holmes got a job working on the  streets of the District of Columbia.   And passed down to my family is what happened to Richard Holmes.  Richard Holmes that continues to inspire me, even as I am inspired by  our veterans as we approach Memorial Day.   Richard Holmes was working on the streets of the District of  Columbia, where slave owners roamed the streets, because, after all,  valuable property was lost if there was a runaway slave that could be  identified.   A man walked up behind Richard Holmes and called out the name  ``Richard.'' Richard Holmes kept digging. Then the slave owner went  over to the straw boss and said, ``That is my slave. I have come to  take him back.'' And the straw boss said, ``Well, that man didn't  answer to that name,'' and he let Richard Holmes stay.   I think Richard Holmes must have been a good worker, so he just  wasn't going to give him up. I don't know that. All I know is that he  did not give him up, and the Holmes family has been very grateful ever  since.   This has been the most important destination, not only for people  like my great-grandfather who simply walked off of a plantation in  Virginia. In telling the story, you will note that I didn't speak about  Richard Holmes as some heroic runaway slave, because that is not how  the story was told to us. We were told that Richard Holmes simply  walked off that plantation when nobody was looking and walked all the  way to the District of Columbia from way down in Virginia.   In a real sense, I feel like I am walking. I am continuing in his  footsteps as I strive to help my city become the 51st State, no longer  be a city where there is taxation without representation.   Imagine the outrage. This is not a Congress which likes taxes,  particularly my Republican friends. Well, a lot of us have owned up to  the fact that it became a great country because all of us pitched in,  including paying Federal  [[Page H4160]]  taxes. But imagine paying Federal taxes when you don't have anything to  say about the amount of those taxes or anything else about those taxes.   Imagine being number one per capita in Federal taxes to support your  country and yet having no final vote on this House floor when those  taxes are raised, when, for example, there has been a massive tax cut  that went to the great benefit, as it turned out, of corporations and  the very well-off.   For the District of Columbia, I could speak on that bill but I could  not vote on that bill, even though I represent those who will pay the  highest amount in taxes pursuant to that bill.   So taxation without representation is not simply a slogan for the  people I represent. It has real meaning, as real for us as it did for  the Framers. They were willing to risk treasonous acts in order not to  pay taxes without representation.   As the United States stands, today as a Nation, we are in violation  of treaties the United States has signed because we do not grant full  and equal rights to the residents of the Nation's Capital.   For example, our country, in 1977, signed the International Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights. The Human Rights Committee, which has  oversight over that treaty, has since said that the United Nations  delegation to the U.N. `` . . . remains concerned that residents of the  District of Columbia do not enjoy full representation in Congress, a  restriction which does not seem to be compatible with article 25 of the  covenant,'' the covenant that the United States has signed, in  violation of all our country stands for and in violation of  international law.   So, as this Memorial Day comes, I come to the floor simply to remind  my colleagues of what it means for those of us who live in our Nation's  Capital. Even though on this Memorial Day we recall the Memorial Days  that have gone ahead, commemorating the residents of this city who have  fought and died in every war, I believe we should particularly note the  first African American general, who happened to be born and raised in  the District of Columbia; the first African American Air Force general,  who was born and raised in the District of Columbia; the first African  American Naval Academy graduate, born and raised in the District of  Columbia; and the first African American Air Force Academy graduate,  born and raised in the District of Columbia.    I cite these African Americans because they served, all of them, when  the District was a segregated city. And when I say the District was a  segregated city, understand that this was a majority-White city and has  been a majority-White city for most of its 218 years as a city.   And yet African Americans and Whites have been treated in exactly the  same way, as second-class and perhaps worse.   On Monday, the last Monday in May, Memorial Day will mean perhaps  more to the residents of our Nation's Capital than anywhere else, and  particularly to our veterans who are still living here. We cannot help  but remember that in World War I the District lost more lives than  three States.   And, therefore, on Memorial Day, 2019, as I remember at our  casualties, I speak on this House floor for every resident, for every  veteran, and, I believe, for every American when I say all Americans,  those who live, those who have died, and those who continue to serve,  are entitled to full and equal rights.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 41 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, May 24, 2019, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
