 Mr. Speaker, brinkmanship is no way to run a  government. The default on America act is one of the worst bills I have  had the opportunity to vote on. It is antichildren, antiseniors,  antiveterans, antimiddle America, antismall business, antihealthcare,  antiworkers.   As a matter of fact, it is anti-American because all that it does is  cut, cut, cut. When all that you do is cut, cut, and cut, all that you  get is blood, blood, blood. The blood of the American people will be on  the hands of those who held the knife. I urge a ``no'' vote.                                time  1630
