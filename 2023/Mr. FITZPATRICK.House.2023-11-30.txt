 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of my amendment to H.R. 5961, the  No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act.   Mr. Chair, this Congress has a responsibility to unequivocally  denounce the cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated by the terrorist  organizations funded by Iran, especially Hamas.   As we work to prohibit further funds from being used by the ruthless  Iranian regime to prop up terrorists and subsidize terror attacks, we  must also ensure that we swiftly and clearly condemn the criminal acts  already carried out by Iran's agents of terror.   The deliberate use of innocent civilians as humanitarian  infrastructure by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist groups to  shield themselves, their weapons, and their operations is entirely  unconscionable.   Their unabashed and irredeemable disregard for human life is equally  outrageous. Hamas and other terrorist organizations are placing  innocent, noncombatant women, children, elderly, and other vulnerable  individuals in harm's way. This must stop.   This is a blatant contravention of international humanitarian law.   Beyond all of that, Mr. Chair, it is a fundamental violation of human  dignity.   My amendment ensures that the United States emphatically condemns  these actions of Iran-backed terrorist organizations. It further  demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of Hamas and other  terrorist organizations so that innocent civilian lives may be saved in  both Israel and Palestine.   This has not and should not be a partisan issue. This Congress and  this government must continue to be united in our condemnation of  terror and terrorists.   Anything less is a betrayal of our obligation as a global leader for  human rights, human dignity, and human freedom.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
