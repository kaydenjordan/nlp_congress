 Mr. Speaker, today I am proud of American democracy, and I  want to talk about American democracy.   In this election, record numbers of voters turned out to cast their  ballots, with very few voting irregularities.   A record number of young people turned out to cast their ballots and  express their voice by voting.   We saw civil servants and folks tabulating those ballots. We saw  American democracy at work, and we ought to be proud of that.   On January 20, we will welcome President Biden and Vice President  Kamala Harris in a peaceful transfer of power.   God bless the United States, and God bless our democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for his leadership and  support.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan measure, H.R.  6334, the Securing America From Epidemics, or SAFE Act. This  legislation, which I introduced alongside my friend, Congressman Ted  Yoho, would authorize U.S. participation in the Coalition for Epidemic  Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI.   CEPI was created in the aftermath of the 2015 West Africa Ebola  epidemic. Its founders understood that due to factors like climate  change, overcrowding, malnutrition, and the proximity of people living  next to animals, the world would see deadly epidemics more and more  frequently. The most effective countermeasures to these epidemics are  vaccines.   CEPI sought to fund vaccines for several pathogens like MERS that  could potentially explode into pandemics. And it sought to help develop  universal vaccine platform technologies that could be adapted to  quickly address emerging outbreaks. The individuals in CEPI could not  have predicted the current COVID-19 pandemic, but they knew it was just  a matter of time until we would see something like this.   Since the start of the pandemic, CEPI has devoted major funding to  nine vaccine candidates to defeat COVID-19. In January of this year,  CEPI was one of the first investors in Moderna, providing catalytic  funding to spur additional research and development. That early funding  has paid off. It looks like Moderna's Phase 3 trials have been  successful.   CEPI's early investment in Moderna is a reminder of the critical role  CEPI plays and will continue to play: investing in smaller companies to  boost their capacity, so that larger players and actors can help scale  and bring those vaccines to market. This is what happened with Moderna  and may happen with other vaccine candidates.   USAID recently announced the collaboration with CEPI, funding $20  million over 5 years to combat noncoronavirus priority diseases, like  Lassa fever and Ebola, but we need to do more. By authorizing U.S.  participation in CEPI, this bill will enable the United States to  firmly claim a seat at CEPI's table, shape its priorities and  governance, and allow Congress to provide contributions to the  organization.  [[Page H5882]]    U.S. participation in CEPI was one of the recommendations of the  final report issued nearly a year ago at the Center for Strategic and  International Studies Commission on Strengthening America's Health  Security. It was prescient in its recommendations, and I am proud to  have served as a commissioner. We knew then that the next epidemic or  pandemic was around the corner. It is here with us now, but it will not  be the last one.   We need to be a full and active participant in CEPI's work. By  working through organizations like CEPI to develop new vaccine  technologies, we will ensure the world is far more ready for the next  pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yoho and all the cosponsors of this  important legislation, as well as the work that the Committee on  Foreign Affairs staff, like Katy Crosby, and my own staff, like Ryan  Uyehara, did to bring this legislation to the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and call on  the Senate to pass it as well.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support of my resolution,  H. Res. 1012, which recognizes the transformation of the U.S.-South  Korea relationship into a strong and enduring partnership that benefits  the entire world.   As the proud co-chair of the Korea Caucus and the co-chair of the  Congressional Study Group on Korea, I know how important this  relationship is to our two countries.   This spring, I introduced this resolution because I wanted to  acknowledge and highlight the shared history and ties between our  nations.   It was over 70 years ago that the United States rushed to the aid of  the Republic of Korea after they were attacked by its neighbor to the  north.   The United States, leading the multinational coalition of the United  Nations Command, successfully defended the Republic of Korea.   But the war devastated South Korea. Forty years ago, South Korea was  one of the poorest countries in the world. Today, they are one of the  most advanced. It is a miracle, and it is hard work.   The Republic of Korea became a democracy in the late 1980s. Today, it  is one of the most widely respected countries in Asia and the world. It  has been incredibly successful against the COVID-19 pandemic and has  helped the United States in our own battle against it.   President-elect Biden has recognized the value of our relationship  with Korea, and his call to President Moon Jae-in was one of the first  calls to a foreign leader.   Our ties with the Republic of Korea are enduring. They are based on  our shared people-to-people values, our vibrant Korean-American  community, American expatriates in South Korea, and our economic ties.   We have shared values and respect for democracy and human rights. We  will work together to confront the challenges of this pandemic, as well  as other challenges, like climate change.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who support and  sustain this alliance, as well as Chairman Engel and Ranking Member  McCaul and their staff, like Theresa Lou, who helped bring this  resolution to the floor.
