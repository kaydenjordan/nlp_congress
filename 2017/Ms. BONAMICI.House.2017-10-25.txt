 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be on the floor this  morning to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague on the  Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Drew Ferguson from  Georgia.   Our bill, Promoting Apprenticeships Through Regional Training  Networks for Employers' Required Skills Act, or PARTNERS Act, will help  close the skills gap by increasing opportunities for small- and medium- sized businesses to establish apprenticeships and work-based learning  programs.   When I visit communities in northwest Oregon, I hear from many  Oregonians who still feel left behind because they don't have the  skills they need to compete in today's economy. They are not alone.  Many jobs today do not require a 4-year degree, but do require more  than a high school diploma. In fact, those jobs make up about 53  percent of today's labor market, but only 43 percent of today's workers  are trained at this level.   This creates a skills gap, leaving businesses struggling to find  workers with appropriate skills, and workers without meaningful  pathways to better paying jobs.   I hear from employers and workforce organizations about the  importance of a qualified workforce. They want to identify new  opportunities to strengthen skills training.   Apprenticeships and work-based learning programs are a win-win. They  provide individuals with paid, on-the-job training and classroom  instruction. Employers can align training with the skills they need at  their workplaces, and workers can learn while they earn.   Unfortunately, small- and medium-sized businesses often lack the  infrastructure and resources to establish apprenticeships or work-based  learning programs on their own. So the PARTNERS Act addresses this by  establishing a grant program to support the creation and expansion of  industry and sector partnerships that will help small-and medium-sized  businesses develop work-based learning programs and provide support  programs for workers.   Industry and sector partnerships will bring together employers,  education, training, labor, and community-based organizations to  develop work-based learning programs that benefit workers and the  economy as a whole.   In Oregon, these partnerships could address, for example, workforce  development needs in rapidly growing sectors like healthcare and  technology.   Under the PARTNERS Act, the partnerships would use grant funds to  recruit workers, develop training curriculum, and provide workers with  access to tools, work attire, transportation, childcare services, and  mentorship support. These support services help businesses retain  employees and help workers balance caring for and providing for their  families.   Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill results in no additional cost to  taxpayers because it authorizes the use of 50 percent of the funds  deposited in the H1-B nonimmigrant petition account, and these will be  used by the Department of Labor for the partnership grants. This  funding source was suggested by the administration in a June 2017  executive order on apprenticeships.   Through stronger investments and work-based learning programs, we can  build pathways to get more people back to work, to provide our Nation's  businesses with the workforce that will improve productivity and  efficiency.   I thank Mr. Ferguson for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to  join us in supporting this bipartisan legislation that will help people  in our districts across the country access good jobs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the immediate passage  of the Dream Act to bring certainty to the more than 10,000 DREAMers in  Oregon and DREAMers across the country.   I have met with DREAMers in my State of Oregon, and tearing them away  from their lives would be a tremendous loss for our communities.  DREAMers like Daniel, a dedicated second grade teacher, DACA allowed  him to come out of the shadows and give back to his community.   But with President Trump ending DACA, Daniel is rightly anxious about  his future. He worries about the effect on his students if he is forced  to leave abruptly in the middle of the school year.   When we threaten DREAMers, we put their futures at risk, but we also  risk harming the many people who rely on them, like Daniel's students.   Mr. Speaker, we must work together and pass the Dream Act  immediately. We just pledged, ``with liberty and justice for all.''  Let's bring justice to the DREAMers and pass the Dream Act.                            ____________________
