 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Alex  Ray and Lisa Mure of Holderness and Susan Mathison and Steve Rand of  Plymouth as March's Granite Staters of the Month. The group of friends  started a nonprofit, Common Man for Ukraine, that has raised more than  $2.6 million for Ukrainian children impacted by Putin's unconscionable  invasion of Ukraine.   Following the onset of the war, the group wanted to figure out how  they could help the Ukrainian people. Through their membership with the  Plymouth Rotary Club, Alex and Steve connected with Rotarian leaders in  Poland, which was already seeing an influx of Ukrainian refugees  fleeing the conflict. And then Alex, Susan, Steve, and Lisa jumped into  action. Within just 2 weeks, the four friends were on the ground in  Poland and Ukraine meeting with Ukrainian and Polish Rotary Club  leaders about the needs of local displaced person camps, orphanages,  and safehouses for displaced children.   When the group returned to New Hampshire, they began to raise funds,  with the first donation being $500 from the Plymouth Rotary Club. Since  then, they have raised more than $2.6 million to purchase 750 tons of  food for their partners in Poland. The NH Fisher Cats AA baseball team  also hosted a benefit game to raise funds.   The group has not let up in their efforts over the past year. They  have visited Poland and Ukraine three more times to evaluate the  changing needs on the ground in coordination with their Rotarian  partners. In addition to packing warehouses with essential goods, they  also delivered those relief supplies themselves to safehouses and  orphanages for children impacted by the war. This past Christmas, they  brought personal solar lanterns, food, generators, and presents to 21  Ukrainian orphanages, so that the children could experience literal and  symbolic light throughout the various power outages. When the Granite  Staters arrived with the supplies, the children excitedly came outside  in the cold to greet them, and they were able to share Christmas  greetings and carols despite the language barrier. The four volunteers  bravely returned to Ukraine on the war's February anniversary to  deliver supplies to 14 additional orphanages and safehouses.   The work that Alex, Susan, Steve, and Lisa have done with their  nonprofit organization is an incredible testament to the impact that  Granite Staters can have, even across the world, when they are helping  others. They refused to stand by during a devastating war and the  subsequent refugee crisis, instead boldly finding a way to directly  help Ukrainian children. Alex, Susan, Steve, and Lisa embody the  Granite State spirit of taking on a challenge directly in order to make  a real difference, and I know that they will continue to make New  Hampshire proud through their work in Poland and Ukraine.                            ____________________
