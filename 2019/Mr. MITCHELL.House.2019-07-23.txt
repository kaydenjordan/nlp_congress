 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ed Lomasney  for his 60 years of dedicated service to the Burtchville, Michigan,  fire department.   Mr. Lomasney became a firefighter following in the footsteps of his  father, who helped found the Burtchville Fire Department. Over the last  60 years, Ed has served as a volunteer firefighter and has been  instrumental in growing the firehouse through his time, resources, and  mentorship.   In addition to volunteering with the fire department, Ed worked and  retired from DTE Energy. He is a devoted husband to his wife, Mary  Nell, and loving father to their three children.   For six decades, Ed has been a mainstay of the department, and he  will be missed by all. Although Ed may be retiring from the fire  department, we all know he will remain involved in the community to  make an impact on all of Burtchville.   Madam Speaker, I join the Burtchville community in thanking him for  his dedication and his 60 years of service and wish him the best in his  retirement.                            ____________________
