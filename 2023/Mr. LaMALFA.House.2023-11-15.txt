 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was honored to be able to take  part in the rally for Israel on the National Mall.   Indeed, there were so many people seeking peace, sharing their love  for mankind with each other, but also underlining the horrific  suffering that has happened to the people in Gaza and to the people  that have been kidnapped by the evil Hamas. There are hostages still  being held there.   We will work and fight for their release, but also for long-term  peace. Israel only seeks peace to exist with their neighbors in the  Middle East or amidst the Arab world. That is all they want.   To see what is happening, to see the videos, to see the images of  what was done to them on October 7 is horrific and evil. We must  continue to stand strong on Israel. At that rally, the march for  Israel, we saw that solidarity and we will stay with Israel through  thick and thin until this is resolved properly.   God bless the State of Israel and God bless those families that have  hostages still being held until we can get to a resolution and find  them and get them back to safety.                            ____________________
