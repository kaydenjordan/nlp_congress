 Mr. Speaker, let me indicate to the American people  happy holidays and thank the gentleman from Georgia for his bipartisan  reach to help us understand the impact of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), the incoming chair of the Democratic Caucus and the original  cosponsor of this legislation. I thank him for his embrace of all of us  as we worked our way through this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me take the tone of Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Collins, and  Mr. Jeffries in saying that this is a momentous occasion. What I am  grateful for, Mr. Speaker, is the faith community; the advocates who  have been working with families for decades; mothers who welcome home  sons and daughters; prisoners or ex-prisoners like those I met just a  week ago at the Houston Reentry Program who indicated that they could  not find a job; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; our present  chair, Mr. Richmond; and our chair-elect, Ms. Bass.   People from all walks of life have recognized that this is not going  to increase crime, but quite the opposite. Through our faith, we  understand that humanity and the recognition of someone's dignity helps  them to be a contributing member of society.  [[Page H10364]]    So I rise to support this bill that includes the First Step and the  sentencing reform reduction act. I rise because so many people have  worked over the years to ensure that this bill will work.   It is important to note what we are overcoming. The ACLU said: ``Over  the past 4 to 5 decades, U.S. criminal justice policies have driven an  increase in incarceration rates that is unprecedented in this country  and unmatched elsewhere in the world. Our country has over 20 percent  of the world's incarcerated individuals, despite having less than 5  percent of the world's population.''   In 2015, it was estimated that 6.7 million persons were involved in  the adult correctional systems, and almost 2.2 million were in prisons  or jail, 180,000 in the Federal system, all costing us money and the  value of those human beings that can serve their country.   So I am grateful for the work that we came together on, that we  overcame some of the challenges. I want to mention Mr.  John Lewis, who  is the conscience of this Congress, who worked with us to ensure that  sentencing reform would be part of the ultimate bill.                                time  1130    We acknowledge other members of the other body, Senator Durbin,  Senator Grassley, Senator Harris, and, of course, Senator Booker, among  others. I thank Mr. Goodlatte in his last bill for his commitment to  moving criminal justice reform, even in the last Congress, and the new  ranking member and soon to be chair, Mr. Nadler, who put all of his  energies in ensuring that we could effectively move this bill.   We worked with Senator Durbin, and we worked with Senator Grassley,  who wanted to make sure that this was a wonderful partnership, the same  kind of partnership that my good friend, Mr. Jeffries, spoke of,  conservative viewpoints, religious viewpoints, and those advocacy  groups who had fought for years against mandatory minimums. We have  come a long way.   Justice has to be equal, and it has to be fair. It has to be  righteous and reasonable, and, in that, it has to have any number of  those participating. Eric Holder, who worked on this issue, recognized  that we had to have a partnership between these two fine elements:  reduction, and, as well, the First Step Act, sentencing reduction. I  know that this bill--and hope it will be signed, because the President  indicated he wants the finest prison reform bill that we can have  anywhere.   Let me proclaim on the floor that we have made that giant step, but  we have added the opportunity for almost 5,000 people to see their  families, under supervision, by sentencing reduction--over 50,000 over  a 10-year period--not individuals who haven't had the opportunity for  training, for job training, for counseling, for opioid treatment, all  matched together with the sentencing and prison reform bill.   So we have elements like the safety valve and retroactive application  of fair sentencing. To all of my friends in the advocacy community, you  have been victorious, and I thank you. Reforms enhance mandatory  minimum sentences for prior drug offenses, recognizing that the crack  cocaine disparity was destructive in the work that we have tried to  do--stacking.   Let me also say that there was concern that there be no oversight  over this bill. I am glad that they took my amendment before an  Independent Review Committee so that the discretion of wardens and the  DOJ are not random, but they, in fact, will have an independent outside  committee to look at this matter.   I am grateful that my friend, Mr.  Danny Davis, who has worked so  hard, got his Second Chance Reauthorization in the bill, which is  extremely important. I am so grateful, and you will hear from  Congresswoman Bass for her ongoing passionate concern about the  treatment of pregnant women, and I look forward to working with her in  the future.   We have groups like the ACLU, The Brennan Group, the NAACP, and  others who have worked hard on this type of legislation, and we are  grateful for their continued insight and keeping us honest as we move  forward.   I want to acknowledge, if I could, the idea, again, that there will  be those who will be preying upon us. In this season of caring and  giving, I hope the Nation will be praying, praying for a better Nation,  praying for the opportunity for people who went astray, and to  recognize that what we have put in this bill are limits to ensure that  these persons released will have the right kind of training and  counseling, because we have increased the funding, we have worked with  the groups that need to be worked with, and we have protected pregnant  prisoners.   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, something that I hope will grow in our  compassion, that we have reformed an aspect of the criminal justice  system as relates to juveniles, and, that is, that there is no more  solitary confinement. I appreciate the sponsors accepting that from  both myself and Senator Booker. It is a bill of compassion. It is not a  bill of crime. It is a bill that America can be proud of.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Bass), the incoming chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus and a member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me quickly move to my closing by really  reemphasizing happy holidays to the American people and to thank our  colleagues for recognizing the humanity of all individuals.   Just in closing, imagine you are a mother, child, or loved one of an  incarcerated person that was robbed by a system that played Russian  roulette with his or her life, because that system decided they were  criminals rather than victims of a public health crisis or of a bad  start in life or a lack of resources as a child. This bill recognizes  that people start life in many different ways, but they can be saved.  They can be relevant. They can be with their families.   So I am grateful for the amendments added, the protection of  juveniles that will not be in solitary confinement, and I am grateful  for the Independent Review Committee that indicates that there will be  an oversight on how wardens issue the earned good time and how they are  treating those who are incarcerated, an Independent Review Committee in  the Institute for Justice.    Finally, I would offer to say, we have money. And that money is at  least a quarter of a billion dollars in terms of the amount of money  that we will have over a period of time--some $250 million is the  approximate amount, at least, in that figure that we have that will be  invested in this particular bill.   Finally, a bill that has been around for a very long time, the Second  Chance Act, has a new lease on life, and that will be part of the bill,  and we will continue to work with our colleagues going forward to  emphasize the redemption of those who are trying to do right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of 2018. I rise  to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act of  2018.   This bill seeks to establish a national communications network to  help locate missing adults by providing assistance to State, Tribal,  and local search efforts. This bill would initiate, facilitate, and  promote Ashanti Alert plans in coordination with States, Indian Tribes,  units of local government, law enforcement agencies, and other  concerned entities with expertise in providing services to adults.   I was pleased when we initially passed this bill last September, and  I am even more pleased with the Senate amendment, and so I rise to  support this legislation and indicate that as of December 31, 2017, the  National Crime Information Center database included records of 55,968  missing adults. In fact, many adults go missing each year that are not  found until it is too late.   In particular, the young woman who the bill is named after, Ashanti  Billie, was too old for the assistance of an AMBER Alert on her behalf  and too young for a Silver Alert. Had these resources been available  when Ashanti Billie was abducted, she may be here today.   Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I join with the manager of the bill to support H.R.  7093, the Clean Up the Code Act, as a measure that takes a small step  toward addressing the problem of over-criminalization as a result of  the hard work of the Over-Criminalization Task Force, of which we look  forward to continuing in the next Congress.   This bill repeals several criminal penalties for violations that do  not involve serious wrongdoing, or at least not serious enough to  warrant criminal prosecution and the consequences of a criminal record.  For example, this bill repeals laws that make the unauthorized for- profit use of the Smoky the Bear and Woodsy Owl characters punishable  by fine and/or imprisonment for up to 6 months.   The conduct that these laws are designed to deter or punish certainly  do not merit criminal sanctions.  [[Page H10396]]    We are grateful for the Clean Up the Code Act, and I ask my  colleagues to support H.R. 7093.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank for  their efforts Representative  Steve Chabot and Representative Hank  Johnson for their work on this bill.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as well in support of S. 2896, the Justice  Against Corruption on K Street Act of 2018, also known as the JACK Act.   The JACK Act would require lobbyists to publicly disclose any State  or Federal convictions for certain crimes of character, such as  bribery, extortion, embezzlement, illegal kickbacks, tax evasion,  fraud, conflicts of interest, making false statements, perjury, or  money laundering.   As many of you have known, this bill impacts lobbyists and impacts  individuals, such as Mr. Abramoff, who pleaded guilty to a number of  counts in 2006.   This is an important bill that was sponsored by Mr. Cohen, and I ask  my colleagues to support this legislation, again, S. 2896, the Justice  Against Corruption on K Street Act of 2018, the JACK Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2961, the Victims of Child Abuse  Act Reauthorization. This bill updates and reauthorizes this important  law so that we can better prevent and address child abuse in our  communities.   This is very important legislation, just for the fact of the number  of children that are abused. In my own community in Texas and in the  city of Houston, we have had some atrocious cases; one just reported in  our newspaper of a 5-year-old under a stairwell, locked, lying flat on  his back, weighing 70 pounds, with no food and water, abused by two  parents, the step-child of one of the parents. What a horrific and  horrible life.   The Administration for Children and Families reported that over 4.1  million referrals for 7.4 million children were made to Child  Protective Services in the United States in 2016.   Our Federal Government must provide resources to ensure that these  cases are carefully, compassionately, and comprehensively addressed at  the local level.   This bill recognizes the sensitivity of these issues and helps  integrate social services, mental and physical healthcare, and law  enforcement.   With the resources and legislative updates in this bill, child  advocacy centers can extend their outreach to underserved communities  and expand programs, such as offering longer term counseling.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representatives Poe and Costa here in  the House and Senators Blunt and Coons in the Senate for leadership on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record several letters  dealing with S. 756: a letter from the ACLU; a letter from the Judicial  Conference of the United States; and a letter from the Center for  American Progress.                                The Leadership Conference, ACLU,                                  Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.      Re THE ACLU AND THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT           5.756, THE FIRST STEP Act.       Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and The Leadership       Conference on Civil and Human Rights, we write to urge you to       vote YES on S. 756, the FIRST STEP Act. This legislation is a       next step towards desperately needed federal criminal justice       reform, but for all its benefits, much more needs to be done.       The inclusion of concrete sentencing reforms in the new and       improved Senate version of the FIRST STEP Act is a modest       improvement, but many people will be left in prison to serve       long draconian sentences because some provisions of the       legislation are not retroactive. The revised FIRST STEP Act,       however, is not without problems. The bill continues to       exclude individuals from benefiting from some provisions       based solely on their  [[Page H10399]]       prior offenses, namely citizenship and immigration status, as       well as certain prior drug convictions and their ``risk       score'' as determined by a discriminatory risk assessment       system. While these concerns remain a priority for our       organizations and we will advocate for improvements in the       future, ultimately the improvements to the federal sentencing       scheme will have a net positive impact on the lives of some       of the people harmed by our broken justice system and we urge       you to vote YES on S. 756. The ACLU and The Leadership       Conference will include your votes on our updated voting       scorecards for the 115th Congress.        Over the past four to five decades, U.S. criminal justice       policies have driven an increase in incarceration rates that       is unprecedented in this country and unmatched elsewhere in       the world. Our country has over 20 percent of the world's       incarcerated individuals, despite having less than five       percent of the world's population. In 2015, the U.S. Justice       Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that 6.7       million persons were involved in the adult correctional       systems in this country and almost 2.2 millions were in       prisons or jail. More than 180,000 of these people are in       federal prison, almost half of whom are there for drug       offenses.        The most recent data indicate that the United States spends       almost $81 billion per year on corrections systems--prisons,       jails, parole, and probation--and this figure does not       include the costs of policing and court systems. The cost of       the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) accounts for nearly a       third of the Department of Justice's discretionary budget.       Federal incarceration has become one of our nation's biggest       expenditures, swallowing the budget of federal law       enforcement. It costs more than $36,000 a year to house just       one federal inmate, almost four times the average yearly cost       of tuition at a public university.        While the dollar amounts are astounding, the toll that our       U.S. criminal justice policies have taken on black and brown       communities across the nation goes far beyond the enormous       amount of money that is spent. This country's extraordinary       incarceration rates impose much greater costs than simply the       fiscal expenditures necessary to incarcerate over 20 percent       of the world's prisoners. The true costs of this country's       addiction to incarceration must be measured in human lives       and particularly the generations of young black and Latino       men who serve long prison sentences and are lost to their       families and communities. The Senate version of the FIRST       STEP Act makes some modest improvements to the current       federal system.        I. Sentencing Reform Changes to House-passed FIRST STEP       Act--Sentencing reform is the key to slowing down the flow of       people going into our prisons. This makes sentencing reform       pivotal to addressing mass incarceration, prison       overcrowding, and the exorbitant costs of incarceration. As a       result of our coalition's advocacy, the new FIRST STEP Act       added some important sentencing reform provisions from SRCA,       which will aid us in tackling these issues on the federal       level. These important changes in federal law will result in       fewer people being subjected to harsh mandatory minimums.        Expands the Existing Safety Valve. The revised bill expands       eligibility for the existing safety valve under 18 U.S.C.       3553(f) from one to four criminal history points if a person       does not have prior 2-point convictions for crimes of       violence or drug trafficking offenses and prior 3-point       convictions. Under the expanded safety valve, judges will       have discretion to make a person eligible for the safety       valve in cases where the seriousness of his or her criminal       history is overrepresented, or it is unlikely he or she would       commit other crimes. This crucial expansion of the safety       valve will reduce sentences for an estimated 2,100 people per       year.        Retroactive Application of Fair Sentencing Act (FSA). The       new version of FIRST STEP Act would retroactively apply the       statutory changes of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA),       which reduced the disparity in sentence lengths between crack       and powder cocaine. This change in the law will allow people       who were sentenced under the harsh and discriminatory 100 to       1 crack to powder cocaine ratio to be resentenced under the       2010 law. This long overdue improvement would allow over       2,600 people the chance to be resentenced.        Reforms the Unfair Two-Strikes and Three-Strikes Laws. The       new version of FIRST STEP would reduce the impact of certain       mandatory minimums. It would reduce the mandatory life       sentence for a third drug felony to a mandatory minimum       sentence of 25 years and reduce the 20-year mandatory minimum       for a second drug felony to 15 years.        Eliminates 924(c) ``stacking''. The revised bill would also       amend 18 U.S.C. 924(c), which currently allows ``stacking,''       or consecutive sentences for gun charges stemming from a       single incident committed during a drug crime or a crime of       violence. The legislation would require a prior gun       conviction to be final before a person could be subject to an       enhanced sentence for possession of a firearm. This provision       in federal law has resulted in very long and unjust       sentences.        II. Prison Reform Changes to House-passed FIRST STEP Act,       H.R. 3356--The revised bill also made some strides in       improving some of the problematic prison reform provisions.       The new bill strengthened oversight over the new risk       assessment system, limited the discretion of the attorney       general, and increased funding for prison programming, among       other things. The bill now does the following:        Establishes an Independent Review Committee. The revised       bill establishes an Independent Review Committee (IRC) of       outside experts to assist the Attorney General in the       development of the risk and needs assessment system. The       National Institute of Justice would select a nonpartisan,       nonprofit organization with expertise in risk and needs       assessments to host the IRC. This added guardrail will help       to ensure the risk and needs assessment system is evidence-      based and potentially help to mitigate any harms.        Permits Early Community Release and Loosens Restrictions on       Home Confinement. The House-passed FIRST STEP Act limited the       use of earned credits to time in prerelease custody (halfway       house or home confinement). The revised bill would expand the       use of earned credits to supervised release in the community.       The bill also would permit individuals in home confinement to       participate in family-related activities that facilitate the       prisoner's successful reentry.        Increased Funding for Prison Reforms. The revised bill       would authorize $75 million annually, a 50 percent increase       over the House-passed bill's $50 million annual       authorization.        Limits Discretion to Deny Early Release. The revised bill       strikes language giving the BOP Director and/or the prison       warden broad discretion to deny release to individuals who       meet all eligibility criteria.        Mandates BOP Capacity. The revised bill mandates that BOP       ensure there is sufficient prerelease custody capacity to       accommodate all eligible prisoners. This helps to address       concerns that individuals would be unable to use their earned       credits because of waiting lists for prerelease custody.        Effectively Ends Federal Juvenile Solitary Confinement. The       revised bill significantly restricts juvenile solitary       confinement, which can cause substantial psychological       damage.        Reauthorizes Second Chance Act. The revised bill       reauthorizes the Second Chance Act, which provides federal       funding for drug treatment, vocational training, and other       reentry and recidivism programming.        While these revisions to the bill were critical to       garnering our support, we must acknowledge that some of the       more concerning aspects of the House-passed version of the       FIRST STEP Act remain.        III. Outstanding Concerns Regarding the FIRST STEP Act--The       bill continues to exclude too many people from earning time       credits, including those convicted of immigration-related       offenses. It does not retroactively apply its sentencing       reform provisions to people convicted of anything other than       crack convictions, continues to allow for-profit companies to       benefit off of incarceration, fails to address parole for       juveniles serving life sentences in federal prison, and       expands electronic monitoring.        Fails to Include Retroactivity for Enhanced Mandatory       Minimum Sentences for Prior Drug Offenses & 924(c)       ``stacking.'' The bill does not include retroactivity for its       sentencing reforms besides the long-awaited retroactivity for       the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. This minimizes the overall       impact substantially. Retroactivity is a vital part of any       meaningful sentencing reform. Not only does it ensure that       the changes we make to our criminal justice system benefit       the people most impacted by it, but it's also one of the       essential policy changes to reduce mass incarceration. The       federal prison population has fallen by over 38,000 since       2013 thanks in large part to retroactive application of       sentencing guidelines approved by the U.S. Sentencing       Commission. More than 3,000 people will be left in prison       without retroactive application of the ``three strikes'' law       and the change to the 924(c) provisions in the FIRST STEP       Act.        Excludes Too Many Federal Prisoners from New Earned Time       Credits. The bill continues to exclude many federal prisoners       from earning time credits and excludes many federal prisoners       from being able to ``cash in'' the credits they earn. The       long list of exclusions in the bill sweep in, for example,       those convicted of certain immigration offenses and drug       offenses. Because immigration and drug offenses account for       53.3 percent of the total federal prison population, many       people could be excluded from utilizing the time credits they       earned after completing programming. The continued exclusion       of immigrants from the many benefits of the bill simply based       on immigration status is deeply troubling. The Senate version       of FIRST STEP maintains a categorical exclusion of people       convicted of certain immigration offenses from earning time       credits under the bill. The new version of the bill also bars       individuals from using the time credits they have earned if       they have a final order of removal. More than 12,000 people       are currently in federal prison for immigration offenses and       are disproportionately people of color. Thus, a very large       number of people in federal prison would not reap the       benefits proposed in this bill and a disproportionate number       of those excluded would be people of color. Denying early-      release credits to certain people also reduces their       incentive to complete the rehabilitative programs and       contradicts the goal of increasing public safety. Any reforms       enacted by Congress should impact a significant number of       people in federal prison and reduce racial disparities or       they will have little effect on the fiscal and human costs of       incarceration.  [[Page H10400]]         Allows Private Prison Companies to Profit. The bill also       maintains concerning provisions that could privatize       government functions and allow the Attorney General excessive       discretion. FIRST STEP provides that in order to expand       programming, BOP shall enter into partnerships with private       organizations and companies under policies developed by the       Attorney General, ``subject to appropriations.'' This could       result in the further privatization of what should be public       functions and would allow private entities to unduly profit       from incarceration.        Relies on Discriminatory Risk Assessment System. The bill       continues to give the Bureau of Prisons and the Attorney       General too much discretion in the design, implementation,       and review of the tool, including the ability for the BOP to       use an existing tool. It also continues to misuse terminology       (i.e. recidivism risk vs. risk categories), inappropriately       ties risk categories to earned time credits, and fails to       properly safeguard against unwarranted racial disparities.        Fails to Include Parole for Juveniles, Sealing and       Expungement. Under SRCA, judges would have discretion to       reduce juvenile life without parole sentences after 20 years.       It would also permit some juveniles to seal or expunge non-      violent convictions from their record. The FIRST STEP Act       does not address these important bipartisan provisions.        IV. Conclusion        Bringing fairness and dignity to our justice system is one       of the most important civil and human rights issues of our       time. The revised version of the FIRST STEP Act is a modest,       but important move towards achieving some meaningful reform       to the criminal legal system. While the bill continues to       have its problems, and we will fight to address those in the       future, it does include concrete sentencing reforms that       would impact people's lives. For these reasons, we urge you       to vote YES on S. 756.        Ultimately, the First Step Act is not the end--it is just       the next in a series of efforts over the past 10 years to       achieve important federal criminal justice reform. Congress       must take many more steps to undo the harms of the tough on       crime policies of the 80's and 90's--to create a system that       is just and equitable, significantly reduces the number of       people unnecessarily entering the system, eliminates racial       disparities, and creates opportunities for second chances.

Sakira Cook, Director,        Justice Program, The Leadership Conference on Civil and       Human Rights.                                             Judicial Conference of                                               The United States,                                  Washington, DC, November 30, 2018.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write on behalf of the Judicial       Conference of the United States, the policy-making body for       the federal Judiciary, regarding S. 3649, the ``First Step       Act,'' which was introduced on November 15, 2018. The       Judiciary strongly supports many of the reforms proposed by       S. 3649. We note that several provisions, however, will       impose new workload requirements on the federal Judiciary,       particularly on judges and our probation system, which will       necessitate additional resources.                        Title I: Recidivism Reduction         We greatly appreciate that, unlike several of its       legislative predecessors, S. 3649 would not require Article       III judges to exercise powers that traditionally have been       exercised by officials in the executive branch in deciding       whether an inmate may be allowed to serve a portion of his or       her prison sentence in the community. Such decisions are in       the nature of parole and therefore we agree that they are       more appropriately made by the executive branch, which has       direct contact with the inmates and the most accurate and up-      to-date information about their conduct and condition.        We remain concerned, however, about the resources that the       federal probation system would be required to expend to       ensure the effective implementation of S. 3649. Specifically,       one of this bill's predecessors--H.R. 3356, the ``Prison       Reform and Redemption Act''--required the Director of the       Bureau of Prisons (``BOP'') to ``provide for the transfer of       such funds as may be necessary'' to the federal probation       system to ``supervise prisoners placed in home confinement or       community supervision.''        Unfortunately, this language is omitted from S. 3649 in       favor of a more general statement that agreements between BOP       and the federal probation system should ``take into account''       the resource requirements of the federal probation system       ``to the greatest extent practicable'' when moving prisoners       to prerelease custody or supervised release.        Our position has been that reimbursement authority is       preferable to transfer authority, and we are concerned that       the explicit deletion of the transfer provision found in H.R.       3356 could be read as communicating a lack of support for the       underlying concept that the probation and pretrial services       system must be provided with the resources necessary to       execute its new responsibilities. Further, Sections 101 and       104 of S. 3649 indicate that recidivism reduction activities       at the BOP (potentially including the costs of funding       agreements with the probation system under Section 102)       should be covered by the ``savings'' realized as a result of       the implementation of this title. This may be an insufficient       or unreliable source of funding because much of the       ``savings'' will be in the form of future cost avoidances       rather than current excess appropriations that could be       reinvested. Without the provision of such resources in future       appropriations acts and via other funding mechanisms, the       Judiciary will be unable to carry out the provisions of the       bill as intended without diverting resources from other       critical activities that are needed to ensure public safety       and the efficient administration of justice.        In addition to our concerns about resources that will be       needed, we also ask that you consider amending S. 3649 to       include the Judicial Conference's legislative proposal to       allow federal probation officers to conduct their official       duties more safely--which include conducting searches and       seizing contraband--by authorizing probation officers to       arrest anyone who assaults, impedes, or interferes with them       while carrying out official duties. This legislation already       has passed the House of Representatives this Congress, and       has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.                         Title IV: Sentencing Reform         For over sixty years, the Judicial Conference has       consistently and vigorously opposed mandatory minimum       sentencing provisions and has supported measures for their       repeal or to ameliorate their effects. Mandatory minimums do       not enhance the administration of justice, but have proven to       undermine it by wasting valuable taxpayer dollars, creating       tremendous injustice in sentencing, undermining guideline       sentencing, and ultimately fostering a lack of confidence in       the criminal justice system.        S. 3649 would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for       certain offenses, which the Judicial Conference supports.       Moreover, Section 402 would expand the existing safety valve,       which is consistent with the Conference's support for       ``legislation . . . that is designed to restore judges'       sentencing discretion and avoid the costs associated with       mandatory minimum sentences.'' The Conference continues to       pursue its overriding goal of persuading Congress to reduce       or repeal mandatory minimum sentences.        The Judicial Conference supports the amendment to 18 U.S.C.       924(c)(1)(C), contained in Section 403 of S. 3649, that would       clarify that the additional consecutive penalties apply only       to true repeat offenders, i.e., those with one or more       convictions that have become final prior to the commission of       such offense. Section 924(c)(1)(C) compounds the problems       created by mandatory minimums, however, by treating multiple       Section 924(c) counts in one indictment as triggers of the       statute's second-or-subsequent-conviction mandatory minimums.        Section 404 of S. 3649 would retroactively apply the ``Fair       Sentencing Act of 2010,'' which reduced the disparity between       sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses, to inmates       who had been sentenced prior to its August 3, 2010, enactment       date. This proposal is consistent with the Judicial       Conference's strategy to restore fairness to the sentences       for defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses. Noting       concern that the disparity between the sentences for powder       and crack cocaine offenses could have a corrosive effect on       public confidence in the courts, the Conference agreed to       oppose that disparity and supported its reduction.                   Title V: Miscellaneous Criminal Justice         We appreciate that Section 509 of S. 3649 would help to       ensure the supervision of released sexually dangerous       persons. In the interest of ensuring public safety, the       Judicial Conference supports giving probation officers clear       statutory authority to supervise these offenders, and we are       pleased to see it included in this legislation.        We are concerned with the potential impact of Section       503(b), which would amend 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A) to allow a       defendant to bring a motion on his or her own behalf for       modification of an imposed term of imprisonment, commonly       known as compassionate release. This amendment could result       in premature motions to federal courts, before administrative       appeals have been fully exhausted, thereby forcing federal       judges to decide these motions on an incomplete or       undeveloped record. Depending on how BOP implements this       provision, additional judicial resources could be required to       handle petitions for compassionate release filed by prisoners       when a warden fails to act on a prisoner's request for such       relief. It is also unclear whether the defendant would be       entitled to counsel for this process, including  [[Page H10401]]       court-appointed counsel. We may be in touch with further       observations or concerns after the Judicial Conference has       studied this issue in detail.        Relatedly, the Judicial Conference supports expanding       judges' authority to terminate supervised release for       compassionately released inmates. Ongoing supervision of       certain offenders, such as those in hospice care, may be       wasteful of public resources.                Relevant Positions of the Judicial Conference         The Judicial Conference believes that the Sentencing       Commission would benefit by having a federal defender       representative as a non-voting member. Prosecutors currently       are ably represented in the Commission's proceedings by the       ex officio non-voting member assigned to the Attorney General       or his designee.        Notably, although S. 3649 would implement sweeping       sentencing and prison reforms, it does not address the       pretrial system. Section 4285 of title 18, U.S. Code,       currently authorizes courts to order the United States       Marshals Service (``USMS'') to provide a released defendant       with non-custodial transportation and subsistence to the       court where that individual's appearance is required, when       the interests of justice would be served and the client is       financially unable to pay transportation costs. The Judicial       Conference supports giving courts the discretion, in the       interests of justice, to order the USMS to furnish, when       financially necessary, transportation and subsistence       (lodging and food) for defendants returning home from court       proceedings, and subsistence while attending such       proceedings, including for successive court appearances. This       provision would not be applicable for a defendant found by       the court to be financially able to cover these costs. Draft       statutory language for each of the aforementioned proposed       reforms was submitted to your office earlier this Congress       and is attached.        Section 3142(e) of title 18, U.S. Code, creates a       presumption that certain defendants should be detained       pending trial because a court cannot craft conditions of       supervision that would reasonably assure both the safety of       the community and the defendant's appearance at court       proceedings. The statute identifies several categories of       defendants to whom this presumption applies, including those       charged with specific drug trafficking offenses, and places       the burden on a defendant to rebut the presumption for       detention. In keeping with its support of evidence-based       supervision practices, the Administrative Office of the U.S.       Courts conducted a study analyzing data collected from a ten-      year period. The study reveals that a sizeable segment of       low-risk defendants fall into the category of drug       traffickers subject to the presumption of detention. The       study concluded that these defendants are detained at a high       rate, even when their criminal histories and other applicable       risk factors indicate that they pose a low risk of either       reoffending or absconding while on pretrial release, and       arguably should be released for pretrial supervision.        Legal, policy, and budgetary factors--including the       presumption of innocence and the relative costs of       incarceration versus pretrial supervision--support reducing       unnecessary pretrial detention. Therefore, at its September       2017 meeting, upon recommendation of the Criminal Law       Committee, the Judicial Conference endorsed limiting the       application of the presumption of detention to defendants       whose criminal history suggests that they pose a higher risk       of failing to appear or being a danger to the community if       released pending trial. This would enable judges to make       pretrial release decisions for low-risk defendants on a case-      by-case basis. No defendant would be automatically released       into the community if this proposal were enacted. We would be       glad to provide draft statutory language, as well as an       academic article analyzing the aforementioned study, for your       consideration.                                  Conclusion         Thank you for considering the federal Judiciary's views on       this important legislation. If we may be of further       assistance to you in this or any other matter, please do not       hesitate to contact us through the Office of Legislative       Affairs, Administrative Office of the U. S. Courts.            Sincerely,                                                     James C. Duff,                                                         Secretary.        Enclosure.                                   ____                                                  November 28, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Grassley       and Ranking Member Feinstein: We, the International Community       Corrections Association (ICCA) and National Criminal Justice       Association (NCJA), add our voices to the many urging passage       of the First Step Act before Congress adjourns for the year.       The First Step Act of 2018 (S. 3649) is bipartisan, common       sense legislation based on innovations adopted and tested in       the states over many years. The bill would require the       federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to adopt a risk and needs       assessment system to determine the recidivism risk of each       prisoner as part of the intake process and to provide       evidence-based recidivism reduction programming based on each       individual's criminogenic needs. Eligible inmates who       successfully complete the recidivism reduction programming       and/or other productive activities shall earn time credits       allowing them to complete their sentences in a residential       reentry center or in home confinement. Further, the bill       would require BOP to ensure there is sufficient prerelease       custody capacity to accommodate all who are eligible.        The First Step Act would also restore judicial discretion       for some non-violent offenses where federal mandatory minimum       sentences have been found to be too rigid, reduce the       enhanced mandatory minimum sentence for certain firearm       offenses, and apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010       retroactively.        ICCA members have been at the forefront of the evidence-      based practices movement for decades. ICCA members operate       residential reentry centers and have extensive experience       delivering community-based services to justice-involved       individuals. NCJA members are the state criminal justice       planning agencies who fund and oversee community-based       services and are responsible for planning across the justice       system. NCJA members are keenly aware that successful reentry       rests on the provision and quality of community-based       services. ICCA and NCJA look forward to working closely with       BOP on implementation of the bill.        The First Step Act is important legislation and we urge its       swift passage.            Sincerely,      Ellen Donnarumma.        President, International Community Corrections Association.      Christian Kervick,        President, National Criminal Justice Association.  [From the Center for American Progress, Dec. 19, 2018]                                   ____     Statement: The Center for American Progress Applauds the Senate for                         Passing the FIRST STEP Act                             (By Julia Cusick)         Washington, D.C.--Yesterday, the Senate passed the FIRST       STEP Act by an 87-12 bipartisan vote. The bill would reform       the federal criminal justice system by revising some       sentencing laws and letting judges consider sentences below       the mandatory minimum for more people. The legislation would       also establish a system of programs to provide incarcerated       people with skills and tools to succeed when they go back to       their communities after serving their sentence. Following the       passage of the bill, Ed Chung, vice president for Criminal       justice Reform at the Center for American Progress, provided       the following statement:        The Center for American Progress applauds the Senate for       passing the FIRST STEP Act with overwhelming bipartisan       support. The Senate's version of the legislation, while far       from perfect, includes crucial sentencing reforms that safely       reduce the footprint of the federal criminal justice system       from the front end. Additionally, the Senate added important       checks on the U.S. Department of Justice as it creates a risk       and needs assessment and a system of programs and education       in the Bureau of Prisons.        These changes, which were priorities of CAP when we       announced our support for the bill, would not have been       possible without the leadership of Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL),       Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Kamala Harris       (D-CA). These champions all resisted earlier calls to accept       a more moderated version of the bill that omitted sentencing       reforms and made sure the legislation was as progressive as       possible in the current political climate. We look forward to       the House quickly passing this version of the bill followed       by enactment of the legislation in the coming days.     Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2961  to save our children, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting to suggest  that anyone is telling an untruth when 24 hours ago this House  committed to passing a CR to stop the government from being shut down  and the United States Senate passed it without objection to keep the  government open. Here we are now, with the government on the verge of  closing because the President owns it, and we are talking about a bill  that creates $53 billion in deficit and does not help the middle class  and small businesses and has a pox on women as relates to choice.    What kind of crisis are my friends trying to build a few days before  we rise to take leadership as a majority in the 116th Congress? Maybe  we should have hearings, but maybe we should stop this bill altogether  and get back to keeping the government open and passing a continuing  resolution so that the working people in all of these agencies,  including Border Patrol agents and others, can do their job.   This is an insanity that keeps on growing. Mr. President, let's stop  doing this and keep the government open, and let's have hearings on  this tax bill to ensure that we do what is right for small businesses,  working families, and women of America.    Mr. Speaker, I know what it is like to be waiting on  disaster aid and not getting it. Among other things, this potential or  so-called disaster aid is missing dollars needed by the people of  Puerto Rico. I walked the streets and saw how desperate the need was.  It doesn't even include the $600 million in assistance for Puerto Rico  to deal with food nutrition.   I remember, in the time of Hurricane Harvey, we begged for an  extension for the food nutrition program called Disaster Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, and in 3 days, we served 30,000 people.  You have to feel the pain to understand.   Really, Mr. Speaker, this is a sham and a shame, because Republicans  are in the United States Senate--let the American people understand  that--and they fostered this compromise. They came together. They have  sent it to the President. They spoke to the President. The President  agreed that we would do it in this manner and that we would look at  this issue on the other side of 2019.   What happened here? A callous disregard of Border Patrol agents;  callous disregard of Customs and Border Protection; callous disregard  of the National Guard and the military who are down at the border, who  are out there every day; and a callous disregard of Jakelin, the 7- year-old who died because we don't have adequate health facilities,  medical care, medevac, and the kind of decent living conditions--yes,  decent--that are warranted.   We are shutting down Commerce and Justice. We don't have enough  judges at the border. We don't have enough judges to deal with the  asylum cases.   So if these folks want border security, it is not just a wall. It is  technology. It is the agents. It is understanding that human beings are  coming across the border. It is medical care. It is, as well, the  security that we need.   So I am here to say, Mr. Speaker, as I close, what a sham and a  shame. Let's get the Senate bill and put it on the floor.   Yesterday, I introduced H.R. 7332 that says no American tax dollars  will be paid for the wall. Mexico will pay for it. Border security will  be based upon technology, personnel, and barriers.   Let's pass that bill and pass the CR from the Senate.    Mr. Speaker, during this holiday season, I am  baffled as to why and how we have gotten here to this place.   In the last 24 hours, a tweet went out from the White House that  would end the Syrian war, to the opposition of the national security  team--General Mattis, the Secretary of State, the National Security  Advisor, and others who thought that a tweet ending the war was never  heard of in the history of the United States.   In the course of these 24 hours, we are in the midst of a political  collapse, a catastrophic collapse, and a shutting down of the  government. Included in the shutting down of the government will be the  funding for the State Department and Homeland Security.   It is clear that we are at a constitutional crisis, one that requires  the attentiveness of this body, and to recognize the leaving and  retiring of General Mattis, who has indicated: Maybe you can have a  Secretary of Defense that fits your thinking.   What thinking?   And then to hear from North Korea: Maybe you can remove the troops  off of our borders.   This is a time for us to speak up, to protect the American people,  and not a time to shut the government down.   I hope the President is listening.                            ____________________
