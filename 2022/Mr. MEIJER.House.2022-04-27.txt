 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7372,  the Protecting Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians  Act.   This bill, which I helped introduce with Representative Titus, is an  incredibly timely bill and focuses on two of the most pressing issues  today: the war in Ukraine and our semiconductor supply chain shortages.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen unprecedented challenges to our  supply chain. The current war in Ukraine has exacerbated each and every  one of these challenges, threatening our supply of critical minerals,  including the supply for semiconductors.                                time  1315    From cell phones and cars to medical devices, we all know the  integral role that semiconductors play in our everyday lives. My home  State of Michigan knows all too well the challenges that the  semiconductor shortage have created for our economy. A threat to our  supply chains is a matter of both economic and national security, and  we need a robust and coordinated response to any threats to our  semiconductor supply chain. This bill offers just that.   By establishing a working group focused specifically on the threats  to our semiconductor supply chain as a result of Putin's illegal war of  aggression in Ukraine, we can ensure that all available resources and  expertise are being used to examine how our critical mineral supply is  affected by the ongoing war. This legislation also examines how we can  bolster our supply of critical minerals, as well as how we in Congress  can offer legislative solutions to help support and strengthen our  supply chains.   We know now that our global supply chain is at a critical juncture,  and if it can be disrupted for semiconductors, the threats will be  endless to our economic and national security. This legislation allows  us to take meaningful steps to identify how the ongoing war threatens  the chain and what we can do to shore up our supply domestically.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) for leading  this effort, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.  [[Page H4529]]         Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Asset  Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, which I was proud to help  introduce with my colleague, Congressman Malinowski.   This bill sends a strong and clear message of support to the  Ukrainian people and a clear message to Putin and his cronies that  their ill-gotten assets are no longer welcome in the United States.   The Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act encourages the  administration to take necessary steps allowed by the Constitution and  existing laws to seize Russian assets valued over $2 million and  repurpose them towards post-conflict reconstruction and humanitarian  assistance in Ukraine.   It also includes my amendment that aims to expand sanctions on  members of Russia's Parliament who took the reckless and illegal vote  to recognize two breakaway states in the Donbas and authorize Putin to  use military force in Ukraine.   Although the Biden administration sanctioned 328 duma members who  voted on February 15 for a resolution calling on Putin to recognize the  Ukrainian breakaway states, the so-called Luhansk People's Republic and  Donetsk People's Republic, it has still not imposed similar sanctions  on the remaining duma members and the 154 members of the Federation  Council who voted just one week later to authorize Putin's senseless  war in Ukraine.   These Russian politicians, as well as the oligarchs who so  comfortably store their assets on U.S. territory, play a role in  Putin's illegal war, and they all deserve to be punished. Our bill  ensures that they do not escape accountability for their complicity in  the atrocities against Ukraine, which has left thousands of civilians  dead, and many millions displaced.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this critical and urgent bill.
