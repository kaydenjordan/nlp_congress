 Mr. Speaker, in a time when so many Americans are looking  for ideas and policies we can unite around, one point of agreement  stands out. There is strong consensus among Americans that they do not  want their taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions. A Marist poll  released in January revealed that 61 percent of Americans feel this  way.   States have always had the freedom to direct funds away from abortion  providers, such as the Nation's largest abortion provider, Planned  Parenthood, and there are many reasons States may wish to do so. The  most important reason, one that we should all carefully consider, is  that abortion is not health care. Abortion takes the lives of unborn  children and hurts women. Many States have recognized this tragic  reality and, as a result, have chosen to award funds to health clinics  and organizations that do not provide abortions.   But in December, the Obama administration issued a regulation that  forces many States to drastically alter their previous course of  action. The regulation requires States to include abortion providers as  recipients of title X grant distributions. Not only does this  regulation ignore the American people's wish that their tax dollars be  directed away from abortion providers, it also denies States the  flexibility to choose to allocate title X funds in a way that meets the  needs of their citizens.   H.J. Res. 43 disapproves of this unacceptable regulation, allowing  States to return to the status quo under which they were operating  prior to the rule's issuance. If States wish to disburse title X funds  away from abortion providers, that wish should be respected. For these  reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and H.J.  Res. 43.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 116, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 66) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by  States for non-governmental employees, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 116, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 66         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Labor       relating to ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for       Non-Governmental Employees'' (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 59464       (August 30, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or       effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) each will control  30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 66.   The Obama administration spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars  emphasizing the need to protect retirement savers, but as was often the  case with the previous administration, their rhetoric rarely matched  their actions.   For example, the Obama Department of Labor spent years advancing a  flawed rule that will limit access to affordable retirement advice for  low- and middle-income families. Despite repeated calls for a more  responsible approach, the Department pushed forward with an extreme,  partisan rule. Then, late last year, the Department finalized two  additional rules that will also negatively impact the retirement  security of workers. The administration crafted a regulatory loophole  that allows States to establish government-run IRAs by circumventing  protections workers and employers have enjoyed for decades.   As was usually the case, the actions of the previous administration  hurt the very people it claimed to be helping. First, this loophole  would lead to fewer protections for retirement savers. Working families  will have less information about how their retirement plans are  managed, and they will have fewer options if those plans are not  managed well. They will also have less control over the money they  worked so hard to put away.   We need to honor hardworking taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, who save for  their retirement and not have the Federal Government do things to harm  them.   The loophole also threatens to inflict significant harm on small  business employees. It is already hard enough for many small businesses  to provide their employees with retirement options, and this regulation  only makes it less likely they will do so. In fact, many small  businesses could actually be discouraged from offering 401(k)s or other  private sector options. Others could cancel their retirement plans and  dump their employees into government-run retirement plans.   Finally, the Obama administration's regulatory action puts taxpayers  at risk. We already know that many government-run pension plans for  public employees are woefully underfunded. Let me repeat that, Mr.  Speaker. We already know that many government-run pension plans for  public employees are woefully underfunded. If government-run IRAs for  private sector workers are mismanaged, does anyone seriously believe  hardworking taxpayers won't be asked to foot the bill?   These may be unintended consequences, but they will be detrimental to  workers, retirees, and small business all the same. Too many  hardworking men and women struggle to plan for the future and retire  with financial security and peace of mind. The resolution under  consideration today will close a loophole that threatens that security  and peace of mind.   To be clear, these resolutions will not prevent States and cities  from providing workers and retirees with new, innovative retirement  options. These resolutions will simply ensure that all workers and  retirees enjoy the same protections that have been guaranteed for  decades.   I want to thank Representatives Walberg and Rooney for leading this  effort and working to protect the retirement security of hardworking  men and women across the country. I urge my colleagues to support both  resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) be permitted to control the balance of my  time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.                                General Leave
