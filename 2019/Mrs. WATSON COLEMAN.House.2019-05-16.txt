 Mr. Speaker, Democrats continue to fight for  access to healthcare in our work to deliver progress for the people  because it is essential to daily life. You cannot work, you cannot care  for your children, you cannot do anything without your health.  [[Page H3912]]    I was recently blessed to come through a health challenge myself, and  I believe more strongly than ever that, whether it is cancer therapy or  prescription medication, access to the best treatment cannot be  reserved for only the wealthy.   Last week, I secured funding in the Appropriations Committee to study  the impact of prior authorization policies on patient health. People  are dying because insurance companies want to see lower cost  treatments, see them fail before they will cover more expensive ones,  even if your healthcare provider specifically recommends it.   Whether you have cancer like I did or you are dealing with a chronic  illness, you shouldn't have to endure extra pain or wonder if you can  survive long enough to get to the treatment that will work for you.   I will continue to fight for access to high-quality healthcare for  all Americans.                            ____________________
