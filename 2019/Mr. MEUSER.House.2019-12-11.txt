 Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from my constituents in  Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District about the skyrocketing  costs of prescription drugs. Families should not have to dedicate such  a high percentage of their disposable income on prescription drugs, and  families should certainly not be forced to choose between buying  medication or putting food on their table.   Over 70 percent of Americans think that lowering prescription drugs  prices should be a top priority for Congress. Delivering for the  American people will require a bipartisan approach with proposals that  can actually pass the House and the Senate and be signed into law.   Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi's prescription drug pricing proposal,  H.R. 3, was crafted without any Republican input and will be dead on  arrival in the Senate.   A key component of H.R. 3 involves the Federal Government mandating  pricing for prescription drugs. While supporters of H.R. 3 describe  this as ``voluntary negotiation,'' manufacturers who decline to  participate in the process are taxed up to 95 percent of the medicine's  gross sales. That is 95 percent of the gross sales price.    This is not a negotiation. This is a heavyhanded government at its  worst. It is ridiculous. It is take this price or else. It is,  figuratively and literally, a poison pill provision to this bill.   Government, command central price setting is not only un-American, it  is ineffective. When we look at countries with heavyhanded approaches  to price controls, we find they have significantly less access to  lifesaving medications and treatments.   Of the 270 new medicines available in the United States, only 41  percent are available in Australia; 52 percent in Canada; 53 percent in  France; 67 percent in Germany; 48 percent in Japan; 64 percent in the  United Kingdom.   Imagine, in our country, a lifesaving drug being available in another  country but not available here. We can't imagine that.   Fortunately, House Republicans have found a solution to lowering  prescription drug prices without sacrificing American innovation or  harming access to lifesaving medications.   H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, is a package of over 40  bipartisan provisions to lower out-of-pocket spending, strengthen  transparency, and spur competition.   H.R. 19 protects seniors by placing an annual cap on out-of-pocket  drug costs and establishing a ``smoothing'' mechanism to allow them to  distribute their prescription drug spending throughout the year. Rather  than heavyhanded government overreach, H.R. 19 stimulates free market  forces to spur innovation and lower costs by streamlining FDA approval  pipelines, increasing availability of over-the-counter products, and  prohibiting anticompetitive practices that prevent access to generics.   H.R. 19 makes insulin more affordable--so important--by capping the  costs at $50 a month after a Medicare beneficiary has met their  deductible. Under H.R. 19, doctors would know what a patient will have  to pay for a drug, allowing them to prescribe medication that addresses  the patient's needs and fits their budget.   Again, every single provision in H.R. 19 is bipartisan and could  actually become law. President Trump has made it abundantly clear that  lowering prescription drug prices is a top priority,  [[Page H10028]]  and H.R. 19 achieves this goal without harming innovation or access.   I am a cosponsor to this vitally important legislation, and I do urge  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with the House  Republicans on delivering lower drug costs for the American people.                            ____________________
