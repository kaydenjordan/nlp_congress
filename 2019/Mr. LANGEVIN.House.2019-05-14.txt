 Mr. Speaker, I rise during National Infrastructure Week  to highlight the importance of investing in a skilled infrastructure  workforce.   Rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure will require more than  investments in bridges, roads, and waterways. It will require a  workforce that can design, build, and maintain them.   The Brookings Institution estimates that 3 million more workers will  be needed to support our infrastructure over the next decade.   This is a great opportunity for millions of Americans who are out of  work or underemployed. However, without adequate training, these  workers won't be prepared to fill open jobs and carry out high-priority  infrastructure projects.   That is why my Career and Technical Education Caucus co-chair,  Congressman G.T. Thompson, and I are urging congressional leadership to  prioritize workforce development in any infrastructure investment  package that comes to this House.   CTE and apprenticeships are absolutely proven strategies that provide  workers with the skills and training that they need for in-demand jobs,  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance them in the  coming months.                            ____________________
