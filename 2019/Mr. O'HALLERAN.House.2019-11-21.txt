 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National  Rural Health Day.   To mark this important day, my colleagues and I will discuss the  unique challenges that rural America faces when seeking quality  healthcare close to home or as close to home as rural America has it.   I am proud to represent Arizona's First Congressional District in the  House of Representatives. Our district is actually larger than the  entire State of Illinois, and it is one of the most rural in the  country.   This year, I have held 26 town halls across this vast and diverse  district. At each and every one I hear from rural residents struggling  to access quality healthcare, especially emergency care. Many of my  constituents must spend hours traveling hundreds of miles to access any  kind of care, let alone specialist care or maternity care.   Since I was elected, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to identify legislative solutions to the issues our rural  residents are facing. This year I introduced the CHIME Act, legislation  to extend the Community Health Center Fund and the National Health  Service Corps for 5 years and increase funding for priority areas.   Community health centers are critical to serve hundreds of thousands  of patients every year just in Arizona. In my district, and many rural  areas, community health centers are often the primary care facility for  a large portion of the population. If funding for community health  centers in Arizona were to lapse, just in my district, tens of  thousands of rural residents would be left without access to critical  care.   My language to extend this funding was included in this week's  continuing resolution, but it is at risk of expiring if we cannot come  together to fund the government. We need a long-term solution. I will  continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass  this bill into law permanently, so our communities have the support and  certainty they need.   Additionally this year, I introduced the GME, graduate medical  education amendment, to the Lower Drug Costs  [[Page H9158]]  Now Act. My amendment would instruct the Department of Health and Human  Services to establish a grant program for hospitals in rural and  medically underserved areas. We must act now to ensure that rural  communities have the resources they need.   According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, our  country will suffer a shortage of over 120,000 physicians by 2032.  Rural areas will be hit especially hard. We must do what we can now to  prevent this from happening and to mitigate the effects. My amendment  would help incentivize doctors to stay and practice in our rural  communities. We know very well that, when a resident comes to a rural  community or any other community, there is a higher percentage that  want to stay in that community after their residency.   This May, after years of work with stakeholders, community leaders,  and veterans' advocates, I was able to secure Federal funding for the  construction of veterans nursing homes in Flagstaff, in my district,  and Yuma in western Arizona. We found out during that time that you  can't build a facility like that on Tribal lands, so we have a bill  that is trying to change that so the many Tribal nations in our country  and nations like the Navajo Nation that are as big as West Virginia can  have a nursing center close to the many veterans that they have.   For too long these rural construction projects were unfairly  penalized by an outdated VA funding formula that left too many families  without the help that they deserve.                                time  1315    We must continue to expand access to healthcare for rural Americans,  but I know these are merely first steps. There is much work to be done  and many hurdles that must be crossed before we ensure that our  veterans, seniors, and families across rural America have access to  quality healthcare that is close to home.   Just quickly, rural America is probably tied closer to urban America  than many people know. But the families who we need there--who supply  the food, the water, the energy, everything that makes urban America  survive--won't be there if we don't have people who want to and are  able to live there.   That means we have to have good schools, good healthcare, and good  job opportunities.   We want our children to move back to rural America, and we will not  have that if we do not address the appropriate concerns.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Brindisi),  my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van  Drew).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa),  my colleague.    Madam Speaker, California is, too.    Madam Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for  joining me to participate in this important show of support by the Blue  Dog caucus for rural healthcare and access across America today.   A couple of quick examples: First of all, when you are traveling  across the country from urban America through rural America, this  hospital issue, this medical issue, is your issue because the hospitals  that we have are the hospitals you are going to be taken to. The  ambulances that have to take an hour or 2 hours to get to the site  where you are at are the ambulances that you are going to be taking,  too.   People on dialysis in rural America, whether it is a Tribal community  or another community in rural America, some of them have to drive 2  hours one way to get their treatment and then 2 hours back home.  Sometimes they do 3 days a week, sometimes up to 4 days a week, sick  people traveling hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles to get  this type of treatment so they can live.   Cancer is the same way. Cancer patients have to find a way to get  that treatment. It is very scarce in rural America.   Rural communities make up the very fabric of America. Their success  is our Nation's success.   I am committed to fighting to improve access to healthcare for rural,  Tribal, and other underserved communities, for hardworking families and  veterans who often travel hundreds of miles for basic care.   As I stated before, my district is rural for the most part, and we  have 60,000 veterans within the district.   For rural healthcare to be totally successful, we must improve  broadband and expand it so that telemedicine is meaningful for the  people who live in rural areas across America.   Improving access to care is not a partisan issue. We must come  together across the aisle and continue to work to identify legislative  solutions to the barriers our rural residents face.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
