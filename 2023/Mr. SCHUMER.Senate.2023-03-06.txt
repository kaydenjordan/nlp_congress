 Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 61.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, March 6, be waived.    Madam President, so, this Thursday, President Biden will  release the third budget proposal of his Presidency, one of the most  important chances all year to emphasize the contrast between Democrats'  and Republicans' vision for the country.   When Americans see President Biden's budget proposal and compare it  to the nasty plans coming from Republicans, the contrast will be  glaring and unmistakable.   First, President Biden's budget will focus on creating opportunity  for average Americans. He will keep his promise not to raise taxes for  anyone making less than $400,000 a year. He will show how Democrats  will keep Medicare solvent for another two decades. And he will lay out  a plan--a realistic, serious plan--for lowering the deficit by $2  trillion over the next 10 years.   Republicans love to talk about cutting the deficit, but Democrats  have actually done it. The Inflation Reduction Act lowered the deficit  by hundreds of billions of dollars, and we cut the deficit while also  cutting prescription drug costs and expanding tax credits for millions  of middle-class families.   Now, compare President Biden's budget to the nasty vision laid out by  our Republican friends. While the President's budget will keep taxes  and costs low for the vast majority of families, Republicans went on  record wanting to raise taxes by 30 percent for millions of Americans  through their recent national sales tax proposal.   While the President promised no new taxes for people making under  $400,000, the very first bill House Republicans passed helped rich tax  cheats get away with paying little or nothing in taxes. And while  President Biden and Democrats have been clear that Social Security and  Medicare are not on the table, Republicans have proposed raising the  retirement age and privatizing certain elements of Medicare. The  result: fewer benefits for retirees, higher premiums for Medicare  beneficiaries.   We cannot overlook the threat Republicans also pose to Medicaid,  which tens of millions of middle-class Americans rely on to ease the  burden of paying for nursing homes and assisted living. Democrats want  to preserve and strengthen Medicaid, but Republican proposals would cut  Medicaid by $2.2 trillion and end coverage for millions of Americans.  That average middle-class family--let's say they are 40, 50 years old,  and they are worried about paying for the kids' college, but they also  have a parent in a nursing home. Right now, Medicaid would pay for it  if the parent doesn't have the resources. With these cuts, that burden  will fall on tens of millions of American families in the prime of  life.   Finally, the President will make clear that in order to strengthen  Social Security and Medicare and to lower the deficit responsibly, the  ultrarich must pay their fair share. There is no--no--conceivable  scenario where wealthy CEOs should ever pay a lower rate than nurses  and teachers and firefighters, but that is precisely how Republicans  preferred it when they cut taxes for the ultrarich under Donald Trump.   It is as if Republicans care more about making sure the rich stay  rich than they do about building ladders to the middle class, than they  do about keeping middle-class people in that position.   Now, when President Biden called out Republicans for targeting Social  Security and Medicare, they erupted with feigned outrage during his  State of the Union. But, to this day, Speaker McCarthy and House  Republican leadership have failed to present their own plan to the  American people.   Speaker McCarthy, it is now March 6. Where is your plan? Speaker  McCarthy, where is your plan? The President is about to release his  budget. Are you going to release yours anytime soon? Enough with the  dodging. Enough with the excuses. Show us your plan, and then show us  how it is going to get 218 votes on your side of the aisle.   Americans deserve to see for themselves what Democrats and  Republicans propose for the future of the country. Republicans should  come clean with the American people about what cuts they are pushing  and explain how those cuts will cause unnecessary pain for millions of  Americans across the country.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I understand there is a bill at the desk due for a  second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.,  Tuesday, March 7; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Ballou nomination postcloture; further, that all  postcloture time on the Ballou nomination be considered expired at  11:30 a.m. and that the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination;  that the Senate recess following the cloture vote on the Schopler  nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings;  further, that if cloture has been invoked, at 2:15 p.m., the Senate  vote on confirmation of the Schopler nomination, and if cloture has  been invoked on the Subramanian nomination, the confirmation vote be at  4:30 p.m.; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during  Tuesday's session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's actions.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:43 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 7, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
