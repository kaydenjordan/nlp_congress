 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want  to thank the ranking member for her leadership and always trying to be  responsible. I thank Mr. Visclosky and the Appropriations Committee for  their work.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this agreement between the two  parties and between the administration and the Congress. I am hopeful  that it will pass overwhelmingly.   I have a little statement here, which I will submit. But because we  want to get this business done, briefly I want to say to the  Appropriations Committee: Congratulations for doing your work. I know  there was controversy and everybody didn't support it, but we passed 10  of the appropriations bills almost 2 months ago, clearly sufficient  time to have reached agreement and passed the appropriation bills, not  a CR. A CR is a recognition of failure, failure to get our work done in  a timely fashion, and I regret that.   I take some credit for passing 10 bills last year in June and 10  bills this year in July. I pushed the Appropriations Committee pretty  hard. The staff worked hard; Members worked hard; and we got our bills  done.   The Senate has not marked up a single bill in committee. There is no  bill out of committee, and there are no bills on the floor, which means  the Senate has essentially abandoned the appropriations process. Madam  Speaker, that is not the way that the Congress of the United States  ought to work.   I am for this. It was tough to get to. We have an agreement, and I am  hopeful that everybody here will vote for it so we do not shut down the  House of Representatives--excuse me--the Government of the United  States, not just the House of Representatives.   That is, in my view, an unacceptable alternative ever, and we reached  an agreement today. There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. A lot of  people wanted this, a lot of people wanted that, a lot of people didn't  want this, and a lot of people didn't want that. But we have an  agreement that will keep the government functioning for the people from  now until December 11.   What, Madam Speaker, I would urge is every one of us would from now  until hopefully before December 11--that is a Friday, we are scheduled  to break for Christmas and the holidays--I am hopeful that everyone  will put their heads together to get the appropriations process done.  We will probably do it in an omnibus, not single appropriations bills,  which is not a good way to do it either.  [[Page H4702]]    When I joined the Appropriations Committee--and Mr. Visclosky's  Congressman that he worked for was on the committee with me--we passed  one bill at a time.                                time  1915    The Senate passed one bill at the time, and we came to conference and  sat down together, the members of the Defense Subcommittee, the members  of the Treasury-Postal Subcommittee, and the Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. We came  together individually, and we worked out agreements between the two  bodies.   That is the way it ought to work. It is not working that way. In a  world of alternatives, this is the best we have, so we need to take it  and keep the government funded.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with members of the  Committee on Appropriations on both sides of the aisle to effect an  omnibus that we can all be proud of. We won't all agree with all of it,  but at least we can say, ``This is the work product of the people's  House and the United States Senate,'' and pass it and feel that we have  done our job for the people.   Madam Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is a result of the kind of  cooperation that the American people expect from all of us.   It is also an example for how we ought to spend the coming days:  Working toward an agreement on the HEROES Act to mitigate the continued  economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.   However, a Continuing Resolution is not how Congress should operate.   The House did its job, passing nearly all of the appropriation bills  before the end of July.   The Republican-controlled Senate, however, failed to do its job.   It has not only failed to pass a single appropriation bill--it hasn't  even introduced one.   Senate Republicans have had months to do their part to prevent a  shutdown, yet here we are just eight days before the end of the fiscal  year.   So, the House today will continue to do its job and govern  responsibly by voting on this clean Continuing Resolution, which would  keep the government open through December 11 at current funding levels.   I say this C.R. us ``clean'' not because it is free from anything  other a date change, but because is reflects a bipartisan agreement  between on the issues it contains.   This C.R. includes funding for highway and transit programs and the  National Flood Insurance Program for another year.   It includes funding to protect seniors from rising Medicare premiums  and to keep other vital health care priorities funded, such as  community health centers.   It also includes funding for children who rely on school lunch  programs to continue accessing nutritious meals.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in passing  this Continuing Resolution and showing the American people that we will  not let their government go dark in the middle of a deadly pandemic and  economic crisis.   I urge the Senate to pass this Continuing Resolution and get to work  without delay on full-year appropriation bills.   The House is doing its job.   It's time for the Republican Senate to start doing its job as well.
