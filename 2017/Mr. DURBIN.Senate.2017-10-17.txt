The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the  Republican tax reform plan and what impact it will have on the fiscal  health of our Nation but especially the impact it will have on working  families across the United States and in my home State of Illinois.   I have represented Illinois in Congress both as a House Member and as  a Senator for a number of years. I am proud to say that during my  career, I have not shied away from tackling big issues.  [[Page S6428]]    Maybe one of the toughest assignments I have ever had was in 2010,  when President Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal  Responsibility and Reform. It was known as the Simpson-Bowles  Commission. I was one of 18 Republicans and Democrats given the  responsibility of trying to find a way to balance America's budget and  reform our country's largest spending programs and our Tax Code.   This was no small task, but it was an important one. We spent month  after month in bipartisan meetings working at it. Nearly a year after  the Commission was created, we were asked to vote on the final report.   Simpson-Bowles was not a perfect plan, but I decided to vote in favor  of the report, and I knew it would be controversial, but I believed  then, as I do now, that there is only one honest way to reduce debt:  cut spending, raise revenues, do not ignore the Tax Code. Bowles- Simpson did just that. It raised revenue by eliminating a lot of the  exclusions and deductions and efforts of the Tax Code to reward certain  companies and special interests, and it cut spending for both defense  and nondefense. To say nothing of the months-long bipartisan process--a  far cry from the current reconciliation that we have been going through  this year on the healthcare issue--there simply is no comparison  between the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan and what the  Republicans want to bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate and House  this year in the name of tax reform.   Simpson-Bowles was about balancing our budget responsibly. It raised  nearly $88 billion in revenue over the first decade, and unlike the  Republican tax plan, it boosted the standard deduction and still  retained the personal exemptions families claim on their taxes. It  protected middle-income families from backdoor cuts, and--and I  underline this--it ensured that the wealthy in America paid their fair  share of taxes.   If there is one thing I can never understand, it is why the  Republicans, in the name of budget deficits or in the name of tax  reform, always end up in the same place--always cutting taxes on the  wealthiest people in America. Where in the world is that coming from? I  have met a lot of wealthy people in the course of my life; not one of  them, with a straight face, has said to me: Senator, I desperately need  a tax cut. They don't. Yet that is the fallback default position on  every Republican plan.   Importantly, the Simpson-Bowles plan provided details of the hard  choices necessary to reach our goal. There is simply no comparison  between that comprehensive, bipartisan plan to balance the budget and  the highly fiscally irresponsible Republican tax reform plan before us  now that will literally add $2.4 trillion to the national debt.   How many times have Members on the Republican side of the aisle come  to the floor to pose for holy pictures and to preach to us about the  deficit? Now that they are in the majority and they have a President of  their party, what is the first thing they do? They propose adding $2.4  trillion to the national debt.   Where are my colleagues across the aisle who have been the first to  speak out and admonish the Democrats about their failure to recognize  the Federal debt? Where is my colleague the majority leader of the  Senate who was so quick to rail on the ``alarming level'' of our  national debt during the Obama years? He is silent now.   Even the most stalwart of self-proclaimed fiscal hawks on the right  are falling in line behind this phony plan, which would allow for $1.5  trillion in unpaid-for tax cuts--clinging on to economic growth  projections no responsible economist would dream of using. They used to  call this economic theory of cutting taxes on the rich and economic  growth the Laffer curve. I have never heard a better named description  of an economic theory. It is a laugher. And this Laffer curve inspired  the Governor of Kansas to bring that State to near fiscal ruin, trying  to apply that great theory and watching his State crumble in the  process.   History has proven that tax cuts simply do not yield economic growth.  The economic growth promises of the Bush tax cuts turned out to be  completely false. Those tax cuts for the wealthy ballooned our deficits  and our debt and contributed to a scandalous rise in income inequality  in the United States of America.   Tax cuts don't pay for themselves, and I know my Republican  colleagues know that.   When Republicans' rosy estimates of economic growth do, in fact, fail  and the deficit is sky-rocketing, the Republican budget spells out  exactly how they plan to pay for the tax cuts on the backs of hard- working Americans. Listen to this. To pay for the tax cuts for the  wealthiest people in America, the Republican tax reform plan--now, get  this--uses $1 trillion in cuts from Medicaid and more than $470 billion  in cuts from Medicare.   Think about it. Health insurance for the elderly in America will take  a $470 billion cut under the Republican tax reform plan--for what? To  give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country--go figure--and  then $1 trillion in cuts in Medicaid.   What is Medicaid for? Isn't it just health insurance for the poor?  Well, in some respects, that is a good general description, but it is  so much more. The Medicaid Program, which the Republicans return to  time and time again to cut, is critically important for parts of  America. Half of the children born in the State of Illinois are taken  care of by Medicaid. Their mothers are taken care of before the baby is  delivered and after. Plus, it is the No. 1 source of health insurance  for the disabled across America. They want to cut $1 trillion out of  it. I haven't even gotten close to the most expensive part of Medicaid.  Two-thirds of seniors in America in nursing homes count on Medicaid to  pay for their medical bills.   The Republicans want to cut $1 trillion out of Medicaid to give tax  cuts to the wealthiest people in America. What is going to happen to  those folks in nursing homes? What is going to happen to the disabled  who count on Medicaid? What is going to happen to those mothers and  their babies? That is a legitimate question to ask.   Make no mistake, the real answer for who pays for these cuts doesn't  involve fake economics; it involves real families across America.   Let's look at the plan for what it is. While claiming to fix our  broken Tax Code, this Republican tax reform plan would instead provide  nothing short of a windfall for the wealthiest in our country and stick  hard-working families in Illinois and across the country with the bill.   Under the Republican plan, no less than 80 percent of the benefits go  to the top 1 percent of wealthiest Americans. Eighty percent of the  benefits go to the wealthiest people in this country. That is more than  three-quarters of all tax breaks going to people who make more than  $730,000 a year. Is that why Members of the Senate were elected--to  take care of people making more than $730,000 a year? Not in my State.   What about the middle-income Americans this plan is supposed to help?  The Republican plan would raise taxes on nearly one-third of Americans  who make between $50,000 and $150,000 a year. One-third of them will  pay higher taxes. That is not tax relief for working families. In fact,  the Republican plan would eliminate the State and local tax deduction-- a deduction used by one-third of all taxpayers to reduce their tax  bill. That has been part of our Tax Code from the beginning, and here  is the theory: We believe, in the current Federal Tax Code, you  shouldn't pay a tax on a tax. It is basic. If you are paying $1,000 in  property taxes where you live right now, should you be taxed on that  $1,000? Under the current Tax Code, no. You are able to deduct State  and local taxes. The Republicans eliminate that deduction. If they have  their way, families with homes, families who pay sales taxes will pay a  Federal tax on the State and local taxes they pay. This deduction  currently allows families who pay State and local income or sales taxes  to deduct those taxes from their Federal income tax. In other words,  this deduction prevents families from double taxation--once by the  Federal Government and again by the State. Yet the Republicans  eliminate this deduction.   In Illinois, we rank fifth in the Nation for people who are helped by  the State and local tax deduction. The taxpayers I represent will be  hit especially hard. Nearly 2 million Illinoisans--roughly a third of  the taxpayers of my State--claimed more than $24 billion in  [[Page S6429]]  State and local tax deductions in 2015. If Republicans have their way,  almost 2 million people in Illinois would be double-taxed on an average  $12,500 of earnings. That is just plain wrong.   Republicans would have you believe that State and local tax deduction  only helps the wealthy, but most people who take this deduction make  less than $200,000 a year.   Even families who do not claim the State and local deduction will see  their taxes increase under the Republicans' so-called tax reform plan.  The Republican plan eliminates the personal exemption worth $4,050 a  person. A family of four making $50,000 a year in my State will pay  $887 more under this part of the Republican tax reform plan. Getting  hit by losing the State and local tax deduction and then turning around  and losing a personal exemption, a family of four in Illinois making  $50,000 will pay $887 more a year, just on that provision, in Federal  taxes.   What are the Republicans raising taxes on my middle class for? They  are raising taxes on middle-income families to provide massive tax cuts  for corporations to the tune of $2.6 trillion over the first 10 years,  and--Mr. and Mrs. America, sleep well tonight--we are going to take  care of that with economic growth. Here is the reality: Corporate  profits are soaring in America. Today, corporate profits in the United  States of America as a share of gross domestic product are at record  highs; corporate taxes paid to the Federal Government as a share of  GDP, record lows. What is the Republican approach to those two facts?  To cut more corporate taxes.   Wouldn't it be good to have someone come to the floor and say:  Instead of just looking at corporate taxes, why don't we look at  corporate employees? How are they doing? We know how they are doing.  They are falling behind. They are more productive than ever. The  corporations are more profitable than ever. Yet the disparity in income  in America gets worse. We have the best workers in the world--no  apologies. They do great work. They don't get paid enough. The answer  on the Republican side is to give the corporations more tax breaks. I  say the answer should be something else.   Why don't we address the fact that CEOs in America make 271 times the  average wage of their employees? Two hundred seventy-one? Come on. If  they are going to head up these corporations, of course they are  entitled to be paid more--their profitability, their entrepreneurial  spirit, their talent, and all the rest--but 271 times? American workers  are still waiting for their pay raise, and they won't get it with this  Republican tax reform plan.   While American workers and their families continue to wait for their  turn, the Republicans seemed determined to provide tax cuts to  corporations and the wealthy rather than make the Tax Code work for  working families. This has to stop. It is time we look at tax reform  and economic growth in terms of the family room, not the boardroom.   The very successful Warren Buffett said:         My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a       billionaire-friendly Congress. It's time for our government       to get serious about shared sacrifice.    Thank you, Warren Buffett. I agree.   If Republicans want to get serious about fixing the faulty incentives  in our Tax Code and provide working families some relief, it is time  they stop clinging to the Laffer curve and this failed trickle-down  policy that giving a tax break to the wealthiest person in America can  only help the poorest person in America.   I know these are difficult and complex issues. It is no secret in  Washington how difficult tax reform can be. But these are issues that  deserve robust, bipartisan debate. Now is not the time to abandon any  semblance of fiscal responsibility and rush through this deficit- exploding plan that has no prayer of paying for itself with growth.   I hope my Republican colleagues will look beyond the boardroom and  seize this opportunity to reward and incentivize businesses to make  real investments in the United States and its workers. Look at this Tax  Code. If you own a big business in my State of Illinois and want to  move your business out of Illinois--to Mexico or China or you name it-- we are going to give you a helping hand. Our Tax Code says that the  cost of the moving expenses are deductible. You don't have to pay taxes  on those; we are going to give you a break to move your business. What  are we thinking?   For goodness' sake, why don't we have what Senator Sherrod Brown and  I are submitting as an amendment--a patriot employers tax break, a  patriot corporation tax break. You keep your business in Illinois. You  keep your business in Ohio. When your workforce grows, it is American  workers who get the jobs, and the wages you pay for 90 percent of them  have to be at least $15 an hour. You have to provide health insurance  and a basic retirement plan that is fair. Give a veterans preference,  please, to the men and women who served our country. And then we will  give you a tax break. We won't give it to the company that is ready to  move overseas; we will give it to the company that is ready to invest  in the United States and U.S. workers. I think that is a tax policy  most Americans would say makes sense. Why aren't we talking about that  kind of approach instead of finding a way to give a tax break to the  wealthiest?   American workers and families are watching this debate, and they are  still waiting for a better deal.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
