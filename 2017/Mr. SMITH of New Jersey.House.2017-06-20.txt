 Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words  in support of Representative Kristi Noem's Women, Peace and Security  Act (H.R. 2484). Among other things, it highlights the role women must  play in peacemaking.   In the limited time we have, I would just like to highlight the role  of one woman who served as a peacemaker, whom I have had the  opportunity to get to know--Nuala O'Loan, who served as the Police  Ombudsman in Northern Ireland from 2000 to 2007, and someone who has  contributed to our understanding in the Congress as she twice testified  at hearings held on the Northern Ireland peace process.   Baroness O'Loan--she was made a Dame of the British Empire and a  member of the House of Lords in recognition for her role in the cause  of peace--had the difficult task of looking into how the police handled  the Omagh bombing. That bombing, by a splinter group of the Irish  Republican Army, was intended to reignite sectarian tension and stop  the movement towards peace that was memorialized in the Good Friday  Agreement. The bomb was indiscriminate, however, killing both  Protestant and Catholic alike, and helped underscore the need for  peace.   In the ensuing years, Baroness O'Loan became known as an even-handed  intermediary. Indeed, she was so even-handed that she was criticized by  extremists on both sides, and her retirement party was boycotted by  hardliners from the Unionist and Republican camps. On the other hand,  the average citizen, whether Protestant or Catholic, supported her in  her role as Police Ombudsman in roughly equal numbers, something that  was borne out by independent polling.   Nuala O'Loan is but one example of a woman serving as peacemaker.  There are many more Nualas around the world, and I applaud  Congresswoman Noem for encouraging us to recognize the role these women  play in helping bring a little light to the darkness.
