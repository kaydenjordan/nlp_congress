 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who are here tonight  and Senator Merkley for organizing this evening.   The President has taken a step back from a crisis he provoked, a  crisis he caused, and it seems like it is a rare recognition on his  part that when a President speaks and a President acts, he speaks and  he acts on behalf of the American people, not on his own behalf. The  American people could not stand the idea that this country would do  what it did to these kids in their name. They could not stand the idea  that the whole world would see the separation of children from their  parents on the southern border of the United States of America-- perpetrated by our own government.   Finally, probably for the first time ever, this President relented to  the values the American people share whether they are conservatives or  whether they are liberals or something in between that. That is a  reason to say I am glad we are moving in that direction.   Maybe another good thing will come out of this, which is that the  people who stood up who work for this administration and defended this  terrible, inhumane policy in the name of the law and in the name of  religion--the Bible--might think harder the next time they do that at a  moment of conscience like this one.   As my colleagues have said, it is not clear tonight what is in the  policy. I quote a New York Times article that is on the front page of  the paper tonight.   It reads:         And a Health and Human Services official said that more       than 2,300 children who have already been separated from       their parents under the President's ``zero tolerance'' policy       will not be immediately reunited with their families while       the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration       proceedings.        ``There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,''       said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for       Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health       and Human Services. Mr. Wolfe said the decision about the       children was made by the White House, but he added, ``I can       tell you definitively that is going to be policy.''    So what are they saying--that current kids aren't going to be  grandfathered, that the current kids who have been on the TV this week  and the week before are not going to have the benefit of this Executive  order?   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, June 20, 2018]   Trump Retreats on Separating Families, But Thousands Will Remain Apart         (By Michael D. Shear, Abby Goodnough and Maggie Haberman)         Washington.--President Trump caved to enormous political       pressure on Wednesday and signed an executive order meant to       end the separation of families at the border by detaining       parents and children together for an indefinite period.        ``We're going to have strong--very strong--borders, but we       are going to keep the families together,'' Mr. Trump said as       he signed the order in the Oval Office. ``I didn't like the       sight or the feeling of families being separated.''        But Justice Department officials said it was not clear       whether the practice of separating families could resume       after 20 days if a federal judge refuses to give the       government the authority it wants to hold families together       for a longer period.        And a Health and Human Services official said that more       than 2,300 children who have already been separated from       their parents under the president's ``zero tolerance'' policy       will not be immediately reunited with their families while       the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration       proceedings.        ``There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,''       said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for       Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health       and Human Services. Mr. Wolfe said the decision about the       children was made by the White House, but he added, ``I can       tell you definitively that is going to be policy.''        The president signed the executive order days after he said       that the only way to end the division of families was through       congressional action because ``you can't do it through an       executive order.'' But he changed his mind after a barrage of       criticism from Democrats, activists, members of his own party       and even his wife and eldest daughter, who privately told him       it was wrong.        Stories of children being taken from their parents, audio       of wailing toddlers and images of teenagers in cagelike       detention facilities had exploded into a full-blown political       crisis for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who were       desperate for a response to those who have called the       practice ``inhumane,'' ``cruel'' and ``evil.''        The president's four-page order says that officials will       continue to criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the       border illegally, but will seek to find or build facilities       that can hold families--parents and children together--      instead of separating them while their legal cases are       considered by the courts.        But the action raised new questions that White House       officials did not immediately answer. The order does not say       where the families would be detained. And it does not say       whether children will continue to be separated from their       parents while the facilities to hold them are located or       built.        Officials on a White House conference call said they could       not answer those questions.     Mr. President, the headline of the article reads: ``Trump  Retreats on Separating Families, but Thousands Will Remain Apart.''   We need to know, and that, obviously, isn't going to be acceptable to  the American people if that is what it is.   The last point I want to make tonight, because I know I have other  colleagues here, is that it does not help matters when the President is  completely allergic to the truth on any dimension but especially on  this one.   Today, at the White House, in front of all of the cameras and in  front of the Republicans he invited there--he didn't invite any  Democrats--this is what he said in lamenting the fact that he couldn't  do a deal with Democrats.   This is the President:         We're having a lot of problem with Democrats.        They don't care about lack of security, they would like to       have open borders, where anybody in the world can just flow,       including from the Middle East--from anybody anywhere they       can just flow into our country. Tremendous problems with       that. Tremendous crime caused by that. We are just not going       to do it.    That is what he said is our position.   As the Presiding Officer knows, I was on the Gang of 8 in 2013 that  negotiated what was called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity,  and Immigration Enforcement Act of 2013. The first two words in that  title are ``border security.'' It got 68 votes on this floor. Every  single Democrat voted for it. I want the American people to know what  is in it because they will never hear from the President as to what was  in it:   There is $46 billion dollars for border enforcement; $30 billion to  hire and deploy nearly 20,000 new Border Patrol agents, doubling the  total number, a doubling of the number of Border Patrol agents; $8  billion for a fence along the southern border at least 700 miles long;  $4.5 billion for new surveillance technologies, including air and  marine surveillance so we could see every inch of the border, so we  would know what was happening there; $2 billion to enact  recommendations of a newly established southern border security  commission; $750 million to expand the E-Verify; the remaining $1.5  billion dollars for administrative costs to the Departments of State,  Labor, Agriculture, and Justice.   That was the border security bill we passed in 2013, and that is the  border security bill we should pass today. The only reason it is not  the law of the land today is that the House would not let it come to a  vote. Had they let it come to a vote, had the Speaker allowed it to  come to a vote, it would have passed.   I think, collectively, we should go back to that work and see if we  can't actually solve the problem rather than just play politics with it  or, in the case of what we have just seen, rather than play politics  with the lives of the children on the southern border.   I yield the floor.
