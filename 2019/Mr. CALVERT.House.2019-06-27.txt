 Madam Speaker, as a Member from California, it is hard  for me to believe that the majority could possibly propose an election  security bill that doesn't address the major vulnerabilities related to  ballot harvesting.   Ballot harvesting is where paid campaign operatives collect up to  hundreds or even thousands of ballots and drop them off at polling  places or an election office. The practice is ripe for fraud and a  recipe for disaster. Any serious effort to secure elections would  address it.   Let's be clear: We want to give people who need it an opportunity to  vote by mail, and we want to look for ways to make it easier for  disabled or elderly Americans to participate in our elections. My  concern is inserting campaign operatives into the ballot-handling  process without any safeguards.   In California, paid campaign staff can collect hundreds of ballots  without having to disclose who they are working for. When they hand  over those ballots to election officials, there is no requirement to  even provide their name.   Some of my friends across the aisle claim that the real problem is  bad actors committing fraud. But it is the very practice of ballot  harvesting being the problem. The reality is this process is an open  invitation for fraud. That is why most States have banned the practice.   Ignoring the most notable threat to election security is unacceptable  in a so-called election security bill.   Madam Speaker, American voters deserve better. I urge my colleagues  to oppose this bill until we can get serious about real threats to our  democracy.
