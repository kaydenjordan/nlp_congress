 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life and legacy of South African President Nelson Mandela on what  would have been his 100th birthday.   President Mandela, or ``Mandiba'' as he was affectionately called,  was a revolutionary and transformative leader, who forever changed the  world through his steadfast dedication to freedom, equality, and human  rights.   After spending 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela became the first  Black South African to be elected President in what was also the first  free, multiracial, democratic election in South African history.   While President Mandela used his administration to dismantle  apartheid, combat institutional racism, and begin the process of racial  reconciliation in his country, his efforts also taught the world the  power of one man having the fortitude to sacrifice his own ideals for a  cause greater than himself.   To me, Nelson Mandela is more than a world-renowned hero. I had the  distinct honor and privilege of calling him a friend. His leadership of  the international antiapartheid movement encouraged me to take action  here in the United States, where I served as the Los Angeles chair of  the Free South Africa Movement, organized countless antiapartheid  rallies in Los Angeles, led a sit-in at the South African Consulate  General's office in Los Angeles, and was even arrested during a protest  at the Embassy of South Africa in Washington, D.C. I was also a board  member of and worked nationally with TransAfrica, one of the most  prominent antiapartheid advocacy groups in the United States.   As a member of the California State Assembly at that time, I fought  for the passage of Assembly Bill 134, which forced California to divest  $12 billion in State pension funds tied to the apartheid regime in  South Africa.   In 1990, I chaired the committee in Los Angeles that brought over  90,000 people together in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to welcome  Nelson Mandela into the United States, and I also traveled with the  official U.S. delegation to South Africa in 1994 to attend his  inauguration as President of South Africa.   In 1998, I was honored to welcome President Mandela to the United  States once again, this time to receive the United States Congressional  Gold Medal.   In honor of his 95th birthday in 2013, I organized an event here in  Washington, D.C., called the Celebration of the Life, Legacy and Values  of Nelson R. Mandela in Emancipation Hall of the United States Capitol  Visitor Center. The celebration was attended by my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus, leaders from both the United States House  and Senate, and representatives of national and international civil  rights and humanitarian groups.   As we reflect on Nelson Mandela's memory today, let us remember what  he once said: ``What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have  lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that  will determine the significance of the life we lead.''   Few embody this quote better than Nelson Mandela himself, and it is  my  [[Page H6474]]  sincere hope that my own career in public service can live up to his  extraordinary example.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, during rollcall Vote No.  342 on the amendment (No. 25) to H.R. 6147 offered by Rep.
