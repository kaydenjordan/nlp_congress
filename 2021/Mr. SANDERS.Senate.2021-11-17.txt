 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, day after day here on the floor of the  Senate and back in their States, many of my colleagues talk to the  American people about how deeply concerned they are about the deficit  and the national debt. They tell us that we just don't have enough  money to expand Medicare, to cover dental care for seniors, to cover  hearing aids, to cover eyeglasses. We just don't have enough money to  do what every other major country on Earth does, and that is guarantee  paid family and medical leave.   At a time when hundreds of thousands of bright young people are  unable to afford a higher education and millions are struggling with  student debt, my colleagues tell us that we just don't have enough  money to provide 2 years of free tuition at community colleges.   When we have over 500,000 Americans sleeping out on the streets,  including a few blocks away from the Nation's Capitol, we just don't  have enough money to build the low-income and affordable housing this  country needs.   At a time when the scientists are telling us that we face an  existential threat in terms of climate change, we are told that we just  don't have enough money to transform our energy system away from fossil  fuel and create a planet that will be healthy and habitable for our  kids and future generations. Just don't have enough money.   Yet, today, the U.S. Senate will begin consideration of an annual  defense budget that costs $778 billion--$778 billion for one year. That  is $37 billion more than President Trump's last defense budget and $25  billion more than what President Biden requested.   By the way, all of this money is going to an Agency, the Department  of  [[Page S8328]]  Defense, that continues to have massive cost overruns year after year,  wasting enormous amounts of money, and is the only major governmental  Agency in the Federal Government not to successfully complete an  independent audit.   Now, isn't it remarkable how, even as we end the longest war in our  Nation's history, the war in Afghanistan, concerns about the deficit  and the national debt seem to melt away under the influence of the  military-industrial complex. People sleeping out on the street, people  dying because they don't have any healthcare, kids unable to get the  early childhood education they need--not a problem. Can't afford to pay  for those things, but somehow, when it comes to the defense budget and  the needs of the military-industrial complex, we just cannot give them  enough money.   But that is not all, and I want the American people to know this, as  I suspect many don't.   It is very likely that in the Defense bill or attached to the Defense  bill, there will be a so-called competition bill, and this bill is a  $250 billion bill that includes $52 billion in straight corporate  welfare, with no strings attached, for a handful of extremely  profitable microchip companies.   Now, is there a problem in that our country is not producing the  kinds of microchips and the number of microchips that we should? The  answer is yes. It is an issue we have to deal with, but we can deal  with it in a way other than simply handing money to a handful of  enormously profitable corporations with no protection for the taxpayers  at all.   By the way, I should also mention that as part of the so-called  competition bill, there is also a $10 billion handout to Jeff Bezos,  one of the wealthiest people in our country, for space exploration.   Combining these two pieces of legislation would push the pricetag of  the Defense bill to over $1 trillion for 1 year. I want people to  remember that because when we talk about Build Back Better, we are  talking about a 10-year bill. This is 1 year.   Meanwhile, while there is limited discussion about the Defense bill  or corporate welfare in the competition bill, Congress has spent month  after month discussing the Build Back Better Act, which on an annual  basis costs far less than the Pentagon budget, and discussing whether  or not we can afford to protect the working families of our country  whose needs have been ignored decade after decade, who in many cases  are living paycheck to paycheck, can't afford housing, can't afford  prescription drugs, and can't afford to send their kids to college. We  can't address their needs--no, no, no--because we are too busy worrying  about throwing money at the Pentagon and large, profitable  corporations.   If there was ever a moment in modern American history when we need to  fundamentally review our national priorities, now is that moment.  Whether it is transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels;  whether it is guaranteeing paid family and medical leave; whether it is  providing healthcare to all of our people as a human right, as  virtually every other major country does; whether it is taking on the  greed of the pharmaceutical industry, which charges us by far the  highest prices in the world for prescription drugs; whether it is  addressing our crisis of affordable housing or providing childcare and  pre-K to the little kids, now is the time to reassess our priorities.  Now is the time to fight for real change.   But instead of addressing these major issues that impact the lives of  working families all across this country and that the working class of  this country desperately wants, Congress comes together, Democrats and  Republicans, with minimal debate, to support an exploding Pentagon  budget, which is now higher than the next 13 nations combined and  represents more than half of our discretionary spending.   After adjusting for inflation, we are now spending more on the  military than we did during the height of the Cold War or during the  wars in Vietnam or Korea. And I would like to reiterate, this is after  the war in Afghanistan has ended. That is why I have introduced an  amendment with Senator Markey to reduce the military budget by $25  billion, down to what President Biden requested.   Let's be clear. This is not a radical idea. It is the military  spending proposed by the President of the United States and the amount  requested by the Department of Defense. I look forward to support on  that amendment, especially from the deficit hawks, who I know are very,  very concerned about the deficit.   I should also point out that this extraordinarily high level of  military spending comes at a time when the Department of Defense is the  only Agency of our Federal Government that has not been able to pass an  independent audit and when defense contractors are making enormous  profits while paying their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages.   Let's not forget that in this so-called competition bill, there will  be a provision which provides $53 billion in emergency appropriations  for the microchip industry with no strings attached.   Let me repeat that. We are talking about more than $53 billion in  Federal funds, and by the way, I suspect there will be more taxpayer  money coming to these corporations from State and local government with  no strings attached.   Do we need to expand the microchip industry in this country so we can  become less dependent on foreign countries? Yes. But we can accomplish  that goal without throwing money at these companies with no protections  for the taxpayers.   In total, my guess is that five--one, two, three, four, five--major  semiconductor companies will likely receive the lion's share of this  taxpayer handout. Those companies are Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron  Technology, Analog Devices, and NVIDIA.   I should also point out that these five companies made nearly $35  billion in profits last year combined and spent more than $18 billion  buying back their own stock.   I should also point out that these five corporations combined paid  their CEOs a combined $85 million in compensation last year.   Further, it is important to point out that this is an industry that  received nearly $6 billion in government subsidies and loans over the  years, and it is an industry that has shut down over 780 manufacturing  plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs in the  last 20 years--29 percent of its workforce--while moving most of its  production overseas. In other words, over the years, in order to make  more money, they decided to outsource their operations and, in the  process, throw American workers out on the street.   So let's be clear what is happening here. In order to make more  profits, these companies took good government money and then offshored  good American jobs. Now, for that bad behavior, these same companies  are being rewarded with some $53 billion in no-strings corporate  welfare to undo the damage that they did.    That may make sense to somebody; not to me. That is why I have  introduced Senate amendment No. 4722, which would prevent microchip  companies from receiving taxpayer assistance unless they agree to issue  warrants to the Federal Government. If private companies are going to  benefit from over $53 billion in taxpayer subsidies, the financial  gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people,  not just wealthy shareholders.   In other words, all this amendment says is that if these companies  want taxpayer assistance, we are not going to socialize all of the  risks and privatize all of the profits.   Let me be very clear. This is not a radical idea. These exact  conditions were imposed on corporations that received taxpayer  assistance in the bipartisan CARES Act, which passed the Senate 96 to  nothing. In other words, every Member of the U.S. Senate has already  voted for the conditions that are in my amendment.   CARES was not the first time that Congress passed warrants and equity  stakes tied to government assistance. During the 2008 financial crisis,  Congress required all companies taking TARP funds to issue warrants and  equity stakes to the Federal Government.   The bottom line is that taxpayers should not just be handing out  money to large, profitable corporations and well-paid CEOs. They  deserve to benefit as well.  [[Page S8329]]    In addition to making sure that companies allow for warrants and  equity stakes, this amendment would require that these companies cannot  buy back their own stock, nor outsource American jobs, nor repeal  existing collective bargaining agreements, and remain neutral in any  union organizing efforts.   Here is something else--I think people think that I am kidding here,  but I am not; this is really true--here is something else that is in  the so-called competition bill that must be addressed. Unbelievably,  this bill would provide and authorize some $10 billion in taxpayer  money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in America, for his  space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in America. This is  beyond laughable, and I will be introducing an amendment to strike this  provision. Frankly, it is not acceptable. It is not an issue that we  have discussed terribly much, but it is not acceptable that the two  wealthiest people in this country, Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos, take control  of our space efforts to return to the Moon and maybe even the  extraordinary accomplishment of getting to Mars. This is not something  for two billionaires to be directing; this is something for the  American people to be determining.   Let me just say a few words about why there is so much waste and  fraud and abuse in the military. Again, I always find it amazing how,  when it comes to programs directed at ordinary people, low-income  people, all kinds of investigations and all kinds of language about how  we have to protect the taxpayer from fraud, but when it comes to the  massive amount of money that we put into the Pentagon, not a whole lot  of attention paid to that.   One of the reasons that we have so many cost overruns and one of the  reasons that we have so much fraud and so much abuse is that the  Pentagon has been unable to pass an independent audit 30 years after  Congress required it to do so--30 years.   I think one of the points that need to be remembered is that on  September 10, 2001, 1 day before the terrible attack on our country,  then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, talking about the  Pentagon:         Our financial systems are decades old. According to some       estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We       cannot share information from floor to floor in this       building--    The Pentagon--       because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that       are inaccessible or incompatible.    Yet, 20 years after that statement--a rather profound statement by  then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld--the Pentagon has still not  passed a clean audit despite the fact that the Pentagon controls assets  in excess of $3.1 trillion or roughly 78 percent of what the entire  Federal Government owns.   Just this week, the Pentagon announced that it will fail its fourth  consecutive financial audit in a row. That is why I have introduced an  amendment with Senator Grassley that would require the Pentagon to pass  a clean audit this year. If it fails to do so, 1 percent of its budget  would be returned to the Treasury each year until it obtains a clean  audit operation. I think 30 years is maybe just enough time to make  that demand.   I think that at this moment in American history, it is appropriate  for the American people and for my colleagues here in the Senate to  remember what former Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower said in  1953 when he was President.   As we all recall, Dwight D. Eisenhower was a four-star general, not a  politician, who led the Allied Forces to victory in Europe during World  War II. So this was no peacenik. This was a man who saw more death and  more military battles than probably any human being should have to.   This is what Eisenhower said:         Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every       rocket [fired], signifies in the final sense a theft from       those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are       not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone.       It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its       scientists, the hopes of its children.    That was Dwight D. Eisenhower, and that is what he said 68 years ago.  It was true then. It is even more true now.   If the horrific coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything--a  pandemic which has cost us now almost 700,000 lives--it is that  national security means more than just building bombs or missiles or  jet fighters or tanks or submarines or nuclear warheads and other  weapons of mass destruction. National security also means doing  everything that we can to protect the lives of ordinary Americans, many  of whom have been abandoned by their government for decades. These are  people, right now, who are struggling to put food on the table, people  who are now experiencing a lower life expectancy than was the case in  the past, and these are people who, in many instances, when they get  sick, can't even afford to go to a doctor.   When we analyze the Defense Department's budget, it is important to  note that Congress has appropriated so much money to the Defense  Department that the Pentagon literally does not know what to do with  it. According to the GAO, over the course of 11 years, the Pentagon  returned an astonishing $128 billion in excess funds back to the  Treasury.   And, over the past two decades, while we have funneled out money to  the defense contractors, it is important to note that virtually every  major defense contractor in the United States has been fined for  misconduct and fraud, all while making huge profits. Since 1995,  Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Technologies have paid over $3  billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct.  Meanwhile, the CEOs of these large defense companies enjoy incredibly  large compensation packages--in fact, on average, over 100 times more  than does the Secretary of Defense.   I have also filed an amendment with Senator Markey and Representative  Ro Khanna, in the House, to finally end all U.S. support for the Saudi  war effort in Yemen. This amendment simply codifies the prohibition on  support for the Saudi war, and it already passed both Houses of  Congress, in 2019, in a bipartisan way. At that time and in 2019,  various officials now in the Biden-Harris administration signed a  letter supporting this measure. The House has already passed this  amendment for the third consecutive year. It is long overdue for this  provision to be included in the final Defense policy bill that is sent  to the President's desk.   In addition to Yemen, I have longstanding concerns about the  situation in Gaza. That is why I have introduced an amendment to  request a series of reports on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and on  steps that the United States can take to ease that crisis and bring  desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the  Palestinian people in Gaza.   I would also point out that, when I talk about healthcare, I talk  about dental care, and I think most healthcare experts understand that  dental care is part of healthcare. In my home State of Vermont,  veterans who are eligible for dental care at the VA have no access to a  VA dental facility. That is why I have introduced an amendment to the  NDAA to require the Department of Veterans Affairs to maintain a dental  clinic in every State of this country so that all veterans have access  to the dental care that they need.   I believe in a strong military, but I do not believe that we can keep  throwing more money into the Pentagon than it needs at a time when  working families all across this country are struggling to put food on  the table for their kids and when 140 million Americans can't afford  the basic necessities of life without going into debt.   In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., warned us that ``a nation that  continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than  on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.''   Dr. King was right. That was true in 1967. It is true today.   Let me just conclude with another quote from one of the great  Republican Presidents in American history, and he is Dwight D.  Eisenhower. This is what he said as he was leaving office back in 1961.   He said:         In the councils of government, we must guard against the       acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or       unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential       for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will       persist.   [[Page S8330]]     That was Dwight Eisenhower, and what he was talking about was the  incredible power then of the military-industrial complex--of the  revolving door, where people go from the military into defense  companies. It was true then; it is truer now; and that truth is  manifested in the fact that we have a bill which is now spending $25  billion more than the President of the United States requested.   I yield the floor.
