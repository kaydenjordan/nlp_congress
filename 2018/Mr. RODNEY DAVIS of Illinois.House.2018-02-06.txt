 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank  Chairman Harper for his leadership on this important piece of  legislation. And I would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I didn't offer my  thanks to our House Administration Committee's ranking member, Mr.  Brady. I thank him for his leadership on this important issue, too. I  want to thank my fellow colleagues on that committee for their hard  work and diligence.   Mr. Speaker, no one should have to worry about sexual harassment when  they come to work. This bill is vital to addressing this problem as we  work to increase professionalism in the House and establish a workplace  that is grounded in respect.   In Congress, we have got to lead by example. As a member of this  committee, my colleagues and I held hearings on preventing sexual  harassment in the congressional workplace and the effectiveness of the  Congressional Accountability Act, which demonstrated the need for  reform.   I am pleased to report that this bill continues the House  Administration Committee's commitment to increasing transparency in the  Federal Government. Last Congress, we worked hard to pass reforms that  made House office spending more transparent and accountable than any  other area of the Federal Government.   Today we are voting on a bill that will increase transparency of  Member conduct by requiring the Office of Compliance to report on  awards and settlements every 6 months and by holding Members personally  responsible. This strengthens the dispute resolution process, enables  employees to speak without fear of retribution, and ensures every House  office has an antidiscriminatory and antiharassment policy.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to support this  bill.
