 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan bill,  H.R. 3949.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member. I was in his office  early on, and he really gave a freshman Member of Congress the guidance  on how to get this through. I want to thank Chairman Arrington for  coauthoring this legislation and for his leadership. I also thank  Congressman Bilirakis for his kind words about the legislation.   The legislation is very, very simple. Right now, if you want to offer  a veteran an apprenticeship, you have to register in 50 different  States. As a result, small businesses or medium-sized businesses say,  ``Well, we can't do that; we can't fill out paperwork in 50 different  States,'' so they don't offer these apprenticeships. Our bill says,  very simply, the only place that you should have to register in is the  State that you are headquartered.   This is the type of commonsense legislation that isn't partisan. It  is going to give more opportunities to the people who have earned them  by serving our country: veterans.   I wish to recognize a few other people who have made this possible.  Of course, Chairman Roe, whose leadership was critical, in addition to  Chairman Arrington; Ranking Member O'Rourke; and the staff: Cathy Yu,  Kelsey Baron, and Jon Clark.   I also want to particularly recognize, on the Senate side, Aaron  Murphy and Tony McClain in Senator Tester's office, and a companion  Senate bill with Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Thom Tillis, as well as  their staff, Jake Bailey and Bill Bode.   Finally, I realize that there is only one person more than Members of  Congress or staff who often gets things to move in this committee, and  that is Dr. Joe Westcott, the legislative director of the National  Association of State Approving Agencies. Joe and I have become friends.  He has been such a voice for innovation and for this bill. He really is  the reason that this bill has moved in the House and, I hope, in the  Senate.
