 Mr. Speaker, Republicans are turning their backs on the  American people today. There are no guarantees with this bill. This  bill will raise costs for families, penalize people nearing retirement  with an age tax, and rip coverage away from millions of Americans.    And if that wasn't bad enough, this revised TrumpCare bill guts  protections for people with preexisting conditions; people like  Cameron, who was diagnosed with cancer at 24 years old. Because of the  Affordable Care Act, he was able to access coverage and attend graduate  school. Now, of course, he has a preexisting condition.   This is personal for Cameron and millions more in this country, and  they are not going to be silent as Republicans rush this legislation  through.   Mr. Speaker, lives are on the line. I urge my Republican colleagues  to have the courage to vote ``no'' on this legislation.
