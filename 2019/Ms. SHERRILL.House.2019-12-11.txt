 Mr. Speaker, on this sixth day of SALT, my constituents  have said to me that they want me to read a resolution from the New  Jersey State League of Municipalities.   In a unanimous, bipartisan resolution signed this month, the mayors  of New Jersey urged Congress to act on SALT. Today, I would like to  read part of this resolution into the Record.   New Jersey State League of Municipalities Conference Resolution  Number 2019-14:         Whereas, our tax obligation is an issue that concerns all       residents in every municipality in the State of New Jersey;       and        Whereas, many New Jersey families relied upon the Federal       SALT deduction to ensure tax fairness, and capping the SALT       deduction has placed an unfair burden on New Jersey       homeowners; and        Whereas, the SALT deduction cap presents a barrier to       affordable homeownership in New Jersey, impacting the ability       of new, young families to prosper in the future,        Now, therefore, be it resolved that the New Jersey State       League of Municipalities, in conference assembled, urges       Congress to restore the full SALT deduction and provide more       equitable taxation once again to residents of New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, it is time to listen to our local elected officials, and  I thank Committeewoman Amalia Duarte of Mendham Township for leading  this resolution.                            ____________________
