 Mr. Speaker, I met last week with a  group of West Virginia coal miners who are worried about their future.  They are worried about their pensions and healthcare benefits that will  expire soon, benefits that they worked their whole life to earn,  benefits the Federal Government promised them more than 70 years ago.   During our meeting at the UMWA Career Center in Beckley, I met  Preston Thomas of Raleigh County. He spent 36 years in the mines before  retiring in 2010. Preston relies on the healthcare benefits he earned  to provide prescription drug coverage for his wife. If this coverage is  allowed to expire in April, his wife will no longer have access to the  medications she needs.   Mr. Speaker, Preston is asking--I am calling on--Congress to keep the  promise we made to him, to his fellow miners, to their wives, to their  husbands, to their widows. We must pass legislation I have cosponsored  to protect these hard-earned benefits.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and  protecting the hardworking miners like Preston. We owe it to all of  them to keep our word.                            ____________________
