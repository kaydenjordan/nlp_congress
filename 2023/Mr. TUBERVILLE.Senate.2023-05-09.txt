 Mr. President, we will never fully  understand--or know--the sacrifices our servicemembers make to keep us  safe, both at home and abroad, like Airman First Class Earl Smith of  Lincoln, AL. His story of heroism went untold for more than 50 years  because of security reasons. His bravery and quick action prevented  what could have been the worst nuclear disaster in history.   Raised on a farm in Hatton, AL, Airman Smith and a friend decided on  a whim to enlist in the U.S. Air Force after visiting a recruiting  office in their local community. Always up for an adventure, Airman  Smith decided to enroll in bomb disposal school after enlisting. He  recalls his instructor's  [[Page S1565]]  warning on the first day that you are only allowed one chance to mess  up--because just one mistake could be fatal. Nine months after  completing his training, his skills were put to the ultimate test while  stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina.   On January 24, 1961, Airman Smith woke up to a midnight call telling  him to report to the base as soon as possible. Without any protective  gear or fully strapping up his boots, he arrived to the base, where he  was then whisked away to the site of a B-52 plane crash 15 miles away.  The plane was transporting two nuclear bombs reported to be 250 times  more powerful than those used on Japan during World War II. Both bombs  had fallen out of the plane during the crash, creating what is now  reported as a 100-percent kill zone for surrounding communities.   Upon arriving to the scene, he immediately noticed one of the bombs  was activated. Despite a general ordering him not to touch the bomb  until receiving permission from atomic support, Airman Smith knew that  time was not on their side. Thankfully, he acted quickly to disengage  the bomb, saving countless American lives.   Airman Smith now proudly travels across Alabama speaking to local  groups about his military service, which has now received national and  global recognition. If you travel to Eureka, NC, there is a marker that  says, ``Nuclear Mishap--widespread disaster averted.'' This is all  thanks to Alabama's extraordinary hero--Earl Smith--who I am proud to  recognize as May's ``Veteran of the Month.''                            ____________________
