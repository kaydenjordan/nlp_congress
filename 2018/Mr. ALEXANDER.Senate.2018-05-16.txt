 Mr. President, today the Senate is finally voting to  confirm a well-qualified nominee, BG Mitchell Zais, to serve as Deputy  Secretary at the Department of Education. I worked to get a time  agreement for this vote because General Zais did not deserve to be  subject to the Democrats' unreasonable and unnecessary obstructions and  delays. For example, General Zais was nominated on October 5, 2017, 223  days ago, and the HELP Committee approved his nomination for the first  time on December 13, 2017, 154 days ago. Because the Democrats forced  his nomination to be returned to the President at the end of the  session in December, the HELP Committee had to approve his nomination  again on January 18, 2018, after he was renominated.   It is time to confirm General Zais and give Secretary DeVos a Deputy  Secretary. He has extensive experience working in education and in  government. From January 2011 to January 2015, General Zais served as  South Carolina's elected State Superintendent of Education. Before  that, he was president of Newberry College in South Carolina for 10  years. He also served as a commissioner on South Carolina's Commission  on Higher Education for 6 years. Further, after 31 years in the U.S.  Army, he retired as a brigadier general. He graduated from West Point,  has a Ph.D. from the University of Washington, as well as an honorary  doctorate of education from the Citadel.   As Deputy Secretary, his job will be to help the Secretary manage the  Department of Education, which includes implementation of the Every  Student Succeeds Act. I am glad we are having this vote today. I  support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to support him as  well.
