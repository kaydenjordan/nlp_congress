 Mr. Speaker, we recently learned that the Biden  administration is considering funding mining projects abroad with  American tax dollars in order to address our country's mineral supply  concerns.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen this movie before: President Biden looks to  other countries to meet our country's energy needs while our domestic  industries are blocked by unnecessary permitting delays and regulatory  uncertainty.   If I may offer a suggestion to both the President and my Democratic  colleagues, why not in America?   In my home State of Idaho, we have an abundance of resources,  including cobalt, gold, silver, tungsten, and antimony. These resources  are necessary for the production of batteries, semiconductors,  munitions, and countless other essential products.   Instead of looking at countries with hostile motives against America,  like Russia and China, to help us meet our demand for critical  minerals, we should strengthen our domestic supply chain by enabling  the responsible development of our resources at home.
