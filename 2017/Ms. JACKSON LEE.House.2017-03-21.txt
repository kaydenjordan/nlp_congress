 Mr. Speaker, I, too, am excited to celebrate the  signing of the Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama.   In the hearing last Thursday of the Budget Committee, we noted that  Medicaid that provided health insurance in this bill, now the TrumpCare  bill, will be cut $880 billion for working people, for seniors in  nursing homes, for the blind, and for the disabled.   We note that this meaningless TrumpCare amendment, for which the  President is now rallying his troops, coming up to the Hill two and  three times--maybe he will be here tomorrow--is as meaningless as the  first part of it was: 24 million Americans will lose their insurance-- TrumpCare will double that amount in 2026; 52 million will not have  insurance--giveaways to billionaires, 1 percent of the rich people in  America; and destroying 2 million jobs.   But what I am most concerned about is my constituent in the Heights  who could not take her medicine before the Affordable Care Act.  Tragically, a young woman had a stroke and a heart attack and now is in  a nursing home. She uses the health insurance of Medicaid, $880  billion, to provide for her lifeline, but yet TrumpCare comes to  destroy that.   I want to celebrate the Affordable Care Act because it saves lives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman very much  for his leadership. I acknowledge the chairman of the committee for  his, as well.   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and although I will make  the points that I think are important, I wanted to take the time to  thank Mr. Conyers for the thoughtful legislation that he has introduced  over the years.   This leads me to call this the Conyers bill because of the important  contributions it makes to ensuring that our health care is competitive,  our health insurance is competitive, and his thoughtfulness in this  legislation. As it comes to the floor, I am reminded of Mr. Conyers'  influence on this legislation. It is an interesting time at which it  comes, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the importance of H.R. 372, the  Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, a proposal to remove  the antitrust exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act as it applies to  health insurance.   Overall, the proposed legislation, as well as previous attempts by  the Judiciary Committee to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust  exemption for health insurance, does not raise new or pressing issues.   Opponents of repeal assume problems that cannot be documented, unlike  the very tangible and real economic and competitive costs that will be  incurred if the exemption is allowed to continue.   As the Justice Department has explained, where there is effective  competition, coupled with transparency, in a consumer-friendly  regulatory framework, insurers will compete against each other by  offering plans with lower premiums, reducing copayments, lowering or  eliminating deductibles, lowering annual out-of-pocket maximum costs,  managing care, improving drug coverage, offering desirable benefits,  and making their provider networks more attractive to potential  members.   That sounds, of course, like the Affordable Care Act, which we will  celebrate tomorrow, for that was the day it was signed. That is what  health insurance should be for the American people.   This legislation is a very thoughtful legislative initiative, and I  am hoping that its coming to the floor is not like trying to put  lipstick on a pig. That, of course, is the latest configuration of the  meaningless TrumpCare, and which the amendment that will be coming  forward will, again, in essence, throw people off health insurance. It  will take away all that we are intending it to do, but this legislation  has reason.   Other current enforcement tools and regulatory policies already in  place address competition issues at the State and Federal level to  police health insurance competition. In this and numerous other ways,  effective regulation can promote improved healthcare delivery and  improved cost control by ensuring that all insurance companies are  required to follow certain basic consumer-friendly rules of the road.   Again, wouldn't it be great to have this very thoughtful legislation  with all of the points of the Affordable Care Act: it eliminates  preexisting conditions, has lowered premiums and continues to lower  premiums, and is lowering or eliminating deductibles. All of those were  thoughtful of Mr. Conyers, and they would have been the right  complement to the Affordable Care Act.   However, the additional risks of adding new regulatory uncertainty,  increasing boundary-testing litigation, and distracting policymakers  from more important ways to reduce healthcare costs and improve  healthcare competition suggest that further caution and delay on this  front is inadvisable, given present circumstances and conditions.   But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that the legislation  before us is a panacea that will lead to affordable, accessible, high- quality health care for all Americans. If that worthy goal is the  objective sought, the best way to achieve it is to retain and  strengthen the Affordable Care Act and abandon the misguided effort of  House Republicans to repeal this landmark legislation and replace it  with the pay more for less act masquerading as a healthcare bill.   The Affordable Care Act works. I think we in the Judiciary Committee  know it full well. We held hearings and briefings; we heard from the  victims of those who did not have insurance, who had lost insurance,  did not have enough insurance, or the insurance would not cover them.   I am reminded of a very emotional story of an 8-year-old girl in the  office of an insurance company where her family was begging for  coverage because she had leukemia; obviously, a preexisting condition.  It is sad to say, but I understand that she lost her life.   The Affordable Care Act has significantly improved the availability,  affordability, and quality of health care  [[Page H2271]]  for tens of millions of Americans, including millions who previously  had no health insurance at all.   Americans are rightly frightened by Republican attempts to repeal the  ACA without having in place a superior new plan that maintains  comparable coverages and comparable consumer choices and protections,  not throwing off 24 million Americans who will have no insurance.   It is beyond dispute that the pay more for less plan proposed by  Republicans fails this test miserably. The Republican pay more for less  act is a massive tax cut for the rich, paid for on the backs of  America's most vulnerable: those who work and who happen to be of low  income. This Robin-Hood-in-reverse bill is unprecedented and  breathtaking in its audacity. No bill has ever tried to give so much to  the rich while taking so much from the poor.   One number comes to mind: $880 billion taken away from Medicaid  insurance covering nursing homes, patients, the blind, the disabled;  again, then giving a great plus and a great refund in tax credits to  the richest in America. They will be happy. It won't be health care.  They have got private health insurance. But it certainly will be a big  check that they get in the mail.   This pay more for less bill represents the largest transfer of wealth  from the bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent in American history.  This Republic scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays for  it by taking insurance away from 24 million.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade, without demanding  in return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name  drugs. That is very important.    To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.   The pay more for less plan destroys the Medicaid program. CBO  estimates 14 million will lose Medicaid. In 2026, 52 million Americans  will be uninsured.   We know that these combined policies will not help to cure some of  the thoughtful deliberations that went into the underlying bill. We  want more competition. We want the insurance products to be the kind of  products that we can be sure provide health care.   In short, the Republican pay more get less plan represents a clear  and present danger to the financial and health security of American  families and to the very stability of our Nation's healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, the healthcare marketplace is complex in how it operates  and how it motivates providers, insurers, and consumers.   If I can quote the 45th President, he said: ``I didn't know how  difficult this would be.'' Well, we know how difficult it can be, and  was.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats held some 79-plus hearings. We had 181  witnesses-plus. We had hundreds of hours of hearings. We held  thousands, I might imagine, of townhall meetings. We didn't hold one  here and one there. I myself held 11 townhall meetings.   We continue to hear from not only the consumers, but the rural  hospitals, the major hospitals, the senior citizens, and particularly  those senior citizens on dealing with the cost of prescription drugs.   I am proud to say that we saved the dastardly Medicare part D by  closing the doughnut hole, which is closed today, so that seniors under  the Affordable Care Act do not fall into an abyss, a deep ocean, and  have to, in essence, not take their drugs because they don't have  enough money.   An effective regulatory framework is needed to shape this complex  environment--and this is a word to the administration--to help  safeguard consumers, help keep costs under control, and help make a  full range of healthcare services. But our country's long experience  shows that we cannot expect a healthcare system to run effectively on  market competition alone. Markets can and do fail when proper  regulation is lacking.                                time  1515    So the goodness of this bill has to go along with--a good example is  recognizing what happens in the ACA's provision, banning insurance  companies from denying coverage of preexisting disease--we had to help  them along--preexisting conditions. We had to help them along. You have  to help them along to be a good steward of the insurance that the  American people need.   This is a key consumer protection that the free market demonstrates  time and time again that it could produce and needed to do. That is  where regulation and the antitrust laws come in to protect consumer  choice. Let me go back and say that it could not produce on its own. It  is a per se violation of antitrust laws for competing companies to  agree to divide markets or to fix prices. The other sectors in the  healthcare supply chain are already subject to antitrust laws, and it  will be beneficial to the healthcare marketplace and to consumers if  the healthcare industry joins them. That is why I said this bill is a  thoughtful, important bill to dealing with the complex issues of  insurance and health care.   I am sad to say that tomorrow, as we celebrate the Affordable Care  Act, we will be looking toward Thursday, where we will be, in essence,  debating a bill that takes 24 million people off of health insurance,  period. 24 million will lose their coverage. Tax giveaways will  continue again to the top 1 percent. That will be $600 billion in tax  breaks to the rich and big corporations. In fact, the Republican bill  gives $2.8 billion to 400 of the richest families in America.   Then to add to the downside, the Affordable Care Act was known to  create more jobs. Unfortunately, this will see 2 million jobs destroyed  and lost. Families will be paying more for less. Young people will be  hit with a millennial penalty. And we don't know if this formula that  they have still stops the 50- to 64-year-olds from paying higher  premiums. Women lose comprehensive care, middle-aged Americans pay the  age tax, seniors see Medicaid and Medicare weakened, preexisting  conditions and disabilities may suffer, and it does not reduce the  deficit as the ACA does.   My final point, if I can, we are glad to come to the floor and honor  Mr. Conyers for this important bill and support H.R. 372. I believe  this legislation before us does a lot more good than it does harm, but  I hope that we can, in a bipartisan manner--maybe even in a nonpartisan  manner--reflect on what is needed to really insure the American people  and we can work with the Affordable Care Act, which has all of these  positive elements, and move this country forward through competition  and health care that saves lives.   Mr. Speaker, overall, the proposed legislation, as well as previous  attempts by the Judiciary Committee to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson  Act's antitrust exemption for health insurance, does not raise new or  pressing issues.   Opponents of repeal assume problems that cannot be documented, unlike  the very tangible and real economic and competitive costs that will be  incurred if the exemption is allowed to continue.   As the Justice Department has explained, where there is effective  competition, coupled with transparency, in a consumer-friendly  regulatory framework, insurers will compete against each other by  offering plans with lower premiums, reducing copayments, lowering or  eliminating deductibles, lowering annual out-of-pocket maximum costs,  managing care, improving drug coverage, offering desirable benefits,  and making their provider networks more attractive to potential  members.   Other current enforcement tools and regulatory policies already in  place address competition issues at the state and federal level to  police health insurance competition.   In this and numerous other ways, effective regulation can promote  improved health care delivery and improved cost control, by ensuring  that all insurance companies are required to follow certain basic  consumer-friendly ``rules of the road.''   It might be argued that increasing the federal government's role in  regulating health insurance, through expanded antitrust enforcement,  would appear to conflict with proposed reforms to delegate more  responsibility to state governments.   However, the additional risks of adding new regulatory uncertainty,  increasing boundary-testing litigation, and distracting policymakers  from more important ways to reduce health care costs and improve health  care competition suggest that further caution and delay on this front  is inadvisable given present circumstances and conditions.   But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that the legislation  before us is a panacea that will lead to affordable, accessible, high  quality health care for all Americans.   If that worthy goal is the objective sought, then the best way to  achieve it is to retain and  [[Page H2272]]  strengthen the Affordable Care Act and abandon the misguided effort of  House Republicans to repeal this landmark legislation and replace it  with their Pay More For Less Act, masquerading as the American Health  Care Act.   The Affordable Care Act has significantly improved the availability,  affordability, and quality of health care for tens of millions of  Americans, including millions who previously had no health insurance at  all.   Americans are rightly frightened by Republican attempts to repeal the  ACA without having in place a superior new plan that maintains  comparable coverages and comparable consumer choices and protections.   It is beyond dispute that the ``Pay More For Less'' plan proposed by  House Republicans fails this test miserably.   The Republican ``Pay More For Less Act'' is a massive tax cut for the  wealthy, paid for on the backs of America's most vulnerable, the poor  and working class households.   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill has ever tried to give so much to the rich  while taking so much from the poor and working class.   This ``Pay More Get Less'' bill represents the largest transfer of  wealth from the bottom 99% to the top 1% in American history.   This Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays  for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people and raising  costs for the poor and middle class.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade without demanding in  return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name drugs.   To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that ``never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.''   The ``Pay More Get Less'' plan destroys the Medicaid program under  the cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.   CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by  2026 under the Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the ``Pay More  Get Less'' plan converts Medicaid to a per capita cap that is not  guaranteed to keep pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid  spending in 2026.   In short, the Republican ``Pay More Get Less Act'' represents a clear  and present danger to the financial and health security of American  families, and to the very stability of our nation's health care system  overall.   Mr. Speaker, the health care marketplace is complex in how it  operates and how it motivates providers, insurers, and consumers.   An effective regulatory framework is needed to shape that complex  environment, to help safeguard consumers, help keep costs under  control, and help make a full range of health care services available.   But our country's long experience shows that we cannot expect a  health care system to run effectively on market competition alone;  markets can and do fail when proper regulation is lacking.   A good example is the ACA's provision banning insurance companies  from denying coverage of preexisting conditions.   This is a key consumer protection that the free market demonstrated  time and again that it would not produce on its own.   And that is where regulation and the antitrust laws come in to  protect consumer choice.   It is a per se violation of antitrust law for competing companies to  agree to divide markets or to fix prices.   The other sectors in the health care supply chain are already subject  to the antitrust laws, and it will be beneficial to the health care  marketplace, and to consumers, if the health insurance industry joins  them.   For these reasons, I believe the legislation before us does more good  than harm and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 372.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to take just a moment.   This is an excellent presentation. I think our constituents should be  aware, and our colleagues, of your enormous knowledge as the former  State insurance administrator in California, years of service to the  people of California, and we are grateful for that analysis because you  are right on the money, if you will, on the disaster or the questioning  that comes about through two points: the existing bill, and then now an  amendment which has been called meaningless that will be on the floor  on Thursday, meaning that this bill has been amended by those who want  to make it worse.   We sat in the Budget Committee on Thursday with Ranking Member  Yarmuth most of the day trying to debate these numbers. So I just want  to make points about wellness, about some of the criteria that maybe is  misrepresented as making the insurance product more expensive.   To the Republicans, 10, 20 years ago, the product you had may not  have been worth what you paid. In the product we have now, preexisting  condition, stay on your parents insurance until you  [[Page H2281]]  are 26, certain criteria that the insurance companies must have, by the  nature of the market, premiums go up to take in the idea that there are  ``better benefits.'' I would argue that those benefits should have been  there, but they are better benefits.   The other thing is that there was a formula which pushed millennials  into the market or into the pool of people and persons that will  purchase insurance.   Now, let me be very clear. I think we have not seen the end of the  story. I believe that 10 years, 15 years, the young population will buy  insurance. It is an educational curve. And so as they buy insurance,  they will create that cushion.   Now, let me make this other point. Premiums are raised under this  Republican bill, really raised, and then there are smoke and mirrors to  say, oh, at a certain point it will go down 10 percent. But it goes  down on the raised amount.   If you allow the Affordable Care Act to continue, we have a very  large piece of wellness. Talk to your doctors. It is working.    Individuals are coming in, taking advantage of the wellness check. So  they are not coming in with metastasized cancer, with thyroid  conditions. They are not coming in on a stretcher with strokes or a  heart attack because they are getting wellness care. When you get  wellness care, on the other side of the curve, premiums go down because  you get more well people.   I want to finish on this point of Medicaid that we were just  debating.   Over and over again, it doesn't seem like there was any understanding  that Medicaid is now part of people's insurance. And it is not a  situation where I have seen many of my constituents stand on the street  corner with a sign, saying, ``Give me Medicaid.'' You get Medicaid  either through the expanded Medicaid.   And for our colleagues, that means that you are in a State where your  insurance comes through expanded Medicaid; or you are a sick and  elderly person in a nursing home or a disabled person; or you are  blind; or you are a pregnant woman; or you are a mother with children;  or you are on the children's health insurance program, which I was here  in 1997 when this miraculous bill came forward and we established the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which is a Medicaid-based program  that gives millions of children insurance.   But under this bill, all of that will be capped. It will be per  capita. So the $880 billion is being cut, my fellow Americans, ladies  and gentleman, from your insurance.   Then, finally, this bill could not be more cruel. Besides the ailing  that are in nursing homes--and I do want to tell one story of an  individual who got into the nursing home, Mr. Speaker, because they  didn't have insurance to take their medicine, and it resulted in heart  attack and stroke. They are not an old person, but they are totally  disabled, and they are in the nursing home on Medicaid now.   But in the Budget Committee, two amendments came up that I was just  stunned. You worked very hard on the opioid legislation. Some of it  came out of my committee, Judiciary Committee. Many Members have worked  hard on this.   They had an amendment saying no able-bodied man or person should get  Medicaid. I don't know what that definition is. Are you an addicted  young person, wholly addicted on opioids, that needs medical treatment?  Are you an able-bodied person because you have all of your faculties  and limbs but you are sick and addicted?   And then, don't incentivize Medicaid. I am trying to find out what  that means because all of my hospitals--and I think one of the things  the Affordable Care Act has done is to question costs and to work hard  to bring costs down in hospital care and to have an accountability  assessment on that.   But to finish, I have not heard my rural hospitals, I have not heard  my public hospitals, I have not heard the Texas Medical Center talk  about people being incentivized to get Medicaid. They are sick and they  come in for whatever they have.   The last point is someone gave an example that they were able to have  a transplant because they were under the Affordable Care Act with  expanded Medicaid.   So I want to thank the gentleman for raising these very important  points, but it baffles me that there is such a skewing of a very  successful legislation, very difficult. It was a very difficult piece  of legislation. It took years, the Affordable Care Act, and it is doing  what it is supposed to do.   As we have heard before, you can get more insurance companies. We  have to do something with the premiums, and that is fixing or  improving. But that is not what we are doing here. We are literally  cutting people off of insurance.   I will give you the number that I keep using: 2026, 52 million  Americans will be uninsured, and that will be our constituents all over  the Nation. That is because of the underlying bill, this bill that is  coming up now--which there are those who want it to be even worse. I  just heard a gentleman say he wants to take away all the mandates. It  will be worse on the American people, and I don't want to make America  sick again.
