 Mr. President, President Ronald Reagan once said:         Freedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the       bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on       for them to do the same.    In every generation since the country's founding, brave men and women  have stepped forward to defend our great country. Each one of them  joined knowing that they might be called upon to sacrifice everything,  even their lives. In our history, more than 1 million Americans have  paid that last full measure of devotion. It is only right that we  return the honor.   The tradition of Memorial Day goes back to the 1860s. It was  originally called Decoration Day. Families of the fallen would decorate  the graves of their loved ones. In 1888, Congress recognized this  tradition and made it a holiday in the District of Columbia. Congress  made it a national holiday in 1968.   For Gold Star families, every day is Memorial Day. Alabama is home to  more than 6,000 Gold Star family members. These include children who  were forced to grow up without knowing their parents, spouses who had  ``happily ever after'' cut short, moms and dads who hugged their  children goodbye for the very last time, families with an empty seat at  their dinner table.   As we honor their loved ones, we also ought to honor Gold Star  families. Today, I would like to do just that. I would like to  recognize three of Alabama's fallen heroes and their families,   First, I would like to recognize SGT Ricky Jones of Plantersville,  AL. The former star running back of Dallas County High School--also  known as MoJoe--is remembered for being a ``giving person'' who was  always there for his family and for his community. Sergeant Jones was  known to consistently attend football games to support younger players  who aspired to be just like him.   His family always knew they could count on him. After his mother  fractured her hip, Sergeant Jones took leave to come home and help with  her recovery. His sister Jasmine recalls him standing at the door of  her bedroom to tell her goodbye when the time  [[Page S1660]]  came for him to return to Afghanistan. She didn't know this would be  the last time she would see him. He was killed on Father's Day of 2009,  leaving behind a wife and four children.   Because of the impact he left on his community, Dallas County  established June 27 as ``Ricky DeWayne `MoJoe' Jones Day.'' Dallas  County High School also retired his No. 3 jersey as a tribute to  someone who was a hero to so many on and off the field.   Second, I would also like to recognize SGT Jason Stegall of  Trussville, AL. From the age of 10, he knew he wanted to make a  difference by joining our military. Even with injuries and several  near-death experiences, this desire to serve never wavered. Sergeant  Stegall's courage saved countless American lives. On one occasion, he  helped stop two suicide bombers from carrying out an attack on a U.S.  military base in Iraq. Another time, he led his men away from an  ambush, despite being shot just beneath his heart.   Sergeant Stegall earned numerous awards for his heroism, including a  Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.   His wife Ashley said his plan was to stay in the service for a long  time because he loved every minute of being in the military. But this  plan was cut short. At age 31, Sergeant Stegall passed away from a  mission-related illness while serving on Active Duty. Ashley was left  to cope with the loss of her teenage sweetheart and having to raise  three sons alone, including a 10-month-old named Landon. Ashley keeps  Sergeant Stegall's memory alive by reminding her sons about his  sacrifice and his belief in our great country of America.   Sergeant Stegall is honored at the Trussville Veterans Memorial in  Alabama.   Finally, I want to honor the memory of SGT Ervin Hullett of Lowndes  County, AL. On Christmas Day in 1952, Sergeant Hullett's brother Arthur  received the news that his 22-year-old brother had been killed in  Korea.   Both brothers had lived and suffered under segregation and  discrimination because of their race. Yet both loved this country and  were proud to wear the uniform. Both brothers rose to the rank of  sergeant. Sergeant Arthur Hullett to this day says that he has no  regrets about his military service. He also says he is confident that  his brother would say the very same thing.   Alabama is deeply grateful for their strong belief that America is  worth fighting for and even worth dying for. We will not forget their  unwavering devotion to serving the American dream for all of our future  generations.   SGT Ervin Hullett's name is etched forever into the wall of the  Korean war monument here in Washington, DC.   The Bible says: Greater love has no man that he would lay down his  life for a friend.   We may never have met Sergeant Jones or Sergeant Stegall or Sergeant  Hullett or any of the other fallen heroes, but their sacrifice is an  example to all.   As we look toward Memorial Day, I hope we will remember this is not  just another long weekend; it is a time to reflect on the sacrifices  made by all of our courageous heroes who didn't want freedom to die on  their watch. May we live to ensure their efforts aren't in vain.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Again,  for the fourth or fifth time, I am fighting against taxpayer-funded  abortions--funding from taxpayers that was never, ever approved by this  Congress.   By the way, poll after poll shows that Americans agree with exactly  what I am doing. The American people do not support taxpayer-funded  abortions. Period.   Democrats have had a few retired Secretaries, in the last few weeks,  agree with them; but other retired military leaders and thousands of  servicemembers and veterans just happen to agree with me, just like the  majority of Americans. In fact, earlier today, a letter representing  more than 3,000 servicemembers and veterans was sent in full support of  my hold. Those servicemembers and veterans said:         This policy is not just illegal, it shamefully politicizes       the military, circumvents the authority of Congress, and       exceeds the authority of the Department of Defense.    They sent that letter to Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell. I would  encourage them to please read it.   Also, earlier today, retired Lt. Gen. William Boykin and retired Lt.  Gen. James Carafano penned an op-ed condemning the Pentagon's policies.  They said:         The Pentagon's new abortion policy has everything to do       with activist politics and nothing to do with Congress's       obligation to raise and maintain armed forces to provide for       the common defense.    So I object, and I will continue to object.   I will end with one comment from the retired military leaders' op-ed:         America is a global power with global interests and       responsibilities. We can't afford a  [[Page S1667]]       military distracted by politics. The quickest way to make       this right is for Secretary Austin to immediately rescind his       radical abortion policy.    Because of this, I object.    Mr. President, I rise to object. I continue hearing  about this word ``readiness'' from my colleagues.   We have had a law in place for nearly 40 years. The law provides  taxpayer-funded abortion in case of rape, incest, or threat to the life  of the mother. Nobody, in 40 years--nobody--on either side of the aisle  has complained about this. This was a bipartisan consensus 40 years  ago.   The law was not affected by the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision  did not apply to Federal military installations.   On July 8, 2022, just 2 weeks after the Supreme Court ruling, the  Biden administration said they needed to expand abortion to counteract  the Dobbs decision. By memo, they said the VA would pay for abortion  travel and time off. By memo, they said HHS would pay for late-term  abortions. By memo, they covered all Federal workers, and they acted to  expand abortion at the Pentagon.   The Pentagon is now giving servicemembers and their dependents  reimbursements for travel and additional paid time off for elective  abortions.   We are not talking about cases of rape, incest, or threat to the  health of the mother. Despite what some of my colleagues have said, we  are talking about elective abortions. Despite what some of my  colleagues have said, that is what this is all about.   Ordinary servicemembers get 30 days off a year--30 days off. Under  this policy, servicemembers who get abortions would get 30 days off  plus an additional 3 weeks. Servicemembers who get abortions get paid  more time off than servicemembers who do not get abortions.   The Pentagon is spending money without the consent of Congress. This  money was never authorized. It was never appropriated. Nobody voted for  [[Page S1669]]  this. Even my friend from Connecticut didn't vote for this policy. The  Democrats' strongest abortion supporters never voted for this. Nobody  voted for this, and now Senators are down here defending this.   They are outsourcing the work of the U.S. Senate. Follow the law or  change the law in this building.   That is the reason I object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Preston  McGee, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges until May  17, 2023.
