 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution  before us here.   Last year, a draft Supreme Court opinion was leaked to the media in  one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the Nation's highest court. It  reestablished the authority of States to prohibit the killing of unborn  children, sending the Democratic Party and other leftwing extremists  off the deep end.   The liberal brush fire that ignited after the opinion was leaked  wasn't contained to just Washington. Pregnancy centers and pro-life  organizations across the country soon became the target of their rage.                                time  1300    The chairman said it very well in his opening comments when he cited  the situation in Madison, Wisconsin: ``If abortions aren't safe then  you aren't either.'' That is what it says right here.   Following the attack, a radical pro-abortion group known as Jane's  Revenge took credit, proudly proclaiming ``this was only a warning''  and ``next time the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive.''   Leftwing extremists have shown us time and time again--first, during  the summer of 2020 when they burned American businesses to the ground  and then by firebombing pregnancy centers in 2022--that they will  resort to violence and destruction when they do not get their way.   Unfortunately, there has been very little accountability for the  leaked draft opinion.   This resolution makes it clear that violence needs to stop.
