 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a special guest who  is here with us in the gallery today, Jesse Burleson, the head coach of  the Hardin-Simmons University Cowboys football program, located in the  heart of the big country, Abilene, Texas.   Coach is joined today by his wife, Lois, and his daughters, Lainey  and Marisa.   Under Coach Burleson's leadership, the Cowboys have enjoyed  unprecedented success, going 36 and 4 in the past four seasons, making  four consecutive playoff appearances, and graduating 14 All-Americans  and two Rimington Trophy winners.   Coach stresses the importance of hard work, discipline, and the  necessity of making sacrifices to achieve goals. The most important  thing that these Cowboys will learn while they are playing football at  Hardin-Simmons is that God loves them, that He has a plan for them, and  that if they follow Him, there is nothing they cannot overcome or  achieve in this world.   Thank you, Coach Burleson. Hooyah, Cowboys. Go west Texas.                            ____________________
