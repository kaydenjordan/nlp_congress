 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate and  2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes expected no earlier than  6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  with last votes no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A  complete list of the suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   In addition, we will consider bills rejecting hate toward the Asian- American and Pacific Islander community, including S. 937, the Senate- passed COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which addresses the dramatic increase  in hate crimes targeting the AAPI community since the start of the  pandemic.   H. Res. 275, a resolution condemning the horrific shootings in  Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021, and reaffirming the House of  Representatives' commitment to combatting hate, bigotry, and violence  against the AAPI community.                                time  1115    We will also consider H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug  Exclusivity Act, which closes the loophole that blocks pharmaceutical  competition and prevents innovative treatments for opioid use disorder  from coming to market, and would help millions of Americans suffering  from opioid addiction.   Next week, the House will also consider the Emergency Security  Supplemental to Respond to January 6th Appropriations Act, 2021, which  addresses enhanced security needs for the Capitol complex; and House  Resolution 3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6  Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act, which establishes a  commission to investigate the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6.   This is bipartisan legislation. I want to thank Chairman Thompson and  Ranking Member Katko for their leadership in announcing this bill, and  I hope that it will have broad bipartisan support next week.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for the  question and for acknowledging the extraordinary success of the Biden- Harris administration in putting millions of shots in arms at a  historic pace.  [[Page H2344]]         Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, that success that the gentleman talked  about was fueled by this Congress last year and this year and by a  science-based investment approach that the American Rescue Plan  offered. As evidenced by this guidance, we are building back.   But I want to call particular attention to the ``Dear Colleague''  letter that Dr. Monahan sent out to everyone on the Capitol complex  campus. It says: ``The present mask requirement and other guidelines  remain unchanged until all Members and floor staff are fully  vaccinated.''    Will the gentleman yield?    The centerpiece of this strategy that the gentleman just  acknowledged is vaccinations.   It is important that we continue to get as many Members as we can  vaccinated. That is the strategy that Dr. Monahan, Rear Admiral  Monahan, a distinguished physician, the strategy that he has laid out.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, the cornerstone of the strategy is  vaccinations. What the gentleman is asking is an important question.  What the majority is saying is, let's follow the guidance of the Office  of the Attending Physician.   We have no interest in knowing individually what Members and what  staff members are vaccinated. Our interest is in governing this House  and the operations of this body, and we trust that Dr. Monahan will  work with both parties and both sides of the aisle and will give us a  report when this House is fully vaccinated. That becomes our guidance.    Will the gentleman yield? We will talk about the  Constitution.    I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia yielding once  again. I will try to be as clear as I possibly can.   We will follow the guidance of the Office of the Attending Physician,  a decorated rear admiral, who is hoping, with the Sergeant at Arms, to  govern the Capitol complex.   As the CDC guidelines mention--and I am sure my colleague has read  the full CDC guidance, which specifically says government buildings and  local governments and State governments may make separate----    The gentleman knows I am happy to talk about HIPAA and  your role with it.    What I would say is, the CDC guidelines, as my colleague  from Georgia understands, specifically mentions workplaces can set  their own guidelines. We are following workplace guidance given by the  Office of the Attending Physician and the Sergeant at Arms. Those are  the processes that govern this body, whether Democrats are in control  or Republicans are in control. We should be guided by public health  guidance. That is exactly what we are doing here.    And I appreciate the question. Because as the gentleman  knows, we are a co-equal branch of government here in the Capitol. So I  appreciate his love of the executive branch of government; I really do.  However, we are governed by different rules. As a co-equal branch of  government, we should be.    Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H2345]]         I appreciate the question, and this is such a timely and  important topic that the country needs to address. I am incredibly  pleased with the bipartisan success that the negotiations have led to,  to date.   As the gentleman knows, those conversations continue to be ongoing,  but the majority believes that those conversations are progressing in a  way that is hopeful toward addressing this issue.   I think both sides realize, and I hope the minority realizes, the  importance of making changes to protect our communities. I know the  gentleman is a former mayor, as I am as well. So we have dealt with a  lot of these issues at the local level.   So what I would say is, Senator Scott, Congressman Stauber, and  Congresswoman Karen Bass have been engaged in this discussion. We want  to give them the latitude and the flexibility to continue those  discussions. I wouldn't agree with the characterization that the  gentleman from Georgia made about where the negotiations are, but I can  tell you that we are committed to seeing this done. We are committing  to getting this done and putting a bill on the floor that will have  strong bipartisan support.    As the gentleman knows, there was a lengthy Special  Order hour led by our colleague from Florida, former police chief  herself, talking about the importance of these issues, the importance  of honoring heroes, the importance of honoring people who put  themselves in harm's way each and every day and are behaving well.   What I would ask the gentleman from Georgia is, in that similar vein,  honoring police week, honoring those folks who helped us, who looked  out for us January 6, I hope the gentleman will encourage the minority  leader to meet with Officer Fanone from the Metropolitan Police  Department, who has requested a meeting with the minority leader to  talk about the events of January 6 and to talk about his experiences,  which were so impactful as he shared them on national television and as  he talked about the role that he played and the role that his  colleagues played in protecting this temple of democracy.   I hope that the minority leader has the time to meet with Officer  Fanone. I signed a letter to the minority leader from my colleagues  encouraging him to do so, and I hope that the gentleman from Georgia  reiterates the importance to meet with law enforcement heroes.                                time  1130     Will the gentleman yield?
