 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Kori Keller of Yellowstone County for her impact on the  Billings community, through her work at the Ramsey Keller Memorial.   Mrs. Keller, a Billings native, has dedicated her time to aiding  parents who have undergone the hardship of losing a child too young.  Mrs. Keller and her husband lost their precious daughter Ramsey soon  after she was born.   As a way of honoring their daughter, Kori and her husband founded the  Ramsey Keller Memorial. The Ramsey Keller Memorial is dedicated to  helping families who have lost children under the age of 1 year old.  The foundation raises money through both an annual race and a pink-tie  affair to pay for the funerals of Montana infants that have passed away  before their first birthday. Since then, Kori has been an advocate and  provided comfort for numerous parents going through the same hardships  she experienced.   I congratulate Kori on her growing role in the State of Montana. She  has been a constant source of hope and aid to families going through  similar hardships she has endured. I look forward to seeing the success  of the Ramsey Keller Memorial, as it continues to pour into Montana  family's lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
