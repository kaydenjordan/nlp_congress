 Mr. President, I commend my colleague for talking  about dark money. I was so curious this week when I saw--I think it  was--a New York Times article about the amount of dark money that came  from the Democratic side of the aisle this year far outpacing anything  that Republicans had spent. So I hope he is going to be successful in  dealing with some of his supporters on that side of the aisle.                          Crime and Border Security    Mr. President, what I want to focus on today is a meeting that I had  the opportunity to have last week with the Tennessee Association of  Chiefs of Police and yesterday with Tennessee sheriffs who had come up.   And one of the things that they talked about repeatedly in these  meetings is the recent crime spike. This is something on everybody's  mind, and for good reason. The majority of America's 40 most populous  cities saw an increase in homicides last year--40 most populous,  increase, homicides. More officers were intentionally killed on the job  than in any other year since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.   This is why morale is low.   Shoplifting is surging, and the thieves are getting creative. Instead  of stuffing merchandise in their clothing and smuggling it out the  door, gangs of thieves are executing smash-and-grab raids. We are also  seeing a spike in drug use. Overdose deaths were up 30 percent in 2020.   This is not trivial; it is not frivolous; it is not a laughing  matter; and it is something you cannot just overlook. It is life.   And I am sorry to say that Tennessee hasn't escaped this terrible  trend. In 2021, the homicide spike in Memphis set a new record. We lost  more than 3,000 Tennesseans to drug overdoses in 2020.   Law enforcement officers take this personally because they see how  quickly crime can destroy a community. Are they worried? Yes. Do they  have reason to be worried? Absolutely. As I said, morale is low.  Recruiting is hard.   But here is what struck me about my conversation with the police  chiefs and the sheriffs. They don't only consider the local effects.  They really see the big picture and the issue writ large for what it  truly is.   You won't be surprised to know that the lack of security along our  southern border came up more than once in these conversations. The  chiefs, the officers see the ripple effects of the Biden  administration's absolutely demoralizing failure to enforce the law.   On his first day in the White House, President Biden endorsed  lawlessness when he made it harder for Border Patrol to secure the  country. That stroke of a pen caused absolute chaos on our southern  border.   Border Patrol detained more than 1.7 million migrants between January  and September of 2021, and 1.1 million of those people were single  adults. They were not families.   Those 1.7 million were just the ones we were able to catch. We will  never know how many hundreds of thousands of ``got-aways'' made it into  the interior of the country, nor do we know what they were bringing in  with them that they were trying to evade the Border Patrol.   People and drugs are flowing across the border. Just last week, I  came here to the floor and told the story of the Border Patrol's $7  million week. Between January 21 and January 28, 1 week, they seized 47  pounds of meth, 3,800 pounds of marijuana, and almost 20 pounds of  cocaine--1 week.   Hopefully, those drug mules are behind bars, but, remember, those are  just the drug mules we caught. We do not know what the ``got-aways''  were bringing in with them or how many drug mules there were or how  many hundreds of women they were trafficking in for sex trafficking,  for human trafficking, for gangs, for labor crews. We don't know.   My Democratic colleagues continue to spin the border crisis as a  purely humanitarian issue, but what we are seeing along our southern  border is lawbreaking. In many cases, it is dangerous criminal  behavior. And the Biden administration is ignoring every bit of it.  Don't believe what you see. Don't believe the Border Patrol. Don't  believe the people who are down there running videos. Oh, no.  Everything is fine. Just listen to them.   But do you know who does not believe this? Our law enforcement  officers. They don't believe what this administration is saying because  they see something different. Every town is a border town, every State  is a border State because of that open southern border.   Our law enforcement officers can't ignore this. They can't ignore the  ripple effects because they live it every single day. They put on the  belt, the badge. They go out, and they do their job. They see how the  Democrats' desire to ignore lawless behavior when it benefits their  narrative has created a perfect storm of violence, of fear, and has  empowered criminals--not quite the message you want to send if you  believe in the rule of law.   Just yesterday, I had to send a letter to Health and Human Services  demanding to know why taxpayer dollars are funding fresh crack pipes  for drug addicts. That is right. A HHS spokesman has confirmed that the  Agency is pushing a grant program that would fund so-called smoking  kits with pipes for users to smoke crystal meth, crack cocaine, and  ``any illicit substances''--government-funded drug paraphernalia.  [[Page S590]]    Every once in a while, you think you have heard it all. Meanwhile,  the border sits wide open, crime is on the rise, and we are asking  police departments to do more with less.   A recent survey showed that between April 2020 and April 2021, police  force retirements were up 45 percent, and resignations were up 18  percent compared to the previous year. There is no coincidence there.   It is time for the administration to decide whose side they are on.  Are they on the side of the American people? Are they on the side of  law enforcement? Are they on the side of criminals and monsters who  really are responsible for this terrible crime spike?   I yield the floor.
