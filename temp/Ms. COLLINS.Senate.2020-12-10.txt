 Madam President, before I give my remarks, I want to  strongly associate myself with the comments that have been made this  evening by my colleagues from Texas and New Jersey--Senator Cornyn and  Senator Menendez--in support of a museum to celebrate and commemorate  the achievements of Latinos in our country.   I could not help but wonder, as I heard the comments of my colleague  from Utah, whether he also tried to block the museum celebrating and  telling the history of African Americans, that museum which is so  popular on the Mall. I wondered whether he tried to block also the  creation of the museum that tells the story of Native Americans.   I am convinced that if this bill, which has just been described by my  two colleagues, were brought to a vote on the Senate floor, it would  pass, not unanimously, that is clear, but with a very strong vote. And  it seems wrong that one Senator can block consideration of a bill that  would have overwhelming support by a majority of this body.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 959    So, Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and the Senator  from California, Mrs. Feinstein, to urge the Senate to take the  important step of passing our legislation to establish a long overdue  women's history museum in our Nation's Capital.   This is an issue that I have been working on since 2003, when I  introduced the first bill to tell the story of more than half of our  population, of the contributions of American women to our country in  every field: government, business, medicine, law, literature, sports,  entertainment, the arts, the military, the family.   Telling the history of American women matters, and a museum  recognizing our achievements and experiences has long been a goal of  many of the women and men who serve in this Chamber.   Following 18 months of study by an independent, bipartisan commission  established by Congress, the Commission unanimously concluded:  ``America needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to  showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the  country.'' I agree wholeheartedly with the Commission's unanimous  conclusion.   This year, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of suffrage for women  in this country and the decades-long fight for women's equality at the  ballot box. It is extraordinary to me that just 100 years ago, not  every woman in this country was allowed to vote in every State. That is  not that long ago. That story is one of the stories that needs to be  told.   Amid the celebrations of this historic year, I can think of no better  way to tell the story of American women to inspire those young girls  and young boys who come to Washington to tour all the wonderful museums  that are part of the Smithsonian than to create  [[Page S7416]]  a museum of American women's history so that they can better understand  the contributions of American women to the development of our Nation  and its proud history.   As with the legislation that would establish a museum celebrating and  commemorating the history of Latino and Latina Americans, this  legislation has passed the House by an overwhelming margin. Surely, we  ought to be able to take it up and pass it here too.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 599, S. 959. I ask  unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be withdrawn,  the Murkowski amendment at the desk be agreed to, and the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I think this is a sad moment. I had  hoped that we could proceed with both of these bills and pass them  before the end of this year.   Surely, in a year where we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of  women's suffrage, this is the time, this is the moment to finally pass  the legislation unanimously recommended by an independent commission to  establish an American women's history museum in our Nation's Capital. I  regret that that will not occur this evening, but we will not give up  the fight.   Thank you    Mr. President, when his official portrait that will hang  in the Senate Agriculture Committee hearing room was unveiled last  month, Senator Pat Roberts said the panel he led so well ``has a long  history of caring more about the issues than the ideology, more about  the people than the party.''   Those words perfectly describe Pat's philosophy of public service.  Throughout his four decades in Congress, this remarkable Kansan has  always stood for government that is responsible to the taxpayers and  responsive to the needs of the American people. He believes in a  legislative process that is open, transparent, and bipartisan.   Pat retires with an extraordinary record of accomplishment. He is the  first person in history to have served as chairman of the Agriculture  Committees in both the House and the Senate. He is Kansas' longest  serving Member of Congress. As the ultimate evidence of the trust the  people of his beloved State have in him, Pat has been on the ballot in  24 elections since 1980 and has won every time.   Pat and I were sworn in to the Senate on the same day in January of  1997. It has been an honor to serve alongside this national leader in  agriculture, health care, and defense. He is an advocate of a strong  education system, free and fair trade policies, increased investment in  science and technology, a focused foreign policy, and a strong  military.   This effective advocate for our Nation's family farms is a champion  for rural America. A recent example is the State Offices of Rural  Health Reauthorization Act he introduced and that I cosponsored. This  law helps equip rural communities with the resources they need to  strengthen their health care delivery systems and improve access to  high-quality services for individuals living in rural and underserved  areas.   From the U.S. Marine Corps to the U.S. Congress, Pat has served our  Nation with uncommon dedication. His wide-ranging accomplishments are  united by a commitment to move America forward and empower the American  people. I thank him for his service and his friendship and wish him,  Frankie, and their family well in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in her memoir titled ``Dare to Fly'',  Senator Martha McSally tells an especially inspiring story from her Air  Force days as the first American woman to fly in combat. This one  anecdote reveals the totality of her character.   In September 2005, a routine mission in the skies over Afghanistan  suddenly turned into an emergency when a team of U.S. Special Forces  were trapped in a canyon and under hostile fire. She raced to the scene  only to discover that virtually all of the high-tech electronics for  her A-10 Thunderbolt's navigation and weapons systems had failed.   She had a choice to make: Withdraw, wait for backup, and leave the  troops in jeopardy, or continue the attack with her skill,  determination, and courage replacing the malfunctioning technology. She  made the choice that those of us who have had the honor of working with  this great leader from Arizona have come to expect.   The full title of Senator McSally's memoir is ``Dare to Fly: Simple  Lessons in Never Giving Up.'' From 26 years in the U.S. Air Force,  achieving the rank of full colonel and becoming not only the first  woman to fly in combat but also the first to command a fighter  squadron, to two terms in the House of Representatives, to her service  in the Senate, she has done a lot in her remarkable life. Giving up is  one thing she has never done.   It has been a pleasure to work with Senator McSally on many issues,  from increasing preventive care and treatment for breast cancer to  promoting animal welfare. As a champion for the men and women who serve  our country in uniform, she led the way in creating a nationwide  Veterans Treatment Court Program to provide our heroes with treatment  they need to recover from the invisible wounds of war.   Senator McSally has been a strong advocate for Arizona seniors and a  dedicated and involved member of the Aging Committee, of which I serve  as chairman. Together, we worked to protect older adults from criminals  who sought to rob them of their hard-earned savings and introduced two  senior fraud bills: the Anti-Spoofing Penalties Modernization Act to  combat unwanted robocalls and the Stamp Out Elder Abuse Act to support  community efforts to prevent abuse, exploitation, and neglect.   Senator McSally's memoir contains another powerful story. When she  was just 12 years old, her father was stricken by illness and had not  long to live. He called his young daughter to his bedside and said this  to her: ``Make me proud.''   That is another mission this American hero has carried out fully on  behalf of the people of Arizona and of our Nation. It makes me proud to  have served with Senator Martha McSally, and I wish her all the best in  the years to come.                            ____________________
