 Mr.  Speaker, I rise to say I am embarrassed by the past month.      The online version has been corrected to read: (Mr. HARDER of  California asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HARDER of  California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say I am embarrassed by the  pastmonth.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     This is my first week in Congress without our government being shut  down. I came to Washington to help my community. It is a shame that the  benchmark for progress so far has been whether or not the government  has even been open. It is hard to lower the bar from there. We can't  let this happen again.   Alongside some of my freshman colleagues, I have cosponsored  legislation that says, even if the government shuts down, Congress will  still have the funding to pay our Federal workers.   And it goes further than that. If Congress fails to make a deal, we  should withhold pay from Members of Congress, we should stop using  taxpayer dollars for travel, and we should end bonuses for the  executive branch.   In other words, if the government shuts down, the people at fault  should be held accountable, not the workers. If families in my district  can't get their paychecks or if farmers can't get their USDA grants,  then elected officials need to feel the consequences.   Mr. Speaker, governing from one crisis to the next is an  embarrassment. I came here to do better. We have a chance to turn it  around right now.                            ____________________
