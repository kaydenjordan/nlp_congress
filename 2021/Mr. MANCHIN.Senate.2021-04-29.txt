 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment by  Senator Lee. His amendment would amend the Antiquities Act to prohibit  the President from reserving water when designating a national  monument.   The amendment states that any water rights associated with a national  monument may only be acquired under State law. The Lee amendment  overturns decades of Supreme Court precedent that when a President  designates a national monument under the Antiquities Act, the  designation reserves the right to use enough water to fulfill the  purpose of the monument.   But the water infrastructure bill is not the appropriate place for  this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
