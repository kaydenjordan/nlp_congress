 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman  Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur. I wish the whole country could be  here to watch how hard you have worked, not just tonight, but  throughout the year to bring this important legislation before us. It  would give them great hope and faith in the process, and I commend both  of you, your committee members, and your staff for the work that you  are doing here.   Madam Chair, I will be brief. My amendment would add $1 million to  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' aquatic nuisance control program. In  effect, it would double the annual funding to $2 million for the  important and critical research that is needed to combat some 1,500  terribly destructive invasive species in our lakes and waterways,  including six new invasive species of foreign zooplankton that were  just discovered in Lake Superior. I am not sure where it came from and  what kind of damage it will do.   A little quick history here: I am only going to take a couple of  minutes. My amendment to the 2014 water resources bill added fish and  other aquatic creatures to the official definition of invasive species,  a definition that had been previously reserved only to plants. So that  opened the door for us to have a way to combat these aquatic species.   And in so doing, the Congress gave the Army Corps the authority to do  the research to eradicate invasive species like Asian carp, zebra  mussels, and so many hundreds of others that are causing so much damage  to sport and commercial fishing, to shipping, navigation, and to harbor  maintenance.   The aquatic nuisance control program is supposed to be leading the  way with cutting-edge research, and it is doing a good job. But the  fact is, it is terribly underfunded, leaving little resources to  address the influx of the aquatic species.   As a result, the aquatic invasives like zebra mussels have infested  more than 130 lakes in my own State and thousands of lakes across the  country. To give you an idea of how fast these zebra mussels, for  example, spread, a female zebra mussel can produce a half a million  offspring each year.   And the simple truth is, the zebra mussels are just choking off all  kinds of snails and clam and other native fishes--even bird species. In  fact, they killed over 10,000 loons in Lake Erie alone because they ate  something that had zebra mussels in them, and the zebra mussels had a  botulism that killed 10,000 loons. That is how devastating these things  can be.                                time  2045    For outdoor recreation, our people are getting their feet cut and  getting all kinds of injuries by stepping on these zebra mussels.  Thousands of good jobs and slowdowns of our economy are caused,  delaying ships as they are painstakingly having to remove these zebra  mussels. They are just one of more than 1,500 invasive species.   So I urge my colleagues to approve this amendment so the Army Corps  can get to work cleaning up our lakes and waterways and putting an end  to the invasive species that are causing so much costly damage and  destruction to our lakes and waterways.   Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
