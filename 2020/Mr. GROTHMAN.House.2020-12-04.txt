 Mr. Speaker, I think, without question, one of the  parts of our history that has been underreported is that of the great  wars against communism, one of which was the Vietnam war.   One part of the Vietnam war that hasn't been discussed enough is that  of Air America. It was a CIA-run operation in which they would take  airlines, scrub off the markings related to the U.S. Air Force, and  then fly over Laos maybe to drop off supplies, maybe to do rescue  missions, both with regard to American troops and our Hmong allies.   I have the honor to introduce, together along with Congresswoman  Maloney, the bipartisan Air America Act, which will give those people  who risked their lives, and many of them have died, the same retirement  benefits as other people who fought for the military in the Vietnam  war.   But today I would just like to salute those veterans of Air America,  many of whom are still alive, some in my district, and hope that we act  quickly to give them the retirement benefits that they should have had  many years ago.                            ____________________
