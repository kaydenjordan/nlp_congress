 Mr. Speaker, in the last 10 years, our country's national  debt has grown from $10 trillion to nearly $22 trillion. This  trajectory is not sustainable. While there is no easy fix to this, the  first step is clear: stop adding to it.   President Trump is leading by example telling his Cabinet to  eliminate waste in their departments. He understands the fiscal cliff  we are standing on and is taking the right steps to get our spending  under control.   Now it is time for us to do our job. We cannot govern from crisis to  crisis. We need a budget that balances, and we need to get back to  regular order by passing all 12 appropriations bills.   Short-term spending bills are not the solution, and we cannot rely on  them anymore. With the national debt growing every day, we cannot  continue to kick the can down the road. We need to face this crisis  head-on.   Frankly, Americans deserve better. It is time we put in the work to  get it right and solve our budget crisis. Let's get to work.                            ____________________
