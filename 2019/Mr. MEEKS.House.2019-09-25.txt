 Madam Speaker, there has been a rapid and dramatic shift  in the legal treatment of cannabis, led by voters at the local and  State levels.   Nearly every American now lives in a State where cannabis has been  decriminalized to some extent and legal business activities permitted  to varying degrees, including in my home State of New York. But Federal  drug laws and bank regulations have not evolved to reflect this new  reality. We need clear, harmonized laws, which the SAFE Banking Act  provides.   Without passage of this bill, the legal cannabis industry is forced  to operate mostly in cash, depriving law enforcement of important  financial data and creating avoidable security risks for companies and  their employees.   With the passage of this bill, entrepreneurs, employees, and  financial institutions operating legally within the bounds of State and  local laws will no longer bear the burden of a punitive Tax Code, high  compliance hurdles, the lack of all basic financial services, and  significant security risks.   I am proud of the work Mr. Perlmutter has done on this bill, and I  compliment him.
