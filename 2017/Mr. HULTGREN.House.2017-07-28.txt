 Mr. Speaker, I rise today pleased to welcome Pastor  Scott Poling, who graciously delivered our opening prayer in the House  this morning.   For more than 20 years, Pastor Scott has faithfully led the  congregation at Harvest New Beginnings Church in Oswego, Illinois,  where my family and I attend.   His passion for evangelism and outreach is contagious. Those touched  by his ministry have seen firsthand his energy and passion for people  around the globe.   When he is not running ultra-marathons or playing tennis, he spends  time expanding the church's international ministry, and has equipped  African pastors with the leadership skills to carry God's truth into  their congregations.   Scott and his wife, Carla, are celebrating 26 years of life-giving  marriage, along with their five beautiful children.   Pastor Scott, we praise God for how your ministry has affected so  many, and our legislative work is blessed by your prayers over us  today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege today to rise to  recognize the 50th anniversary of the Sugar Grove Corn Boil, a  volunteer-run annual summer festival bringing residents together to  raise funds for local organizations doing good work in the community.  This year, the corn boil is focused on helping families and  organizations addressing autism.   In 1967, the first ever corn boil brought Sugar Grove community  members together for several hours in order to raise enough funds for  the town's first ever street lamp. As a result of the festival's  initial success, the community continued the tradition year after year.   The Sugar Grove Corn Boil has grown from a one-day event to a four- day event that brings around 35,000 attendees annually. Even though the  old steam engines that used to boil the corn are no longer in use, the  tradition of corn in the community ensures the grain remains a staple  of the festival.   While the festival has grown in size and prominence, the mission has  always stayed the same: to bring friends, family, and neighbors  together to raise money for local organizations and for town  improvement.   In addition, the corn boil celebrates Sugar Grove's Citizen of the  Year to remind the community of the difference one person can make.  Every dime donated to the Sugar Grove Corn Boil is given back to the  community, whether it is local groups, food banks, churches, or to meet  village needs.  [[Page H6561]]    I am pleased to share that this year's festival is dedicated to the  effort to address autism.   I commend the vital role the Sugar Grove Corn Boil organization and  the members play in my community. I ask that all my colleagues join in  acknowledging their great contribution to the individuals and families  of the 14th Congressional District.                            ____________________
