 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. Bob Corker,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: May 17, 2018.        * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             policy justification                      Government of Bahrain--Munitions         The Government of Bahrain has requested three thousand two       hundred (3,200) General Purpose (GP) and Penetrator Warhead       bomb bodies to include: one thousand five hundred (1,500) MK-      82 (500lbs) GP bomb bodies, six hundred (600) MK-83       (1,000lbs) GP bomb bodies, six hundred (600) MK-84 (2,000lbs)       GP  [[Page S2769]]       bomb bodies, and five hundred (500) BLU-109 (2,000lbs)       Penetrator Warhead bomb bodies. Also included are spares and       repair parts, support equipment, personnel training and       training equipment, shipping and logistics services,       publications and technical documentation, U.S. Government and       contractor technical support services, containers, munitions       components, test equipment, and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is       $45 million.        This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a major non-NATO ally which is an       important security partner in the region. The purchase of       these munitions will bolster the Royal Bahraini Air Force's       ability to conduct and sustain air operations with its F-16       combat aircraft. Our mutual defense interests anchor our       relationship and the Royal Bahraini Air Force plays a       significant role in Bahrain's defense.        The proposed sale will improve Bahrain's capability to meet       current and future security threats. Bahrain will use these       munitions as a deterrent to regional threats, strengthen its       homeland defense, and execute counter-terrorism operations.       The GP bomb bodies would also better equip Bahrain to operate       with U.S.-led and U.S.-supported coalition operations.       Bahrain will have no difficulty absorbing these munitions       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        There is no prime contractor planned for this effort; the       munitions will be provided by the U.S. Government out of       stock. There are no offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor       representatives to Bahrain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
