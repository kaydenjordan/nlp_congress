 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to  support a resolution that I am introducing to raise awareness of the  danger of meningitis B.   Nearly 1,000 Americans contract the meningitis disease each year, and  for more than 15 percent of the victims, it is, tragically, fatal. I  want to share the stories of two of those victims here today.   Emily Stillman was born on September 11, 1993. She used to joke that  she had the unluckiest birthday, but her mom, Alicia, was always quick  to reply: No; it was one of the luckiest days of our lives.   Emily was a 19-year-old sophomore at Kalamazoo College in Michigan  when she contracted meningitis B, and on January 31, 2013, Emily called  home complaining of a headache. She was hospitalized for just 36 hours,  and then she passed away.   Emily had a rare strain of meningitis for which there was no approved  vaccine yet in the United States. It was a shock, of course, to the  Stillman family that their young daughter, who was so vibrant and full  of life, was taken away at such a young age.   Then, in 2014, just a little later, the vaccine for meningitis B was  finally approved by the FDA and made available here in the United  States after I and several other of my colleagues had been advocating  for its approval. Yet, even today, fewer than 10 percent of young  people receive the meningitis B vaccine.   Emily's mother, Alicia, who is in the gallery with us today, founded  The Emily Stillman Foundation to help preserve her daughter's memory  and also advocate both for vaccination and organ donation.   Mr. Speaker, Patti Wukovits also lost her 17-year-old daughter  Kimberly in 2012. Patti is also joining us here in the House gallery  today.   Her daughter Kimberly Coffey was a high school senior on Long Island  and was just 17 years old when she contracted meningitis B back in  2012. Her parents, of course, were blindsided, thinking she had been  vaccinated. Within hours of being hospitalized, she went into cardiac  arrest and her organs began to fail. Her mother had to make that  agonizing decision to actually remove her from life support.   To honor Kimberly's memory, Patti founded The Kimberly Coffey  Foundation, with the mission of also educating others about the  importance of vaccination against meningitis B.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution that I am introducing today will  designate April 24 as National Meningitis Awareness Day to help educate  other parents and other young people about the dangers of meningitis  and the important need for vaccination.   Alicia Stillman and Patti Wukovits already know that alerting  families about a simple vaccine can prevent a tragedy. It is also time  for us, Mr. Speaker, to broaden the awareness so that they are not just  doing this on their own.                            ____________________
