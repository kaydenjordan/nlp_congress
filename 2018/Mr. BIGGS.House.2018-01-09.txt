 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stop the  Bleed training courses offered by the American College of Surgeons.   Every year, more than 180,000 Americans die from injuries sustained  in a myriad of ways. What many people may not know is that a large  number of these fatalities result not from instantaneous trauma but,  rather, from blood loss. From the moment a major injury occurs, the  clock is ticking. Uncontrolled bleeding can kill us in as little as 5  to 10 minutes.   Bleeding is a preventable cause of death, and that is why the Stop  the Bleed effort is such a valuable program. The American College of  Surgeons, working in partnership with many other organizations, has now  made this training easily available to Americans across this country.   I had the opportunity to participate in Stop the Bleed training  myself, and as part of my course, I learned how to properly apply  bandages and tourniquets. And do you know, what? It actually was kind  of fun.   We should do everything possible to ensure that more accidents don't  become tragedies. This effort must include integrating blood loss  prevention into our preparedness toolkit. Let's all be ready to come to  the aid of our fellow citizens if the need ever arises.   Madam Speaker, let's stop the bleed.                            ____________________
