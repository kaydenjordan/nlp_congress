 Madam Speaker, it has been 97 years since the equal rights  amendment was introduced in the 68th Congress and 48 years since the  ERA passed the House and Senate.   In those 48 years, I have had three daughters and one granddaughter.  Those four young women are brilliant, precocious, and accomplished,  with strong character, great morality, and true nobility. These women  are every bit the equal of any man I have ever met, yet our  Constitution does not recognize their equality nor prohibit  discrimination against them.   I am very proud that the Commonwealth of Virginia was the 38th State  to ratify the ERA. We must permanently remove the deadline for State  ratification and provide an essential legal remedy against gender  discrimination.   Does this sound like a political stunt: ``Women shall have equal  rights in the United States and every place subject to its  jurisdiction. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.''   No. These words belong in the United States Constitution. There is  nothing partisan about recognizing men and women have equal rights  under the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
