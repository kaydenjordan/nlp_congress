 Mr. Chair, during rollcall Vote Number 267 on H.R.  1640, I mistakenly recorded my vote as No when I should have voted Aye.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the new  Stanley Cup champions, the Las Vegas Golden Knights.   As many of our local fans know, the story of the Golden Knights  starts long before last night's victory. Six years ago, our Las Vegas  community was forever changed. On October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire  on the Route 91 concert, killing 60 and wounding hundreds more.   We were shaken to our core. We were resilient. We were united. We  were Vegas Strong.   Something that captured that spirit so clearly was when, just days  later, the Golden Knights stood shoulder to shoulder with the Las Vegas  community and honored the victims of this tragedy at their very first  home game, showing the true meaning of Vegas Strong.   With the whole city behind them, the Knights proceeded to win that  home opener and became the first expansion team in NHL history to start  their inaugural season with a 3-0 record.   The Golden Knights have always been more than just a sports team for  our community. Now, for the first time, they are world champions.    Our unlikely heroes--6 years ago, a hockey team just getting to know  their city--helped us heal in ways we never imagined.   I congratulate the Stanley Cup's Battle Born champs, the Las Vegas  Golden Knights.                            ____________________
