 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1116, the so-called Taking  Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act of 2017, or the  TAILOR Act.   This bill would weaken important safeguards established since the  financial crisis by requiring agencies on the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council--composed of the Federal Reserve  Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union  Administration, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency--to perform a biased analysis that favors  lessening the costs for industry over protecting consumers and the  economy.   It was 10 years ago today that Bear Stearns collapsed and the Federal  Reserve used taxpayer funding to arrange a shotgun wedding to J.P.  Morgan to avoid a catastrophe. We now know that much, much worse was to  come, when AIG, Lehman Brothers, the money market fund industry, and  hundreds of banks, including all of the largest ones, would need a  bailout. And this says nothing of the tremendous damage inflicted on  the millions of Americans whose homes were lost to foreclosure, the  millions who lost their jobs, and the trillions of dollars of wealth  that evaporated.   Congress took decisive action to ensure that we were never caught  unaware again when it passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act.   Although some claim that the measure that is now before us is aimed  at helping community banks, that is not the case. If enacted, this bill  would provide all financial institutions, including the largest banks,  with opportunities to challenge any and every regulation in court if  they felt it was not, so-called, uniquely tailored to their business  needs.   This bill would ignore the mandates and requirements of all other  laws passed by Congress and override decades of well-established  administrative law requirements by subjecting all new financial rules  to a vague, if not impossible, standard to meet. This includes an  undefined standard of appropriateness and a vague standard of the  ability to serve evolving and diverse customer needs; and, importantly,  the legislation includes no similar mandate that regulators consider  the benefits of Federal regulations, including the promotion of our  Nation's financial stability or the protection of our consumers.   Let us not forget that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is  the centerpiece of this Dodd-Frank reform. Prior to Dodd-Frank, our  consumers had nobody looking out for them. They were left and they were  taken advantage of, and so that is why we have Dodd-Frank reform.   But it seems that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle have  forgotten about all of this. This set of standards that they are  promoting not only applies to all future guidance and rulemaking, but  retroactively to all of the rulemakings in the past 7 years, which,  conveniently for the industry, covers all rules under the Dodd-Frank  Act.   But financial regulators already have to go through extensive look- back reviews to refine and improve rules that make sense. In fact,  under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or  EGRPRA, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were just  last week calling the gold standard for how regulators should review  regulations, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC are already required to  review their rules once every 10 years.   During this review, the regulators must identify whether regulations  are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome and consider how to  reduce regulatory burdens on insured depository institutions while, at  the same time, ensuring safety and soundness.   The Consumer Bureau engages in a similar look-back review 5 years  after a significant rule takes effect.   Make no mistake: I support tiered and tailored regulations for  community banks and credit unions, but week after week, we have been on  this House floor debating deregulatory gifts to Wall Street instead of  moving legislation that actually benefits community banks and credit  unions.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and I have  differences about Dodd-Frank, but something we worked hard to do in  crafting those critical reforms was to make sure that the law did not  impose a one-size-fits-all approach on every financial institution. So,  as you can see, the toughest rules focus on the largest and most  complex financial firms that, as we saw in the crisis, can destabilize  the financial system and inflict lasting damage to the economy and  constituents we serve.   We have monitored Dodd-Frank's implementation carefully and pushed  regulators to tailor rules to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens  while maintaining appropriate protections and safeguards for consumers,  investors, and taxpayers.   We must continue to take this type of targeted approach instead of  advancing measures like H.R. 1116, this bill  [[Page H1578]]  that we are talking about right now, which would force the regulators  to prioritize costs to Wall Street over benefits to consumers and the  economy and expose rulemaking to needless litigation because of the  nebulous standards in the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), a member of the  Financial Services Committee, ranking member of the Small Business  Committee, and a senior member, of course, of our Committee on  Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed at the deregulatory bills that are  produced by the opposite side of the aisle, and I keep wondering why  there are so many attempts to provide the banks and the financial  institutions, the largest banks in this country, opportunities to make  even more money.   According to an estimate from Goldman Sachs, the Republicans' tax  scam bill represents a giant windfall for Wall Street megabanks. So we  are here with another bill to deregulate, basically to talk about  tailoring. Let me just redefine this tailoring. It just means changing,  modifying, coming up with ways that the banks can basically complain  about their costs and their burdens. But my friends continue to  basically support them in whatever efforts they want in order to make  more money.   This report that I just referred to estimates that all of the largest  banks, eight of the largest banks, will receive $15 billion windfalls  on their 2018 tax bill. This includes $3.7 billion for Wells Fargo,  $3.5 billion for Bank of America, $3.3 billion for JPMorgan, $1.4  billion for Citigroup, and $1 billion for Goldman Sachs.   What more do they want? How much more can you give them? What is the  next deregulatory bill that you will come with on this floor?   It is interesting to note that the Financial Services Committee is  responsible for over 50 percent, or at least 50 percent, of all of the  bills coming through the Rules Committee that come to the floor, which  means that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle have spent an  inordinate amount of time coming up with legislation dealing with  deregulation of these big banks.   Now, we have a lot of things that we could be doing to protect  consumers, working people, and families in that committee. I wish we  would spend a lot more time on HUD. The homeless population in this  country is expanding. It is exploding all over the country. In New York  and California, in the Midwest--you name it--people are on the streets.   Do you think we have been able to have a hearing on homelessness in  this committee? No, because all of this time is spent on supporting the  biggest banks in America and deregulating in ways that will cause them  to be able to make more and more money.   How much more do they want? How much more do they need? How much time  is this Congress going to spend on trying to undo Dodd-Frank and kill  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?   I don't know the answers to these questions, Mr. Speaker. And I wish  they would answer me, but no, I know they are not going to. They are  simply going to come and talk about tailoring. Well, tailoring just  means changing, fixing in a way that will benefit the biggest banks.   Mr. Speaker, I will let them continue with their deregulatory  efforts.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am perplexed and somewhat amused by the statement that  the community banks are just withering on the vine.   Well, let me just talk about what is happening in the banking  community. Dodd-Frank is not hampering the banking sector at all. In  2016, the industry made record profits of $171 billion, and community  banks are outperforming their larger peers. At the end of 2016, lending  was up 8.3 percent for community banks and 4.8 percent for larger  banks. Credit unions are expanding, and they have increased their  membership by more than 16 million since 2010, an increase of 18  percent.    We oftentimes talk about what we are doing to the community banks.  But we always--you, rather, always have a way of making sure that big  banks are attached to this deregulation that you say you want to do for  community banks. All you have to do is amend this bill and make it  apply only to community banks.   Would the gentleman who is talking about what the ranking member  should understand and should be thinking about be willing to amend the  bill so that it only applies to community banks?   That is rhetorical, and I won't ask for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was just reviewing this bill somewhat and it has come  to my attention that this so-called tailoring, which really means  modifying, changing, doing something different, is for each individual  bank.   So each individual bank could say: We do things this way, so we want  a rule that is tailored especially for us.   Another bank could say: We do things another way, and we want some  separate rules just for us.   And on and on for every bank.   Is this what this is all about? Is this what this so-called tailoring  is about? This tailoring, which is modifying,  [[Page H1581]]  changing, basically deregulating in the interest of the big banks to  make sure they can reduce their costs and get rid of what they would  call their burdens?   Are you really talking about having our regulators look at each bank  and say: You do business a little bit different, so we are going to  change the rules just to fit your bank?   Well, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't seem to me as if this is plausible.  This does not make good sense. I don't understand why my friends on the  opposite side of the aisle, in their deregulatory efforts, would even  try this one. This one doesn't work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that my colleague on the opposite side  of the aisle, Congressman Lucas, enjoys engaging in these discussions  also. I watched very closely his countenance, and I see that he is  enjoining it even more than I ever dreamed he would. So let us continue  with this very lively debate where we can at least lift the spirits of  each other as we go through our daily work.   Having said that, the chairman likes to say that we lose a community  bank a day. However, last year, only eight banks failed.                                time  1645    The other 230 banks merged with others, and I would like the chairman  to even acknowledge that long before Dodd-Frank, we were losing a bank  a day, and that trend had been going on for 30 years. So I do not wish  us to think that something new and extraordinary is happening, that  somehow we have come to a point in time in the banking world where  banks are being lost on a daily basis in a way that they have not been  lost before.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing my colleagues talk about one size does  not fit all and they keep trying to make a case for the community  banks, but they always tie the community banks to these deregulatory  efforts so that the big banks can benefit from it.   When I take a look at the Dodd-Frank requirements and how they target  the largest banks, let's take a look at those banks that are less than  $10 billion in assets. They don't have to comply with all of these  regulations.   If they are a little bit bigger, they are between $10 billion and $50  billion, they have to comply with just a few more, but not as many as  the large banks. If they are $50 billion to $250 billion, yes, we have  a few more requirements for them. And then the big boys, the big banks,  yes, we have more oversight and more requirements.   Do you know why? Because they put this entire economy at risk if they  fail.   When we talk about doing all of the stress-testing, we are stress- testing on these banks because we know that, in the event of an  economic downfall, if they don't have the capital, if they don't have  the kinds of things that would keep them safe, they could trigger  another recession.   So stop saying that one size does not fit all and trying to make  people believe that somehow we are requiring the same thing of the  small community bank as we are requiring of the big bank. It is  absolutely not true.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time  I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Members, and to my colleagues on the opposite side of  the aisle, I am going to take a couple of minutes to bore you. I am  going to bore you with all of the groups who are opposed to your  legislation.   I heard one of your Members say that you have tremendous support. I  didn't hear where that support is coming from, but I do believe that  probably the biggest banks in America are supporting your legislation.  So please allow me to share with you who is opposing your legislation.   Allied Progress; the American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees; Americans for Financial Reform; the Arkansans  Against Abusive Payday Lending; Center for American Progress; Center  for Economic Integrity; Center for Justice and Democracy; Center for  Responsible Lending; Consumer Action; Consumer Federation of America;  Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety; Consumers Union; Demos; the  Florida Alliance for Consumer Protection; Indivisible; Interfaith  Center on Corporate Responsibility; Jacksonville Area Legal Aid  Incorporated; the Kentucky Equal Justice Center; the NAACP; the  National Association of Consumer Advocates; the National Association of  Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys; the National Center for Law and Economic  Justice; the National Coalition for the Homeless; the National Consumer  Law Center, on behalf of its low-income clients; the National Consumers  League; the National Fair Housing Alliance; the National Urban League;  the People's Action Institute; PolicyLink; Progressive Congress Action  Fund; Prosperity Now; Public Citizen; Public Justice Center;  Reinvestment Partners; Statewide Poverty Action Network; Tennessee  Citizen Action; U.S. PIRG; West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy;  the Woodstock Institute; and the World Privacy Forum.   If you have time, I would like you to share with me who is supporting  your legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I am prepared to close, so I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the majority is continuing to move to roll back  important financial regulations at a furious pace. Week after week, the  majority pushes harmful bills through the House. This bill is just the  latest example.   In recent months, this deregulatory frenzy has included House passage  of bills that, among other things, allow payday lenders to evade State  interest cap rates, decrease operational risk capital requirements and  roll back enhanced prudential standards for the Nation's largest banks,  weaken consumer protections for mortgages, undermine efforts to combat  discriminatory and predatory lending, reduce consumer privacy  protections, and threaten the stability of our financial system and  economy.   Last week, Republicans pushed through H.R. 4607, another bill that is  designed to weaken rules considered inconvenient by the financial  services industry, despite the harm that could result for consumers and  the economy.   As we have discussed, the bill we are debating today, H.R. 1116,  would allow large financial institutions to challenge financial  regulations in court if they believe them not to be uniquely tailored  to their business needs. It includes a provision that would allow these  challenges for all of the financial regulations put in place following  the financial crisis, making all of the important Dodd-Frank reforms  targets.   Of course, the legislation is totally silent on the need for  regulators to consider the interest of consumers and to ensure the  stability of our economy as they conduct rulemakings.   Ultimately, this bill would serve to put consumers and the financial  system at risk by subjecting important regulations to endless  litigation. It is designed to block and bog down important rules that  were put in place following the financial crisis to protect consumers,  investors, and our economy.   I would simply urge Members to oppose H.R. 1116, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as this month is  Women's History Month, it is my honor to rise today to recognize my  distinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), as she  becomes the longest serving woman in the history of the United States  House of Representatives.   On March 18, 2018, Congresswoman Kaptur will have served in the House  for 35 years, or a total of 12,858 days.   While Congresswoman Kaptur earns a notable place in American history  for her length of service, her true accomplishment is the profound  impact that she has had on this Nation through her legislative work,  her leadership, her representation of the northern Ohio district, and  her steadfast commitment to addressing critically important issues.   I think about Congresswoman Kaptur every evening that I am in  Washington, D.C., because when I leave the Capitol, I drive past the  marvelous beautiful World War II national memorial, which would not  exist but for the tireless work of Congresswoman Kaptur.   After being approached by a constituent, Congresswoman Kaptur first  proposed legislation in 1987. She began a yearlong effort to have that  legislation enacted into law, and turned the World War II monument into  a reality.   Congresswoman Kaptur's commitment to that project symbolizes what her  colleagues know about her. Marcy Kaptur is one of the hardest working  Members of the United States Congress, and she is one of the most  dedicated advocates for the people and the values that she represents.   Congresswoman Kaptur is a community organizer and a serious public  policymaker. She serves on the House Appropriations Committee, where  she is an incredibly powerful voice for appropriate spending levels for  programs and projects important to working families across the country.   She serves as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies, where she has been  tremendously impactful on promoting U.S. energy independence and the  protection of the natural resources.   Congresswoman Kaptur previously served on the Committee on Banking,  Finance and Urban Affairs, which is now known as the Committee on  Financial Services.                                time  1915    As the current ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I  am grateful that Congresswoman Kaptur has not lost interest in  financial issues. In fact, she has remained extremely engaged on issues  pertaining to Wall Street. She has been a leader in responding to  issues that arose or were painfully identified during the financial  crisis.   Congresswoman Kaptur and I regularly speak about financial services  matters. She shares articles and materials with me about key  individuals on Wall Street. She finds and shares information with me on  individuals' and firms' involvement in creating financial products or  engaging in activities that might be harmful to consumers.   I am thankful to have the benefit of her thoughts on these matters.  Congresswoman Kaptur has the courage of her convictions even in the  face of fierce opposition. Since the 1990s, the Congresswoman has been  a proponent for the reestablishment of the Glass-Steagall barriers  between investment banking and traditional depository banks. Although  her legislation on this matter has been considered controversial,  Congresswoman Kaptur has stood by her convictions out of a sincere  desire for protecting working families and Main Street over the  interests of Wall Street.   Congresswoman Kaptur supports policies that are good for her district  without hesitation. For instance, she fought tirelessly to combat  threats to Lake Erie. Congresswoman Kaptur is a strong advocate in so  many areas like national security, energy independence, and support for  the Armed Forces. Her attention to important issues, her dedication,  her skills as a legislator, and her work ethic should serve as an  example for all public servants. I am proud and honored to call Marcy  Kaptur not only my colleague, but my friend.   So I would like to say congratulations to Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur  for taking her place in American history as the longest serving woman  in the House. I would like to say to the Congresswoman that I am not so  sure that I should have worked with others to sneak up on her tonight  and make this a surprise, and I know that, in doing that, she has been  sitting there thinking about working on and coming up with things that  should be said about Wall Street. But tonight we are talking about  Marcy Kaptur, we are not talking about Wall Street. We will talk about  that later on.   But let me just say that the gentlewoman has been a wonderful and  extremely acknowledgeable voice and someone who understands the  history, not only of Wall Street, but many of the players who have  played over the years who were responsible for some of the problems  that caused us to have the recession that we got involved in in 2008.   So I thank the gentlewoman for her caring about Main Street, and I  thank the gentlewoman for knowing and spending time on these financial  issues  [[Page H1596]]  despite the fact she has so many other things on her plate. Again, I  feel very honored to be her friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the dean of the Ohio  delegation.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure  to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Texas, Representative Louie Gohmert.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members will have 5 legislative days within which to revise  and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the  subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, prior to wrapping up  this session of friends who care so much about Marcy Kaptur, I yield to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) not to talk about Wall Street.    Mr. Speaker, there are some  wonderful moments in this institution. There are times when we are not  always pleased and we don't feel as if anything is getting done, but  then there are times like these when we have the opportunity to pay  tribute to and to recognize one of our Members who have made tremendous  contributions, someone who loves this institution and has worked hard  to ensure that we get the best out of it.   I am just pleased and proud that I have been a part of not only the  recognition that we have done today, both in the reception that was  held earlier for Congresswoman Kaptur, and for being able to be on this  floor this evening and spend this opportunity with my other colleagues  who helped us to understand the vast knowledge and contributions that  this Congresswoman has made to this institution and all of the advice  and mentoring that she has done for so many.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
