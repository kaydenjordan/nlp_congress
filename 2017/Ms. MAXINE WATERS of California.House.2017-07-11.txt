 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the  Democratic delegation of California, I am so very pleased to welcome  the newest member of the California delegation, Congressman Jimmy  Gomez.   Congressman Gomez will represent the people of the 34th Congressional  District.   Congressman Gomez was elected to the California State Assembly in  2012 and reelected in 2014, and most recently in 2016, with over 86  percent of the vote, to represent California's 51st assembly district.   In the assembly, Congressman Gomez was a national champion of paid  family leave. Congressman Gomez authored and passed legislation,  Assembly Bill 908, the Nation's most progressive expansion of paid  family leave, that President Obama held as a model for Congress.   Jimmy also authored legislation to address public health,  environmental justice, water conservation, and access to education.   We are all looking forward to Representative Gomez expanding and  continuing his work in the United States Congress. I hope Members will  all join me in welcoming him to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez).
