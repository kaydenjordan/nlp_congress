 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I feel that too many  on the left are comfortable with lies and half-truths. Let me tell you  one thing, Mr. Speaker: I am sick of it, my constituents are sick of  it, and the American people are sick of it.   My colleagues just said that President Trump instituted a Muslim ban.  If my colleagues had read executive order 13769, instead of their  liberal talking points, they would know that that is simply not true.  President Trump's ban impacted seven specific countries. My colleagues'  statements are patently false and prohibitively misleading.   The crisis at our southern border represents a serious risk to our  national security of the United States and the sanctity of the rule of  law.   Reports from law enforcement officers fighting to stem the  overwhelming tide of illegal immigration into our country emphasizes  the lack of resources and misapplication of funds by the Federal  Government. Yet today, we are being asked to vote on a bill that would  do nothing to fix the weaknesses at our border but instead would  misallocate resources away from our border security agents.   This little bill would spend $825 million to provide taxpayer-funded  legal assistance to individuals crossing our border because my  colleagues on the left believe the best way to fix any problem is just  to send in more lawyers.   This legislation would significantly hamper law enforcement's ability  to effectively screen potentially dangerous individuals who have been  flagged by other agencies for advanced screening due to their criminal  record or status as a person of interest for national security  purposes.   We should be empowering law enforcement, not reining in their  effectiveness. Screening passengers who enter our country is a normal  part of securing the U.S. ports of entry and is a uniform expectation  for all who want to enter the United States. Granting a lawyer to  anyone who warrants a secondary screening is like demanding a lawyer  every time your bag is checked going through TSA.   This bill does nothing to enhance our border security, and,  furthermore, it hampers their ability to carry out their mission.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R.  1573.    Madam Speaker, if Americans like what Democrats did for  Baltimore, then they will love what Democrats will do for the planet.   The Biden infrastructure bill and the stimulus bill before it shows  that Democrats are more interested in transforming our Nation's  definitions of words than they are our physical infrastructure of roads  and bridges. We need to cut government waste, not create more.   And now the left wants to drag the Green New Deal through America's  back door without any regard for the wishes of millions of Americans.  Make no mistake, this infrastructure proposal is a wolf in sheep's  clothing. It is a Socialist wish list disguised as a roads and bridges  initiative.   This is exactly what Democrats have been doing since the day I was  sworn in. They know that America is in desperate need of infrastructure  reform, and they know that Republicans and Americans nationwide would  vote for a commonsense infrastructure proposal, but have they proposed  such an initiative? Absolutely not.                                time  2015    They will pretend that this legislation deals with infrastructure,  and then they will stand on the steps of their multimillion-dollar  mansions and decry any votes against their Trojan horse of a bill.   Americans are fed up. Why aren't we passing legislation that does  what it claims to be doing? Why are my colleagues on the left so  excited to pretend critical race theory is the same as critically  needed roads?   Let's dispense between this false equivalency. Let's build bridges,  not just the physical but actual bipartisan bridges here in Congress.  Why aren't we working together on the pitifully few issues that we  still happen to agree on these days?   I am wondering. My constituents are wondering. America is wondering.
