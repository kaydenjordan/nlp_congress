 Mr. Speaker, today, on the very day Hunter Biden  ignored a subpoena from this body, we will vote to take the next  critical step in formalizing the House's impeachment inquiry into  President Biden.   For months, the White House and Hunter Biden have been stonewalling  our investigation trying to hide the truth, and this stonewalling is  what has caused us to be here today. Like Chairman Cole said yesterday,  it is deeply sad and not something any of us want to be doing on this  House floor, but it has become necessary.   Following today's floor vote on H. Res. 918, the committees on  Oversight and Accountability, Ways and Means, and Judiciary will have  greater legal position and subpoena power to fully investigate  allegations of influence peddling and wrongdoing by President Biden,  his family, and his associates.   The American people deserve transparency and accountability. They  deserve the truth, and that is exactly what they are going to get from  this Republican House.
