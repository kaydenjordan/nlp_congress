 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thornberry  and Chairman Smith for their leadership in bringing this bill to the  floor in such a bipartisan manner.   I am pleased the bill includes several provisions to support the  Space Force and prioritizes the hypersonic and ballistic missile  tracking space sensor.   While there is still much work to do, this bill takes important steps  forward to confront China with the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative.   It also includes almost $600 million above the President's budget for  science and technology and investments in critical emerging technology  areas.   These critical investments are what will enable us to confront  sophisticated threats that we face from China and Russia.   Importantly, this bill adheres to the budget agreement and fully  funds the President's budget request.   Now, more than ever, we must reject calls for blunt defense cuts from  partisans who are using the current crisis as an opportunity to push  their agenda.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Mac  Thornberry, for his years of service to the Armed Services Committee.  No one cares more about our men and women in uniform and has dedicated  more time and effort to making sure they have what they need.   Our committee was lucky to have him as chairman for 4 years and  ranking member for 2 years, and we wish him and his wife, Sally,  nothing but the best in the future.
