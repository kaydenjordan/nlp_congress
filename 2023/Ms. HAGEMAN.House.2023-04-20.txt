 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Nathan Leikip, a Wyomingite who bravely defended this country  and touched the hearts of all of those around him.   Upon graduation from Sheridan High School, Nathan enlisted in the  U.S. Navy, serving honorably for 4 years. Following the tragic attacks  on 9/11, compelled by his devotion to service and love of his Nation,  Nathan returned to Active Duty in the Army, completing multiple  deployments in Iraq.   During his combat deployments, Nathan was twice wounded from attacks  on his convoy and received two Purple Hearts and the Army Commendation  Medal with Combat V.   Following his military service, Nathan continued to serve others as a  sheriff's deputy in Bayfield, Colorado, for many years.   Tragically, Nathan took his own life after a long, hard-fought battle  with PTSD and other sustained injuries from his service. Nathan was a  child of God and a patriot who will not be forgotten.   His leadership, compassion, and desire to help others will be forever  remembered by his community and should serve as a model for all  Americans each and every day.   To Nathan's family, I offer my sincere prayers in this difficult time  of mourning, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in remembering  the life of Nathan Leikip, honoring his service to our Nation, and  standing with his family in these difficult times.                            ____________________
