 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would increase funding for the Tax  Counseling for the Elderly Program by $1 million.   For this amendment, we are not taking the $1 million from any other  account. Rather, there is a $2.4 billion account for taxpayer services,  and this simply adds to the carveout from that total for Tax Counseling  for the Elderly.                                time  2015    This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered last year that  passed this body by a voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment again this year.   The Tax Counseling for the Elderly program offers free tax help for  individuals who are aged 60 or older. Cooperative grant agreements are  entered into between the IRS and eligible organizations to provide tax  assistance to elderly taxpayers. These funds provided by the IRS are  used by organizations to reimburse volunteers for their out-of-pocket  expenses, including transportation, meals, and other expenses incurred  by them in providing tax counseling assistance at locations convenient  to the taxpayer.  [[Page H6533]]    This amendment will restore funding to this program at the level that  passed both the House last year and the Congress in the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2018.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment; I thank  the chairman for his support; and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would increase funding for the  IRS's identity theft and refund fraud casework by $500,000. For this  amendment, we are not taking the $500,000 from any account. Rather,  there is a $2.4 billion account for Taxpayer Services, and this simply  adds to the carveout from that total for the Taxpayer Advocate Services  identity theft and refund fraud casework.   This amendment will restore funding to this program at the level that  passed the Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018.   Last year, there were 597,000 tax returns with confirmed identity  theft, resulting in $6 billion in taxpayer refunds being affected.   Identity theft can be frustrating and confusing to victims. While  identity thieves steal information from sources outside the tax system,  the IRS is often the first to inform a victim that their identity has  been stolen. The IRS is working hard to resolve identity theft cases as  quickly as possible and has made considerable progress at closing  backlogs; however, more work remains.   Fighting identity theft is an ongoing battle, as identity thieves  continue to create new ways of stealing personal information and using  it for their gain. Identity theft cases are among the most complex  handled by the IRS. The IRS is continually reviewing processes and  policies to minimize instances of identity theft and to help those who  find themselves victimized.   We, as a Congress, should be giving the IRS the resources necessary  to close backlogs and help our constituents as expeditiously as  possible.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment; I thank  the chairman for his support; and I yield back the balance of my time.
