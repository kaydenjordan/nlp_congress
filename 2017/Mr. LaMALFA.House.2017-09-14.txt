 Mr. Speaker, a recent Federal audit found that the Obama  administration improperly used, via the Bureau of Reclamation, $84  million on California Governor Jerry Brown's pet project, the Delta  tunnels. In planning, this is a project that would transfer water from  northern California, where my district is, to southern California.   This comes after years of assurance that no tax dollars would be  spent on the Governor's controversial legacy project, nor was there  even an appropriation made by Congress to do so, and that is where the  problem is. It is the illegal use of Federal dollars in the planning of  this project.   Taxpayers ended up paying for a large portion of this project's  planning costs without their knowledge and, again, without Congress'  authorization, which is obviously unacceptable.   The Bureau of Reclamation needs to explain to Congress how and why  this happened, and the employees and the appointees who carried it out  must be held responsible.   More importantly, California needs to repay every penny to the  Federal Government and the taxpayers of the other 49 States for this  illegal use and improper use.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a small thing. Congress and the American  people need to know what is happening with this and not be lied to.                            ____________________
