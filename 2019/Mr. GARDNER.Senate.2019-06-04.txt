 Madam President, 75 years ago tomorrow, June 5, 1944,  General Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a speech to U.S. soldiers the day  before the invasion of Normandy.   In that speech, he said this:         Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary       Force!        You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward       which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the       world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving       people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave       Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring       about the destruction of the German war machine, the       elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of       Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.    He ended his comments by saying:         I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty       and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full       Victory!        Good luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty       God upon this great and noble undertaking.    It was an undertaking not just remarkable for its logistical effort  and massive supply planning but for what it meant to humanity: a  mobilization in the name of freedom to stand against evil and a massive  undertaking uncertain of outcome to fight oppression for a free world.   I hope every American will take some time this week to reflect on  that massive undertaking 75 years ago that ultimately led to the  liberation of Europe, the destruction of Adolf Hitler, and the end of  World War II and to reflect on the sacrifice and courage, the selfless  acts of bravery, and the stories of families who never saw a loved one  return.   The decision to move forward with the invasion was reached in late  1943. By May of 1944, nearly 3 million Allied troops were amassed in  southern England. Gathered along with the millions of soldiers was the  largest armada in world history, with over 4,000 ships from Canada, the  United States, and Great Britain. There were 11,000 airplanes that  participated in the invasion, pounding the shores and Nazi positions,  and delivering supplies and thousands of troops up and down the coast  of France.   The assault began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, with Allied  bombers attacking targets along the coast and inland. More than 24,000  American, British, and Canadian airborne assault troops and 1,200  aircraft followed the air bombardment. At 1:30 a.m., the 101st Airborne  Division began landing behind Utah Beach, and the 82nd Airborne  Division began landing at 2:30 a.m. The second phase on the coast began  at 5:30 a.m. when six Allied divisions and numerous small units began  landing on five beaches. In total, the Allies landed more than 160,000  troops at Normandy--73,000 American, along with 83,115 British and  Canadian forces--on Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches.   By the end of the first day, Allied casualties were estimated at  10,000 killed, wounded, and missing in action: 6,603 Americans, 2,700  British, and 946 Canadians. From D-Day through August 21, the Allies  landed more than 2 million men in northern France and  [[Page S3187]]  suffered more than 226,000 casualties, with nearly 73,000 killed or  missing. They paid the ultimate price to save the world from tyranny,  and their average age was 26 years old.   Etched in the pavement of the U.S. Armed Forces Memorial Garden in  Normandy, France, are the words: ``From the heart of our land flows the  blood of our youth, given to you in the name of freedom.'' Let us never  forget the sacrifice of the greatest treasure this Nation has and what  these men and women did for a free world and free people.   I yield the floor.
