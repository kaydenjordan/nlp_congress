Any Member may       demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted       in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment       in the nature of a substitute made in order as original text.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of       the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.

Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1181) to amend       title 38, United States Code, to clarify the conditions under       which certain persons may be treated as adjudicated mentally       incompetent for certain purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Veterans' Affairs; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H2095]]  from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my friend, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   Our veterans have paid a high price. Dispatched to foreign lands to  fight for our freedom, many returned injured, grief-stricken over lost  friends, and torn apart by the violence of war.   We owe them our time, our energy, our gratitude, and our protection.  That is why we are here on the floor today: to protect the  constitutional rights of our heroes and to make sure we are taking care  of them like we promised we would.   H.R. 1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, ensures that  government cannot strip our heroes of their constitutional rights  without due process. Under current law, if the VA determines that a  veteran needs a guardian or fiduciary to help manage their benefits,  then that veteran's name must be sent to the NICS database, prohibiting  them from purchasing a firearm.   The decision to strip any constitutional right from anyone, most  importantly our veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend  our Constitution, needs to be made with due process. The VA was never  designed to adjudicate the removal of constitutional rights. This  decision should be made by a judge or judicial authority.   Instead of stripping veterans of constitutional rights, our VA should  be focused on protecting veterans. That is exactly what the other two  bills under consideration do.   H.R. 1259 gives the Department of Veterans Affairs greater ability to  discipline employees for misconduct or poor performance.   We entrust our VA employees with the health and well-being of our  veterans. Most of these employees do a great job, working hard to make  sure our heroes are cared for; but, occasionally, a VA employee engages  in misconduct, behavior that can endanger the very lives of our  veterans.   These men and women sacrificed to serve our Nation. The least we can  do is enable them to receive the best care possible at the VA. That is  why we need H.R. 1259, to allow the VA, under an expedited process, to  fire or suspend or demote employees who are putting our veterans at  risk.   The legislation also allows the VA to recoup the money paid in  bonuses or relocation grants to employees convicted of a felony.   Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve the best. They deserve the best  employees. They deserve the best medical staff. That is what the third  bill under consideration, H.R. 1367, will achieve. This legislation  improves the VA's ability to recruit the best medical staff, offering  the agency direct hiring authority to fill key positions with critical  staffing needs.   It also creates a fellowship program to train up VA management for  the best performance. It is time to improve the personnel practices at  the Veterans Administration.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution on the floor today is vital for our  Nation's veterans. Their constitutional rights and their well-being  stand in the balance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Florida and I were in committee yesterday and heard  testimony from one of our colleagues that this bill, as it pertains to  veterans' gun rights, is not reactive. It does not go back to those  individuals who have been denied their due process rights, who have  been denied their Second Amendment rights.   This bill is prospective only. It will only affect those who in the  future have been denied those rights. And I think it is absolutely  important that we understand the Republican Party in the House of  Representatives is committed to make sure that those individuals who  have been denied their due process rights, their Second Amendment  rights in the past, we will find a solution. We will help those  individuals.   Right now, we are focused on making sure that others have the ability  to a fair, open hearing where they can present their side of the story  before they are denied their constitutional rights.   My friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Hastings) also talks about  the fact that H.R. 1259 will do more harm than good; that somehow  disciplining those who are delivering poor services to our veterans is  unfair to unions. The truth is that 35 percent of the VA's workforce is  made up of veterans.                                time  1300    But the fact is that veteran employees believe employees that are not  meeting acceptable standards for their fellow veterans should be  removed, period, regardless of their service while on Active Duty.   Are opponents of removing poor-performing employees and those whose  misconduct warrant removal saying that a veteran employee who cannot do  the job or is guilty of misconduct be kept on the job?   On the contrary, veterans know that the strictest accountability  standards apply to them during their military service, and millions of  hardworking Americans in the private sector do not enjoy anything close  to the protections enjoyed by Federal employees.   The only employees who need to be concerned with reasonable reform  that would be made by this legislation are those who aren't doing their  jobs on behalf of the veterans who they serve.  [[Page H2097]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend from Florida talked about the specificity that he used in  describing the conditions of these veterans, but that is not what the  rule says.   What the rule says, Mr. Speaker, is that if someone--if a veteran  needs a fiduciary, they will be denied the ability to own, possess,  purchase a firearm. It doesn't say if they are schizophrenic. It  doesn't say if they have PTSD. It doesn't say if they have depression,  and if they have PTSD or depression that is somehow linked to further  violent behavior. It doesn't say that.   What it says is, if you can't balance your bank account, you can't  have a gun to protect yourself. There is no relationship between those  two.   Now, if the gentleman from Florida would go to the Veterans  Administration and talk to them about the need to link that finding of  a fiduciary with future violent behavior, we may not be here today.   But so many people have been trapped in this overbroad rule that we  are going to make sure that those people that have a fiduciary and are  listed by the VA have a due process right to show that they are  nonviolent; that they don't have a propensity to commit a crime with a  weapon; that they are not a harm to themselves or to others.   And if the VA or an independent judicial officer finds that they are,  then yes, list them on the NICS report, but give them that due process  right. That is where the majority believes this rule created during the  Clinton administration and by the Veterans Administration falls.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Georgia  (Mr. Collins).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to draw your attention and the attention of my  colleague from Florida to a letter dated January 26, 2017, from the  chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. House of  Representatives, Representative Roe, and the chairman of the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, Chairman Isakson, to the President  in which they asked for various positions to be exempted from the  President's executive order concerning a hiring freeze.   The next day, January 27, the Acting Secretary issued a memorandum  under the authority of that Presidential memorandum, executive order,  granting the chairman's request and exempting various positions.   I would exceed my time limitations, Mr. Speaker, if I were to read  all of these. But let me assure you there are dozens and dozens of  positions at the Veterans Administration that have been exempted from  the President's hiring freeze. They include social worker, science lab  technician, practical nurse, nursing assistant, dietician,  nutritionist, occupational therapist, on and on and on. And the need  for the amendment that the gentleman presents is unnecessary.   I would also like to talk very briefly about the gentleman's argument  that somehow those at the Veterans Administration are being harmed, and  we are attacking a union in some way rather than trying to deal with  real situations and improving the quality of care at the VA.   I want to give a few examples of VA employees and just the time that  it took to remove people. A VA employee was a willing participant in an  armed robbery several years ago, and after a lengthy legal and  administrative battle where the employee was supported by the Public  Employees Union, the employee was reinstated in their previous position  without any discipline.   A VA nurse showed up to work intoxicated and participated in a  veteran's surgery while under the influence of alcohol. Although the  employee eventually resigned, to date, no other employees were  disciplined for allowing the employee to participate in the veteran's  surgery.   In 2013, a vocational rehab specialist out of the Central Alabama  Veterans Health Care System crashed a government car, and a passenger  ended up dying. He was later indicted for a DUI. The VA confirmed that  the employee was not removed from payroll until January of this year-- almost 4 years.   In 2014, a VA employee at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care  System took a veteran who was a recovering drug addict to a crack house  where he purchased illegal drugs for the veteran, as well as purchased  a prostitute for him, though the employee was still employed at the VA  well over a year later after the incident until they were finally able  to remove him.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand up now for our veterans.  They have performed their duty, and it is time for us to perform for  them.   Our duty is to take care of them. A ``yes'' vote restores their  Constitutional rights and improves their quality of care.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, vote ``yes''  on the underlying bill. I thank Chairman Roe and Representative  Wenstrup for bringing these bills before us.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 198 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       696) to prohibit any hiring freeze from affecting the       Department of Veterans Affairs. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived.  [[Page H2100]]       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 696.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
