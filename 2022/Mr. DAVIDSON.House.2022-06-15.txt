 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this bill. The Fed is not  meant to be a political weapon. With inflation above 8 percent and the  economy on the verge of a recession, this is one of the most  inopportune times in our Nation's history to suggest that we turn the  Fed into a political pawn.   Our Nation is suffering from too much government. Inflation is a  policy choice, and this delivers more government to an agency that is  supposed to be insulated from it.   We know the recipe. We need more freedom, less government, and sound  money. This thing distracts the Federal Reserve.   Inflation doesn't care about your race. The price of groceries, the  price of healthcare, education, rent, it doesn't care about your race  or your gender. We have to stop the politicization of our government  agencies as Democrats--really the radical left--stays committed to this  long march through our Nation's institutions to try to push an agenda  at odds with the American public. If this bill does anything, it  highlights that disconnect.    Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of our colleagues to oppose this bill.  [[Page H5571]]
