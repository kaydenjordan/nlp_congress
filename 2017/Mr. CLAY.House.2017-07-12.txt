 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  yielding.   I rise today as an original cosponsor of H.R. 2480, the Empowering  Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act, along with my  friend and distinguished colleague from Missouri, Congresswoman  Hartzler, and other colleagues.   This bipartisan act aims to provide local law enforcement with  additional tools to fight the heinous epidemic of sex trafficking by  expanding the authority of the vital Byrne Justice Assistance Grant act  to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for Federal funding,  specifically to develop and implement sex trafficking demand reduction  programs.   Our legislation would also add an additional provision for Byrne JAG  funding to allow State and local agencies more flexibility in  prioritizing precious resources to combat domestic sex trafficking. The  trafficking of mostly  [[Page H5492]]  young people for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a form of 21st  century slavery that is pervasive around the world, around this  country, and even in my home State of Missouri, as we heard earlier.   Sadly, because of my district's central location and easy access to  cross-country interstates and modes of transportation, the St. Louis  area is one of the top 20 markets for the horrific and inhuman crime.  Most of the victims are minor children, and some of them have been  kidnapped, beaten, and deceived by organized criminal enterprises who  are exploiting their bodies for profit.   But the sick and the inhuman practice could not continue without  steady demand, and reducing that market is exactly the purpose of this  important bill.   According to a recent report by the National Human Trafficking  Resource Center, this multibillion dollar slavery system victimizes  over 20 million young people worldwide, with at least 1\1/2\ million of  those victims in North America. Yet, last year in the United States,  only about 5,000 cases were actually reported, leaving tens of  thousands of other victims in the shadows with no protection, no help,  and no hope.   As reported in the February 23, 2016 edition of The Atlantic  magazine:         According to the United Nations' Office on Drugs and Crime,       sexual exploitation is the most commonly identified form of       forced labor worldwide. And as a whole, human trafficking is       a lucrative industry that, around the globe, rakes in at       least $150 billion.        But it is unclear whether the numbers are an accurate       representation of the problem, because many cases are not       reported, according to Monique Villa, the CEO of the Thomson       Reuters Foundation, which works to combat human trafficking.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, the article continues on:         The problem with human trafficking is that, of course, the       victims are silenced. We don't have good data about it. You       don't know how many slaves there are around the world.        Traffickers also play into the narrative by telling victims       who are exploited for sex that they are offenders,       threatening to call the police and report them for       prostitution if they push back. This makes sex trafficking       particularly challenging because victims might be fearful of       going to law enforcement and being charged with a crime.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.
