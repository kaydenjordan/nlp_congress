 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it is the 24th day that  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has intentionally discharged toxic  water from Lake Okeechobee in Florida's interior into the Treasure  Coast of Florida, which is my community.   Today, I have a group of warriors with me, the River Kidz. They are  here in Washington fighting to show that what is happening in our  community is not okay. It is not right, and it is not just.   The River Kidz are a group of young people from the Treasure Coast of  Florida whose health and community have been threatened. While many  kids across the country right now are gearing up to go to camp this  summer or spending their days on a boat or at a beach or fishing, our  kids are doing all that they can to avoid contact with our water  because every single day our water is being made more and more toxic.   As we speak, there is a toxic algae bloom over 100 miles in diameter  laden with cyanobacteria. It is being drained into Florida's east  coast, and, in fact, as we speak, satellite imagery shows that nearly  half of the entire lake of Lake Okeechobee is covered in algae. It is a  threat to the health of every single man, woman, and child who is  exposed to it.   The toxic algae blooms are also devastating to threatened species  like manatee who inhabit our waters but cannot escape from the water.  The billions of gallons of discharge that is evacuated from Lake  Okeechobee into the coastal estuary wipes out our entire estuary of  seagrass the way a wildfire wipes out a forest, leaving no habitat for  the rest of the sea life that is meant to exist there.   Mr. Speaker, you might be wondering: Why would anybody in Washington  care about this beyond to say for a few moments what a sad situation it  really is? Washington needs to care. Washington needs to care because  this is a situation that is created by the fact that Florida's water  system is functioning exactly the way that the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers designed the system to function.   In other words, this is happening on purpose. The Lake Okeechobee  Regulation Schedule, which is what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  uses to decide when and where water out of Lake Okeechobee will be  discharged into places it does not belong, is designed to ``share  adversity.''   Let me say that again. The Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule is  designed to share adversity.   Shared adversity means shared toxic water into a community that did  not share at all in the polluting of the source of the toxic water. Mr.  Speaker, let me explain this in a way that people here in Washington,  people here in the Capitol, can relate to.   It would be like if a Senator on the other half of this building  flushed their toilet over there, and instead of sending that sewage  into pipes that go underneath the street and into a water treatment  plant, the Corps of Engineers set up a system here where they had a  pipe that dumped the sewage onto the floor of the House of  Representatives. That is what shared adversity by the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers looks like.   In the case of my community, it is not just a pipe, though. It is  millions of gallons a minute that destroys our environment, destroys  our economy, destroys small businesses, and affects the health, as I  said already, of every single man, woman, and child who comes in  contact with the water, and it threatens our entire way of life.   The Treasure Coast of Florida can no longer be forced to share  adversity that they played no role in creating. The River Kidz, myself,  and the entire Treasure Coast of Florida demand that the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers stop immediately its willful pollution of our home  that is done on behalf of others.                            ____________________
