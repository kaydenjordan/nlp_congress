 Mr. President, I rise today as Black History Month  comes to a close to pay tribute to Black Americans who have played  pivotal roles in shaping American foreign policy and advancing national  security abroad. As leaders and change-makers who have served the  American people around the world, translating their own experiences  fighting for justice and freedom in the United States into their  passion for advancing democracy, human rights, and the rule of law  overseas.   From the first Black diplomat Ebenezer Bassett, who served as  Ambassador to Haiti from 1869 to 1877, to Ambassador Linda Thomas- Greenfield, who today serves as U.S. Representative to the United  Nations, Black Americans have been at the forefront of advancing U.S.  foreign policy.   Black Americans like Nobel Laureate Dr. Ralph Bunche, who mediated  the 1949 Armistice Agreement and assisted in the creation of the United  Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights; Ambassador Edward  Perkins, who was instrumental in the 1992 creation of the Thomas R.  Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship; and Peace Corps Director Aaron  Williams, who advanced the 2009 reopening of programs in Colombia,  Sierra Leone, and Indonesia, have broken down barriers and made our  world a better place.   And yet, while we have made great strides in increasing  representation throughout our diplomatic and development corps' ranks,  our work is clearly far from over. According to the U.S. Office of  Personnel Management's first-ever government-wide diversity, equity,  inclusion, and accessibility--DEIA--report, released earlier this  month, Black Americans comprise just 12 percent of the Senior Executive  Service--SES--workforce. And these  [[Page S525]]  findings are not limited to our domestic agencies. As I said at the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee's first-ever DEIA hearing convened  last year, between 2002 and 2021, the overall proportion of Black  employees at the State Department decreased from 17 percent to 15  percent. At the time of our hearing, there were only four career Black  Ambassadors serving abroad.   This failure to harness America's diverse talent pool is not only a  grave error, but it also places us at a significant disadvantage when  we seek to engage our allies and counter our adversaries on the world  stage.   That is why, as the highest ranking Latino in the U.S. Congress and  the first chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of Latino  descent, one of my top priorities has been to promote and expand  diversity in our domestic and international affairs agencies, including  in our most senior levels.   That is why I introduced diversity, equity, inclusion, and  accessibility--DEIA--provisions as part of last year's State Department  authorization bill, which passed as part of the National Defense  Authorization Act for FY2023. And, why it is so important to support  paid internship programs and fellowships in Congress, the State  Department, USAID, Peace Corps, and all of our international affairs  agencies. Because without these opportunities, many students of color  would be unable to afford to come work in Washington, DC.   Our diversity continues to be our Nation's greatest source of  strength, and we must act on this moral and strategic imperative to  cultivate a representative workforce, because, in every single world  crisis that the United States faces, a more diverse and more  representative U.S. diplomatic corps would be a valuable asset.   A few years ago, when I was traveling in China, the diplomat in  charge of democracy and human rights programs at our Embassy had  participated in the civil rights struggle. His personal history, his  personal eyewitness accounts of trying to change the course of events  in our country as an African American man, were a powerful example to  those fighting for democracy and human rights in China. I can recount  easily dozens of moments in different parts of the world where  Americans from diverse backgrounds have made a powerful case for our  country. These life experiences cannot be replicated, they cannot be  purchased, and they cannot be bought.   So, as Black History Month comes to a close, let us not only remember  the critical contributions of African-Americans in the formulation and  execution of U.S. foreign policy, let us also recommit to doing our  part to prepare the leaders who will strengthen and secure our national  security in the future.                            ____________________
