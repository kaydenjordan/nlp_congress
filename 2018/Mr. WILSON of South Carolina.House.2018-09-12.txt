 Mr. Speaker, this week, President  Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and National Security  Advisor John Bolton made the courageous decision to close the  Palestinian Liberation Organization, PLO, office in Washington.   The PLO has taken no steps to advance the peace negotiations with  Israel. Instead, they have focused their efforts on leveraging the  International  [[Page H8113]]  Criminal Court, which directly disrupts the peace process.   Unfortunately, the PLO's efforts to subvert the International  Criminal Court were advanced when former President Barack Obama refused  to stand up for Israel in the U.N. Security Council.   While the PLO condemns Israel, it is, shamefully, paying payments to  families of suicide bombers and terrorists as rewards for mass murder.  Hakim Abard, who murdered five members of an Israeli family, receives  $14,000 a year from the PLO. The family of the murderer of American  Taylor Force received benefits as a reward for that murder.   The administration had provided the PLO the opportunity to remain  when their waiver lapsed, but, unfortunately, the PLO continues to  sponsor violence against innocent American and Israeli citizens.  President Trump made the right decision.   Our prayers for the people threatened by Hurricane Florence, with our  appreciation for the first responders who are protecting American  families in the tradition of 9/11.                            ____________________
