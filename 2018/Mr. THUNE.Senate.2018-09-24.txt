 Mr. President, today I recognize Red Arndt for his  many years of service to the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System, as  well as his lifetime commitment to bringing safe and reliable water to  the rural corners of this country.   Born Lennis Arndt on May 1, 1948, he earned the nickname, ``Red,''  while in grade school from his full head of red hair. The name stuck,  and most people only know him today as Red Arndt.   Red grew up in Springfield, MN, about 90 minutes from his current  hometown, Luverne, where he first started working in 1989 as their  public utilities director. Shortly after beginning his new position,  Red heard about a proposal to bring water from the Missouri River in  South Dakota to the surrounding States. A major undertaking with more  people doubting the idea than supporting, Red saw the opportunity and  potential, recommending to the mayor and city council that Luverne join  and become one of the first members of the corporation that would later  become the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System.   Seeing Lewis & Clark develop from conception to construction was a  labor of love for Red and a mission he fought hard to achieve. Red, one  of only two original directors from 1990 still on the board, held a  shovel when the ground was first broke in 2003. He has probably made  over 60 trips to Washington, DC, and many more to the State capitals  and attended countless county, city, and community meetings.   Fighting to get Lewis & Clark off the ground was just a starting  point for Red. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the project,  serving as the vice chairman of the board beginning in 1994, until  becoming the board chairman in 2006, a position he still holds. Lewis &  Clark has experienced ups and downs during those years; yet under Red's  leadership, over 200 miles of pipeline have been laid in the ground  currently delivering much needed water to 14 member communities and  rural water projects, reaching over 300,000 people across South Dakota,  Minnesota, and Iowa. He has seen over $470 million in funding to Lewis  & Clark, including $57 million in advance funding from the three  States.   Red's indisputable dedication was demonstrated when he participated  in the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the water treatment plant in August  2012, a mere 2 weeks after having open heart surgery. His fellow  directors surprised him at the ceremony by presenting him with the  Lewis & Clark Trailblazer Award, which is the organization's highest  honor.   In May 2016, Luverne was finally able to celebrate their connection  to Lewis & Clark, with Red reveling in taking the first swig of water.  It was at this ceremony that the meter building in Luverne was  dedicated in Red's honor. Red will be the first to acknowledge that  this endeavor, benefiting generations to come in the tristate area, has  been a true team effort. But, there is no question Red's vision for the  future, dogged dedication, and strong leadership have been a driving  force through the years.   When he is not dedicating his time to Lewis & Clark, Red is a proud  father of three boys--all sharing his red hair--and grandfather of  three red-headed little girls. His family is his pride and joy. You  will often find Red wearing a pin honoring his son who served in the  U.S. Air Force.   As a dessert first type of guy, Red lives life to the fullest,  enjoying travel, fishing and numerous other outdoor activities in his  free time, as well as hanging out in his ``man cave.'' I am grateful  for his commitment to public service, his hard work on behalf of Lewis  & Clark, and, more importantly, I am proud to call him a friend.   I commend Red Arndt for his many great contributions and wish him the  best as he continues to make the most out of the life God has  given.                            ____________________
