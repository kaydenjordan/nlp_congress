 Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the first  charges of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation had been filed  against President Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his  business associate Rick Gates.   But just as importantly, we learned that former Trump campaign  foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to  the FBI about his attempts to contact the Russian Government. The  investigation is gaining momentum and must go on.   In the Senate, Majority Leader McConnell has refused to commit floor  time to legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller's investigation  from outside interference. If the Senate refuses to act, the House  must. It is imperative that we allow the investigation into Russian  interference in our democracy to continue unimpeded and unhindered.   Yesterday's news may be the first public revelations, but they cannot  be the last. The investigation into the Russian Government's attempts  to sabotage our democracy must continue. I urge Speaker Ryan and the  House leadership to commit to safeguarding the independence and  integrity of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.                            ____________________
