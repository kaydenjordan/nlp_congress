 Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise  today and recognize Mary Kay Csanyi from Kernersville, North Carolina.   Since 2004, Mary Kay has served as an administrative assistant with  the Kernersville Chamber of Commerce. The title she holds does not do  justice to the impact she has at the chamber or in Kernersville. To me,  she was the sunshine in the room, no matter where she is. Her ray of  sunshine will be sorely missed.   In her capacity, she has coordinated numerous craft shows, festivals,  and events within the Kernersville community. After 15 wonderful years  at the Kernersville Chamber, Mary Kay retired on August 26 and  celebrated alongside her colleagues and friends with a drive-in  celebration.   Mary Kay, as you enter this new stage of your life, I know that you  will continue to serve your community, impact the lives of your friends  and neighbors, and be a ray of sunshine wherever you are.   May God continue to bless you; Bob, your husband of 40 years; and  your family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2639, the Strength in Diversity  Act.   Republicans and Democrats agree that discrimination and State- sanctioned segregation are repugnant, illegal, and blatantly immoral.  Studies have shown that integrated schools promote greater  understanding, tolerance, and improved educational outcomes.   I don't disagree with the intentions behind this bill but have major  reservations about its efficacy. Will this bill stand the test of time?  Will these ideas have helped the ongoing effort to achieve greater  equality for children? Sadly, the answer is no.   The Education and Labor Committee has a long history of reaching  across the aisle and finding common ground to effect meaningful reform  for our Nation's schools and students.   The legislation before us today was another opportunity for committee  Republicans and Democrats to find bipartisan compromise. Unfortunately,  committee Democrats ignored commonsense approaches to this problem to  impose a top-down, Big Government mandate that would have the Federal  Government decide how best to address the issues of racial and  socioeconomic isolation in America's schools.    As we have seen many times before, additional government mandates and  burdensome red tape are not the answer. Congress has already set up the  Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants, a block grant created  to give school districts flexibility to pursue local solutions to their  communities' educational challenges. Local and State leaders and those  with their feet on the ground know how best to combat these challenges,  not the Federal Government.   That is why Representative Allen will offer a Republican alternative  later today that will provide this House a bipartisan solution that  could easily garner an overwhelming majority of support in this Chamber  if every Member chose to focus on the importance of actually addressing  racial and socioeconomic isolation in schools. His amendment would  ensure that nearly every school district in the country would have the  flexibility with Federal funds they may need to tackle this problem.  This is how legislating for solutions, rather than legislating for  headlines can work.   Republicans want nothing more than to see all American children  prosper. That means expanding opportunities for marginalized students  to gain access to an education that prepares them for lifelong success.  It also means school districts taking action to reduce racial and  socioeconomic isolation in schools.   A bipartisan path forward to make that possible is achievable, but  Democrats would rather score political points than work with  Republicans on solutions that will make a significant difference in the  lives of our Nation's children.   Instead of building upon a program that has bipartisan, bicameral  support, Democrats' H.R. 2639 sets up a new grant program within the  Department of Education that will inevitably be underfunded, if it is  funded at all.   Creating more government programs that have to scramble for funding  in order to operate successfully is the last thing we need to foster  the best environment for all students to learn.   H.R. 2639 also ignores the biggest problem facing low-income students  and students of color--a lack of high-quality educational options.  Committee Republicans stand ready to work with our colleagues in the  majority to expand educational opportunities to all families. But  rather than bring a bill to the floor that would expand the  availability of charter schools or offer marginalized families the kind  of educational freedom that the wealthy exercise for themselves,  Democrats decided teachers unions are more important to them than real  families who are desperate for access to a better education for their  children.   My Republican colleagues and I believe that expanding opportunities  for students should be a priority. We know school choice gives families  the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and enroll their children  in challenging environments that better develop their skills and  intellect, encouraging them to reach higher. In fact, studies show that  when students are given the freedom to attend school in a learning  environment best suited to their abilities, they pursue and complete  postsecondary opportunities at higher rates.   Access to opportunities, freedom to climb, these are aspects of a  student's education that must be equal for all children nationwide. No  one-size-fits-all structure can deliver on those essentials. Separate  was never equal, but equality cannot simply mean uniformity if that  uniformity doesn't prepare students for lifelong success. Equality is  affirming that all children are fundamentally the same in dignity,  importance, and worth but also understanding that not all children's  needs are the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats' approach in H.R. 2639 is wrong for our  Nation's schools and students if we hope to achieve greater equality  for children nationwide. Not only does this bill push another Democrat- led, top-down, Big Government mandate, but it has  [[Page H4405]]  also been crafted to mirror a failed Obama administration program.   At the Rules Committee yesterday, and also referenced today, Chairman  Scott touted the fact that 30 school districts applied under the  Opening Doors, Expanding Opportunities program created during the Obama  administration. For the sake of debate, let's say that half of those  school districts had been awarded funding. That is only 15 school  districts nationwide that would have received Federal funding under  President Obama's program that this bill is modeled after.   In contrast to this failed approach, Representative Allen will offer  an amendment that would allow school districts to use funds from an  existing Federal grant program to accomplish the same goals as the  Democrats' bill.   About 12,000 school districts receive ESEA block grant funding every  year. By supporting Representative Allen's amendment, we can ensure  that nearly every school district in the country has the flexibility to  tackle this problem using taxpayer funds at the Federal level. This is  how legislating for solutions, rather than legislating for headlines,  can work.   A high-quality education is an indispensable tool, and America's  children deserve nothing less than an education that empowers them to  reach their greatest potential. This bill doesn't move us in that  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats agree that discrimination and  State-sanctioned segregation are repugnant, illegal, and blatantly  immoral. Action must be taken to achieve greater equality for our  Nation's students and in our schools.   We continue to strive toward a future where all students, regardless  of race or color, have the chance to succeed. Education and hard work  are the paths out of poverty for millions, and education provides  students with the tools and skills they need to build a successful  life.   It is disappointing that a bipartisan path forward to address these  issues was possible but not attained because of political posturing  from Democrats. Apparently, political wins are more important than  building upon bipartisan, bicameral legislative solutions that will  help our Nation's children prosper.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2639 so that we can have  the opportunity to work on a bipartisan solution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment and have great  affection for the introducer.    Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this  amendment does nothing to correct the flaws of the underlying bill, but  it doesn't make the bill any worse either. The amendment includes  language that would ensure applicants are judged on their ability to  meet the fundamental purposes of the bill, which should be done with  all grant applications and by anyone receiving taxpayer funding, and  that makes sense.   However, the amendment doesn't change the fundamentally flawed  approach this bill takes to tackle a problem we all agree that school  districts should address. But nothing in the amendment itself is  objectionable--in fact, it may be helpful--so I will support the  amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and urge  my colleagues to support it.   I applaud the gentleman from Georgia for offering such an  alternative. As has been said, it builds on bipartisan, bicameral  agreements to ensure nearly every school district in the country has  Federal funds to pursue the goals of the underlying bill rather than  affording this opportunity to a select few school districts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, the majority of the  amendments are unobjectionable, though none of them address the  underlying problems with the bill.   However, I highlight two problematic amendments:   The amendment offered by Representative Cooper would give school  districts priority in this program if those districts had previously  submitted an application under an Obama-era predecessor to the program  in the underlying bill. This amendment is flawed for two reasons:   An application filed 4 years ago, may or may not still be adequate.  Automatically giving those districts priority would disadvantage school  districts who might have new and better ideas to propose.   Submitting an application 4 years ago is not the same as being funded  4 years ago. Applicants that never demonstrated their merit then should  start on equal footing with new applicants now.   Another amendment concealed within the en bloc is offered by  Representative Green of Texas, which forces grantees' hands on a  dilemma many are still considering for themselves. The amendment  requires that participating school districts that utilize entrance  exams and competitive application procedures must replace these  processes with other methods.   Republicans recognize that many school districts, as well as colleges  and universities, are wrestling with the role entrance exams and other  competitive application procedures have played in the admissions  decisions and should play in the future. Democrats would, apparently,  like to short-circuit that debate and make those determinations for  school districts themselves.   Ironically, entrance exams began as an earnest effort to combat  discrimination and prejudice by creating objective criteria that  weren't as easily manipulated by admissions personnel who were biased  against certain populations. Objective enrollment criteria can decrease  the potential for schools--especially highly competitive schools--to be  able to justify discrimination against students based on their  backgrounds or racial identities.   Today, there are legitimate arguments to be made on both sides of the  debate for keeping or eliminating this practice. But this amendment  would proclaim that the House of Representatives has decided against  the use of entrance exams, a conversation this body has never had.   These two amendments--one undermining the quality of the application  process, and the other unfairly deciding an outcome of an ongoing  debate--cause me great concern and I oppose them.   Ultimately, though, on balance, this en bloc consideration is worthy  of support, even if it doesn't ultimately redeem the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, while I support the goals of  this amendment, I must reluctantly urge my colleagues to oppose it.   Hidden within this amendment is potentially a sweeping change to how  States evaluate their schools under the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act. The amendment requires States to include progress on  reducing racial and economic isolation in evaluating schools as a  factor under State's title I State plans.   I say this is a potentially sweeping change because the language is  unclear. However, I read it as intending to require States to consider  racial and economic isolation as a factor in the State-driven  accountability systems required under title I.   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if such a change to how States evaluate  schools is a good or bad idea. But I am sure that such a significant  change should be debated as part of a proper reevaluation of title I,  not in the context of a standalone competitive grant program.   If this is not the gentlewoman's intent with this amendment, then  this just highlights the flaws in legislating without bipartisan  discussions. Perhaps there are steps we could agree States should take  in the context of title I to reduce racial and economic isolation, but  let's debate those changes in the proper context.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat something I  said earlier. Republicans and Democrats agree that discrimination and  State-sanctioned segregation are repugnant, illegal, and blatantly  immoral. Action should be taken to achieve greater equality for our  Nation's students and in our schools.   We believe we should strive toward a future where all students,  regardless of race or color, have the chance to succeed. Education and  hard work are the paths out of poverty for millions, and education  provides students with the tools and skills they need to build a  successful life.   My colleague mentioned that she didn't see the difference between her  amendment and Representative Allen's amendment. Well, Representative  Allen's amendment provides a way for all schools to achieve worthy  goals through grant programs. This goes to the fundamental way schools  are evaluated and would be a major change in policy.   I, again, urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. We  should be debating this issue when we are debating the issues related  to title I.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I mentioned in my opening  remarks that the underlying bill fails, in part, because it doesn't  address the biggest challenge facing low-income families and families  of color, namely, the lack of access to high-quality education options  that will prepare their children for lifelong success. Unfortunately,  this amendment doesn't directly address that problem either, but at  least it takes a small step in that direction.   As more and more communities embrace charter schools and other public  school options, one-stop enrollment processes are one way some  communities have made it easier for parents to understand and navigate  their options.   As charter school enrollment grew in Washington, D.C., to include  nearly half of the city's students, the city implemented an open  lottery system to provide parents a one-stop portal to apply to  multiple schools.   The system isn't perfect, but that is mostly because the open lottery  system doesn't address the fact that there are an insufficient number  of seats in high-performing schools to meet demand. I wish we were here  debating solutions to that problem today, Mr. Speaker.   But in the absence of a real effort to increase the availability of  the high-quality education options, I will settle for an effort to  facilitate easier selections of these options where they exist.   I applaud the gentleman for bucking the trend in his party of  opposing educational freedom for low-income families and families of  color, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's  comments, and, as I said, this is a very small step in the right  direction. I wish that there were more people in the gentleman's party  who wanted to see this. We have tremendous evidence that school choice  is the tide that lifts all boats in education. It does everywhere.   It breaks my heart when I see places like New York City where people  there--particularly, the mayor there, has done everything he can to  snuff out choice and to snuff out the opportunities that exist there,  such as Success Academy, which not only has provided extraordinarily  high-quality education to the students, but has really helped raise the  level in a very minor way in the other public schools there.   We have way too many situations in this country where the teachers  unions want to stop all opportunities for choice. And I will take a  tiny, tiny step as a good faith movement in the direction of providing  all students, particularly low-income students, with the opportunity  for choice, because we know where there is choice, the quality  increases.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
