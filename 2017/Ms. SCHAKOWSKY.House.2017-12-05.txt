 Mr. Speaker, I rise today against the Trump  administration rule allowing corporations to decide whether their  employees can access birth control. This morning, 500,000 comments were  delivered in opposition to this rule.   It is astonishing to me that we are having this debate in 2017:  women's access to birth control.   Birth control is not healthcare alone. It is the right of women to  control their own bodies, plan their own families, and chart their own  futures.   Obstetricians and gynecologists from Chicago submitted a comment,  saying: ``Women who are able to control when and how they become  pregnant are able to finish school, pursue graduate degrees, and  further the greater social and economic good of our Nation.''   Mr. Speaker, for 99 percent of women of reproductive age, birth  control is an essential part of their lives. This is a direct attack on  women, and we will not stand for it. Women in America are watching.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.  Con. Res. 90.   I am very grateful for this debate today because we need to raise  this issue so the world knows that right before our eyes right now  ethnic cleansing is happening halfway around the world in Myanmar.   I was privileged to go 2 weeks ago to both Bangladesh and Myanmar to  be an on-the-ground witness to what is going on. In my district, I have  probably most of the 1,000 or so Rohingya in the Chicago area and even  have in my district the Rohingya Cultural Center, which I visited this  weekend with Senator Dick Durbin, who was also on this congressional  delegation.   We listened to people in Bangladesh and we heard about unspeakable  atrocities that, in fact, were spoken, and I recorded some of them.   We talked to a 20-year-old woman who was holding her hijab on her  face  [[Page H9647]]  as she cried and told about, in front of her eyes, how her husband's  throat was slit and he was killed, his brother was killed, and then  they grabbed the baby out of her arms and, in front of her, killed that  child. It was just one of the stories.   We talked to a grandmother and her granddaughter next to her covered  with burns that are now scars from a few months ago. She is so scarred  that she cannot speak, and her grandmother wishes only that she would  be able to talk.   We met with the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Hasina,  a woman, who we thanked for allowing 620,000 Rohingya to cross into  Bangladesh, but they want them to go home. The Bangladeshis want them  to go home. Right now that is impossible because villages have been  burned and because the almost complete prejudice against the Rohingya  people. They won't even use the name Rohingya in Myanmar, in Burma, to  refer to these individuals.   Thousands upon thousands of stories like that are coming out of  Rakhine State, where the Rohingya made their home.   We thought we were going to be, but we were not permitted to go to  the displaced persons camps, which are really prisons, concentration  camps in northern Rakhine, where people have been thrown out of their  homes, and their homes and jobs destroyed.   We went to Sittwe, the capital of the Rakhine State. We went to what  is essentially a ghetto surrounded by barbed wires, blocked by police,  where people cannot get healthcare, they can't go to the stores that  they used to have in the village, they can't get education. They are  running out of rice right now.   This is happening now in the world. We need to do something about it.  I am proud of this Congress for standing up today and saying no more  ethnic cleansing.
