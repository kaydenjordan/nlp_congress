 It was something that I just never thought--I       just never thought I'd see this in our Nation's Capitol and       particularly in the House Chamber. It was surreal when it was       unfolding.        Well, you know, what was interesting was the bravery and       courage of some of my fellow Members. When we got to a point       where the mob was banging on the doors, and then all that       kept them from breaching that--the Chamber itself was the       doors and then some furniture that we had moved (inaudible)       Capitol Police. And they needed to be augmented, and so Tony       Gonzales, the new Representative from Texas, and Ronny       Jackson and Troy Nehls and Markwayne Mullin stepped in, and       we broke off furniture. Some of the (inaudible) big giant       poles, wooden poles, and we turned them upside down, and we       were ready to actually have to street fight in the House       Chamber. It was unbelievable.    Many Members that day wondered if they would ever see their families  again as the rioters breached the Capitol and they were outnumbered and  trapped inside. They were calling loved ones to say goodbye.  Representative  Dan Kildee was one of them. Listen to how he described  the impact of the riot on him.   (Text of video presentation.)
