 Mr. Speaker, I simply want to add my  appreciation and thanks to the chairman and ranking members that you  have just heard from for this momentous agreement before us today. And  I would like to especially commend our big chairman, Frelinghuysen, for  the work he has done on this bill, but, more importantly, the work he  has done throughout his career in this body.   Mr. Frelinghuysen, you are a great friend, a great Member of this  body, a great leader, and you will be missed.                                time  1515    Once again, we are demonstrating that the Appropriations Committee  can and will do everything in our power to get the job done. I  especially appreciate the committee's continued commitment to address  the addiction crisis.   This bill maintains a comprehensive focus on prevention, treatment,  and education, following the holistic model of Operation UNITE in my  congressional district, and it provides a record $6.6 billion toward  those programs.   You have all heard me talk endlessly, if you will, about the  devastation brought by opioid abuse touching so many lives around the  country over the last 20 years. Chairman Cole has been a truly  incredible leader and partner in combating this epidemic, and I am  confident that this bill will bring substantial relief to our  communities in need.   I would also like to thank the conference committee for their work to  ensure that the Department of Defense not only receives the funding it  needs, but that its funding is finalized before the beginning of the  fiscal year to allow them to plan.   For too long, some say 22 years, we in Congress have not delivered  this bill in time to allow the Department to operate as it should with  its full allotment of funding on October 1.   When combined with the Energy and Water and MILCON-VA bills that are  already law, this bill does exactly that and provides the Department of  Defense with the funds it needs to defend American interests and values  around the world, including a well-deserved pay raise for the men and  women in uniform who serve bravely under our flag.   Thank you again for your collective leadership. This is a great  agreement, and I urge its support.
