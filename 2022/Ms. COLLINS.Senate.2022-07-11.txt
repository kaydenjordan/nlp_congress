 Mr. President, St. Joseph Healthcare of Bangor, ME, was  founded in 1947 by the Felician Sisters with a mission to support the  wellness and healing of a patient's mind, body, and spirit. On this  75th anniversary, I congratulate this outstanding institution for  carrying out that mission with expertise and compassion.   St. Joseph is a 112-bed acute care community hospital that brings  together primary care providers and specialists focused on delivering  personalized medicine in more than 30 departments. It is a member of  Covenant Health, an innovative, Catholic regional health delivery  network that is a leader in values-based, not-for-profit health and  elder care.   The St. Joseph story began in 1855 in Warsaw, Poland, when Blessed  Angela founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix, an order  dedicated to serving the poor, the sick, and the disabled. The Felician  Sisters were founded with a particular focus on serving the Polish  countryside. St. Joseph Healthcare continues that tradition by its  efforts to ensure healthcare services for rural Maine.   St. Joseph's contributions as a healthcare provider are enormous but  only part of its mission. The hospital's facilities have been applied  to such needs as providing laundry and food services to the area's  homeless shelters. A food pantry, an elementary school backpack  program, and a community vegetable exchange stand help alleviate food  insecurity. St. Joseph's Closet provides patients who are being  discharged with needed clothing. The Blessing Bag program provides  food, winter clothing, and basic personal hygiene items to homeless  emergency room patients.   Countless other acts of kindness complement the St. Joseph mission of  meeting the spiritual and religious needs of patients regardless of  their beliefs and traditions or spirituality. The 16th century Capuchin  friar canonized St. Felix was known in his time as ``the saint of the  streets of Rome'' for his daily journeys through the city dispensing  food, medicine, and comfort to the poor, the sick, and the troubled.  The dedicated staff and leadership of St. Joseph Healthcare continue  that legacy through the streets of Bangor and the country roads of  Maine, and I thank them for their blessed service.                            ____________________
