 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week. As a 42-year veteran of law enforcement and a former patrolman,  detective, police chief, and sheriff, I know firsthand how much our law  enforcement officers and their families sacrifice to protect our  communities.   At a time when law enforcement officers across the country have been  vilified by far-left activists, it is more important than ever that we  show them our honor and respect.   Today is Peace Officers Memorial Day, and I take this time to honor  two fallen heroes from south Mississippi, Bay St. Louis Police officers  Sergeant Steven Robin and Officer Branden Estorffe.   Sergeant Robin and Officer Estorffe were shot and killed in the line  of duty this past December. Like so many other fallen officers, they  leave behind grieving families and a community grappling with the  consequences of senseless violence.   As we honor both National Police Week and Peace Officers Memorial  Day, our fallen officers, their loved ones, and their communities are  in the thoughts and prayers of myself, this body, and the United States  of America.   May we always remember their selfless commitment to service and,  ultimately, their sacrifice.                            ____________________
