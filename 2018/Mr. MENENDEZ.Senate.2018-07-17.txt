 Mr. President, I rise to urge this body to uphold our  solemn responsibility to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution  of the United States and to protect the Nation from all enemies,  foreign and domestic.   I have long believed the President's words and actions have  undermined our national interests and our values, but yesterday felt  different.   As someone who has sat for 26 years on the House and Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, it was a day of infamy in the history of our  foreign policy.   Yesterday, the American people witnessed a supplicant President of  the United States capitulate to a brutal foreign leader on the world  stage. Far from standing up to Putin, President Trump was unable to  even acknowledge Russia's attack in 2016 and the continued threat it  poses today. Instead, the President reverted to his own insecurities  about his electoral victory and disturbingly subverted the work of the  men and women who lead our intelligence community.   I shouldn't have to repeat this, but I will, and I hope my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle are as unequivocal as well. Seventeen-- seventeen--U.S. intelligence agencies together assessed that Russian  President Vladimir Putin ordered a sophisticated influence campaign  aimed at the 2016 Presidential election. Yet the President said he had  ``no reason to believe'' Russia interfered, and I have no reason to  believe what he tried to clean up today.   Those statements directly contradicted statements from then-CIA  Director Mike Pompeo--who is now the Secretary of State--the U.S. Vice  President, Michael Pence, and the Director of U.S. National  Intelligence.   The President said:         I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I       will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and       powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an       incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on       the case come and work with their investigators--    With respect to the 12 military intelligence officers that the  special counsel indicted--         I think that is an incredible offer.    The only incredible thing about that offer is that the President of  the United States would invite the perpetrator of the crime to help  with the investigation. That is incredible.   Every time President Trump failed to stand up to Vladimir Putin felt  like a collective punch in the gut of the American people. It was  disturbing and saddening to see the leader of the free world shrink in  the face of a dictator.  [[Page S4989]]    Just as disturbing is, we have no idea what transpired between  President Trump and Putin during their secretive, lengthy meeting. What  could the President need to discuss with President Putin for 2 hours  with no other advisers present? If President Trump said such appalling  things in public, Lord knows what he would have said to Putin in  private. We deserve to know what was said and what was agreed to. We  can't afford to be blindsided or outmaneuvered.   Just today, the Russian Ministry of Defense publicly stated it is  preparing to start implementing an agreement that the President  apparently struck in Helsinki with President Putin--an agreement that  neither Congress nor the American people have been informed about.   President Trump, to adequately protect America's interests, we need  to know what commitments you made to Putin. What specific topics did  you discuss? What were the suggestions President Putin made to you? Did  you discuss any changes to international security agreements, and, if  so, what were they? Did you advocate for the extradition of the 12  Russian intelligence officers indicted last Friday? Did you make any  commitments to the U.S. role regarding Syria? Did you press Russia to  return to compliance with the INF Treaty and halt its nuclear threats  against Europe? Did you discuss U.S. sanctions on Russia, including  CAATSA sanctions that this body passed 98 to 2? If so, did you commit  to any action?   Did you call upon President Putin to withdraw from Crimea and eastern  Ukraine so both areas can be returned to the sovereign Government of  Ukraine or did you ultimately give up on Crimea?   Did you discuss NATO military exercises scheduled for this fall? Did  you agree to roll back or change the nature of those exercises? Did you  discuss U.S. security assistance to Ukraine and make any concessions  regarding their continuation?   Did you raise the issue of political prisoners with President Putin,  including that of Oleg Sentsov, the Ukrainian filmmaker who has been  detained for 4 years on a hunger strike?   What, if anything, did you commit to? We need to know.   The President keeps saying having a good relationship with Russia  would be a good thing. Of course, having good relationships with  countries, in general, is a good thing, but those relationships must be  grounded in trust, in cooperation, in the values we share--values like  human rights, democracies, self-governance, and individual freedom.   We do not share values with a country that attacks our elections and,  by doing so, seeks to undermine our democracy. We do not share values  with a country that invades its sovereign neighbors and engages in a  brutal war with Ukraine. We do not share values with a country that  bolsters the Butcher of Damascus and is complicit in war crimes in  Syria. We do not share values with a country that assassinates  political opponents and jails journalists. We do not share values with  a country that continuously violates the international order. We do not  share values with Russia under Putin.   We take oaths when we are sworn into office. President Trump did as  well. Yesterday's behavior, from my view, was an abdication of that  oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United  States.   We have reached a terrible and historic low point in the United  States. An American President, it seems, has teamed up with Russian  intelligence against our democracy, our FBI, our Justice Department,  and our intelligence community.   Our President is more closely aligned with Vladimir Putin than he is  with his own government. It is unfortunate we have come to expect this  behavior. President Trump has made his fixation on Putin and his  affinity for authoritarians crystal clear, and America is weaker  because of it. The question is, Are Senate Republicans OK with this?  Except for the Presiding Officer and one or two other colleagues, from  the silence of many or the feeble comments of others, I would say so.   Are they willing to concede Russian policy to President Trump? Is the  price of letting this President surrender to a brutal dictator in  Moscow some corporate tax cuts and a Supreme Court seat?   Tweeting about being ``troubled''--troubled--is shamefully  inappropriate. Signing on to symbolic measures that carry no force of  law is a joke, and remaining silent in the face of betrayal is nothing  less than complicity.   It is time the Republican-led Congress live up to its constitutional  responsibilities. If this Senate is to respond appropriately, here is  what we must immediately do, starting this week:   First, the Foreign Relations Committee; the Armed Services Committee,  of which my distinguished colleague is the ranking Democrat; and the  Intelligence Committee, of which my distinguished colleague is a  member, must hold hearings on what happened in Helsinki. We have a  right and a responsibility to know what transpired between Trump and  Putin and how it affects American citizens. We have the power to compel  the administration to provide that information; we just need to use it.   Second, the Senate must protect the Mueller investigation and prevent  interference by President Trump. The President is laying the groundwork  to fire the special counsel. We can't let that happen. It is our  responsibility to protect the integrity of our institutions.   Third, the Senate must conduct real oversight of the Russia sanctions  that were signed into law last August. As I have said repeatedly on  this floor, the Trump administration is ignoring several mandatory  provisions of the law--mandatory. In all of the sanctions that I have  helped write, this is one of the first times the Congress came together  and didn't give the President waivers because they were concerned about  what he would do vis-a-vis Russia, and look at this--maybe that  foresight was very clairvoyant.   I and other Democrats have spoken out. We have sent several letters.  We continuously urged administration officials to implement the  sanctions. Where are the Senate Republicans, including all of those who  voted for this bill, except for one? Silent.   If you want to stand up to Putin, if you want to stand up against  Trump's capitulation in Helsinki, then we need to press the  administration to finally implement what is already in the law--what is  already in the law. We should do so today.   Fourth, we need to protect ourselves here at home, since it is clear  we have a President who will not. The Senate needs to take up and pass  the Protecting the Right to Independent and Democratic Elections Act I  introduced last month. There are also measures by Senators Warner,  Klobuchar, and others that would bolster our electoral defenses.   President Trump's intelligence community has repeatedly warned that  the Kremlin's dangerous interference in U.S. democracy is continuing.  Just days ago, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, said  the warning signs are ``blinking red'' of further Russian cyber  attacks. He noted that we are under literal attack. Yet instead of  marshaling a whole-of-government response, President Trump remains  fixated on protecting his fragile ego.   Today is the fourth anniversary of the shooting down of Malaysia  Airlines flight 17 over eastern Ukraine by Russian-supported  separatists, which killed all 298 people on board--a devastating  reminder of the real dangers of the Kremlin's brutal targeting of  civilians and why our relations with Russia have been strained.   Yesterday, Putin said the ball is in America's court. Well, it is  time we take our shot. It is time we show the American people and the  world what it means to put country over party. It is time to show the  American people that we can be patriots and not just partisans; that we  will stand by our allies and stand up to our adversaries; that we will  defend our democracy, our institutions, and the values that truly make  America great.   Our President has proven too weak, too egotistical, too feckless, or  maybe too compromised to do it. It is up to us.   With that, I yield the floor.
