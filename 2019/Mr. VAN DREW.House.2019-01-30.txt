 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the future of  our Congress.   I stand here today at a crossroads: a crossroads of cooperation, a  crossroads of bipartisanship, and a crossroads of accomplishment.   This is a chance to begin to make Americans proud of our Congress  once again, certainly more proud than the 13 percent approval rating  that we currently have.   Republicans and Democrats can have different opinions. They should  have different opinions. But they should never push these opinions to  such extremes that we end up hurting our good American people.   In the next 2\1/2\ weeks, both sides of the aisle can truly achieve  greatness.   Mr. Speaker, we came here not to be great Democrats nor to be great  Republicans. We came here to become, and to be, great Americans. I pray  to God that we will be.   God bless our great country of America                            ____________________
