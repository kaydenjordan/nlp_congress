 Madam Speaker, I rise to encourage the  Speaker of the House to let us vote on H.R. 962, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It is more than common sense; it is  common decency legislation being put forth to end the barbaric act of  infanticide.   Every day, Kansans watching from back home assume this must already  be law. There is no way that, in America, it is legal to murder a child  who already has been born.   Sadly, in some parts of this country, it isn't common sense; it isn't  common decency. In some parts of the country, it isn't something  inherently wrong to kill a child who was born alive.   This is murder. It is appalling that it is being protected. This is  murder.   Madam Speaker, let us vote.                            ____________________
