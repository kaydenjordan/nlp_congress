 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and call on Congress to support  our seniors and those on Medicare by lowering the cost of prescription  drugs.   Seniors will get a 1.6 percent cost-of-living increase this year, yet  the cost of prescription drugs is expected to go up 3.8 percent.   How can older Americans on a fixed income afford this? The answer is  they can't, and they need to act on this.   I have spoken with Iowans who are rationing their medications or  skipping meals just to cover the cost of the drugs they take.   I heard from Joan in west Des Moines, who has an autoimmune disease,  and her medication suddenly skyrocketed. If she doesn't take it, she  will need a liver transplant, and she doesn't know how she is going to  afford the medication.   John in Madrid discovered his standard refill of insulin costs more  than, literally, the price of gold.   So something must change. Older Americans need Congress to act.   That is why I am supporting H.R. 3 to protect our seniors. It means  our older Americans won't be robbed of their retirement savings and  they will live healthier lives.   If you want to give seniors a healthier, happier, safer retirement,  then I call on you to support this bill.                            ____________________
