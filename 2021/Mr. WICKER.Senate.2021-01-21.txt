 Madam President, today I honor a superb leader and  warrior. I have had the privilege of associating with VADM Fritz Roegge  both personally and professionally over many years, and it has been my  pleasure to do so. After 40 years of uniformed service, Vice Admiral  Roegge will be retiring from the U.S. Navy. On this occasion, I believe  it is fitting to recognize his distinguished service and dedication to  our Navy.   Vice Admiral Roegge is an honors graduate of the University of  Minnesota with a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering and was  commissioned through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program. He  went on to earn a master of science in engineering management from the  Catholic University of America and a master of arts with highest  distinction in national security and strategic studies from the Naval  War College. He was a fellow of the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology Seminar XXI program and of the Harvard Kennedy School  program for Senior Executives in National and International Security.   His sea tours include USS Whale (SSN 638), USS Florida (SSBN 728)  (Blue), USS Key West (SSN 722), and most prominently, command of USS  Connecticut (SSN 22). His major command was as commodore of Submarine  Squadron 22, with additional duty as commanding officer, Naval Support  Activity La Maddalena, Italy.   Ashore, he has served on the staffs of both the Atlantic and Pacific  Submarine Force commanders, on the staff of the Director of Naval  Nuclear Propulsion, on the Navy staff in the Assessments Division (N81)  and the Military Personnel Plans and Policy Division (N13), in the  Secretary of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs at the U.S. House  of Representatives, as the head of the Submarine and Nuclear Power  Distribution Division (PERS 42) at the Navy Personnel Command, and as  an assistant deputy director on the Joint Staff in both the Strategy  and Policy (J5) and the Regional Operations (J33) Directorates.   Vice Admiral Roegge completed his first flag officer assignment as  the deputy commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Global  Strike at U.S. Strategic Command. He then served concurrently as  commander, Submarine Group 8; commander, Submarines, Allied Naval  Forces South; deputy commander, U.S. 6th Fleet; and director of  Operations and Intelligence (N3), U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa. As a  rear admiral, he served on the Navy staff as director, Military  Personnel Plans and Policy Division (N13) with a concurrent period as  director, Total Force Manpower Division (N12) and then as commander,  Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet.   Vice Admiral Roegge now culminates his career of service to the Navy  and the Nation as the 16th president of the National Defense University  (NDU). NDU is the university of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and the premier Joint Professional Military Education institution  in the Department of Defense. NDU's mission to develop joint  warfighters and other national security leaders through rigorous  academics, research, and engagement has never been more important to  our Nation and its security.   I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to Vice Admiral  Roegge for his outstanding leadership and unwavering support of the  missions of the U.S. Navy. I want to recognize his supportive family,  Mrs. Julie Roegge and their two sons, Alex and Will. I wish Vice  Admiral Roegge and his family ``fair winds and following seas.''                            ____________________
