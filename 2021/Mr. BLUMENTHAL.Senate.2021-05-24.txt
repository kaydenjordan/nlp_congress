 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa, our  colleague and friend, for those really eloquent and powerful remarks. I  thank her and our other colleague from Iowa, who has been beside us  from the very start of this cause 8 years or more ago. But most  importantly, I thank my colleague from New York, who has been  unstoppable, steadfast, and resolute in this cause. We are here today  with that overwhelming, bipartisan support because of her advocacy, her  eloquence, and power.   Above all, we are here today because of the survivors and victims who  have come forward with tremendous courage and strength. As much courage  as it takes to be in the military--and I pay tribute literally every  day to the men and women in uniform who defend our country, who raise  their right hand, willing to give their lives--it is equally if not  more difficult to come forward as they have done over these years and  speak their truth to us. I have been so impressed by their bravery and  by their truth-telling.   I know as a prosecutor how difficult reporting this crime is in the  civilian world, in universities, in the workplace. It is excruciatingly  difficult to come forward and overcome the stigma and sometimes shame  and the threat of retaliation. It is that threat of retaliation that we  need to counter and stop because reporting of this crime is always  difficult. Underreporting is a chronic problem in prosecuting it.   So taking it out of the chain of command, eliminating the prospect of  retaliation, implicit fear, even if it is not spoken--it may be  unspoken--and that is what our purpose is. It is not just taking sexual  assault out of the chain  [[Page S3328]]  of command of decision but also felonies, serious crimes that may be  intertwined and interrelated with sexual assault, as they so often are  in the civilian world, whether it is obstruction, intimidation of  witnesses, assault, other crimes that may be related to it.   So I believe sincerely that this Secretary of Defense is committed to  ending sexual assault. I talked to one of the nominees for a prominent  position in the Department of Defense; I believe he is firmly  committed. I have talked to others who have been confirmed or who will  be nominated; they are firmly committed.   Let's make that commitment real and approve this legislation because  the numbers have belied the promises. The results have betrayed the  good intention, and now it is time for action.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in just hours, we will be voting on  the nomination of Kristen Clarke to be Assistant Attorney General for  the Civil Rights Division in the United States Department of Justice.   I am proud tonight to advocate for her, not that she needs my voice  in her support. She is a brilliant leader and advocate. She has  dedicated her entire career to protecting the civil rights of all  Americans, and she has an extraordinary record to show for it.   She reminds me of the legal warriors in the Department of Justice  during the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s who battled for the rule of law in  supporting children who were trying to gain entry to desegregated  schools, in voters who sought to uphold the franchise, and in men and  women who challenged the denial of their rights in the South and  throughout the country. The Department of Justice became a beacon of  law enforcement in its upholding of the civil rights of America, and  she is in that great tradition--fierce and fearless, strong and  unyielding and tenacious in defending and advocating for the rights and  liberties of Americans when they are denied those rights and liberties  guaranteed under the Constitution and our statutes.   She served as the civil rights chief for the New York Attorney  General in the civil rights bureau. She served as assistant counsel for  the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She served as a Federal  prosecutor during the Bush administration in the Civil Rights  Division's Criminal Section and Voting Section, the very divisions that  she has been nominated now to lead.   She knows these issues. She knows civil rights and civil liberty  issues and law because she has worked on them for more than two  decades. She cares about these issues because her life has  [[Page S3331]]  been dedicated to them, and she understands these issues on a deeply  personal level. She knows them inside and out because she served to  fight for them inside and out of the DOJ, inside and out of the New  York Attorney General's Office, inside and out of the organization  whose mission is to protect them, and she is the daughter of immigrants  who grew up in the Nation's largest public housing complex. She is also  the mother of a 16-year-old son, who is growing up in this moment of  reckoning for racial justice, equality, and equity in America.   If memory serves me, she also once took a field trip to the Hartford  area, in Connecticut, and watched a then comparatively young State  attorney general who was arguing in court in a desegregation case. Now,  I have no illusions that this experience played any part in her desire  to use her extraordinary skills and talents and gifts and education as  a public servant and lawyer for the public good, but that has been her  career, and that is exactly what we need now at the helm of the Civil  Rights Division.   There is no excuse for waiting another moment to confirm her to this  most important post. She is the civil rights chief for this moment  because we are in a moment of reckoning. Justice, equity, and equality  are on the line now, and her strength and tenacity meet this moment.   Unfortunately, there are some on the other side who have used Ms.  Clarke's nomination to make baseless allegations against her, including  allegations that she supports abolishing the police. To support this  distortion, they have repeatedly invoked a 2020 op-ed written by Ms.  Clarke and published by Newsweek. I want to meet that article head on  because, at our Judiciary Committee's markup just 2 weeks ago, Senator  Cruz selectively excerpted portions of that op-ed, claiming that they  demonstrated that Ms. Clarke ``explicitly'' advocated abolishing the  police.   There is only one problem with this argument: Ms. Clarke never wrote  that. It just isn't true. Ms. Clarke's piece is a thoughtful call to  rethink how we approach law enforcement in a country that is going  through a moment in which thousands of Americans have called out for  real reform, real change, real action.    I have been proud to be involved in peaceful demonstrations and  rallies throughout the State of Connecticut--probably 20 or maybe more  of them over the last summer--when young people led these public calls  for justice in policing, justice in housing, justice in the workplace,  and justice in healthcare--all of them implicated in this moment.   The fact is the word ``abolition'' appears only once in the entire  op-ed. That word appears once in the op-ed--``abolition''--when it is  used to describe the huge range of views held by others, activists and  local governments. That is it. That word ``abolition'' is used to  describe the views of others, not her views.   Senator Cruz has also distorted her record in another way in claiming  she had written a provocative email comparing the police to the Ku Klux  Klan. That is simply not true. In reality, the passage Senator Cruz  quoted was written by someone else--an activist--in an essay that Ms.  Clarke had simply forwarded in an email. In the email, the subject line  includes the actual author's name, and the essay is signed at the end  by the author.   Had Senator Cruz bothered to look at the entirety of the email and of  that document instead of cherry-picking a line to fit his preconceived  narrative, he would have known, and it would have been truer to the  facts here. Ms. Clarke no more wrote the words Senator Cruz attributed  to her than he did.   At a time when the country faces a moment of reckoning over racial  justice, the Civil Rights Division needs someone with Ms. Clarke's  knowledge, skill, dexterity of thinking, life experience, heart, and  dedication because these challenges are immense and they need to be  addressed. She is the person for this moment. That is exactly what she  will do, address the need for equity and equality in civil rights  enforcement. She will be tenacious but thoughtful and insightful and  true to the law, serving the rule of law. She is a dedicated and  devoted public servant, committed to equal justice, civil rights, and  the rule of law.   I have seen that firsthand, and I know I am not the only one who  thinks so. The letters the Judiciary Committee has received in support  of her nomination reflect a broad, professionally and ideologically  diverse coalition of individuals and organizations that know that she  is, without a doubt, eminently qualified for this position.   That support includes law enforcement, like the Major Cities Chiefs  Association, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement  Executives, the National Association of Women Law Enforcement  Executives, the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association,  and 71 former attorneys general from red States and blue States.   The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives wrote:         Ms. Clarke has displayed the qualities of leadership,       empathy, excellence, and persistence in supporting and       defending the U.S. Constitution while ensuring equal       protection and justice for all Americans.    The 71 former attorneys general wrote:         Kristen Clarke is someone with immense credibility among       community leaders in each of our states--she has handled       cases of hate crimes, constitutional policing, human       trafficking, and voting rights, and, most recently, has done       effective work on violent extremism and the threat that it       poses to our citizens.    I believe strongly that Kristen Clarke should be confirmed right  away, without delay, and I encourage all of my colleagues to see the  baseless allegations against her for what they are--a distortion--and I  urge them to support her nomination. I have confronted those  allegations. They are unworthy of repetition, but I think my colleagues  should know the truth behind them. The Civil Rights Division and the  American people need Kristen Clarke.   For me, this vote feels very personal. Two of my four children are  graduating literally today and during this week from law school. I hope  they will use the great gifts that they have, the skills that they have  acquired, and the advocacy that they have been learning to advance the  public interests in the way that Kristen Clarke has done throughout her  extraordinary career. I hope they will regard her as a role model  because she has sought justice.   She has fought to uphold the rights of people who are vulnerable,  Americans who are voiceless, and ordinary Americans, who all too often  have been denied their rights. She has stood up for them; she has  spoken out; and I hope we will confirm her tomorrow with a bipartisan  vote.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
