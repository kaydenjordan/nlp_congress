 Mr. Speaker, we are fiddling while freedom burns. We have  5 legislative days left to aid our allies, Israel and Ukraine.   Each hour we wait makes it harder for our allies to defend freedom  and democracy against tyrants and terrorists.   OMB Director Shalanda Young made it clear this week that the past  resources we secured for Ukraine have run out.   As Speaker Johnson said in Florida, Putin won't stop in Ukraine. He  will continue to devour territory and undermine democracy until he is  stopped.   My Republican colleagues ask what the plan is in Ukraine and Israel.  The plan is to win. The plan is to defeat Putin. The plan is to  vanquish terrorism generally and Hamas in particular.   Most Members agree on that plan--300 on Ukraine and 400 on Israel. I  urge the Speaker to give us the opportunity to act on that consensus  now. Freedom demands it.                            ____________________
