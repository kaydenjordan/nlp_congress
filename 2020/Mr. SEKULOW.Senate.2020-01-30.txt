 Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, so, I guess  you can buy--that is what it sounds like; you can buy a foreign  interference. If you purchase it, if you purchase their opposition  research, I guess that is OK.   So let me try to debunk the conspiracy, Manager Jeffries; and that  is, it is not conspiracy that Christopher Steele was engaged to obtain  and prepare a dossier on the Presidential candidate for the Republican  Party, Donald Trump. It is not a conspiracy that Christopher Steele  utilized his network of assets--including assets, apparently, in  Russia--to draft the dossier. It is not a conspiracy that the dossier  was shared with the Department of Justice through Bruce Ohr, who was  the No. 4 ranking member of the Department of Justice at that time,  because his wife, Nellie Ohr, happened to be working for the  organization, Fusion GPS, that was putting the dossier together. This  is also not a conspiracy. It sounds like one, except it is real. And it  is also not a conspiracy that that dossier--purchased dossier--was  taken by the FBI, submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court to obtain a foreign intelligence surveillance order on an  American citizen. It is also not a conspiracy that that court issued an  order--two of them now--condemning the FBI's practice and acknowledging  that many of those orders were not properly issued. None of that is a  conspiracy theory. That is just the facts.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Wisconsin.
