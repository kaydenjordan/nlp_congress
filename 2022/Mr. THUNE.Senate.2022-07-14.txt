 Madam President, yesterday morning, June inflation numbers  were released. And, as usual with this administration, the news was not  good.   Inflation rose once again in June to 9.1 percent--the highest  inflation since November of 1981. November of 1981. I was in college  the last time inflation was this bad.   Americans are suffering. Everywhere Americans turn, they are being  asked to pay more--more for cleaning supplies, more for gas, more for  health insurance, more for groceries.   A new analysis yesterday from the Joint Economic Committee found that  inflation will cost the average American household a staggering $718 a  month over the next year--$718 per month. That will happen even if  prices stop going up tomorrow--$718 per month, more than $8,600 for the  year. No working family can afford that.   A major reason that we are in this crisis is because of Democrats'  decision to flood the economy with unnecessary government money with  their so-called American Rescue Plan Act. And, unfortunately, there is  no easy solution to the crisis they helped create. But the first  thing--the first thing--should be to do no more harm.   Incredibly, however, Democrats are currently attempting to double  down on the strategy that helped create this crisis in the first place  by passing a version of the Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree  they tried to force through last year.   Apparently, Democrats think more government spending--like the  government spending that helped get us into this mess--plus new taxes  are a good solution for an inflation crisis and an economy teetering on  the brink of recession.   Madam President, if Democrats want to help our country get out of  this inflation crisis, more unnecessary government spending and new  taxes are the exact wrong way to go about it. In fact, the biggest  thing the Democrats can do to avoid making this crisis worse is by  flooding the economy with more unnecessary government money.   After that, the biggest thing Democrats and the administration in  particular can do to help alleviate this crisis is to unleash American  energy production. I don't need to tell anyone that energy prices have  been a major contributor to our inflation crisis. Gas prices are up  nearly 60 percent--60 percent. The current cost of a gallon of regular  gas is $4.60--almost double what it was when President Biden took  office just 18 months ago--and the price of diesel is even worse, which  is a big concern for farmers and ranchers back home in South Dakota and  around the country, not to mention all of our truckers. Electricity-- that is up 13 percent. Utility gas service is up 38 percent. Americans  everywhere are feeling the pinch.   Of course, high gas prices and utility prices don't just cause direct  pain at the pump; they also contribute to higher prices across the  economy, which means that lowering energy prices is one of the most  important things we can do to help ease high prices on a variety of  goods. The way to lower energy prices is to unleash American energy  production, including and especially conventional energy production.  Unfortunately, the President has shown and continues to show a clear  hostility to conventional energy production despite the fact that our  economy cannot function without conventional energy.   Now, I am a longtime supporter of alternative energy, from wind to  biofuels, and I come from a State that derives a substantial portion of  its electricity generation from wind. In fact, in 2021, over 50 percent  of our State's power generation came from wind and 30 percent came from  hydroelectric power on the Missouri River. But if it weren't for  traditional fossil fuels backing up that generation, we would be left  in the dark.   The fact is, no matter how much Democrats might wish it were  otherwise, alternative energy technology has simply not advanced to the  point where our country can rely exclusively on alternative energy.  That means that, unless we want Americans to be permanently buried  under the pain of high gas prices, we need to invest in responsible  production of oil and natural gas.   We have tremendous natural resources here at home, and the ability to  extract those resources is a far more environmentally responsible way  than frequently happens in other countries. But unleashing American  production is going to require action from the President, who, despite  the current energy price crisis, continues to display hostility to  domestic production. He touts the number of leases oil and gas  companies have available, but he fails to mention that just 3 months  ago his administration made it harder for oil and gas companies to  actually make use of the leases in question by increasing the  regulatory burden for environmental reviews. On top of this, thousands  of drilling permits, which are required to actually begin drilling on  oil and gas leases, are currently stuck in the approval process at the  Department of the Interior.   At the beginning of this month, the administration released a new  offshore drilling plan which includes an option to offer, at most, a  paltry 11 new leases over the next 5 years. It also leaves the door  open for zero new leases--zero. If this proposed 5-year plan doesn't  make it clear that the President isn't interested in increasing our  domestic energy production, I don't know what does.   Madam President, I could go on. I could mention the administration's  proposed SEC climate-disclosure rules that are designed to discourage  investment in conventional energy or the President's quest to increase  taxes on domestic oil and gas production or Democrats' efforts to  impose a new fee--or tax--on methane that could cost consumers an  additional $35 billion to $69 billion annually, but I will leave it  there.   Madam President, I hope--I really hope--that the President and his  administration will take a good, hard look at their hostility to  conventional energy production. Inflation is at 9.1 percent--9.1  percent. American families are paying nearly twice what they were  paying in gas prices just 18 months ago, and utility gas prices have  increased sharply.   Unless Democrats want Americans to be facing staggering prices at the  pump and on store shelves for the long term, the administration needs  to start encouraging domestic production of conventional energy. That  means not just approving leases but making it easier for oil and gas  companies to actually develop those leases and produce oil and natural  gas. It means encouraging, not discouraging, investment in responsible  conventional production and infrastructure like natural gas pipelines.  It means giving up attempts to discourage domestic energy production  with new and higher taxes or burdensome ESG regulations.   American families are struggling, Madam President. The President can  actually do something to help them, and I sincerely hope that he will.   I yield the floor.
