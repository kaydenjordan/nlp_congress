 Mr. President, through the Presiding Officer, I would  like to talk to both of our leaders and thank them for the work they  have done. I, too, look forward to having numbers of amendments.   I think many people here are aware that I have an amendment that  deals with the 232 tariff issue, and I know there is a lot of interest  in that amendment. We actually have strong bipartisan support from a  range of very respected Senators.   There has been a blue slip issued that has been erased. I was asked  by Senator Inhofe, as well as by Senator McConnell, to solve the blue- slip issue. I just wanted Members to know we have talked to the  Parliamentarian, and I plan to ask unanimous consent, after we vote to  move to the bill, for a very short paragraph to be consented to that  would then solve the blue-slip issue and then cause my amendment to be  able to be heard without, in any way, tainting the bill should it move  across the Senate floor to the House.   I have given that language to the well. I know they are going to talk  to Laura Dove and Gary a little bit about it. I just wanted to make you  aware, as a courtesy, that I do plan, after we move to the bill, to ask  unanimous consent on something that should be totally unobjectionable  and that in no way prejudices my amendment in a favorable way; it just  allows us to move to it without having the blue-slip issue that has  been raised.    Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I had a conversation with Senator Inhofe  and Senator Reed earlier. I talked a little bit about resolving a blue- slip issue. I think many Members here are aware that I want to offer an  amendment that deals with our ability to weigh in on the tariffs that  were put in place under section 232 of the trade act--national security  issues.   I think we may have found a resolution to that, but I don't want to  offer it right now. I know that Senator Inhofe, not knowing whether it  works yet for him and the committee, would have to object, and I don't  want that to be the case. I want us to continue to work on this. So I  am not going to offer an amendment and statement thereof relative to  this.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I don't see anybody else on the floor who  wishes to speak. So I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday, June  12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5515. Finally, I ask  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:47 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 12, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
