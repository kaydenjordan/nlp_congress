 Madam Speaker, we have talked a lot about border  security this week, but I rise today to talk about a lot more than what  goes on at the border.   Tens of thousands of people die from opioid addiction every year,  including hundreds in the Fifth District alone.   Yesterday, on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I was reminded of the  many heroes I have met in law enforcement who try to prevent some of  these tragedies; heroes who help people at the end of their ropes,  people who see no way out; heroes like Sheriffs Bob Mosier of Fauquier  County and Mike Taylor of Pittsylvania County.   This issue is important for my district and close to my heart. My  immediate family has been affected by opioids and its awful and  persistent hold. Localities across my district have been ravaged by the  crisis, from Fauquier County in the north, to Pittsylvania County in  the south.   They need our help. Our law enforcement needs our help. Our  communities need our help. I call on Congress to act.                            ____________________
