 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the farm bills that we take up every few  years are essential pieces of legislation. They help provide the tools  and resources that farmers and ranchers need to carry out their task of  feeding our Nation. And with parts of the 2018 farm bill expiring in  the next few months, passing our next farm bill needs to be one of  Congress's top priorities during the remainder of the year.   The Senate Agriculture Committee has been working on this year's  legislation, but there is more work to be done. And we need to make  sure that we don't delay in getting this bill over the finish line.  Farmers and ranchers already face a lot of uncertainty in their  profession--few jobs are as subject to market fluctuations or the whims  of the weather--and the least that we can do here in Congress is make  sure they know that the critical programs won't be expiring and they  will continue to have access to essential resources that help make  farming and ranching possible.   As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and a Senator from a  State where agriculture is not just ``a'' way of life but ``the'' way  of life, the farm bill is always one of my top priorities.   I have had the privilege of helping to craft four farm bills during  my time in Congress; and, for me, the process always begins and ends  with farmers and ranchers.   I have been gearing up for the 2023 farm bill pretty much since work  finished on the last one. And, last year, I kicked off a series of  roundtables with agriculture producers to hear firsthand from farmers  and ranchers what they need from this year's farm bill.   These formal discussions, along with the many informal conversations  I regularly have with farmers and ranchers, have provided me with  invaluable feedback, and I am working on a number of measures for this  year's farm bill that reflect the input I have received from South  Dakota producers.   One thing that farmers have made clear is the critical role of the  farm safety net. Crop insurance is the cornerstone of the farm safety  net, and it needs to be maintained and, to the extent possible,  strengthened in the next farm bill.   Currently, the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage  programs, which help offset losses when prices for agricultural  commodities drop, are not always proving sufficient. And one of my top  priorities for this year's bill is improving commodity and livestock  programs to ensure that farmers and ranchers have sufficient backup.   I am also working to make the Conservation Reserve Program a more  effective option for producers and landowners. Currently, the program  doesn't  [[Page S2448]]  sufficiently support grazing infrastructure, which limits the benefit  of participating for some producers.   And the annual payment limit for this program hasn't changed since it  was first created in 1985. To address these issues, I introduced the  Conservation Reserve Program Improvement Act, which will provide more  flexibility for producers and increase the payment cap to account for  increased land values. And I will work to ensure that the CRP  Improvement Act is included in the final farm bill.   In addition to farmed crops, livestock production is an integral part  of South Dakota's agricultural economy. And one of my top priorities  for this year's farm bill is addressing some of the challenges facing  South Dakota livestock producers in getting their products to  Americans' tables.   The last few years have revealed some vulnerabilities in our food  supply chain that had an outsized impact on agricultural and livestock  producers.   Early pandemic closures, for example, of some meat processing plants  led to bottlenecks in processing livestock and delays for a lot of  ranchers, and this led to supply shortages and empty cases at the  grocery store. Shortages caused by lack of processing capacity, not a  lack of livestock. It has become clear that livestock producers need  more processing options, and one way we can reduce dependence on the  big packers is by expanding smaller meatpackers' capacity.   I have introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act to help  smaller processors invest in the infrastructure they need to expand. My  bill would also allow more State-inspected meat products to be sold  across State lines, which would open up new markets for small meat  processors and the farmers and ranchers who supply them. I have also  introduced legislation--the bipartisan American Beef Labeling Act--to  require the U.S. Trade representative to develop a World Trade  Organization-compliant means of reinstating mandatory country of origin  labeling for beef.   Under our current system, beef that is neither born nor raised in the  United States but is simply finished here can be labeled ``product of  the United States,'' even if the only American thing about the beef is  the plastic that it is wrapped in, if that.   That is unfair to American cattle producers and misleading to  consumers, and I am pleased that USDA is working on a proposed rule to  close the ``product of the U.S.A.'' labeling loophole.   And I will continue to work to get my American Beef Labeling Act  included in the 2023 farm bill so that consumers can be confident that  any beef labeled ``product of the U.S.A.'' really came from American  cattle producers.   New practices and technologies can be game-changers for farmers, and  without reliable data, it can be unclear whether these practices and  technologies will have positive impact. And that is why, earlier this  year, I introduced the Agriculture Innovation Act, which would make it  easier for producers and trusted researchers to use USDA data to assess  the impact of various production practices, so that producers can gauge  whether these practices are right for their farm or ranch operation.   And, of course, while the macrolevel data USDA collects can provide  valuable information, farmers are already beginning to look to the next  frontier, collecting realtime, microlevel data from their own fields.   And I have introduced the Promoting Precision Agriculture Act to help  advance precision agriculture technology and to allow more farmers to  take advantage of this data revolution. And because without a reliable  internet connection, precision agriculture technology doesn't get very  far, I am also working to ensure that my bill to streamline USDA's  broadband authorities and ensure that funding goes to areas where at  least 90 percent of households lack broadband access is included in  this year's farm bill.   Producing the food that fills Americans' dinner tables is no easy  task, and we owe the men and women who do this important work the  certainty that the programs they depend on will be there for them. I  hope that leaders in both houses of Congress will put passing the 2023  farm bill at the very top of our to-do list.   And I will do everything I can to advance this important legislation.  And today and every day, I will continue to make farmers and ranchers  my priority.   I yield the floor.
