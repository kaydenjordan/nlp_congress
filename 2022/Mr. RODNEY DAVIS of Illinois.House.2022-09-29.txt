 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share the  somber news of the passing of a member of our United States Capitol  Police, Officer William Thomas, who succumbed to his fight against  cancer early last week.   Members and staff know the level of service and sacrifice a U.S.  Capitol Police officer commits to every day that they report to duty.  We are aware of the threats they face and the inherent risk of their  position. We are all indebted to the security they provide as we walk  by them at every door and throughout the Capitol. But we often forget  the private battles that they may be fighting.   Officer Thomas served Congress as a member of the U.S. Capitol Police  for 14 years, first assigned to the Senate division in 2008, and then  detailed to the communications team in June of 2021. As he continued to  serve the Capitol community, his department, and his country, he  received his diagnosis of cancer.   Officer Thomas continued to put on his uniform and badge. The U.S.  Capitol Police is built of individuals who inspire me by their  unparalleled level of service and bravery. Officer William Thomas was  one of those individuals.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to share my sincerest condolences to his family  and his friends, as well as the officers and staff of the U.S. Capitol  Police Department of whom many worked by his side.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4791, a bill that will  establish a 10-year term limit for the Director of the Government  Publishing Office.   I thank my friend in the Senate, Senator Roy Blunt, for introducing  this bill earlier this month, and for the Senate's quick action on it.  Although a change to a term limit may seem inconsequential, I would  like to encourage my colleagues that this is a bill that will greatly  benefit the entire legislative branch.   The GPO plays a vital role for our Congress. As the original  ``Government's Printer,'' the agency has supported the House and the  Senate for over 160 years. Although Americans engage with their  government in much different ways than they did in 1861 when the GPO  first opened its door, the agency has adapted. It has upheld its vision  to achieve an ``America Informed'' by updating processes, technology,  products, and even its name, to meet the needs of Americans today.   Much of the strategic success over time can be pinned down to two  driving forces: Congress keeping GPO accountable to the needs of the  institution, and strong agency leadership.   Today, we find ourselves at a time when GPO is under the strongest  leadership it has seen in decades. Director Hugh Halpern is a man whose  career was shaped in the House of Representatives. From working on  numerous House committees, including the Rules Committee, to being  Director of Floor Operations, Hugh knows our institution and has taken  that knowledge to the GPO.   In the time since his appointment, he has greatly increased the  transparency of the GPO, of course, with congressional oversight; has  launched numerous modernization initiatives to ensure that GPO products  truly serve Congress and the American people; and got GPO back to work  faster than any other legislative branch agency as we overcame the  pandemic.   The strategic plan GPO has in place is setting a course of  predictable and accountable progress, a plan that should be supported  by stable leadership. Right now, GPO is unlike other legislative branch  agencies in not having a set term for its director. S. 4791 corrects  that and aligns the GPO director position with its counterparts by  establishing a 10-year term limit.   Not only does this strengthen the agency by increasing institutional  stability, but it also reinforces that the Director of the GPO serves  Congress and the American people, not the executive branch.   I am thankful for Director Halpern's leadership and innovation at the  GPO, and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to  further the GPO's accountability to this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I actually have some time left myself and was debating on what to  talk about. I don't really have anything to talk about with successful  fantasy football teams this weekend, so I am actually glad that my  colleague brought up the Electoral College Act.   What we saw in the Senate were some changes to their legislation that  we had requested the House majority do when that bill passed the House  last week, so I am excited to see those changes in the Senate.   I am excited that the chairperson mentioned during our rules debate  last week that maybe we could have a conference committee. That is a  chance for bipartisan agreement on a very important issue, so I look  forward to seeing whether that opportunity presents itself.   But as we stand here today, Mr. Speaker, we are trying to put the  Government Publishing Office Director in line with every other  executive branch appointed legislative branch employee, like the  Architect of the Capitol, like the Librarian of Congress.   What is happening at the GPO has garnered bipartisan support today,  and we need to continue to see that progress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is a different day here on the House floor for a  debate over a bill with Committee on House Administration jurisdiction.  I once again agree with the majority that this is a good piece of  legislation, albeit I was a little concerned when my colleague just  mentioned that officials in California and Illinois support this bill.  I had to take a step back and realize, well, maybe I will talk to my  team about who those officials are before I offer my wholehearted  support.   But in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker, as part of the Help America Vote  Act created in 2002, Congress authorized funding for the Protection and  Advocacy for Voting Access program to help ensure every eligible  American, regardless of their abilities, can participate in the  election process and cast their ballot privately and independently.   Funds for the PAVA program are currently allocated to only 55 of 57  legally established protection and advocacy systems across the country.  The bill today makes an important correction to ensure that both the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the American Indian  consortium are included as eligible recipients for the first time.   This bill, as mentioned by my colleague, sponsored by my good friend,  Senator Roy Blunt, passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and  Republicans on the Committee on House Administration are supportive of  these changes and have no issues with the bill.   To be honest, I am somewhat disappointed that my colleagues in the  majority on the Committee on House Administration have chosen not to  pass this bill under suspension. For months, our staffs have been  working together to pair the PAVA Program Inclusion Act with H.R. 8517,  the Confirmation of Congressional Observer Access Act, a  noncontroversial bill brought forward by Subcommittee on Elections  Ranking Member Bryan Steil.   Both bills make nonpartisan, noncontroversial amendments to HAVA. Mr.  Steil's bill doesn't change Federal law or practice but simply provides  a citation of convenience for existing law that gives the House  authority to deploy official observers to watch the conduct of  congressional elections in the States and territories.   Both Democrats and Republicans have long deployed House staff as  election observers to monitor congressional elections. Sometimes, our  observers have had access difficulties, including in a widely  publicized event in Maricopa County, Arizona, 2 years ago.   So, we listened when many State and local election officials asked  Congress to speak more clearly about this constitutional exercise so  they can more readily provide access for our observers, which is why  our committee staffs had agreed in principle to move both bills  together.   That was until just a few weeks ago when the Democrats' staff said  they had issues. But when my staff reached out, they couldn't say what  those issues were and met my staff with silence.   We gave Democrats another opportunity to bring these bills up  together during Rules Committee earlier this week when Mr. Steil  offered an amendment to include his election observer bill, but it was  rejected along party lines.   Now, we are here on the House floor talking about a bill that should  have passed under suspension alongside Congressman Steil's commonsense  bill to ensure integrity and faith in our elections.   While I will support the bill before us today, I urge my Democrat  colleagues in the majority to quickly bring forward the Confirmation of  Congressional Observer Access Act for a vote, as well.   I was encouraged by comments earlier this week at the Committee on  [[Page H8233]]  Rules by my good friend, the chair of the Subcommittee on Elections,  Congressman G.K. Butterfield, about Mr. Steil's good piece of  legislation and continue to hope we can work together on a bipartisan  basis to make it law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), my good  friend.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, could I make a quick point  of personal privilege?   Is there any way to get the time of that ``magic minute'' this time?  I want to sign a printout from the Congressional Record for my good  friend from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask Majority Leader  Hoyer about his time.   I have somewhat become used to being the antagonist to some of the  majority's legislation when it comes to election administration, which  I think has been so shortsighted on its impact to the American people.  But this is one of those opportunities where we see good legislation  come from the Senate, and this is an opportunity for us to show the  American people that Republicans and Democrats can get along and pass  important bills that are going to positively impact those who are  disabled, and ensure that every single person who may be dealing with a  disability in this country and in our territories has the right to  vote, the eligibility to vote, and the opportunity to vote. That is  what this bill does.   Really, I have got to thank again my colleague, Roy Blunt, Senator  Blunt, who used to be in leadership in this institution, as many of us  know and remember so well. I thank him for bringing Republicans and  Democrats on the House Administration Committee and Leader Hoyer and I  together on this very important issue.   I wish he would have come in earlier on some other issues, we might  have had a little more bipartisan agreement. I will have to talk to him  about that and ask him why he didn't do that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends, Leader Hoyer and Chairperson  Lofgren, and I thank the staff for pushing this important bill forward.   I am disappointed and optimistic that we did not get the election  observer fixes that both parties want and need and election  administrators throughout the country have asked us to address. I am  disappointed that was not part of a suspension agreement, where this  bill should have been. I am cautiously optimistic with the great  opportunity for bipartisanship that we are seeing here today that maybe  it can continue after today. I won't hold my breath, but I will  continue to remain optimistic and, hopefully, see that moving forward  very quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Steil for his remarks, and I thank  Leader Hoyer and, also, again, my good friend, Mr. Blunt, for all their  hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding.   This is the first time we have heard these concerns, on the House  floor today. We have not had any discussion between our staffs. I would  have loved to have worked through some of these.
