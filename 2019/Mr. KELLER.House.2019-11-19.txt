 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District, I congratulate the Loyalsock Lancers  Marching Band on their recent State championship at the 2019 Cavalcade  of Bands.   The Lancers 2019 show entitled, ``Heart of the Machine,'' Tin Man's  journey to finding his heart, has been noted as leaving fans on their  feet cheering during halftime events at football games and during their  competition season.   The Loyalsock Lancers Marching Band has a rich history of success,  winning the 2017 Cavalcade of Bands, being 20-time Tournament of Bands  Region 4 champions, and marching in the National Outback Bowl parade.  The band is the only band in North America to open for the performing  group DRUMLine Live.   Even given this rich history of achievement, band director Ryan  Bulgarelli said that the 2019 Lancers are possibly the best in school  history. Again, I congratulate the Loyalsock Lancers Marching Band on  their recent State championship.                            ____________________
