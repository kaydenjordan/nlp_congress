 Mr. President, the majority leader referred to what we are  doing this evening as ``awash with good news.'' Well, it is also awash  with earmarks. They have not been around for over 10 years, and we are  bringing them back.   I am going to call up an amendment here in a bit that is going to  talk about what to do about them, but I think you need to have a  backdrop of what we are doing here this evening.   I am on the Budget Committee, and we didn't report out a budget  resolution, and I don't think we have done a budget consistently for  over 10 years.   This is the biggest business in the world that now is spending close  to $5 trillion--only $1.5 trillion of it that is even subject to review  because the one ingenious thing that we have done here is put most of  our spending on autopilot. That is what drives the government  currently, and that means that the Budget Committee is a useless  appendage because we don't use it anymore.   I got here a little over 3 years ago. We were $18 trillion in debt.  Now we are over $30 trillion in debt, and everyone seems to shrug their  shoulders. That is not a good business plan, for Americans to be  borrowing money, even if it has good stuff in it, when it is for  consumption. It will only end up in a hard reconciliation down the  road.   Now, let's talk about earmarks. It is kind of a gateway drug to more  spending. There are 367 pages of earmarks. I just took a quick poll how  much it weighs in paper--4 to 5 pounds. We haven't had them for over 10  years, and now they are back.   In the House, they said they are OK with it. In the Senate, the other  side of the aisle said they are OK with it. We said we are not OK with  it in our Republican conference, but any Senator can do it anyway.   Those are called gimmicks and loopholes, and that is the way the  place works. None of us here are sure how much money is actually being  devoted to these. It is a wasteful tool that was away for a long time,  and it is on top of a budget that was never done, and what we are doing  this evening was supposed to have been done by September 30 of last  year. Too many people depend on this place to have a system that is run  by the seat of its pants.   You bring the earmarks back--well, there are supposed to be a few  rules that go with them.   You are supposed to make them public 2 days before you actually have  to vote on them. Well, that didn't happen. The text was released at  1:30 a.m. yesterday--2,700 pages. The House passed it only after 20  hours of review. That is at the rate of about having to come up with  finding out a billion dollars a minute of what is in it.   Members are supposed to have a financial disclosure attached to any  earmark. That hasn't happened either. It is just one of those simple  details that seem to never get attended to in this place.   Let's look at a few of the doozies.   One earmark spends half a million dollars to promote health equity in  Yonkers in New York.   One spends $1.6 million for university research into equitable  shellfish aquaculture. I don't know what that is, but it is in Rhode  Island.   One earmark spends $300,000 on the Alliance for Gun Responsibility  Foundation, a leftwing lobbying group that claims that the Second  Amendment has a history of being used as a tool of White supremacy.   These are three samples of hundreds and hundreds of earmarks. It is  not what the American public deserves. They expect more out of us. It  should be a merit-based system on what we spend here. It should be  going through regular order on the Budget Committee I am on, where you  bring people in to testify. Do you actually need more money? What you  did spend the year before, was it spent well? That is the way all other  places in this country do  [[Page S1105]]  it because it is the only thing that works. Here, the system has been  so degraded, this is what we end up with.   I will end with this: Most of my colleagues here, I think, view this  place as a growth business, but a growth business is based on a few  things. You generally make a profit. That is not what this is about.  But you balance your budget, you do things that make sense year after  year. And when you are spending money that constitutes almost 20  percent of our GDP, you would think you would put more into it than  dropping 2,700 pages in our lap and thinking that you can get through  it.   For those who want more of this, for the sake of the institution, you  ought to be concerned about what it is going to look like down the road  when we add another $1.5 trillion in debt to our current $30 trillion,  and there is no end in sight. A lot of stories have been written  throughout history on where that ends up, and it is in the ditch.   The Medicare trust fund will be completely exhausted in about 4\1/2\  years; 18 percent benefit cuts when that happens.   Actuarially, we have known the Social Security fund is going to go  broke in about 10 or 11 years. What will we do? We will probably wait  until the year before it happens, not make any other reforms, and then  borrow the money to backfill it and put more and more obligation on our  kids and our grandkids.   I am going to call up my amendment in a bit.   I will yield the floor at this time.                            ____________________     Madam President, I call up my amendment, No. 4990, and ask  that it be reported by number.  [[Page S1109]]     Madam President, this bill has 367 pages worth of  earmarks, roughly 5 pounds of paper. Before it came to the Senate,  dozens of House offices deleted their public disclosures. I think the  swamp is rising again.   Dr. Tom Coburn, he would be appalled by this. He called earmarks-- Madam President, I think it is clear that most aren't interested in  talking about earmarks--something else. I believe they lead to waste  and abuse. That is why Congress got rid of them 10 years ago. They  should have never been allowed back.    My amendment would cut every one of them from this bill that should  have been run through regular process, through the Budget Committee, to  where appropriators should have known what was in it until it landed in  our laps last night.   For anyone here that loves the institution, you ought to have enough  common sense that $1.5 trillion deficits that are embedded in this bill  aren't a good business plan for the institution. I ask you all here  this evening: Make a statement--a symbolic one--to get rid of these  earmarks.    And let's quit shoving all this debt onto the next  generation and on our kids.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
