 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J.  Res. 43. This resolution is simply another attack on women's health and  another attempt by Republicans to limit women's access to high-quality,  essential care.   For decades, title X family planning program has funded grants that  provide millions of Americans each year with access to a broad range of  preventive health services, including contraception care and cancer  screenings. Title X is a critical safety net for low-income women and  teens; and for many patients, this program is their only source of  health care.  [[Page H1270]]    But the Republicans want to limit access to these services and allow  States to discriminate against certain providers, all as part of their  ongoing ideological crusade against abortion.   I stress, this resolution would permit States to prohibit  reproductive healthcare providers from participating in the title X  program, and would allow States to block access to care if the provider  separately performs abortions or is affiliated with health centers that  do.    Now, we already have seen what happens when States take actions to  discriminate against providers in the title X program. Access goes  down, the unintended pregnancy rate goes up, and the spread of sexually  transmitted infections increases.   So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution  because Republicans should not be entitled to pick and choose providers  in the title X program and play politics with women's health.
