 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to talk about my good friend, Senator  Bunning, a mentor to me. I first came across Senator Bunning when I was  a young boy watching baseball and watching him pitch for the Detroit  Tigers and for the Philadelphia Phillies. But I really got to know  them--and when I say ``them,'' it is because most of us from Kentucky  cannot talk about Jim Bunning without saying Jim and Mary. It is just  Jim and Mary. They were grammar school sweethearts. I think the only  people they ever dated were each other.  [[Page H5100]]    It was wonderful to see Mary the other day, unfortunately under these  circumstances, but a wonderful lady.   I have a couple of stories. When I first thought I might run for  public office for the State senate--and my now 23-year-old was 5, and I  had a 3-year-old son--I went to Oldham County, Kentucky, to meet Jim  Bunning. And, of course, you show up, there is Jim and Mary. And she  said: ``Are you going to be our candidate in the 32nd District?''   And I said: ``Well, I just don't know. I am really concerned about  it. I have got a young family.''   And she looked at me and she said: ``Young man, I have raised nine  kids''--I think at that point 20-something grandkids--``we have done  politics, we have done baseball, city council.'' She went through a  whole list of things. And I will never forget she said: ``You are  worried about your family because of the experiences that you have had,  and you want them to have the same kind of experiences, but you have  got to take your family and make your family experiences. Our kids have  gotten to do things no other kid has gotten to do because of the  positions and the things that we have done as a family.''   You know, when you start to run for office, you kind of want to talk  yourself out of it. So I will never forget driving back home convinced  that, yes, I am going to run for this office. I walked in, and the  first thing my wife said is: ``Guess what. We are going to have our  third child.''   I guarantee you, if I had not had that conversation with Mary  Bunning, and after my wife telling me during the time of that decision  we are going to have another one--now our 19-year-old--I wouldn't have  moved forward.   My other story is Senator Bunning took me under his wing. I won my  first race by 130 votes out of 27,000 cast. Jim Bunning was running in  a fight for his life for the U.S. Senate. Bob Dole comes to Bowling  Green, Kentucky, to have a rally for Senator Bunning, and he wanted me  to speak. Well, then we see people around town like this that are  operatives for our parties, and this one guy says: ``No. No State, no  local candidates. Only Federal candidates can speak.''    I had to leave the podium because this young, 25-year-old guy said  that. And Jim Bunning looks over--and they are all there for his  rally--he says: ``If he is not speaking, I am not speaking.''   So the next thing I know, I got on the agenda. They said: ``Yeah.  Three minutes.''   So I had my 3-minute talk.   The final thing I want to say is that one of my favorite Jim Bunning  stories is he did not like to sign baseballs made in China. That was  just his thing. He didn't want to sign a baseball made in China, which  I didn't know that, but I had two major league baseballs for my two  oldest kids to get them signed. He was going to be in Bowling Green,  Kentucky. I show up there. And on the way, my youngest daughter, which  we didn't think even cared, started crying. Well, to buy a real major  league baseball in Bowling Green, Kentucky, at the last minute is not  very easy to do. So we went by Walmart, picked up just a little  official league ball. And I walked to the restaurant and I hand Jim the  first ball. He signs it. The second one, he signs it. The third one-- and it is in my office today, because I may have the only one--he picks  it up and he points to the ``China'' imprinted on the ball and just  gives me this look like only he could give. And fortunately Mary was  there, and she says: ``Jim, you are signing that ball for that little  girl.'' So I now have it in my office in the Rayburn building, a Jim  Bunning baseball that says ``Made in China'' on it. It is something I  cherish.   His granddaughter has interned in my office, and she is a chip off  the old block, both her grandmother and grandfather. During the spring,  we were getting a lot of phone calls in our office because of some of  the actions here on the House floor. She was wonderful and mature  beyond her years at 20 or 21 years old.   So the old right-hander, as Mr. Hal Rogers said, is somebody we miss,  is somebody that is important to me, somebody that leaves a fantastic  legacy in Washington, in Major League Baseball. But far more important,  if you had the opportunity to go to the funeral home, just looking at  those nine children, and with over 30-something grandchildren and now  into the great-grandchildren, that is his legacy. His legacy is his  family, and there is no other way he would want it from that first few  days in grammar school when he first met his wife, Mary, till today. It  is just a legacy that all of us should strive to have.   We love him. We are going to miss him. And we certainly love his  wife, Mary, and his family.                                time  1715
