 Mr. President, the language in section 148 of the  continuing resolution is included exactly as requested by the  administration. It is consistent with language that has been adopted  many times in past continuing resolutions.   The appropriation for missile defeat previously approved by Congress  is very explicit. Section 2002 of that appropriation provides that the  funds ``shall be allocated to programs, projects, and activities in  accordance with the detailed congressional budget justifications  submitted by the Department of Defense to accompany the Fiscal Year  2018 Budget Amendments requested by the President on November 6,  2017.'' It further provides that ``changes to the allocation of such  funds shall be subject to the reprogramming requirements set forth in  the annual appropriations Act.'' Section 2002 explicitly protects the  oversight prerogatives of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  and its role in approving deviations from the Administration's request.   I will continue to work with the Senator from North Carolina on his  concerns but must object to his request.   Mr. President, I object.
