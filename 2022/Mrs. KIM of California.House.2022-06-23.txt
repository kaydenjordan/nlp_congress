 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of  Jesus Rodriguez, a La Habra resident, a dear friend, a community  leader, a Korean war veteran, and a Silver Star recipient who recently  lost his fight against cancer.   He joined the Army after dropping out of his junior year of high  school, deploying to Okinawa and then to the Korean war. At age 19, he  was discharged as a corporal and came back home to begin and raise his  family. Jesus moved up the ranks from janitor to plant manager and  worked really hard.   Throughout his entire life, however, he never forgot his time in war,  and neither did his 29th Infantry Regiment. After sharing his story at  a reunion, Jesus accepted every invitation to speak to area veteran  groups, ROTC units, and the local Korean community.   Although Jesus is no longer with us, I know his story and his  sacrifice will live on and inspire others.                            ____________________
