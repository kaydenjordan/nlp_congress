 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act.   I want to thank Chairman Jenkins and Ranking Member Lewis for their  thoughtful approach to this legislation. Many of these reforms, I think  we can all agree, are long overdue, and the American taxpayer deserves  better.                                time  1415    By requiring the IRS to submit to Congress a comprehensive customer  service strategy and overhauling the tools of enforcement in order to  protect American taxpayers, we will be creating a culture at the agency  that will focus on one singular mission, and that is taxpayers first.  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this should be the motto of every Federal agency.   For the first time, this bill will codify an Independent Office of  Appeals, so that all taxpayers have access to an administrative review  process, and give Congress additional oversight over the agency itself.   Additionally, the Taxpayer First Act simplifies enforcement actions  of the IRS so that individuals and small-business owners understand  their liabilities and what potential actions could be taken by the IRS.   I also want to thank the committee for including a number of  important provisions to this bill to protect taxpayers' identities and  further combat cybersecurity threats.   In recent years, we all know that millions of Americans have had  their personal and financial information stolen and jeopardized through  data breaches of companies like Equifax, Target, and even at the Office  of Personnel Management.   I am glad to see Congress continuing to push for proactive measures  to protect Americans against tax fraud schemes by working with Federal,  State, and private partners. These protections will be especially  important as the IRS seeks to modernize its services and its IT  systems.   With the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress passed  legislation to reform our Nation's Tax Code for the first time in over  30 years. Today we have the opportunity to begin reforming the Internal  Revenue Service for the first time in 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, this is vitally important legislation, and I urge all  Members to vote ``yes.''
