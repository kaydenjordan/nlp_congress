 Mr. Speaker, a quick web search on the  meaning of Independence Day will give you the dictionary definition: A  day celebrating the anniversary of national independence.   For a nation built upon the foundations of freedom, such as the  United States of America, there is much more to the meaning of  Independence Day than can be described in a dictionary.   For Americans, Independence Day is about the people who have lived  and died in the defense of freedom. Crispus Attucks, who was killed by  British troops in the Boston Massacre, has long been honored as an  American hero and the first casualty of the Revolutionary War. Mr.  Attucks has proved to be the first in a long legacy of American heroes.   Each and every generation of Americans has had their share of men and  women willing to pursue a more perfect realization of that most basic  of human rights, freedom.   Freedom against tyranny was the primary motive during the  Revolutionary War for our first President, George Washington, alongside  the Founding Fathers, who designed the government for our new Nation  and the troops who fought for its right to exist.   The great efforts of President Abraham Lincoln during the most trying  time in our Nation's history, the Civil War, led armies of brave  soldiers who fought not only for the reunification of the country but  also the freedom of people held in slavery.   This noble fight was taken up not only by soldiers but by civilians  who worked in support of those in combat, such as Clara Barton, Army  nurse and founder of the American National Red Cross.   Hundreds of thousands of young men lost their lives during the Second  World War fighting fascism in Europe and around the world. Presidents  Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman, alongside generals  including Eisenhower, Patton, and MacArthur, provided the leadership  and strategy necessary to allow our soldiers to gain victory and  preserve freedom.   As a nation, we have believed in and fought for freedom for so long  that it can easily be taken for granted. This is a trap that we must be  extra vigilant not to fall into. As President Reagan aptly stated,  freedom ``is not passed to our children in the bloodstream.''   Pursuing freedom for over 200 years has been the result of a  conscious choice, in each era, by every generation. We must continue to  make that choice in this era and in this generation.   Mr. Speaker, you may have noticed that in my examples from the  Revolutionary War, Civil War, and Second World War, I named politicians  who served our soldiers and citizens. Make no mistake, it is the  soldiers and the citizens of our Nation who do the work to preserve  freedom. Therefore, it is the solemn duty of those of us who work in  government to lead and represent the people so that they can continue  to live in freedom.   I urge each and every government official, and especially my fellow  Members of Congress, to make the choice to pursue freedom, as so many  generations have before us. In this way, we honor the lives of past  heroes such as Crispus Attucks and ensure freedom will be defended by  future generations.   Mr. Speaker, that is the meaning of Independence Day that could never  fit in a dictionary.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  this past Sunday, June 27, as National Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  Awareness Day; and June as National PTSD Awareness Month.   We must do more to defy the stigmas surrounding mental health.  National Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month is intended to  raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD, reduce the stigma  associated, and to help ensure those suffering receive proper  treatment.   Currently, about eight million people in the United States are  struggling with PTSD. PTSD treatment is a crucial tool that helps many  individuals, particularly our Nation's veterans, process, cope, and  treat emotional and mental trauma.   While PTSD can develop among any individual who faces a traumatic  experience, it is often common in our servicemen and -women. Many of  our servicemembers return home with injuries and scars, but in some  cases it is the invisible scars that hurt the most.   The Department of Veterans Affairs offers a variety of resources to  help those suffering with PTSD. There are a wide variety of options,  group meetings, individual meetings, meetings via telemedicine. This  ensures our veterans can receive timely assistance wherever they may  live.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our Nation's veterans for their service, and I  encourage those struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder to  pursue treatment.                            ____________________
