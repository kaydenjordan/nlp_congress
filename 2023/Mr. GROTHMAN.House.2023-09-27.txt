 Mr. Chair, I want to comment a little bit on the last  speech from the other side. They said the vast majority of fentanyl  coming across the border to this country comes from designated points  of entry. You hear that said, but I think what they should say is the  vast majority of fentanyl that we catch comes across from designated  points of entry.   There are--depending on the month--30- or 40,000 people who are got- aways who come across between designated points of entry. We never  catch them because they are called got-ways, and nobody is monitoring  places that are not designated points of entry.   Clearly, if you want to sneak fentanyl across the border you would do  it between designated points of entry, and it would not show up on any  statistics because we don't catch those people.    Mr. Chair, first of all, one comment on the people who  are more likely to be victims of violence in a natural disaster. Just  doing a quick Google search, I noticed that 80 percent of the murder  victims in this country are men. Maybe the men are getting killed when  the weather is good. I don't know.   In any event, as chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security,  the Border, and Foreign Affairs, I have had the opportunity to go down  to the border several times. It amazes me what a good job dogs do at  detecting drugs coming across our southern border. They are not only  able to detect drugs. They also detect explosives, money, and even  human beings being trafficked or smuggled.   We wonder, if canine units are so effective, why not expand their use  along the southern border? To find the answer to this question, my  amendment in this en bloc would express the need for a study on the  expanded use of canine units along the southern border.   Mr. Chair, I would appreciate it if that amendment was included.    Madam Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 431.                    Amendment No. 149 Offered by Mr. Biggs     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I have been down on the border several times, and every  time we are down there, we learn a little bit more.   My amendment would highlight the need for alternative methods of  management for border wall infrastructure during flood season. The  border wall faces a challenge when the waters rise during flood season.  These floods can jeopardize the structural integrity of the wall,  compromising its effectiveness and putting our border at risk.   During a recent hearing I held in Sierra Vista, Arizona, I was  surprised to discover the way in which we deal with this issue. We deal  with it just by opening up the gates along the wall. You heard that  right. Border Patrol agents are required to open vast sections of the  wall, allowing migrants to flow into the country unimpeded. This comes  at a time when we are facing an unprecedented crisis.   Last month, U.S. officials encountered 230,000 migrants crossing the  border; 180,000 of those migrants crossed the border between ports of  entry, areas that are supposed to be protected by the wall. However,  during flood season, these migrants simply walked through because we  open up the gates.   To address this critical concern, we need to explore alternative  methods and technologies that can protect the border wall.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just reiterate, being at the border and  talking to the members of the Border Patrol who are on the border every  day, they feel the current situation is untenable and is allowing more  people to cross the border than they should.   As far as the idea of simply climbing over a fence, I have yet to  meet anybody on the border, be it Border Patrol agent, be it American  law enforcement, be it people who have land on the border, who do not  feel the wall is a good thing.   They all realize it is a wall system. It takes more than just a wall.  They prefer if we describe it as a wall system, but they all feel we  need additional barriers at the border to prevent this over 200,000  people a month streaming in here.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
