 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of serving on the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I rise today in  support of the 21st Century Aviation Innovation, Reform, and  Reauthorization Act. We call it the AIRR Act in the committee.   H.R. 2997 is a unique opportunity in a bipartisan way to do something  big together for the American people.   I know we hear that a lot in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, but so often  it seems like it is just out of our reach. That is not the case today.   Under Chairman Shuster's leadership on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I have worked  to craft the kind of bold, forward-thinking reform that America's 21st  century aviation system needs. It is in reach today to make that the  law of the land.   When we sit together to reauthorize the FAA, Mr. Speaker, it isn't  just about attending to the Nation's business of ensuring safety of air  travelers across the country. Of course, that is a priority, but it is  an opportunity to implement the kind of innovative reforms that we have  seen across the globe and that America needs to reestablish itself as  the world's aviation leader.                                time  1030    We have an opportunity together to deal with a bloated bureaucracy,  to reduce taxpayer costs, to improve efficiency all in an industry that  is designed to prioritize customer's experience and customer service.   Mr. Speaker, Americans pioneered air travel, and we remain the safest  aviation system on the planet. But our own outdated bureaucracy, our  own outdated rules are standing in the way of American innovators and  making air travel more time consuming, more costly, and safety  innovations more difficult.   Mr. Speaker, with this legislation, we have a chance to empower our  innovators, to better serve our travelers, and to preserve the world's  finest commitment to safety, as we always have.   As is the case, Mr. Speaker, with any heavy lift, with any big task,  there are always concerns in keeping America's system safe and the  American people safe a highest among those concerns.   Mr. Speaker, what you need to know today is that with the support of  General Mattis, with the support of the Department of Defense, the AIRR  Act has focused on preserving the primacy of preserving national  security in our aviation infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, the bill has the support of those dedicated public  servants at the Pentagon because it has been sensitive to these issues.  It maintains the DOD's access and management of airspace. It doesn't  allow user fees that are charged to passengers to be passed onto  taxpayers through the DOD. It leaves intact the President's and the  DOD's proper authorities to manage this space.  [[Page H7757]]    In addition, it provides unequivocal definitions about the importance  of defense to the American people and balances the needs of general  aviation with the needs of the Department of Defense. The oversight  will always remain with the FAA, with the DOT, and with the United  States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, after we preserve national security, we turn our  attentions to the general aviation community. And if you have talked  about this bill at all with any of your constituents back home, Mr.  Speaker, you heard the concerns of the general aviation community about  what it will mean to them to completely reform America's air traffic  control system.   Mr. Speaker, we have to balance the role of government oversight and  accountability with private innovation. Our bill is designed to empower  those innovators but to preserve the protections that GA has today.   Mr. Speaker, I want to refer you to a graphic. You will find it at  the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's website. It is  transport.house.gov. You can't see it from where you sit, but I have  line by line by line the law that we are talking about, the bill that  we are talking about, the reforms that we are talking about, and how it  protects our friends at the general aviation community.   No fees. No new fees for our friends in general aviation, Mr.  Speaker. If you have a doubt about that, look at section 9313, you will  see ``charges and fees may not be imposed for air traffic services  provided.''   Continuing airspace and airport access, Mr. Speaker, so important to  American citizens involved in general aviation, again, I refer you to  chapter 907: ``General rights of access to airspace, airports. . . .  The Secretary shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that  an air traffic services user is not denied access to airspace or air  traffic services. . . .''   The stakeholder board, Mr. Speaker, the cooperatizing of air traffic  services that we have seen done so successfully in Canada where they  say they are getting twice the safety and modernization input for half  the cost, getting it done in a third of the time, having done away with  their bloated bureaucracy, the stakeholder board, Mr. Speaker, is  defined by general aviation nomination. Transport.house.gov, Mr.  Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 553 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 553         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the       congressional budget for the United States Government for       fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary       levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027. The first reading       of the concurrent resolution shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the concurrent       resolution are waived. General debate shall not exceed four       hours, with three hours of general debate confined to the       congressional budget equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Budget and one hour of general debate on the subject of       economic goals and policies equally divided and controlled by       Representative Tiberi of Ohio and Representative Carolyn       Maloney of New York or their respective designees. After       general debate the concurrent resolution shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. The concurrent       resolution shall be considered as read. No amendment shall be       in order except those printed in the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such amendment       may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may       be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall       be considered as read, and shall be debatable for the time       specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent. All points of order against such       amendments are waived except that the adoption of an       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall constitute the       conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for       amendment. After the conclusion of consideration of the       concurrent resolution for amendment and a final period of       general debate, which shall not exceed 10 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Budget, the Committee shall       rise and report the concurrent resolution to the House with       such amendment as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent       resolution and amendments thereto to adoption without       intervening motion except amendments offered by the chair of       the Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 305(a)(5) of       the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to achieve mathematical       consistency. The concurrent resolution shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question of its adoption.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all of my  colleagues may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, it is going to be a great day. I don't know  how your Wednesday has gotten started, but we are now in the throes of  budget day.   Budget day only happens on the floor of this House once a year, and  it is one of those times where I would tell you the House operates as  every man, woman, and child across this country believes the House  should operate every day.   I have the great honor as a member of the Rules Committee and as a  member of the Budget Committee of bringing this structured rule to the  floor today.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 71, the rule that we will be debating for  the next hour, makes in order every single budget substitute that was  offered in the Rules Committee. Now, let me tell you what that means in  practical terms.   Over the next 2 days, we are going to hear visions laid out for what  the American government should spend, what American policies should  look like, what the Federal budget should include.   Over the next 2 days, we are going to hear visions laid out from  every single Member or group in this institution that cared enough  about this process to craft a budget of their own.   Mr. Speaker, I serve in the Republican Study Committee. I was once  chairman of the Budget and Spending Task Force on the Republican Study  Committee. I had the honor of crafting a substitute budget to bring to  the floor to offer for my colleagues' consideration.   Over the next 2 days, any Member who has a voice that needs to be  heard  [[Page H7765]]  has had the opportunity. We put out the call last week. My friend from  Massachusetts and I, we sit on the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker. We  send out the call to the membership in advance to say this is what we  expect to happen in the Rules Committee, this is what we are going to  be considering in the Rules Committee. We sent out the call for any  Member of this House to craft their substitute amendment, and we  received four.   We received one from the Congressional Black Caucus, we received one  from the Progressive Caucus, we received one from the Republican Study  Committee, and we received one from the Democrats on the Budget  Committee. Every single one of those has been made in order by the rule  that I will ask my colleagues to support today.   We are going to debate those. We are going to vote on those each  individually, allowing everybody to have their say. That budget that  this House ultimately agrees on collectively, collaboratively after  these days of debate, we will then send to the United States Senate for  its consideration.   Mr. Speaker, they say that budgets are a reflection of values. I  believe that to be true. We are going to have budgets on the floor of  the House to consider that cut taxes, budgets that believe that the  economy has not grown to its full potential, budgets that believe that  the American workforce participation rate is still at historically low  levels. We have to get men and women back into the workforce. We have  to reward that dignity of work. We have budgets that are going to cut  taxes in an effort to stimulate that job growth across this land.   We have other budgets that are concerned that we are not bringing  enough revenue into the government coffers. It is true, Mr. Speaker. I  know you are thinking it. We are bringing in more tax revenue today  than we have ever brought in in the history of the United States of  America. That is true, but we are still running budget deficits. So we  will consider those budgets today that don't necessarily believe that  spending is the problem; they think it is tax collection that is the  problem.   We will consider budgets that raise taxes by about $2 trillion. We  will consider other budgets that raise taxes by about $4 trillion. Mr.  Speaker, I think we will even consider budgets that raise taxes by $9  trillion.   Mr. Speaker, there are only two things that can happen in this  institution. We either have to raise more revenue, or we have to cut  spending, or we have to mortgage our children's future. Three things:  raise taxes, cut spending, mortgage our children's future.   Over the next 2 days, we are going to have that debate and we are  going to have that discussion.   I know where my constituency lands, Mr. Speaker. There are tough  decisions that have to be made, and they believe they sent men and  women to Congress to help make those tough decisions. We sit on the  Budget Committee. That is what we do.   If you have not gotten a chance to work with her this season, Mr.  Speaker, Chairwoman Diane Black on the House Budget Committee, if there  is a more patient and more persistent Member of this body, I don't know  who that would be. She has worked tirelessly to move this process  along, to get us to this point where we are today, trying to bring  people together around a unified vision of what we can do and what we  should do not just as an institution, but as a nation.   I expect we will have some disagreements over the next 2 days, Mr.  Speaker. It won't surprise me at all. In fact, I think this institution  is characterized by the things that we disagree about. Certainly that  is what the media would like to focus on. But at the end of this  process, what will have to be said is that we have considered every  idea, that we have considered every point of view, that we have made  room for every voice, and that we have now come together on a common  pathway forward. That is what is ahead of us, Mr. Speaker, if  we support this rule that we are debating now.    Again, I urge my colleagues to support this rule. I hope you will  find that budget that meets your constituency's needs, support that  underlying budget, and then let's move a budget to the United States  Senate and speak with one voice for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you heard the passion of my friend from Massachusetts,  and I have had an opportunity to work with him on the Rules Committee  for 7 years now. I can tell you that every bit of that passion is  sincere.   So often I think folks turn on C-SPAN, they look at a group of  politicians talking, and they think it is all for the cameras and it is  all for show. I will tell you that while I sometimes have that same  suspicion when I turn on a program of folks I don't know, with folks I  do know, I can tell you that that passion is sincere.   What I can also tell you is that many of those concerns are  misguided, and I think that is important. What happens here in this  institution matters. Our ability to have that debate with one another  matters. The truth is, as you know, Mr. Speaker, most of that debate  doesn't happen here on the House floor.   My friend from Massachusetts and I are here today because it is time  to vote. We are here to bring the rule, we are here to bring the  substitutes, we are here over the next 2 days to vote. The conversation  has gone on not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but for the  better part of this year on what the budget is going to look like.   I happen to have a copy of the budget report right here, Mr. Speaker.  It captures all the votes we have taken. It  [[Page H7767]]  captures all the debates we have had. It captures what the intent of  the institution is.   Now again, we are going to have a choice of which budget we want to  support. If you think taxes are too low, you can vote to raise taxes.  If you think taxes are much too low, you can vote to raise taxes a  whole lot. If you think the tax code as it exists today is a ridiculous  compilation of confusing provisions stitched together by a patchwork of  Congresses over the last 40 years, you can vote for fundamental reform.   If you are tired of the fact that America used to be number one in  the world in terms of tax competitiveness and now we are at the bottom  of the list and you want to take America back to being number one, you  can vote for that, too. I happen to put myself in that category.   I want to read, if I may, Mr. Speaker, from the budget report. The  fact is, I can't. I imagined myself a younger man when I grabbed that  report.   If I can now read from the budget report. ``The resolution's  reconciliation instructions,'' that is what is in the budget, Mr.  Speaker. That is what allows us to take a tax package from the House to  the Senate. You have heard about how the Senate is having a tough time  getting anything done because it requires a supermajority. It requires  60 votes. Through reconciliation, you can get things done with less  than 60 votes. That is how the Affordable Care Act was passed, with  less than 60 votes. You can get the tax bill passed with less than 60  votes.   It says this. ``The resolution's reconciliation instructions that the  Committee on Ways and Means will develop will be a deficit-neutral tax  reform legislation and report such legislative language to the  Committee on the Budget.'' Deficit neutral. Nobody wants to blow a hole  in the budget, Mr. Speaker.   What the discussion is, is can we do better than today's tax code?  Candidly, Mr. Speaker, if any Member of this body wants to take the  position that we can't do any better, the IRS is as good as it can be  in implementing the American Tax Code today, the Tax Code that is twice  as long as the Bible is absolutely as concise and succinct as it can  possibly be, those Americans who spend dozens of hours, even dozens of  days, even dozens of weeks trying to put together their taxes, that is  just the best we can do.   Mr. Speaker, I have seen it happen. Sometimes folks throw their hands  up and think: We can't do any better. Not me. Not today.   We can all agree that we can do better than what we are doing today.  Passage of this budget gives us that opportunity.   You heard my friend from Massachusetts speak from the heart, Mr.  Speaker, about the ability we have as a government to care for one  another. I would tell you that responsibility isn't uniquely a  government responsibility. I would say it is a faith responsibility, it  is a family responsibility, it is a community responsibility. It is a  responsibility that begins at home. It doesn't begin here, it begins at  home, but it is a sincere responsibility, and it is one that we want to  do better at every day.   I am sure you are aware, Mr. Speaker, the labor force participation  rate in America is the lowest it has been since the President from my  great State of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, was in office. The labor force  participation rate. There is not one of us in this body who can drive  down the street without seeing a ``help wanted'' sign. There is not one  of us in this body who can go out to a business without seeing someone  asking folks to come in and help, yet fewer Americans are working today  than ever before. Why? It is a hard question.   Fewer Americans are working today than since the 1970s. Why? It is  important that we ask that question.   The budget is not designed to answer it. The budget can't answer it.  I sit on the Budget Committee. I don't have the jurisdiction to answer  it, but I know this: you will find in this budget a discussion of  whether it is better to support people in poverty or lift folks out of  poverty.                                time  1300    It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I would tell you that we  can support people until we can lift them up, but that lifting them up  must be our goal. Supporting them is not enough.   You will find it here, Mr. Speaker, in these pages. This is a vision  document. This is what we are gathered together to do today, and we  will have legitimate disagreements about when we are doing enough in a  particular area and when we are doing too much.   There are those in this body, Mr. Speaker, who believe passionately  in education. I am one of those people. I come from a district with  amazing school systems.   You can go to any public school in my district, Mr. Speaker, if you  work hard and apply yourself. I don't care what your background is, I  don't care where your family is from, I don't care what you have  stacked against you; if you work hard and apply yourself in our public  schools, you can be anything you want to be.   I know everybody wants that for their constituency back home; and I  have colleagues who believe that only Washington, D.C., is successful  enough, has a track record of success strong enough to implement that  vision back home.   I don't come from that camp. I see a lot of failure come out of  Washington, D.C. I see a lot of bureaucracy come out of Washington,  D.C. I see success come out of parents and teachers and principals back  home raising taxes, supporting those institutions, making sure every  child has a chance. We do that together as a community.   The discussion that we might have in this institution, Mr. Speaker,  is not: Do you believe in education?   It is: Do you believe educators in Washington, D.C., have the best  answers, or educators back home in your district have the answers?   The truth is that we don't have many educators in Washington, D.C. We  have bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who oversee educators. I side  with my educators back home. It is a legitimate disagreement that we  are welcome to have.   What can't be said, though, Mr. Speaker, is that there are any  disagreements over these next few days that we are not going to be  allowed to have. I have said it before, and I will say it again because  it makes me so proud. We don't always have time or make room for all  the voices in this institution, Mr. Speaker. You know, sometimes we  pick and choose winners and losers, whose voice is going to be heard.  Not today. Any Member of Congress could submit their budget to the  United States House of Representatives Committee on Rules.   It is a hard thing to produce a budget. I told you I have done it  before, Mr. Speaker. It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of  commitment. But if you believe that you have a better idea, you can do  it. And if you did it, we made it in order in the Rules Committee last  night and we are going to debate it on the floor and we are going to  vote on it on the floor.   We can't always say that every single idea, every single substitute  is going to make it to the floor for a vote. We can say that today. I  am proud that we can.   It is not going to stop the disagreements, Mr. Speaker, but what it  is going to do is air those disagreements; what it is going to do is  allow us to talk about our differing visions; and what it is going to  do is allow us to come together on a common vision at the end of the  day.   I hope my colleagues will support this rule so we can begin that  process, and I hope my colleagues will support the underlying budget of  their choice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If you have not tuned in to this debate until just these past few  minutes, you might not know that this is the budget debate today. We  have been prepping for the budget debate today for about 10 months now,  and we are ready today not just with one budget, but with a variety of  budget choices. And what is wonderful about this process is it has been  such an open process.   You can come down to the House floor and air absolutely any idea that  is on your mind. That has not just been true today, Mr. Speaker, but  that has been true throughout this entire budget process. In fact, I  have a letter signed by literally hundreds of groups that support not  just voting on the rule to bring the budget to the floor, but groups  that support passing the budget as we passed it out of the House Budget  Committee.   Now, if my colleagues have any concerns about that, I hope they will  come and knock on my door, Mr. Speaker, because I promise you that one  of these groups is going to be from their part of the country.   Certainly, in Georgia, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce is on that  list. So our folks back home are supportive. If you are from Alabama, I  have got Alabamans on here. If you are from Baton Rouge, I have got  Baton Rouge. If you are from Battle Creek, I have Battle Creek, because  what we are working on here isn't a Republican budget, Mr. Speaker.                                time  1315    What we are working on isn't a regional budget. What we are working  on here is the national budget for the United States of America that  can be transformational for absolutely every citizen in absolutely  every corner of this country.   We have that opportunity. I think we are going to seize that  opportunity, but we can't do it until we move this rule to get to the  underlying bills. I encourage my colleagues to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts  that I have no further speakers remaining. I would be happy to close  when the gentleman is prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, what I love most about budget day is the fact that we do  get to talk about our competing ideas. I do reject some of the  implications that we have heard that what we are talking about is  whether we love people or not. That is actually not the debate today.   I want to stipulate that I know the men and women of this Chamber on  a personal basis, and each and every one of them that I know personally  loves and cares for their constituency back home. The debate that we  have is not whether we love people; it is how to love people best.  [[Page H7775]]    Do you love people best by giving them a check or giving them a job?  That is a legitimate debate.   Do you love people best by leaving their children with them or taking  their children away from them? That is a legitimate debate.   I believe in families. I believe in the dignity of work. I want to  have those debates.   I think we do ourselves a disservice when we describe what is going  on here today on the floor of the House as anything other than our  absolute legal and governmental responsibility to pass a budget for the  United States of America. Wherever you sit on the continuum, the  political continuum, the economic continuum, the regional continuum,  there is a budget for you today.   If what you believe, Mr. Speaker, is that the problems we have in  this country are because taxes are not high enough, there is going to  be a Democratic substitute coming out of the Budget Committee that will  raise taxes about $2.4 trillion. If you think taxes are too low, we can  raise them $2.4 trillion. That budget never balances. That budget never  stops borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. That budget  never stops mortgaging America's future. But it is a legitimate debate  because folks are taking those funds and they are investing them in  America. They are prioritizing that investment over balancing.   If you believe $2.4 trillion is not enough, Mr. Speaker, we will have  a budget from the Congressional Black Caucus today that will raise  taxes by $4.2 trillion. We can raise taxes by $4.2 trillion. Again,  that budget never balances. It spends all that money and more, but it  is a legitimate debate about where those dollars come from and where  those dollars are going. I am glad we are going to be able to have it.   If raising taxes by $4.2 trillion isn't enough for you, Mr. Speaker,  we have the Congressional Progressive Caucus' budget on the floor. It  raises taxes by just over $10 trillion. Again, the budget never  balances. It spends all of that money and more and continues to borrow  from our children and grandchildren, but it is a legitimate debate and  it is a conversation worth having. I am proud that the Rules Committee  made that debate in order.    To describe what is happening on the floor of the House today, Mr.  Speaker, as anything other than what is exactly expected of this  institution is to do us all a disservice.   I talked about making taxes higher. Let me talk a second about making  taxes lower.   I talked to some friends back home; I talk to constituents; I talk to  folks for whom I work, and some of them might say: ``Rob, I have enough  to feed my family, and if it means paying down the debt and deficit, I  am willing to pay a little bit more.'' Other members in the community,  Mr. Speaker, say: ``For Pete's sake, I am trying to grow a business  here, Rob. I am trying to employ your friends and neighbors. I am  trying to keep the community working. I am plowing everything I have  back into the business. If I don't have to pay as much in taxes, I am  going to be able to hire more people.''   The Republican budget, Mr. Speaker, takes a shot at once-in-a- generation tax reform--once in a generation. This isn't what we talked  about last year or the year before that or the year before that. This  is a conversation we have not had since Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill  had it in 1986. This is a conversation that we have not had since  America slipped from number one in the world to almost last in the  industrialized world in terms of tax competitiveness. This is a  conversation that America has longed for and that we can deliver today.   Mr. Speaker, let's have these debates about what our priorities are.  Let's have these debates about whether or not we can do better. At the  end of the day, let's agree that we, in fact, can do better, that our  bosses back home expect us to do better, and that by supporting this  rule and supporting one of the underlying budgets, we, in fact, will do  better.   I encourage my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, support this rule, begin this  debate. Let's pass this budget. Let's fulfill our promises. Let's make  the difference that we all came here to make.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 553 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution       (H. Res. 367) to establish the Select Committee on Gun       Violence Prevention. The first reading of the resolution       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the resolution are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the resolution and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Rules. After general       debate the resolution shall be considered for amendment under       the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions       in the resolution are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the resolution for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the resolution to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one       motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the resolution, then on the next legislative       day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order       of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the       resolution.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 367.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H7776]]     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my friend from California for  yielding to me. As you know, Mr. Chairman, he is not just down here as  the ranking member on the House Budget Committee. He is also the leader  of the Republican Study Committee's Budget and Spending Task Force. The  leadership he has provided in all those areas means a lot to the entire  institution. I am grateful to him for it.   I also want to say I am grateful to my friends in the Progressive  Caucus. I disagree with their budget, and I plan to vote against it.   Mr. Chairman, how often do we come down here and folks want to  complain about what is not going right, but they don't want to do  anything about it?   To my friends' credit in the Progressive Caucus, they laid out a  vision, and that is exactly what I came here to Congress to be a part  of. Let's lay out our visions. Let's have some votes. Let's count those  votes and see where we go from there.   As you know, Mr. Chairman, absolutely any group could offer a budget  today, yet we only have four alternatives being considered. That tells  [[Page H7823]]  you something about how hard it is to put your ideas forward. So I want  to thank my friends on the Progressive Caucus for doing that.   I want to run through a couple of things that their budget includes,  Mr. Chairman. It includes a 4 percent pay increase for Federal workers  across the board. It includes $500 billion in green energy incentives.  It imposes a carbon tax to deal with greenhouse gases. It cuts $70  billion from the Defense Department and, in fact, eliminates altogether  the spending on the global war on terror.   Mr. Chairman, these are all legitimate policy disagreements.   Their budget also increases revenues, taxes, by $10 trillion, but  spends so much more on American priorities that we continue to end up  with almost a $1 trillion annual deficit in year 10.   Mr. Chairman, this is the kind of debate that we have to have. I want  to understand the priorities of my friends. I want to understand where  they want to see more investments. And then I want to understand how it  is we are going to balance this budget together. Because what is  lacking in this plan, Mr. Chairman, what frustrates me the most about  the Progressive Caucus plan is not the investment in green energy, it  is not the investment in the Federal workforce, it is not the  investment in healthcare; it is the fact that they don't believe we can  do these things while raising taxes by $10 trillion on the American  people and balance the budget at all.   Mr. Chairman, if folks want to raise taxes in this institution--I  think our problem is a spending problem. I don't think it is a taxing  problem, but I am willing to have that discussion with them to  understand their point of view.   But the reason I will ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this budget  is not because it raises taxes $10 trillion; it is because it raises  taxes $10 trillion, yet continues to borrow from our children and our  grandchildren in the form of annual debt and deficits.   I think we can do better. But we cannot do better without an honest  discussion of the issues, Mr. Chairman. Say what you want to about the  budgets you are going to see on the floor here, these alternatives that  we are going to discuss.   There are a lot of talking heads on TV who just want to talk about it  and don't want to do anything about it. If you are looking for a ray of  hope today, look at the Progressive Caucus, which I disagree with about  almost everything as it comes to how to peg the numbers, but they put  their vision forward tonight. They said: Let's take a stand tonight.   If we can work together across that aisle, Mr. Chairman, there is  absolutely nothing that we cannot do on behalf of the American people.   Vote ``no'' on this budget, but applaud the effort that has gone into  it such that we can try to find common ground going forward.   If we have but one thing to agree on in this institution, let it be  to agree to pay for those things that we think are important. Whether  it is wars or whether it is green energy, whether it is troops or  whether it is Federal employees, let us agree that we should pay for  those things today with our dollars, and the borrowing from our  children and grandchildren should be ended forever.
