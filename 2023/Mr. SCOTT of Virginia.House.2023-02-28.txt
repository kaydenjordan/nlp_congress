 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 30, a Congressional  Review Act joint resolution of disapproval to nullify a popular and  sensible rule issued by the Biden-Harris administration last year.   Workers should be able to invest their retirement savings in a way  that reflects their values, such as combating climate change, without  sacrificing investment returns.   That is why the Biden-Harris administration issued a rule to clarify  that retirement plan fiduciaries may consider the economic effects of  climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors,  or ESG factors, when they make investment decisions for participants in  retirement plans.   Now, to be clear, this rule is not an ESG mandate.   Additionally, the rule does not change the fiduciary standard to  which professionals who make investment decisions for retirement plans  are bound. They must still prioritize the interests of retirement plan  participants and cannot sacrifice investment returns to pursue ESG  goals.   Let's be clear. Consideration of ESG factors is not at odds with  making a profit. In fact, workers' profit is still central, but if a  company has negative externalities, such as carbon-intensive business  practices, vulnerability to sea level rise, high liability risks, or a  record of mistreating workers who may go on strike, its stock could  suffer in the long term.                                time  1415    Workers often contribute to their retirement for decades before  drawing down on their savings, so it makes sense that retirement plan  beneficiaries must consider the long-term time horizon when making  investment decisions.   Finally, there is widespread support for the Biden-Harris  administration's rule. Of the comment letters submitted on the proposed  rule, 83 percent of the letters submitted by institutions like  corporations, financial firms, and labor organizations supported the  rule.   Over 97 percent of the letters submitted by individuals supported the  rule. Simply put, the Biden-Harris rule reflects the best interests of  the American people and our economy.   We should not get rid of this popular and reasonable rule by this  resolution. The rule just simply allows retirement plan fiduciaries to  appropriately consider ESG factors.   Retirement fiduciaries, not House Republicans, are best positioned  and bound by law to make prudent investment decisions on behalf of  retirement savers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten), the co-chair of the Congressional  Sustainable Investment Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier), the distinguished ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Vargas), a co-chair of the Congressional  Sustainable Investment Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Magaziner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time for closing.   Mr. Speaker, during this debate, we have heard a lot about ESG  investing. It is clear there is a difference of opinion on it, but  whether Members of Congress see things the same way is not the point.   What matters is that the Biden-Harris rule puts the decisionmaking  when it comes to considering ESG factors where it belongs, in the hands  of retirement plan fiduciaries who are best positioned and bound by  law, which has not changed, to act prudently on behalf of plan  participants. That is where the decisionmaking should stay.   They, not Members of Congress, know what is in the best interests of  their plan participants, and they are bound by their fiduciary  responsibilities to do the right thing.   Now, when supporters say that a fiduciary should not consider  nonpecuniary factors, they ignore the fact that ESG factors can, in  fact, be pecuniary, because often ESG factors, such as sea level rise,  can have a profound effect on the value of the investment. Those who  recognize this should be able to make reasonable investments based on  that knowledge.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record several letters from  organizations opposed to H.J. Res. 30. Eighty-three percent of  institutions that submitted comments were in favor of the underlying  rule. These organizations, who are opposed to H.J. Res. 30, include the  AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, SEIU,  Environmental Defense Fund, League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club,  Natural Resources Defense Council, Union of Concerned Scientists, and  others.                                                            AFL-CIO,                                               Legislative Alert,                                                  February 16, 2023.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, we urge you       to oppose the Congressional Review Act joint resolution that       has been introduced by Sen. Mike Braun and Rep. Andy Barr to       disapprove of the Department of Labor's recently adopted rule       ``Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and       Exercising Shareholder Rights'' (SJ. Res. 8, HJ. Res. 30).        The Department of Labor's rule clarifies that private       sector retirement plan fiduciaries may consider       environmental, social and governance (``ESG'') factors when       making plan investments or voting proxies. The rule does not       require that retirement plan fiduciaries consider ESG       factors, it simply acknowledges the fact that ESG factors may       be relevant to investment returns.        Indeed, the consideration of ESG factors helps protect the       hard-earned retirement savings of working people. ESG risks       are particularly relevant for long-term investors, such as       retirement plans, who are investing over the expected       lifespans of their participants and beneficiaries. For this       reason, ignoring ESG risks to an investment portfolio may be       financially imprudent.        Contrary to what some would have you believe, investment       professionals' consideration of ESG factors is not limited to       environmental risks, such as climate change. Social issues       such as respect for workers' rights and governance issues       such as having responsible executive compensation can also       impact sustainable investment returns.        The rule affirms that proxy votes should be cast in the       best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries,       thereby giving workers' retirement savings a voice in       corporate decision making. The rule also ensures that the       default investment for defined contribution  [[Page H937]]       plans is the best option available regardless of whether the       investment considers ESG factors.        Finally, the rule clarifies when retirement plan       fiduciaries may consider benefits other than investment       returns. These benefits can include the creation of good       jobs, affordable housing, and economic growth for local       communities. Such benefits may only be considered as       tiebreakers between competing investments that equally serve       the financial interests of the plan.        This rule makes clear that any consideration of ESG factors       must be consistent with the fiduciary duties of loyalty and       care. Retirement plan fiduciaries cannot sacrifice risk-      adjusted investment returns under any circumstances. The rule       appropriately holds the consideration of ESG factors to the       exact same documentation requirements as any other fiduciary       decision.        The decision of whether to consider ESG factors should be       left to investment professionals, not politicians. Trillions       of dollars in assets under management already take ESG       factors into consideration when making investment decisions.       Congress should not interfere in the free market by seeking       to prohibit the consideration of ESG factors.        For these reasons, we strongly urge you to oppose       disapproval of the Department of Labor's rule ``Prudence and       Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising       Shareholder Rights.'' Congress should not play politics with       our pension plans by repealing this commonsense rule.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                   Americans for Financial Reform,                                                  February 24, 2023.

Ranking Member Bill Cassidy,      HELP Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Bobby Scott,      Education and Workforce Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader       McConnell, House Speaker McCarthy, House Minority Leader       Jeffries, HELP Committee Chairman Sanders, HELP Ranking       Member Cassidy, House Education and the Workforce Committee       Chairwoman Foxx, and House Education and the Workforce       Committee Ranking Member Scott: The undersigned organizations       urge you to defend the Department of Labor's important       fiduciary rule that safeguards the savings of millions of       workers who participate in private-sector employee benefit       plans. The rule, titled ``Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting       Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,'' has       four main components: 1) removes costly and impractical       record-keeping burdens on fiduciaries to ensure those who       manage workers' money have the flexibility needed to consider       all financially relevant risks and opportunities; 2) allows       consideration of collateral benefits such as creating union       jobs only if different investment options equally serve the       financial interests of the plan over the appropriate time       horizon; 3) increases workers' investment choices within the       confines of ERISA's stringent protections; and 4) removes       costly and unnecessary barriers to the exercise of       shareholder rights.        A vote in favor of a Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolution to nullify the rule is an affirmative vote for       unworkable, burdensome Trump-era rules. Trump-era rules       erected ``needless barriers'' and had a ``chilling effect . .       . on considering environmental, social and governance factors       in investments'' that are financially relevant. The Trump       rules also put the thumb on the scale against workers'       ability to exercise their shareholder rights, diluting       workers' shareholder voice. Additionally, three lawyers, all       experts in ERISA, recently published a paper that included an       in-depth analysis of why the distinction between       ``pecuniary'' and ``non-pecuniary,'' first introduced in the       Trump-era rules and ``roundly criticized during the       rulemaking comment process,'' is self-contradictory and       unworkable.        The Biden DOL rule repeatedly affirms the core ERISA tenet:       that fiduciaries are not allowed to sacrifice returns in the       pursuit of collateral benefits. The Biden rule returns power       to fiduciaries to make the best decisions regarding relevant       risks and returns in their participants' best interests, in       contrast to the Trump-era rules, which sought to inject       politics into fiduciary decision-making.        The CRA resolution is part of a larger, failing effort to       imbue ``ESG'' with false meaning, vilify it, and legislate       against it. This effort is backed by powerful corporate       interests--including fossil fuel companies looking to       postpone the inevitable decarbonization of the economy--that       are attempting to roll back progress that has been made on       climate change, workers' rights, racial equity, and other ESG       issues with clear financial implications. They are doing so       by pushing legislation and other policies that hurt both       workers' hard-fought pensions and taxpayers.        This effort is unpopular--with 63 percent of voters       agreeing the government should not set limits on corporate       ESG investments, including 70 percent of Republicans and 57       percent of Democrats--and has suffered numerous, recent       failures including: 1) Indiana's budget office finding that a       bill forcing pension funds to divest from asset managers that       consider ESG factors would cost $6.7 billion over the next       decade in sub-market returns, force retirees to increase       their contributions, and impose an additional $550,000       administrative costs a year; 2) Arizona Attorney General Kris       Mayes announcing Arizona will no longer participate in       investigations into banks and other financial institutions       over ESG investing practices, stating that she believes ``it       is not the place of government to tell corporations and their       investors that they cannot invest in sustainable technologies       and practices or improve their governance processes; 3) a       study finding that a 2021 Texas investment blacklist would       cost municipalities an additional $303 million to $532       million in bond interest; and 4) North Dakota voting down,       90-3, a Texas-style bill that would have required the state       treasurer to prepare a blacklist of financial firms that have       committed to reducing carbon emissions.        For all the reasons stated above, we urge you to protect       workers' pensions from anti-ESG attacks and vote no on the       CRA resolution.

Dear Senator: On behalf of the two million members of the       Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I write to       oppose S.J. Res. 8 and H.J. Res. 30, the Congressional Review       Act joint resolution(s) that have been introduced by Senator       Mike Braun and Rep. Andy Barr to disapprove of the Department       of Labor's recently adopted rule entitled ``Prudence and       Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising       Shareholder Rights.'' The rule clarifies that private sector       retirement plan fiduciaries may consider environmental,       social and governance (``ESG'') factors when making plan       investments or voting proxies. The rule does not require that       retirement plan fiduciaries consider ESG factors, it simply       acknowledges the fact that ESG factors may be relevant to       investment returns. Further retirement plan fiduciaries       cannot sacrifice risk-adjusted investment returns under any       circumstances. The rule appropriately holds the consideration       of ESG factors to the exact same documentation requirements       as any other fiduciary decision.        The consideration of ESG factors helps protect the hard-      earned retirement savings of working people. ESG risks are       particularly relevant for long-term investors, such as       retirement plans, who are investing over the expected       lifespans of their participants and beneficiaries. Ignoring       ESG risks, or pretending that they don't exist, may be       financially imprudent to an investment portfolio and could       end up with long term consequences. Contrary to outlandish       claims by those who oppose the rule, investment       professionals' consideration of ESG factors that could impact       sustainable investment returns is not limited to       environmental risks, such  [[Page H938]]       as climate change, but could also include other societal       issues such as respect for workers' rights, or even       governance issues such as having responsible executive       compensation.        The rule also affirms that proxy votes should be cast in       the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries,       therefore giving workers' retirement savings a voice in       corporate decision making. The rule also ensures that the       default investment for defined contribution plans is the best       option available regardless of whether the investment       considers ESG factors. Finally, the rule clarifies when       retirement plan fiduciaries may consider benefits other than       investment returns. These benefits can include the creation       of good jobs, affordable housing, and economic growth for       local communities. These benefits may only be considered as       tiebreakers between competing investments that equally serve       the financial interests of the plan.        The rule makes clear that any consideration of ESG factors       must be consistent with the fiduciary duties of loyalty and       care. The decision of whether to consider ESG factors should       be left to investment professionals, and Congress should not       interfere by prohibiting the consideration of ESG factors.       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose and vote against       S.J. Res. 8 and H.J. Res. 30. We will add any votes on this       legislation to our legislative scorecard for the 118th       Congress.            Sincerely,                                                         John Gray,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2023.        Dear Representatives: Americans work hard for their       retirement savings and need to be able to trust that their       401(k) and pension plans can be managed to prudently account       for all financial risks. That is why the Department of Labor       (DOL) issued a rule in November 2022 to ensure that       retirement plan managers can consider all factors relevant to       investment risk and return in their decision-making,       including financial risks due to climate change. H.J. Res.       30, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to block       the DOL rule, is a threat to Americans' retirement savings.       Our organizations urge all Representatives to oppose H.J.       Res. 30.        Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act       of 1974 (ERISA) to protect the hard earned retirement savings       upon which workers and their families rely. For decades,       DOL's ERISA rules set forth retirement plan managers' core       duty to prudently consider all relevant factors, while       remaining neutral on investment types. In 2020, the Trump       Administration deviated from this longstanding approach by       issuing ERISA rules that discouraged consideration of       environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors--even       when these factors affect investment risk and return.        The 2022 DOL rule under ERISA returns to neutrality, in       which plan managers can consider all relevant factors to       assess investment risk. The rule does not mandate, prohibit,       encourage, or discourage any particular type of investment.       The rule is clear that retirement plan managers must base       their decisions on financial risk-return factors. Those       financial factors may include the financial risks and       economic impacts of changing climate and other environmental,       social and governance factors.        The DOL rule is supported by diverse groups including the       AFL-CIO, investment managers like Vanguard and TIAA, and the       American Retirement Association. President Bush's Assistant       Secretary of Labor, Bradford Campbell stated that ``the new       rule is more consistent with the regulatory history than the       2020 rule was.'' Public comments submitted demonstrate       overwhelming and broad support for the Department of Labor       rule.        The DOL rule restores plan managers' freedom to consider       all financially relevant factors, including financial risks       due to climate change, so they can offer prudent investment       choices to workers. American workers deserve no less.        Congress: protect Americans' retirement savings by voting       NO on this CRA resolution H.J. Res. 30.            Sincerely,        Environmental Defense Fund, League of Conservation Voters,       Americans for Financial Reform, California Reinvestment       Coalition, Center for American Progress, Ceres Accelerator       for Sustainable Capital Markets, Change the Chamber, Clean       Water Action, Climate Action Campaign, Climate Hawks Vote,       Earthjustice, Evergreen Action, Natural Resources Defense       Council, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned       Scientists, WWF.     Mr. Speaker, these organizations have diverse  missions, but they all agree that H.J. Res. 30 should be rejected.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters from financial  services firms who submitted supportive comments on the underlying  rule. These firms are BNY Melon Investment Management and Lazard Asset  Management, who have trillions of dollars in assets under management.                                                      BNY Mellon,                                                  December 13, 2021.      Office of Regulations and Interpretations,      Employee Benefits Security Administration,      U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.        On behalf of BNY Mellon Investment Management, thank you       for the opportunity to submit comments on the notice of       proposed rulemaking entitled ``Prudence and Loyalty in       Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder       Rights'' (the ``Proposal'') published by the U.S. Department       of Labor (the ``Department''). We strongly support the       Department's efforts to clarify the regulatory treatment of       environmental, social, and governance (``ESG'') factors under       Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of       1974, as amended (``ERISA'') following the publication of       ``Financial Factors in Selecting Plan Investments'' and       ``Fiduciary Duties Regarding Proxy Voting and Shareholder       Rights'' (together, the ``Current Rules''). To continue the       Department's efforts to add clarity to the use of ESG factors       by fiduciaries we suggest the Department add clarification in       the rule or preamble that a fiduciary can use a screen to       consider ESG factors based on the fiduciary's determination       that a particular ESG factor will impact investment value       consistent with Section 2550.404a-1(c)(2) of the Proposal.

Many products or       solutions offered by BNY Mellon Investment Management examine       ESG factors in their investment processes and decision-making       to better manage risk and generate sustainable long-term       returns. Six of our investment firms--Alcentra, ARX, Insight,       Mellon, Newton, and Walter Scott--are signatories of the       Principles for Responsible Investment (``PRI'').        As we have noted in a previous comment letter, over the       past decades, fiduciaries and investment managers have come       to appreciate the materiality that ESG factors can have on       investment value. We welcome the Department's clarifications       to the Current Rules regarding the use of ESG factors and the       exercise of shareholder rights. The acknowledgement by the       Department that climate risks and other ESG factors can be       and often are material to investment risk and returns will       better allow fiduciaries to mitigate risk and enhance returns       based on evaluating ESG factors.        Within the last decade, a deep body of research has been       produced that demonstrates the material influence of ESG       factors on the profitability of an enterprise and the       performance of its securities. For example, weak control of       environmental activities such as pollution, over-consumption       of raw materials or lack of recycling of waste materials       readily leads to volatile or lower achieved margins or       financial penalties that reduce investor returns. Similarly       with social issues: high staff turnover, high strike rates or       absenteeism or death or injury rates have all been linked to       lower productivity and poor quality control. Regarding       governance, we know from years of empirical observation that       poorly managed issuers can seriously damage investor returns.       To ignore the entire category of information and analysis       that comprise ESG factors, therefore, could be deemed an       abrogation of a fiduciary's responsibility to consider all       material information when assessing the risk and return of       any investment opportunity.        The Proposal appropriately balances the materiality that       ESG factors can have on investment value with the       Department's longstanding principles that a fiduciary's       duties of prudence and loyalty require the fiduciary to       consider factors that are material to investment value. In       particular, a fiduciary should not subordinate the interests       of plan participants and beneficiaries to other objectives,       nor sacrifice investment return or take on additional       investment risk to promote goals unrelated to the plan and       its participants and beneficiaries. We specifically believe       that the proposed removal of the definition of ``pecuniary       factors'' and the revision to the Current Rules providing       that a fiduciary's evaluation of an investment or investment       course of action should be based on factors that ``are       material to investment value'' both clarifies the rule and       ensures that the rule reflects the analysis performed by       fiduciaries when making investment decisions.  [[Page H939]]         We also support the removal of the special rule prohibiting       certain investment alternatives from being considered       qualified default investment alternatives (QDIA) because the       investment references ESG factors. The QDIA restrictions in       the Current Rules add uncertainty and would be difficult to       apply. We agree with the Department that there is not a       reason to prohibit fiduciaries from prudently selecting a       fund that meets the QDIA requirements and includes the       consideration of ESG factors.        We support the Department's efforts to reduce the       uncertainty in the market caused by the Current Rules and we       suggest additional clarification regarding the use of       screens. We believe this clarification could further reduce       uncertainty that might otherwise prevent fiduciaries from       considering ESG factors which are expected to enhance       investment value and performance or improve investment       portfolio resilience against the potential financial risks.        As noted above, we support the removal of ``pecuniary       factors'' and that a fiduciary's evaluation of an investment       or investment course of action should be based on factors       that ``are material to investment value''. We think that the       Department could add additional clarity to the rule or       preamble by clarifying that the proposed rule does not per se       prohibit a fiduciary from using a screen on investments based       in whole or in part on ESG factors.        A common method used by investment managers to incorporate       ESG factors into the assessment of investment risks and       returns is the use of screens. As described in the Proposal,       ``negative screening refers to the exclusion of certain       sectors, companies, or practices from a fund or portfolio       based on ESG criteria.'' The Proposal's discussion of the       benefits that can occur from the use of ESG factors in the       assessment of investment risks and returns relies on sources       that studied the impact of investment managers using screens       based on ESG factors. However, the Current Rules and some       past guidance regarding the use of ESG factors could be read       to preclude the use of screens based on ESG factors.        We suggest that the Department clarify in the final rule or       its preamble that the investment prudence duties and the       investment loyalty duties under Sections 2550.404a-1(b) and       2550.404a-1(c), respectively, do not per se prohibit the use       of screens. For example, it should be permissible for a plan       fiduciary to select investment managers and funds that use       screens to the extent that doing so would otherwise be       consistent with its duties. It should similarly be       permissible for any such investment manager to select an       ``investment course of action'' that uses a screen to the       extent that the resulting investment strategy would otherwise       be consistent with its duties. Such a clarification would       provide certainty to fiduciaries seeking to use ESG factors       in the assessment of investment risks and returns in       accordance with their prudence and loyalty duties. It would       further ensure that plan participants realize the full       benefits of fiduciaries using ESG factors as described in the       Proposal.        We strongly support the Department's efforts to bring       clarity to the use of ESG factors and the exercise of       shareholder rights by plan fiduciaries. We believe the       Proposal and the changes suggested here will promote       retirement income security and further retirement savings by       allowing fiduciaries to better manage risks and improve       investment returns.            Sincerely,                                                  Hanneke Smits,                                            Chief Executive Officer,      BNY Mellon Investment Management.                                   ____                                          Lazard Asset Management,                                                  December 12, 2021.      Office of Regulations and Interpretations,      Employee Benefits Security Administration,      U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam or Sir: Lazard Asset Management LLC (``LAM'')       submits the following comments regarding the above-referenced       proposal to amend the Investment Duties regulation under       Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of       1974, as amended (``ERISA''). See Prudence and Loyalty in       Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,       29 CFR Part 2550, RIN 1210-AC03 (October 14, 2021), 86 Fed.       Reg. 57272 (the ``Proposed Rule'').        LAM is pleased that the Department recognizes that climate       change and other ESG factors are often material to the       assessment of investment risks and returns. We agree with the       Department that the changes proposed not only would clarify       the duties of plan fiduciaries when selecting investment       options, but also would help individuals build retirement       income security and retirement savings. In particular, we       believe that the Proposed Rule, if adopted, will provide       plans with the freedom to leverage the advances that active       asset managers have contributed to ESG analysis and investing       in recent years.        LAM is an investment adviser registered with the Securities       and Exchange Commission, with more than $239.8 billion of       assets under management as of September 30, 2021. We manage       assets on a discretionary basis for a large number of global       clients, including a variety of U.S. defined benefit plans,       defined contribution plans, individual retirement accounts,       and variable annuity portfolios.        LAM's investment decisions are based on proprietary       fundamental and quantitative research techniques that our       professionals have developed over decades. Our firm seeks to       manage client portfolios in a way that delivers investment       performance, maximizes long-term shareholder value, and       limits unwanted risks--including the risks presented by ESG       factors.        The Proposed Rule would allow plan fiduciaries to consider       a wider variety of factors when evaluating plan investment       options under Section 404(a) of ERISA, which sets forth the       standards of prudence that an ERISA fiduciary must satisfy       when selecting investments for a qualified plan. The Proposed       Rule is in response to the rule the Department adopted in       2020, Financial Factors in Selecting Plan Investments, 85 FR       72846 (Nov. 13, 2020) (the ``2020 Rule''), which is       interpreted generally to require plan fiduciaries to select       investments and investment courses of action based solely on       the consideration of ``pecuniary factors.'' The 2020 Rule       also contains a prohibition against adding or retaining any       investment fund, product, or model portfolio as a qualified       default investment alternative (QDIA) if the fund, product,       or model portfolio reflects non-pecuniary objectives in its       investment objectives or principal strategies.        LAM agrees with the Department's overall assessment of the       2020 Rule expressed in Section 3 of the preamble of the       Proposed Rule--specifically, that the 2020 Rule (1) does not       properly reflect the scope of fiduciaries' duties under ERISA       to act prudently and solely in the interest of participants       and beneficiaries when evaluating investments and (2) creates       uncertainty surrounding whether a fiduciary under ERISA may       consider any ESG and other important factors in making       investment decisions. A number of Department bulletins and       pronouncements predating the 2020 Rule effectively guided       plan fiduciaries that they could consider adding ESG       investment options to their plans pursuant to Section 404(a).       See e.g., Interpretive Bulletin 2008-01, Interpretative       Bulletin Relating to Investing in Economically Targeted       Investments, 73 FR 61734 (Oct. 17, 2008); Interpretive       Bulletin 2015-01, Interpretive Bulletin Relating to the       Fiduciary Standard Under ERISA in Considering Economically       Targeted Investments, 80 Fed. Reg. 65135 (Oct. 26, 2015); and       Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2018-01 (April 23, 2018). The       2020 Rule changed the guidance and standards set forth in       those precedents.        The Proposed Rule would add language in paragraph       (b)(2)(ii)(C) of the current regulation to recognize       explicitly that ``consideration of the projected return of       the portfolio relative to the funding objectives of the plan       may often require an evaluation of the economic effects of       climate change and other ESG factors on the particular       investment or investment course of action.''        This would allow plan fiduciaries to evaluate factors that       many other investors already consider material. An analysis       of over 16,000 global firms over the period of 2016 to 2020       conducted by the Lazard Climate Center found investors are       actively pricing in risk from company emissions profiles. The       study found that with all else being equal, changes in       emissions profiles can have an impact on a company's market       valuation. For example, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in       carbon dioxide emissions is associated with a 0.44 percent       price-to-earnings appreciation. In addition, the Swiss Re       Institute's April 2021 report The Economics of Climate       Change: No Action Not an Option, states that ``[t]he       transition towards a low carbon economy . . . has       repercussions for asset valuations. It is clear that climate       transition risks can have a substantial impact on equity and       credit valuations.'' Their analysis concludes that ``under       the current trajectory, global GDP could be 11-14 percent       less by mid-century than in a world without climate change.''        LAM's research recognizes that there will be economic       winners and losers from the low carbon transition, and that       economically material factors should not be ignored in       investment analysis simply because they are of an       environmental, social, or governance nature. The Proposed       Rule properly grants fiduciaries the express permission to       consider material ESG factors in their investment       analysis, which we believe should result in promoting       retirement income security and more secure retirement       savings.        The Proposed Rule ``confirms that a fiduciary may consider       any factor material to the risk-return analysis, including       climate change and other ESG factors'' (emphasis added). It       goes on to list numerous nonexclusive examples:        (i) Climate change-related factors, such as a corporation's       exposure to the real and potential economic effects of       climate change, including its exposure to the physical and       transitional risks of climate change and the positive or       negative effect of Government regulations and policies to       mitigate climate change;        (ii) governance factors, such as those involving board       composition, executive compensation, and transparency and       accountability in corporate decision-making, as well as a       corporation's avoidance of criminal liability and compliance       with labor, employment, environmental, tax, and other       applicable laws and regulations; and        (iii) workforce practices, including the corporation's       progress on workforce diversity, inclusion, and other drivers       of employee hiring, promotion, and retention; its investment       in training to develop its workforce's skill; equal       employment opportunity; and labor relations.  [[Page H940]]         We believe that the examples given in the Proposed Rule,       while necessarily incomplete, do serve the purpose of       providing adequate guidance to plan fiduciaries. We also       believe the Department's examples focus fiduciaries on       economically material considerations.        At LAM, we have embedded ESG insights into our relevant       investment research and portfolio construction functions. We       have developed a proprietary ESG integration framework using       (among other things) materiality mapping, which is being       implemented across relevant investment platforms. As an       active asset manager that has incorporated ESG considerations       into its proprietary research, LAM is able to regularly       provide our clients with examples of how such considerations       have positively influenced investment outcomes. We have made       these investments into our platform because we believe that       investors--including plan fiduciaries--need to understand how       ESG factors impact the financial productivity, operational       risks, and valuations of the companies whose shares and bonds       are in their portfolios.        Paragraph (c)(3) of the Proposed Rule amends the ``tie       breaker'' standard in the 2020 Rule to allow fiduciaries to       use broader discretion when comparing investment options.       Under the proposal, a fiduciary evaluating two suitable       investment options may select the ESG option over the non-ESG       option where both would ``equally serve the financial       interests of the plan over the appropriate time horizon,''       instead of limiting the use of the ``tie-breaker'' standard       to situations in which both are ``economically       indistinguishable.'' LAM agrees with this more comprehensive       approach as it recognizes that fiduciaries should have the       freedom to choose an investment for the purposes of       diversification or to hedge against broad categories of risk,       both of which can lead to better financial performance for a       portfolio.        The Proposed Rule rescinds paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the       current regulation which prevents an investment option to       serve as a qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) if       it includes the use of non-pecuniary factors in its       investment objectives even if the option is prudent from a       risk and return perspective. LAM believes the 2020 Rule in       this regard is contrary to goals of ERISA as it could       potentially exclude financially prudent investment options on       the simple basis that they consider economically material ESG       factors. As previously stated, LAM believes that       consideration of economically material factors should not be       prohibited on the sole basis that they are of an       environmental, social, or governance nature.        We believe that plan fiduciaries should include assessments       of material ESG issues when evaluating retirement plan       investments. The risks identified by an ESG-integrated       assessment are often ultimately detrimental, and the       opportunities identified can be quite additive, to the       financial performance and value of assets in an investment       portfolio. Importantly, the Proposed Rule greatly reduces the       current uncertainty surrounding a fiduciary's consideration       of material ESG factors. It restores trust in fiduciaries by       allowing them to use their professional judgement to evaluate       all material factors when selecting investment options for       plan participants and beneficiaries.        In light of the foregoing, we recommend that the Department       adopt and implement the Proposed Rule as written. We would be       happy to provide the Department with additional information       concerning our comments. Any requests should please be       directed to our General Counsel, Mark Anderson.        Respectfully submitted,      Nikita Singhal,        Co-Head Sustainable Investment & ESG.      Jennifer Anderson,        Co-Head Sustainable Investment & ESG.     Mr. Speaker, this is just a small sample of  the financial industry's support for the underlying rule. We should not  overturn the rule with this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I oppose H.J. Res. 30, I encourage  all Members to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
