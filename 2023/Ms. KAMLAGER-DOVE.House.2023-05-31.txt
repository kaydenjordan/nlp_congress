 Mr. Speaker, I rise in awe of Republicans' ability  to hijack our economy and put lives at risk.   We should be voting on a clean debt limit bill, not a quasi-budget  bill that began with their phony default on America act.   They usurped a legitimate policy process to get gains they knew would  never make it across the finish line. This has been about a vengeful  GOP party chomping at the bit for retribution and willing to push our  country to the brink of economic catastrophe.   Let's not forget where we started. Republicans wanted to cut food  benefits, eliminate healthcare, and take away benefits from veterans.   I want to know how they can say they stand for this Republic and the  American people, when their actions say the opposite. They have proven  what they were willing to do to our families and the global economy.   They think they are drawing blood from Democrats, but really, they  are exacting their pound of flesh from the American people. If that is  what they stand for, then like the Speaker votes, later today should be  easy for them.                            ____________________
