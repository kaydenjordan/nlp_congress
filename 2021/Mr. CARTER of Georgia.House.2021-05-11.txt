 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a  Georgia legend on his induction into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall  of Fame Class of 2020.   Coach Vince Dooley was inducted for his military service and his  lifetime of selfless service to others. After graduating from college,  Coach Dooley served his country in the Marine Corps for 2 years. It is  without question that Coach Dooley has had a positive impact on the  University of Georgia as well as communities across the country.   During his 25 years as head football coach of the University of  Georgia, the Bulldogs won six SEC titles and a national championship.  Coach Dooley's service did not stop on the field and has carried over  into the community. His community service has extended to organizations  such as the Heart Fund, Multiple Sclerosis, Juvenile Diabetes, Boy  Scouts, Salvation Army, and Georgia Easter Seals Society.   He has also traveled abroad and led missions to provide spiritual and  physical healing to those in need.   I want to thank Coach Dooley for his selfless commitment to improving  the lives of others, and I want to congratulate him on his induction.                            ____________________
