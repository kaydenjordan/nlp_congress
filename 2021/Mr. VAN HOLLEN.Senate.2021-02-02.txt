 Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of Mayor Pete Buttigieg to be the Secretary of the  United States Department of Transportation.   I believe Mayor Buttigieg's experience serving the people of South  Bend, IN, as mayor and his service in the U.S. Navy Reserve position  him well to lead the Biden administration's ambitious infrastructure  and climate-related agenda at the Department of Transportation.   In coordination with Congress, Mayor Buttigieg will face numerous  challenges as the Transportation Secretary concerning issues important  to Marylanders.   We must reauthorize WMATA to maintain and improve metro rail and bus  service to Maryland's DC suburbs, develop transit solutions for  Baltimore city and other jurisdictions throughout the State, and  provide pandemic relief assistance for Maryland's motor coach and  transit industries not included in the CARES Act and for whom the most  recent bipartisan package was only a down payment.   We also should focus on repairing and modernizing our infrastructure,  investing in local projects, working with other Federal partners to  expand access to broadband, addressing environmental concerns such as  air and noise pollution plaguing our communities from air traffic, and  connecting communities through the removal of aging infrastructure. As  Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg will also play a vital role  in implementing Presidents Biden's climate change agenda.   As one of the youngest Cabinet Secretaries in decades and the first  openly gay member of a Presidential Cabinet, Mayor Buttigieg's  nomination presents an opportunity to bridge the gap between the  Federal Government and younger generations of Americans and communities  traditionally underrepresented by leadership in government.   I am confident in Mayor Buttigieg's ability to take on these urgent  challenges. And I look forward to voting yes on his nomination and  working closely with him in the years ahead to tackle the issues facing  our national infrastructure and transportation system.    Madam President, I rise to express my support for the  nomination of Mr. Alejandro Mayorkas to serve as Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Secretary. His long career in public service,  first as a prosecutor and later as Director of the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services--USCIS--will provide DHS with much needed  experience, expertise, and stability.   DHS is the third largest Federal agency, and under the Trump  administration, it had six Directors in 4 years, four of whom were  never Senate confirmed. This lack of stability at the leadership level,  combined with the Trump administration's brutal immigration tactics and  confrontational actions against peaceful protesters, sowed chaos and  distrust in and about the Department.   Mr. Mayorkas will need to meet the challenges of restoring moral  authority and guiding the Department through this difficult time. The  challenges are many: executing a nationwide vaccine strategy to combat  COVID-19, combating the rise of far-right, anti-government extremism  and White supremacy, and strengthening our cyber defenses. I was  pleased that he committed to supporting both DACA and TPS and working  with Congress to support these communities. Maryland has a vibrant TPS  population, with over 6,600 TPS holders working in essential industries  during the coronavirus pandemic. Congress must act to extend permanent  protections to these individuals and ensure that they have a safe and  secure future with their families here in the United States. Unlike the  previous administration, which torpedoed bipartisan congressional  efforts to pass commonsense immigration reform, I am confident that Mr.  Mayorkas will work with Congress to tackle these pressing priorities.   I was dismayed that my Republican colleagues sought to delay Mr.  Mayorkas's nomination at such a crucial time. Approximately 4 weeks  ago, domestic terrorists attacked Congress in an attempt to overturn  the 2020 elections. Last week, for the first time, DHS released its  first national bulletin warning about domestic rightwing extremism. The  Department will need to work with the FBI and DOJ to combat one of the  most lethal and persistent threats against our democracy. We cannot  wait a minute longer, and Mr. Mayorkas must be confirmed immediately.    Madam President, I rise to honor Mrs. Barbara Ann  O'Malley, who passed away last month at the age of 93 after a long life  guided by kindness, strength, grace, and humility. Mrs. O'Malley-- affectionately known as Mrs. O to both Hill staffers and Members  alike--served Maryland for 30 years in the office of former Senator  Barbara Mikulski. The indelible mark she has left on our State and on  Capitol Hill will endure for generations.   Barbara Ann O'Malley was born a pioneer. In her youth, she hungered  to fly and earned a pilot's license at the age of 16 on her own  initiative. But it was in the arena of public service where she would  soar. Inspired by her father's service as chair of the county  Democratic Party where she grew up, Barbara started volunteering for  political campaigns when she was still too young to vote. Her passion  for public service brought her from Indiana to Washington, where she  worked for Democratic Congressman Edward Kruse and later became the  national committeewoman for the Young Democrats. And as a mother,  Barbara O'Malley raised her three children on the value of serving  others. Her son Martin grew up to be the mayor of Baltimore, Governor  of Maryland, and a candidate for President of the United States.   After her boys left home, Mrs. O'Malley turned to raising a new  family on Capitol Hill. She spread kindness, collegiality, and  community from the front desk of Senator Mikulski's office for three  decades. She was notorious for dropping off treats at coworker's desks  throughout the day, shuttling baked goods back-and-forth from the so- called BAMtry, a cache of snacks that kept the staff running. And she  gave moral nourishment to the team by sharing advice cultivated through  years in politics. Legions of Hill staffers, from new hires to chiefs  of staff, turned to her for counsel. But it wasn't just staff. Senator  Mikulski likes to say that Mrs. O gave her the ``first briefing of the  day'' when she walked into work. Senators Jay Rockefeller and Arlen  Specter could often be spotted circling her desk just before heading to  the Senate floor. And when I served in the House of Representatives,  Mrs. O'Malley was always the first to warmly greet me on my way in to  see Senator Mikulski, and I always relished the moment.   If flying was her first love, then history was her second. She knew  every fact, detail, and anecdote about the U.S. Senate, and for years,  Barbara O'Malley's Capitol Hill tours were the hottest tickets in town.  She guided Marylanders of all ages and interests through the halls of  American democracy with trademark wit--never compromising between her  reverence for the Senate and her taste for a good joke. At the front  desk, she was known as the office historian, collecting the stories of  constituents who passed through and maintaining a long catalogue of  staff directories that she held onto throughout her life. She forged  deep friendships and kept up with colleagues even after they left the  office.   That was Barbara O'Malley's gift. She saw the multitudes that live in  all of us and treated each person who crossed her path like they were  the first and last thing in the world. That talent for compassion made  her the soul of the Senate for 30 years and makes this loss all the  more painful for me and for my State. But though she has passed, her  spirit survives. Barbara O'Malley's legacy lives on in the generations  of Hill staffers, students, and  [[Page S244]]  public servants whom she taught and trained and who now serve  throughout Washington and across the country.                            ____________________
