 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent need to  protect access to contraception.   Just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v.  Jackson Women's Health Organization stripped millions of women of the  right to abortion care. After this decision, draconian abortion bans in  States across the country immediately went into effect.   In my own State of North Carolina, Republican leaders have made it  abundantly clear that they will take any opportunity to restrict our  rights. Perhaps even more sinister than this decision are the opinions  that accompanied it.   Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion laid the groundwork for  even greater government interference in the personal and family  decisions of our people, including the right to use contraception. Make  no mistake, the American people will not go backward on contraception.   We must codify Griswold v. Connecticut, which has protected women's  right to make decisions about their own contraceptive healthcare for  decades.   This week, we are considering the Right to Contraception Act. This  critical legislation will safeguard contraception and its access in the  face of these extreme attacks. Americans overwhelmingly support the  right to contraception.   Madam Speaker, I hope to hear from my colleagues across the aisle  about how they could do anything other than support expanding  contraception in the wake of the Dobbs decision.   If my colleagues want to prevent abortions, why would they restrict  resources to women who want to avoid unintended pregnancies?   Madam Speaker, I fought to expand access to contraception in North  Carolina with support from legislators on both sides of the aisle.  Twenty years later it is extremely disappointing that we could be going  backward.    Madam Speaker, women across the country are more determined  than ever to combat these relentless attacks on our freedom. I support  the rule and the underlying bills.
