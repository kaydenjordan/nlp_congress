 Mr. Speaker, last week was National Small  Business Week. The end of the week brought, appropriately, not just  good news, but great news:   Unemployment is now below 4 percent for the first time in nearly 20  years.   164,000 new jobs were created last month--24,000 new jobs in  manufacturing and 17,000 new jobs in construction.   Nearly 3.2 million new jobs have been created since the election of  November 2016;   We currently have 6.6 million job openings in the United States. This  is an all-time high.   Wages for small business workers increased last month by 3\1/4\  percent. That is the strongest rate of increase in over 2 years.   All this, plus:   Female unemployment is at its lowest level since 2000;   Black unemployment is at its lowest level ever;   Hispanic unemployment is at its lowest level ever;   Consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2004;   Job market confidence is at its highest level ever; and   Small business confidence is at its highest level ever.   Because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, since February, 90 percent of  American workers--that is nine out of 10 American workers--have been  opening bigger, less-taxed paychecks. They have more take-home pay,  which means that they get to keep more of their hard-earned money to  spend the way they want to spend it, not the way Washington wants to  spend it.   More than 530 companies, and counting, have reinvested billions and  billions of dollars into their businesses and our Nation's economy. As  a result, more than 4 million American workers, and counting, have  received major bonuses and/or pay raises and/or benefit increases.   This includes employees at local companies in western Pennsylvania  like Erie Insurance, who gave their workers a $1,000 bonus, and then  another $1,000 to their retirement plan. NextTier Bank did the same  thing, $1,000 to their workers. And PNC Bank, as well. There are a lot  of good people who work for national companies, like Home Depot and  Walmart. Walmart alone employs 4,000 people in western Pennsylvania.   Energy bills have gone down for more than 87 million of our fellow  citizens in 48 States. That is an incredible lowering of their cost of  living.   According to the International Energy Agency, the United States is on  track to be the world's largest oil producer by 2023. The significance  of this is that we no longer have to be held hostage by bad actors  around the world when it comes to energy. We will be the biggest  exporters of energy in the world. And when we ask other people not to  buy from these folks because of their intentions of how to use that  money, we can replace what they are not able to buy there with our own  homegrown energy. That is an incredible advantage.   Thanks to the most recent National Defense Authorization Act--now,  think about this--our sons and daughters who serve in uniform are going  to be enjoying their largest pay increase in 8 years.   The facts are clear: America is winning again.   Speaker Ryan was addressing a group the other day, and I want to  quote him, because I think this is so appropriate for where we are  today: ``We are working on reforms to get more people out of poverty  and into the workforce. We  [[Page H3842]]  need to make sure that workers have the right skills they need to get a  job and a good career.''   I am talking about a family-sustaining career, a community-building  career, a career that actually allows us to dream.   Right now, our economy is thriving. Americans are right to feel good  about how things are going. We have not seen those kinds of optimistic  statistics in such a long, long time.                                time  1045    So we are going to keep pushing. We are going to keep pushing to  close the skills gap. We are going to close the opportunity gap. We are  going to make sure that all these jobs that are being made available  are being filled with workers who are getting great careers and good  lives and going from poverty and welfare to work.   The dignity of being able to get up in the morning and go to work, to  take care of your families, to take care of your community, to take  care of your churches and schools, what an incredible lift that is for  the American people.   Listen, our Better Way agenda is about one thing and one thing only:  it is about building stronger families, about building stronger  communities, about building a stronger America. It is what we are in  the middle of executing and implementing right now. We are really  excited to see the great economic news that comes as a result of all  these things that we have been working on.   I want you to think about something, Mr. Speaker. Never, never in at  least a decade has America been winning the way we are winning today in  every way and every day. America is truly winning again, and we are  making America great again.                            ____________________
