 Mr. President, on July 4, we celebrated the founding of  our Nation, as we do every year. But when I woke up on this July 4, I  had a strange thought, a thought I never had before, the question of,  What kind of country are we celebrating?   I have always had immense pride in the founding vision of our Nation,  in that vision of equality, of opportunity for all, of freedom of  religion, of equal justice under the law, of equal representation, and,  most importantly, of government of, by, and for the people.   Our journey as a nation over nearly 250 years has been a difficult  journey of moving toward full implementation of this vision. That is an  inspiring journey--a journey I have been proud to witness, a journey I  have been proud to be a part of.   But just days before this year's July 4 celebration, we saw the  conclusion of the Supreme Court's latest judicial term--a term over  which the Court displayed a far different vision for America: one with  devastating repercussions that will reverberate in the lives of  countless Americans for decades to come.   For years now--actually, for decades, we have watched a steady,  relentless effort by rightwing extremists to rig the courts so they can  transform America and American society as we have known it. Their big  goal is corporations over people and their second goal is to implement  conservative cultural policy over individual freedom and liberty.   Now, with this Court's recent decisions, we are left with an  inescapable conclusion: The extremists have succeeded. The Court is now  operating as an unelected super-legislature with a MAGA political  agenda. Their decisions this term read like planks out of the  Republican Party platform.   Here is what the MAGA Court's vision is for our Nation. It is a  vision that obliterates the right to privacy, giving an overbearing  Federal Government the power to be in the medical exam room making  reproductive health decisions for American women, when the only people  who should be in the exam room, under an ``of and by the people''  Republic is the woman, her doctor, and whomever else she chooses to  invite--her partner, her friend, or her religious adviser.   This Court's vision is a vision that embraces never-ending gun  violence, stripping Congress and the States of  [[Page S3531]]  the ability to make commonsense gun safety laws.   It is a vision of a nation where public schools can impose religion  on their students. So much for freedom of religion and separation of  church and State.   It is a vision of a nation where wrongfully incarcerated Americans  don't have the right to prove their innocence and can't find justice if  their Miranda rights were violated. So much for the principle of equal  justice under law, the very principle carved into stone above the doors  of the Supreme Court. In fact, if you go out this door and out the  front steps, you can see those words while standing here on the steps  of the Senate.   This Court's vision is of a nation where the Court strips the Federal  Government of its legally enacted power to regulate fossil carbon and  fossil methane pollution that is destroying our Nation and our planet.   It is a vision where the powerful corrupt the integrity of our  elections with gerrymandering and dark money and measures to prevent  targeted groups of Americans from voting.   This vision is a vision for a government by and for the powerful, not  by and for the people.   This vision in which the Supreme Court becomes a superlegislature for  a MAGA agenda infuriates me. It infuriates me because I believe in  government by and for the people, not by and for the powerful. It  infuriates me because I know the pain that these decisions will inflict  on millions of Americans--the pain of a woman forced by a State  government to carry a fetus to term that was conceived through rape or  incest or the pain of any woman, for that matter, who simply is  unprepared to be pregnant or become a parent; the pain of every single  person who will have to mourn the death of a loved one lost to an ever- growing epidemic of gun violence and mass shootings like we saw in  Uvalde and in Highland Park and in countless other communities with  more than one mass shooting per day; the pain of the citizens blocked  from the ballot box, effectively denied their most fundamental right as  Americans because of voter suppression schemes enacted in many States  over this past year; the pain of students in our public schools  pressured to participate in religious acts in conflict with their own  beliefs; the pain of rural Americans, ranchers, and farmers whose farms  and ranches will be lost to fire and drought because the Court says the  Federal Government cannot regulate fossil carbon and fossil methane  causing climate chaos.   And I am infuriated because I know more Supreme Court decisions like  these are coming from the six MAGA Justices on the Court. They want to  cement their vision of America through superlegislative powers rather  than calling the balls and strikes defending the Constitution, which is  their job.   They have announced that next term they are going to hear a case on  the fringe doctrine known as the independent State legislature  doctrine. It has been considered an extremist idea, which says only  State legislatures have the power to make decisions about Federal  elections and how to appoint electors. State courts would have no power  to ensure checks and balances or decide which decisions about elections  violate a State constitution or ignore the will of the voters, nor  could State Governors veto such legislative decisions. And that is just  the start.   Justice Thomas himself said in his concurring opinion that, based on  the reasoning in Dobbs, he wants the Court to consider a whole host of  other rights that have been secured and protected by previous Courts,  including the possibility of striking down the right to intimacy and  marriage for same-sex couples and the right to contraception.   Make no mistake, this is not some sudden occurrence. It is exactly  what the Federalist Society has been working toward for decades.   Before joining the Court in 1972, Lewis Powell wrote about the need  to rebuild the power of industrial elites and fight back ``from the  college campus, the pulpit, the media, the intellectual and literary  journals, the arts and sciences, and from politicians'' against  progressive changes in society. In outlining a plan for rebuilding the  power of Big Business, he declared that, with an activist-minded  Supreme Court, the judiciary may be the most important instrument for  achieving that goal.   That is exactly why, as majority leader in 2017, Senator McConnell  stole a Supreme Court seat from one President so another President  could fill it. He stole it in 2016, and he filled it in 2017 with MAGA  Justice Neil Gorsuch. It is why, in 2018, Leader McConnell completely  ignored credible accounts of sexual assault and rushed through a  confirmation without giving Senators access to the nominee's full  records and bypassing committee quorum rules to fill another seat with  MAGA Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And it is why, when a seat opened up in  another election year, 2020, just weeks before the voters would vote,  Leader McConnell completely reversed his argument that he had used to  justify the theft of a Supreme Court seat in 2016, and he rammed  through the nomination of MAGA Justice Amy Coney Barrett.   The Republican Party has won one popular vote for President in the  last 30 years but has appointed two-thirds of the sitting Justices, who  now see it as their job to become a super-legislature for a cultural  agenda and corporate power.   In one of his columns, Eugene Robinson of the Washington Post  described the resulting unelected, unaccountable majority of Supreme  Court Justices as a ``junta''--a word used to describe authoritarian  leaders who rule through edicts rather than through legislative  determination or deliberation on constitutional principles. It is hard  to argue with Eugene Robinson's characterization.   In spite of what the vast majority of Americans want--the protection  of a woman's right to full reproductive healthcare and more gun safety,  not less, and free and fair elections--the Court's MAGA majority has  chosen to rule by Supreme Court edict to inflict their narrow  preferences for society on hundreds of millions of Americans.   And they are not just using the regular process for considering  cases. Over the past 5 years, we have seen a monumental shift in the  Court's use of emergency orders--the so-called shadow docket--to enact  sweeping decisions on the American people. These cases don't get the  full process we are familiar with--formal briefings, formal hearings,  lengthy deliberations, and opinion writings--because it is argued that  the applicant would suffer ``irreparable harm'' if their request were  not immediately granted.   The shadow docket decisions, by the way, are usually unsigned and  unexplained. In the past, they have essentially involved death penalty  cases--cases of literal life and death--of pretty much extreme  importance to the applicant because, if someone is executed before  their case is heard, they do suffer ``irreparable harm''--the standard.   Then, about 5 years ago, we started to see a big shift in the  emergency cases being taken up and in the substances of them as well.   We have seen the shadow docket used to stop the Federal Government  from implementing a vaccine and testing mandate on businesses to  protect public health in the middle of an unprecedented global health  crisis that has killed more than a million Americans.   We have seen it used to uphold a Texas law banning abortion after 6  weeks.   We have seen it used when a lower court blocked Alabama's  congressional map because it violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting  the political power of Black voters.   The Court said: You have got to draw a new map that is fair.   The Supreme Court stepped in with their shadow docket and said: No.  Alabama can use this faulty map that dilutes the power of Black  Americans.   In this situation, the Court didn't stop the infliction of harm; they  inflicted the harm on Black Americans, who want fair maps, who deserve  fair maps for voting in our democracy. That gerrymandered map is now in  place to disenfranchise Black voters in this November's election  because of the Supreme Court's use of the shadow docket.   It is hard to see how any of these cases met the test for the shadow  docket.   The state of abuse of the shadow docket has gotten so bad and so  blatant that even Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Court,  joined a dissent in a case reinstating a Trump administration Clean  Water Act regulation limiting Federal protections for streams and  wetlands. This dissent  [[Page S3532]]  stated that the majority's decision ``renders the court's emergency  docket,'' meaning the shadow docket, ``not for emergencies at all . . .  . The docket becomes only another place for merits determinations-- except made without full briefing and argument.'' When the Supreme  Court's Chief Justice says the shadow docket is being abused, you know  it is true.   This MAGA Court is so determined to impose their legislative  priorities and values on our country that they have abandoned one of  the core principles of American jurisprudence, going back to even  before there was a United States of America, and that is that the Court  only rules when there is an actual dispute or controversy in question.    In their eagerness to cripple the Federal Government's ability to  fight fossil carbon pollution, the MAGA Justices weighed in on a  regulation that had never been enforced--a regulation that had been  withdrawn by President Trump and a regulation which President Biden had  indicated was never going to be reinstated. Even the utilities that  would have been regulated didn't want the Supreme Court to decide this  case. This out-of-control MAGA Supreme Court super-legislature wanted  to legislate--and legislate they did--violating a core principle that  the Court does not address moot cases. Moot cases are cases where there  is nothing still in dispute, and this certainly was the case that this  case was as dead or as moot as it could be because nobody could be  impacted by a rule that doesn't exist.   Why did the Court take up this case?   Well, we may not be able to specify the exact reasoning by each  Justice, but the effect is clear. By taking up this case, the Court  furthered the MAGA policy agenda. Their ruling handcuffed Federal  authorities' ability to pursue future limitations on pollutions from  fossil fuels like carbon dioxide and fossil methane. This is to the  enormous benefit of the fossil fuel billionaires who funded the massive  dark money campaigns that supported these Justices' confirmations. That  situation of their breaking precedent to benefit the fossil  billionaires, who had just funded their confirmation campaigns, reeks  of corruption.   When generations ahead of us look back at this moment, I have no  doubt--especially when they look at this year, 2022, and what the Court  did in a single year--they will look back with a sense of profound  disbelief--disbelief--like that disbelief that we experience when we  look back on cases like Dred Scott, which dehumanized Black Americans  and legitimized slavery, or Plessy v. Ferguson, which locked in 60  years of vicious discrimination and racial terrorism under a separate  but equal philosophy.   The disbelief that future generations will have will be directed at  Dobbs--a decision this year in which the Court obliterated privacy and  put an overbearing government in charge of women's reproductive health.   They will have the disbelief that, in Kennedy v. Bremerton--decided  this year--the Court destroyed freedom of religion in our public  schools; the disbelief that, in West Virginia v. EPA--a decision this  year--the Court violated centuries of precedent to rule on a regulation  that is no longer on books, with the effect--perhaps the goal--of  limiting the future regulation of greenhouse gas pollution; the  disbelief in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen-- decided this year--that the Court ruled that a State legislature can't  require folks to have a good reason to carry a concealed weapon in  public spaces.   Let me be clear. This activist, extremist MAGA Court faces a  legitimacy crisis, and a legitimacy crisis for the Court is a crisis  for our democratic Republic. Part of that illegitimacy is Justices of  the Supreme Court selectively using a doctrine of so-called originalism  to justify their politically inspired decisions. The doctrine of  originalism is based on a reasonable argument, one on which you and I  would say makes sense: a goal of understanding what the Founders meant  when they wrote what they wrote in our Constitution more than two  centuries ago. But if that effort is applied selectively, it simply  becomes a measure to justify, after the fact, where the Justices want  it to come out. They use it when it works, and they abandon it when it  doesn't.   For example, the Founders wrote the Second Amendment to ensure that  members of well-regulated militias had access to their rifles, but the  so-called originalists on the Court cast originalism aside, declaring  that the Founders wrote that clause to ensure that nonmilitia members  had the right to bring assault rifles--that didn't exist in 1787--onto  subways, which didn't exist in 1787. That is bogus originalism in its  purist form.   Consider this: Corporations, as we know them today, did not exist in  1787. Yet the so-called originalists on the Court insist that the  Founders' vision of the First Amendment, to protect freedom of speech,  gives corporations speech rights even though the word ``corporation''  doesn't appear in the Constitution--a point that they use when they  want to take an originalist argument: that the Founders had to have it  be something written in the Constitution and be something they  discussed and something they considered and something they envisioned.  None of those are true. Not a one of them is true in this case.   The MAGA Court also claims that a corporation is a person, which no  Founder would ever have argued. They didn't even know what a  ``corporation'' was because they didn't exist in this form that we have  now.   The MAGA Court goes on to claim that the members comprising the  corporate personhood--those are the stockholders of a corporation--have  absolutely no right to know how that corporation that they are part of  spends their money. This is absurdity stacked on the fallacy that a  corporation is a person.   I have yet to see and yet to hear any plausible explanation as to how  the MAGA Justices can be confident that the Founders intended for  billionaire CEOs to hijack the accumulated wealth of their stockholders  without their stockholders' knowledge or permission or opportunity to  know what is being said and to use that money as speech and to spend it  on secretly funded campaigns, including campaigns to confirm Supreme  Court Justices.   The problem we face, colleagues, isn't just a MAGA-majority Court  enacting terrible policy rather than defending the balls and strikes  against the Constitution. The problem is greater if the highest Court  in the land loses its legitimacy, the law itself loses its legitimacy.  If the American people see the Supreme Court Justices making clear that  the law has no meaning other than their political preferences, then the  law is not the foundation for our society that it is supposed to be.   We have seen with deadly results on January 6, 2021, the consequences  to our policies, to our politics, and to our society when the rule of  law is replaced by violence and power as the organizing principle for  society.   The Court is essential in a society based on the rule of law, and it  is essential to have a Court that honors the law rather than trying to  write the law.   This MAGA majority and its desire, and operation as a super- legislature--unelected, lifetime appointments--is a dire threat to our  Republic. Here in Congress, we must not only shine a light--a  spotlight--on the threat; we must stop the runaway MAGA Court from  corrupting the rule of law and try to restore the legitimate role of  the Court as a panel defending our Constitution.   Some will say there is no way to restore the Court and that any  strategy for restoring the Court will simply compound the problems we  are now facing, and I agree that there is no simple way to restore the  legitimacy of the Court.   Back in 2017, when then-Majority Leader McConnell was striving to  complete the theft of the Supreme Court seat taken from the  administration of Barack Obama, I took to this floor for 15\1/2\ hours  with one simple message: Don't do it. Don't do it because, if you do,  you will damage the legitimacy of the Court and there will be no simple  path, no easy remedy to restore the Court's legitimacy.   But Leader McConnell, he doused the Supreme Court with gasoline on  that day, and he set it on fire. He did the damage. I stood here for  15\1/2\ hours and said don't do it.   You know, we take an oath of office to a Constitution. That involves  defending the Court, not delegitimizing the Court, not stealing Supreme  Court  [[Page S3533]]  seats. It was the first time in the history of the United States of  America that this Senate failed to debate and vote on a nominee. But  here we are; the damage is done. What do we do now?   When an arsonist sets fire to your house, you don't let it burn  because you are worried about water damage. You have to strive to put  out that fire, regardless of how difficult the task. So I say to you  today, we cannot accept the defeatist attitude that fails to confront  the forces destroying our Republic.   There are two things we must do. Mission one, we have to reform the  ability of this broken Senate to serve as a legislature because, if it  serves effectively as a legislature, it can serve as a counterweight to  decisions of a corrupted Court.   The second thing we have to do is put all options on the table and  debate them for directly reforming the Court, recognizing that we are  left with difficult choices on how to do that. But we have to step up.  It is necessary to save our Republic.   So let's take each of these missions in turn. The first is to restore  the Senate.   Our goal: Restore the Senate as a legislative body to serve as a  counterweight to the corruption of a MAGA-majority Court.   There are three massive problems currently afflicting the Senate's  ability to serve as a functioning legislative body. First, we spend  virtually all of our time on nominations, so much time that it keeps us  from doing much legislating, even though we have a massively complex  society and a lot of possibilities for making it work better.   When George Washington was assembling his first administration, he  had to appoint and the Senate had to confirm four Cabinet positions:  Secretary of War, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, and  Attorney General--four positions. Today, the Senate is responsible for  confirming over 1,200 Presidential appointments to executive branch  positions and commissions.   Now, in the past, both parties worked to exercise the Senate's advice  and consent responsibilities in a manner that minimized the amount of  Senate time required. Most were done by unanimous consent late at  night, when practically anyone was here because most nominations are  not ones to which anyone has an objection.   In the entire decade of the 1960s, there was one vote required to  close debate on a nominee--one, in an entire 10 years. But, last  decade, that number went to 545. Now, it is like every nomination.  Virtually every nomination we have to file to close debate and vote to  close debate before we can vote on the nominee. And do you know what?  The way it works, you can also require 30 hours of debate after the  vote to close debate succeeds.   So the rules, which were designed for exceptional situations where  there is a significant objection, are now used as partisan obstruction.   Democrats are in the minority. They want to tie up the Republicans.  So they have little time to legislate.   Republicans are in the minority. They want to tie up the Democrats.  So they have little time to legislate.   They want each other to fail, partly because they disagree and partly  because they know if the other side succeeds in making something work,  the voters might reward them at the ballot box.   We have to massively streamline this nomination process. We have to-- 100 Senators--work together, not do what is best for us when we are in  the majority and oppose it when we are in the minority, or vice versa.  We all have a responsibility to completely streamline that process so  we can return to being a legislature.   The second big problem for the Senate is that the rules provide a  complicated, time-consuming process for debating and voting on whether  to debate a bill. It involves a motion to proceed or requirement to  close debate on the motion to proceed and whose nomination is up to 30  hours of additional of debate--all on the question of whether to  debate. You have 100 capable people sent here by their constituents in  their various States to solve problems for America, not to spend a week  debating whether to debate a single bill. That could be a week spent  debating the amendments that could make the bill better, a week spent  considering individual pieces of the bills so the public knows where we  stand and there is public accountability. But, instead, we have  partisan paralysis. A completely dysfunctional Senate, that is what we  have. We have to change the rules to stop this completely meritless  waste of the time and efforts of 100 Senators.   It is an easy solution: 1 hour spent debating whether to debate a  bill, and then a simple majority vote, either we go to the bill or we  don't; easy solution. One hour makes much more sense than 1 week.   The third big problem this Senate Chamber faces is a secret silent  filibuster. Under the Senate rule--and by the way, the term  ``filibuster'' is really inappropriate because this involves no  speaking of any kind. Under the Senate rule, 41 Senators can, operating  as a block, veto the opportunity for the Senate to debate a bill, veto  the opportunity for the Senate to consider an amendment, and veto the  ability, after amendments have been considered, to have a final vote on  the bill. It is the triple veto: three opportunities for the minority  to blockade the majority from being able to consider legislation to  address the issues facing America. And both parties have attempted to  use it when they are in the minority. We have to restore the ability to  actually debate.   It is exactly what the Founders feared. When I lay out that 41 can  block and veto these 3 steps of the process, it means to reverse it-- that 60 out of 100, a supermajority, has to agree to go forward through  each of those three steps.   The Founders warned us: Never allow the minority to make the  decisions by requiring a supermajority. Don't to it.   That is why James Madison said that, with a supermajority, when ``the  general good might require new laws . . . the principle of free  government would be reversed. It would no longer be the majority that  would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.''   It is why Alexander Hamilton warned that a supermajority requirement  would result in ``tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue;  contemptible compromises of the public good.''   He also warned that ``the history of every political establishment in  which this principle has prevailed''--the principle of supermajority-- ``is a history impotence, perplexity, and disorder.''   Now, you may wonder if the Founders had simply read about someone  somewhere requiring a supermajority for legislature and said it didn't  work very well and thought, We had better warn Americans not to do  this. No, they were writing from their direct experience because, as  they were drafting and debating our 1787 Constitution, they were  actually in the middle of living through the impotence and incompetence  of the Confederation Congress.   Under the Articles of Confederation, which preceded our 1787  Constitution, the Congress had to have a supermajority on every  provision; meaning, the position of the minority could prevail over the  position of the majority. The result was paralysis on the most  fundamental issues they faced. They failed to raise the funds to pay  the pensions of the veterans who spilled their blood in the  Revolutionary War that created this Nation. They failed to raise the  funds to put down Shays' Rebellion.   Well, today, we have not one stage of veto, like they faced in the  Confederation Congress, we have the triple veto power under the current  secret, silent filibuster, and we are seeing the same impotence, the  same paralysis, the same partisanship that it drives.   The triple veto power of the minority is destroying the Senate to  address challenges facing America, and there are a lot of them.   We have got the climate crisis that is literally setting our country  on fire. Right now, at this very moment, around 40 million Americans  across the Plains and the Mississippi Valley are dealing with alerts  for dangerous and intense heat, while firefighters are confronting 89  large fires across 12 States. And as of last week, four times as much  acreage has burned this year as last year at this moment.   And it is not just America, of course. Across the Atlantic, Europe is  going through a recordbreaking heat wave, reaching temperatures some of  those  [[Page S3534]]  places have never seen and causing wildfires to burn in France and  Spain and Italy and Greece.   Congress should be immersed in considering bills to address the  climate crisis that is damaging communities across our country, and not  just through fires but through rising sea levels and rising erosion,  through pine beetle infestations and mosquito infestations, through  stronger hurricanes and stronger tornadoes, and, certainly, through the  power of multiyear droughts. But we are not because the triple veto of  the silent, secret filibuster afflicting this body is blocking us from  doing so.   We have a housing crisis. Out-of-control rents and prices make it  impossible for millions of Americans to afford a decent home to rent or  buy. And colleagues have one idea after another about how we should  address it, but because we are paralyzed and our process is taken up,  our time is taken up with nominations and debating whether to debate  and we have the triple veto of the secret, silent filibuster, they  can't move forward. And we aren't debating, discussing, and hopefully  passing measures that can make a difference.   And Americans are outraged by the prices they pay on drugs, which are  so much higher than any other developed country. Eighty percent of  Americans say: Do something about it. And I think the other 20 percent  don't realize how much we are getting ripped off. And Americans know we  should get the best price because we invest the most in the research  and development that creates these drugs, not the worst price, and they  are absolutely right. And we would have passed legislation by now to  get the best prices in the developed world, but we are blocked by the  triple veto of the secret, silent filibuster.   And now States are passing laws to block targeted groups of Americans  from voting. We can fix that by passing S. 1, the For the People Act,  or its reincarnation, the Freedom to Vote Act, but we can't because it  was blocked by the triple veto of the secret, silent filibuster.   Let me be absolutely clear. The single most effective way we can  counterbalance an out-of-control Court with a MAGA agenda is to have a  functioning Senate. That is the most immediate remedy available to us  to respond to this terrible affliction undermining our Republic.   If the Court says there is no problem with gerrymandered districts,  where politicians choose their constituents instead of Americans  choosing their leaders, as they did in the 2019 Rucho v. Common Cause  decision, well, a reformed, restored Senate could pass legislation to  require nonpartisan commissions to draw legislative districts. At least  we could have a robust debate over it, maybe pass a few amendments  modifying it in different forms--or perhaps find some other solution-- if we had a functioning legislative process.   If the Court says there is no limit to dark money from corporations  and billionaires who flood and drown out the voices of ordinary  Americans and campaigns, as they did in the 2010 Citizens United  decision, a reformed, restored Senate could pass the DISCLOSE Act to  shine a light on every dollar and where it is coming from in American  campaigns.   If the Court says that anyone who wants to be able to carry a  concealed weapon should be able to like they did in their New York  State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen decision, a restored,  functioning Senate could pass stronger gun safety laws that most  Americans support, like ending the background check loophole--when guns  are bought and sold by unlicensed parties online or at gun shows--or by  outlawing the kinds of large magazines that carry 30 or more bullets  that are often used in mass shootings.   And when the Court went to abnormally great lengths to decide in last  month's West Virginia v. EPA that the Agency can't regulate fossil  carbon or fossil methane emissions, a functioning Senate would be able  to step up and create the programs designed to speed up the transition  to renewable energy, which would have the added benefit of ending our  addiction to oil and dropping the prices at the pump, and it would keep  money out of the hands of dictators in Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.  But the triple veto of the secret, silent filibuster has blocked us  from doing so.   The remedy is not to eliminate the filibuster. The remedy is to  reform it. The right reform is to adopt the public, talking filibuster.  The talking filibuster would reassert the fundamental principle of  legislative conduct: the Senate Code, adopted by the original Senate.  Under that code, the Senate listened to every Senator's perspective,  and then it took a vote on the issue, be it a bill or be it an  amendment. That was the Senate Code.   The original rules provided that every Senator had the right to speak  twice to a question. It was rule No. 4 in the original rules. It is in  our rules today. But the spirit of that code--listening to each Senator  and then voting, with the majority winning, not losing--that part is  gone. Now, it is the minority that can exercise a triple veto, a veto  absolutely exactly the opposite of what the Founders said to us. They  said: Don't do it. And we have done it in triplicate form, paralyzing  this place and accentuating the temptation of yielding to partisanship  rather than problem-solving.   Jefferson did say that this rule, this code of listening to every  Senator and voting, should not be abused. In fact, he said this in his  manual for rules in 1801:         No one is to speak impertinently or beside the question,       superfluously or tediously.    It worked for the Founders. They exercised some self-control, so much  so that they didn't need the rule that they had to close debate. They  just simply listened to everyone with mutual respect and then said: OK.  Let's take a vote.   You want to see that in action today? Watch the committee process on  a bill with amendments. There is no one filibustering, speaking  forever. There is no one requiring a supermajority to close debate in  committee. They operate--we operate--in committee, much like the  original Senate, and it works pretty well, but we have completely lost  that discipline when it comes to debate here on our floor.   So the early Senate had a rule for the previous question motion, to  close debate or accelerate the closure of debate. And when they rewrote  the rule book--and Aaron Burr was in charge of it--in 1806, they  dropped the rule because they never used it, didn't feel they ever  needed it.   Well, we need to reclaim that vision, and our rules have gotten so  crazy, so out of whack, that we encourage partisanship and paralysis  rather than problem-solving. Let's fix that.    So let's have the talking filibuster. The talking filibuster says,  Yes, you can speak on the issue. We will listen to everyone. You can  speak twice. But then we vote, and the majority wins--not a  supermajority required. The minority doesn't win over the majority. The  majority wins.   That was the Senate. That was the design of our Constitution that we  have the responsibility to restore because we took an oath to the  Constitution. So let's restore it. And that talking filibuster  encourages bipartisan problem-solving. The minority, be it the  Democratic or Republican, that wants to slow things down for leverage,  they can. So they have significant leverage, but, on the other hand,  they have an incentive to negotiate because they are not sure how long  they can maintain continuous debate. And that is the heart of the  talking filibuster: maintaining continuous debate. If there is a break  in debate, you go to the vote.   Meanwhile, the majority has an incentive to compromise because they  know the minority can tie this place up on a single bill for week after  week, and they can't afford to have that much time taken over a single  bill. So the talking filibuster restores an incentive for compromise  and bipartisan problem-solving and, in the end, restores the vision  that the majority makes the decision, not the minority. In the end, it  gives the minority a voice, it gives the minority massive leverage, but  it takes away their veto. That is the right way to legislate in a  democracy.   As I noted before, fixing the Senate is probably the best immediate  tool we have for repairing the damage from the Supreme Court across the  grounds. But we also have to consider every possible remedy to restore  the Court itself, to restore a Court that calls the balls and strikes  on the Constitution, defending  [[Page S3535]]  its core principles, and recognizes it is not there to legislate--not  to legislate on the left side, not to legislate on the right side. They  are there to defend the Constitution.   Well, reforming the Court won't be easily done. But President Biden  did convene a Commission to explore the option, and that Commission has  produced a lengthy, lengthy report. This is part of it: The  Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States,  December of last year.   I encourage all my colleagues to read this and consider the ideas in  it. In this 300-page report, the Commission does review the history of  how the Court has been in different phases, and its size has changed  all the time because that is not established in the Constitution. It  has been as few as 5, and it has been more than 10. There was not nine  locked in like it is now.   And, certainly, one of the ideas they review is adjustment to the  size of the Court. Many people have said that is something to look at  to balance what has happened with the Court, with the stolen Supreme  Court seat and a decision by several Justices to be a legislature  rather than a court.   Well, that is one idea. Another is implementing term limits or a  mandatory retirement age because, when the Constitution was first  written, people weren't living the long lives they have today, and they  didn't stay in the Court forever.   In 1787, the Founders wrote that Justices would hold their seats  during good behavior. Now, I am not sure that every Justice across  these grounds has been engaged in good behavior when they are choosing  to legislate rather than to rule on the defense of the Constitution,  but there is no easy way to remove them from the Court for misbehavior.   But one possibility is for the Court members to rotate out with term  limits of some kind. That is one possibility.   In much of our history, Justices only served an average of 15 years  on the Court. The average is now 26 and getting longer. And, did you  know, America is the only constitutional democracy that gives lifetime  presence on the Court, that doesn't have either a term limit or a  mandatory retirement age?   This report, this Commission, has other ideas in it: rotating  membership on the Court with judges selected from the circuit court.  You know, the original Supreme Court, they served as circuit court  writers. They went out and made decisions across this country. They  didn't just sit in a room in the capital. So there is some precedent  for that idea.   And others point out that there is the power to restrict the Court's  jurisdiction. There are pros and cons for these various ideas, and our  commitment needs to be to examine them. The American public is open to  examining them.   Earlier this week, the FOX News poll reported that 66 percent of the  folks in their poll support an 18-year term for Justices, and 71  percent support a mandatory retirement age. So the American people are  open to trying to fix the challenge with the Court. We have to be open  to fixing it, and we need to look at every option and idea very  carefully to ensure that the highest Court in our land fulfills the  vision for it in our Constitution. And the vision in our Constitution  was not that it would be an unelected super-legislature.   Colleagues, this is a perilous moment for our Republic. It is a  moment when the will of the people is being overrun by an extreme  agenda of a Court legislating from the Bench, imposing their narrow and  precedent-destroying will on all Americans. We have to restore the  ability of this Senate to operate as a legislature that can be a  counterbalance to what the Court does, and we must thoughtfully  consider every proposal for reforming the Court directly.   We can and we must act before it is too late. We can't stand by and  watch the continuous disintegration of our Republic.   Our oath to the Constitution demands that we protect these  institutions and repair them when they go off track. And when we do,  the next July 4, we can all join together and celebrate the restoration  of our paralyzed and partisan Senate into an actual legislative body.  We can celebrate the restoration of Americans' rights that are being  continuously stripped away across the grounds by the Supreme Court. We  can have a renewed belief and confidence in the integrity of all of our  institutions and our democratic form of governance. That would be a  moment justifying a massive celebration next July 4.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 406, S. 3895.
