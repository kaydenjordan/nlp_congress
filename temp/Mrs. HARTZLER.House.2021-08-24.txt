 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of my  dear friend and the longest serving member of my staff, Steve Walsh.   Steve spent many years as a journalist covering politics in  Washington, D.C. and Jefferson City, Missouri. He was one of my  earliest supporters and spent the past decade serving the people of  Missouri's Fourth Congressional District until his passing last week.   Steve leaves behind his beloved wife, State Representative Sara  Walsh, and numerous friends throughout Missouri and our Nation.   He was always fun and full of sense of humor, love of major league  baseball, the Beatles, and his faith.   Steve not only loved history, he lived history. He once took a selfie  in France with Speaker Pelosi on the 75th anniversary of D-day. In  1985, while dining in Midtown Manhattan, Steve was asked by his editor  to cover the assassination of Gambino crime boss Paul Castellano, where  he incredibly encountered him deceased on the sidewalk. His life was  truly filled with remarkable experiences.   Missouri has not only lost a true public servant, but a wonderful  friend to so  [[Page H4358]]  many. Today we mourn the passing of Steve Walsh, but we also rejoice  that he resides with his Creator now.   May his spirit live on throughout our work in Congress and in the  hearts of all who were blessed to know him.                            ____________________
