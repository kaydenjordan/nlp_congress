 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4296, sponsored  by my colleague Blaine Luetkemeyer. This bipartisan bill makes  important corrections in the bank capital requirements for operational  risk. Under the legislation, regulators would continue to be able to  consider the bank's operational risk, but would do so in a forward- looking manner.   Currently, financial institutions are required to hold risk-based  capital, even for discontinued activities and products. Accounting and  the capital markets often use the concept of pro forma financials,  which means you consider the ongoing operations, or the way that it  would look if it looks like it is today, going forward. This bill would  institute that same approach for regulators to use pro forma  operational risk, so they wouldn't have to continue to charge a capital  charge on operations that have been discontinued.   I think the chairman made a great comment about you don't buy home  insurance on a home you have already sold. My colleague, Mr.  Luetkemeyer,  [[Page H1311]]  during the markup of this bill, talked about how the Basel Committee  has revised this specific capital requirement several times, but it is  still a work in progress. This legislation is just a commonsense change  to make sure that banks are not charged capital charges against things  that they aren't doing anymore.   This approach will free up capital that is needlessly on the  sidelines and put it back in reach of America's job creators. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4296.
