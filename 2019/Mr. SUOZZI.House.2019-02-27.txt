 Madam Speaker, I just voted for H.R. 8, and I stand in  support of H.R. 1112.   It has been 1 year since Parkland. It has been 6 years since Sandy  Hook. It has been 19 years since Columbine. It has been 25 years since  the Long Island Rail Road massacre, when Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy  lost her husband and her son was shot in the head. It has been 37 years  since President Reagan was shot.   Think of all the suffering that each of these shootings has caused.  Think of the missing seats at the dinner table and other family events.   Countless families have been torn apart because of gun violence,  including that of one of my constituents, Linda Beigel Schulman.   Linda's son, Scott, was one of the 17 innocent people who lost their  lives in Parkland that day last year. Scott, a geography teacher and a  cross-country coach, gave his life protecting his students. Scott died  heroically while locking the door to his classroom, where students were  hiding from the approaching gunman.   Since that date, we have been pushing more and more for commonsense  gun reform, and H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are just that.   Last week, Linda said to me, ``If a universal background check  prevents just one shooting, it has served its purpose.''   She inspires me. And I am inspired by my colleagues who are fighting  for commonsense gun reform, whether they be Democrats or Republicans.                            ____________________
