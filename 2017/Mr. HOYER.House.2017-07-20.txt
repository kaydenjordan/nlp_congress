 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the  information that he has given us.   Suffice it to say there are a couple of these bills, obviously, that  give us great pause. But having said that, the Appropriations  Committee, over the last few weeks, has marked up, I think, all of its  bills now, 12 bills. There was discussion about bringing an omnibus  with all 12 bills in it. That has obviously not happened, and so we  have what we refer to as a minibus.   We only have 17 legislative days left, Madam Speaker, until the end  of the fiscal year on September 30. First, I would like to ask the  majority leader if he can tell us the process under which the minibus  will be considered. As the gentleman pointed out, there are four  distinct appropriations bills that are included in the minibus.   Is this going to be an open rule?   Will all of these bills be open to amendment, or will they be  considered under a rule so that our Members can prepare for the  consideration of these appropriations bills?   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman made an observation about there were  more Democratic amendments. That is unusual for your bills. We usually  find more Republican amendments to your bills than we do Democratic  amendments. But having said that, I think the gentleman's observation  is correct.   I want to make it clear to Members of the House, perhaps, who have  not served here very long, the first year I was majority leader in  2007, it wasn't just consideration in committee. We passed through the  House of Representatives all 12 appropriations bills and sent them to  the Senate prior to the August break so that the Senate had a full  month to consider them. We didn't get them all done, as you have  suspected.   But in any event, I don't think I have ever seen, Mr. Leader, an  omnibus passed prior to the August break. Individual bills being  passed, but a minibus of this nature with, as you point out, 66 percent  of the discretionary spending, which, by the way, there is no budget,  and, therefore, this breaks the sequester level. It breaks the  agreements that we have had in the past under Ryan-Murray for 4 years,  two Congresses, and the number that is being used is a number that was  simply taken out of the air. There has been no vote on the floor, no  other way to have set that number.   We also believe that the amendments that are going to be offered are  going to be offered in a very short space of time, and that is going to  be a problem, but we will see what the rule says.   Can the gentlemen tell me, do we expect to bring the other eight  bills to the floor in September?   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Now, the gentleman mentioned that the border wall was going to be  fully paid for. The Homeland Security bill is not a part of the package  that includes four bills. Madam Speaker, can the gentleman tell me what  bill that will be included in?   I yield to my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   It is an amendment made in Rules. Is that going to be an amendment  that will be made in order for full consideration and debate on the  floor of the House of Representatives?   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that  answer.   Given the fact that, as the gentleman has pointed out, this was made  a major issue by the administration during the campaign, in light of  the fact that there are many members of his own administration who  believe the wall will not work and is not the most effective way to do  what all of us agree ought to be done, and that is to keep our border  secure and to make sure that we know who is coming into the United  States of America--I think that is a unanimous position, frankly, of  the Members of this House.   This border wall, as I understand it, is in none of the four bills  that have been marked up by the committee. Therefore, my presumption is  the Rules Committee is, in some fashion, going to add this. If they add  it, frankly, to the rule and that it is adopted as a result of the  adoption of the rule, that will preclude a vote on the wall.   Now, I know the gentleman doesn't like me to quote his book, but it  seems to me, in the book, every issue was going to be taken on its own,  discretely, and that Members of the House would be able to work their  will.   If it is in the rule, that is, I think, not consistent with that  ability of Members of the House to fully debate whether or not we ought  to be putting billions and billions and billions of dollars into a wall  and whether or not that wall would be effective to accomplish the  objective.   Madam Speaker, can the gentleman assure me that it will not be simply  included and assumed to be adopted by the adoption of the rule itself  and will, in fact, be an amendment on which the House can engage and  work its will?   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    I am enthralled by it, Mr. Majority Leader.    Madam Speaker, I understand the majority leader's  reticence to answer the question because he says he can't speak for the  Rules Committee. I understand that. But the fact of the matter is this  is an important issue. It ought to be considered by the House.   It ought to have every Member's ability to speak to the issue of  whether or not we ought to build that wall, not whether we ought to  have security--we all agree that we should and must have security--but  whether we do it with a wall, as I said, in which many members of the  current administration do not believe it will work and have been quoted  as saying so in the past, and there are many Members on our side who  feel that.   I would hope that the majority leader would at least make it known to  the Rules Committee that we ought to have that as a freestanding  amendment, not incorporate it in a rule that the vote for the rule or a  vote against the rule is, of itself, a vote on the wall itself.   Lastly, Mr. Leader, I want to say that you and I are both very  concerned about the Russian sanctions and Iranian sanctions bill that  is pending. We have been working very hard on that, very constructively  on that, and I look forward, over the next 24 hours, more or less, to  see whether or not we could get that resolved.   We have introduced, as you know, the Senate bill as a House bill. We  would be for that if it would be brought to the floor. But we want to  make sure that we move a bill, as you do, as quickly as possible and  get agreement with the Senate and move that bill to the President's  desk.    I thank you for your work on that, and I look forward to working with  you over the next day or two to see if we can achieve that objective  together.   Madam Speaker, unless the gentleman wants further time, I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
