 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the outstanding  work of the leadership and volunteers at the Emerald Coast Wildlife  Refuge in my district. The wildlife refuge services thousands of  animals each year from Escambia, Santa Rosa, Walton, and Bay Counties.  They provide services through rescue, rehab, and environmental  outreach.   Our community leaders and volunteers have shown overwhelming support  for this incredible mission that includes educational outreach so that  young people can learn more about our environment and the fantastic  critters that we share the planet with.   I am so proud of the wildlife refuge's accomplishments over the past  decade, and I look forward to the future impact that they will have on  their new home in the Navarre community and throughout the great  northwest Florida.                            ____________________
