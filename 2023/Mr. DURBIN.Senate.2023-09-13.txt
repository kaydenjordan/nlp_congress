 Madam President, it was about 12 years ago when I went  into a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think it was about  the time that Arlen Specter was the chairman of the committee, and he  had a hearing on something that I knew nothing about. It was called  interchange fees.   I walked in there, and the room was packed. It turned out there were  two sides to a debate over this so-called interchange fee. On one side  were the monsters and giants of the credit card industry, Visa and  Mastercard--the duopoly that controls 73, 75 percent of the credit  transactions in the United States--and on the other side were a handful  of people from gas stations and restaurants.   What were they talking about with the interchange fee? They were  talking about the fact that credit cards issued by the banks that honor  the Visa and Mastercard exchanges are required to pay fees on every  transaction.   What was interesting about the conversation was that when it got down  to it, the retailer--the restaurant owner, the gas station--had no  control over what the fee was going to be charged by the bank and Visa  and Mastercard. Take it or leave it. If you want to honor our credit  cards and use them in your business, you will pay the interchange fee.  I kind of thought that was unusual or maybe unfair. There was no  competition. There no was voice. The retailer just had to pass along  the charge, and Visa and Mastercard raised the charges on a regular  basis. They just did recently.   We are fighting inflation in America, and Visa and Mastercard are on  the other side of the battle. Consumers and retailers are trying to  keep prices down; Visa and Mastercard are trying to run them up with  the fee they charge for each transaction.   So I decided to ask for a study--that is pretty easy and innocent--a  study to find out how much the fees were, why these credit card giants  were charging fees in the United States which they weren't charging in  other countries.   They fought me tooth and nail to stop me from this study. So I got my  back up and decided to offer an amendment to the Dodd-Frank bill, which  dealt with Wall Street and the excesses of the 2008 recession. I came  to the floor, offered it, and to everyone's surprise, it passed. It  regulated the amount of interchange fees on debit cards. Debit cards  are just like a checking account. It didn't touch credit cards.   It turned out that that was a big deal because the big banks on Wall  Street that were affected by my amendment were losing up to $8 billion  a year in interchange fees that people were paying. Debit cards were at  least containing the growth of these fees, while credit cards were  still untouched. And so here we are today.   American consumers are concerned about inflation and the high price  of groceries and gas. What they may not know is that the fees charged  by the credit cards that they use, known as swipe fees or interchange  fees, are adding to the problem.   Visa and Mastercard control just about 80 percent of the credit card  market. Each time a credit card is used--whether for groceries,  gasoline, critical drugs, anything else--Visa and Mastercard charge an  interchange fee. Some of that they keep for themselves, but most of it  is given to the bank that issued the card. It is usually charged as a  percentage of the transaction plus a flat fee; for example, 2 percent  of the transaction plus 10 cents each transaction.   Visa and Mastercard set the fees on behalf of thousands of banks and  tell the merchants--the retailers, the restaurants--take it or leave  it. Merchants have no choice but to accept these outrageous fees if  they want to have credit cards used by their customers.   There is no negotiation. There is no competition. Small business  owners and consumers, take it or leave it, are holding the bag.   In 2022 alone, U.S. merchants and consumers paid $93.2 billion in  these fees, credit card interchange fees, to line the pockets of the  biggest banks on Wall Street.   If you ask the man who owns the restaurant or ask the lady who owns  the shop: What percentage of your overhead cost is interchange fees on  credit cards, you will be shocked. Interchange fees are the second  largest cost for small businesses only behind labor costs. Just think  of that for a moment. Making your payroll is the highest expense. The  next expense is not utilities or rent; it is the interchange fees  charged by Visa and Mastercard and their banks.   Despite the nearly $100 billion Visa and Mastercard took out of  communities and small businesses across the country last year, guess  what they are going to do in October? They are going to raise the  interchange fee again. While we are trying to fight inflation at every  angle that we can find to bring down the cost of groceries and gas, the  credit card companies have decided it is just the right time to have  this take-it-or-leave-it fee increased.   When credit cards fees go up, it increases inflation, and consumers  pay it. I strongly urge Visa and Mastercard to reconsider this  misguided decision. I wrote them a letter. I doubt if they will read  it. I am not holding my breath.   That is why I have made it a priority to pass the bipartisan Credit  Card Competition Act this year. The Credit Card Competition Act, which  I introduced with Senator Marshall--there he is on the floor now; good  to see you--Senator Welch from Vermont, who has joined us, and Senator  Vance of Ohio. A bipartisan bill would finally introduce competition  and choice to the credit card market and bring down the excessive  credit card fees. It would require only the largest 30 banks in  America--and they are the big boys, banks with more than $100 billion  in assets--to enable at least 2 credit card networks to be used on  their credit cards, with at least 1 of the networks a company outside  the Visa and Mastercard duopoly so there would be competition. I  thought that was part of a free market. But when it comes to credit  cards, they want no competition.   Merchants would then get to choose one of the networks. There would  be real competition for their business, and it would keep the fees as  low as possible.   The Credit Card Competition Act is estimated to save merchants and  consumers $15 billion a year. With that in mind, nobody should be  surprised to hear that Visa and Mastercard and their big bank buddies  have committed to ``spend whatever is needed'' to stop the Durbin- Marshall amendment.   I stood up to the big banks and giant debit card companies in 2010  when I introduced similar reforms, and I will always choose Main Street  over Wall Street. It is long overdue for Congress to break up the  sweetheart deal that Visa and Mastercard and the biggest banks in  America and certain airlines enjoy. We must bring the bipartisan Credit  Card Competition Act to the floor for a vote.   Madam President, the question is whether my colleagues will listen to  the consumers and families who are struggling with inflation, whether  they will listen to the restaurants that they frequent, as I do,  whether they will listen to the small shops and businesses that have to  pay these outrageous fees.   Give them a chance. Bring competition into the duopoly. Tell Visa and  Mastercard that they cannot lord over these people who are working hard  for a living and shouldn't be stuck with these duopoly fees.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
