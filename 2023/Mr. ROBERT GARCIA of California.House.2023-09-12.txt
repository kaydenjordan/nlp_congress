 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge  House Republicans to investigate one of modern America's biggest  scandals and political cons.   Why did the Saudi Government give Jared Kushner $2 billion just  months after he left the Trump White House?   Kushner, who oversaw Middle East policy for his father-in-law, has  enriched himself and his family in what is clearly an enormous grift  and likely serious conflict of interest crimes.   Let's review: First, Jared Kushner conned his way to a cushy White  House job with no clear job description and no experience. Then he took  it upon himself to prioritize pushing out the U.S. Secretary of State  so he could cozy up to the Saudi Government.   Once he was close enough to the Saudis, we have records of a $110  billion arms deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that was inflated  at the direction of Jared Kushner.   Mere months after Kushner exits the White House, what happens? The  Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia overrules his own advisers and sends $2  billion to Kushner's company bank account.   In the exact words of Republican Chris Christie, who I will quote:  ``The grift from this family is breathtaking. It is breathtaking. Jared  Kushner and Ivanka Kushner walk out of the White House, and months  later get $2 billion from the Saudis.''   Some colleagues from across the aisle have explicitly said the  Kushner family has engaged in business dealings that may have crossed  the ethical line, and I agree, yet they refuse to act.   Is this the same party that is obsessed with President Biden's  family?   The American people deserve answers, and I urge my colleagues across  the aisle to answer our calls and subpoena Jared Kushner's company once  and for all.                            ____________________
