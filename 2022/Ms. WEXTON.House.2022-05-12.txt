 Mr. Speaker, the job of a Federal air marshal is  exhausting and isolating.   Data from the Air Marshal Association show that air marshals are at  high risk for extreme fatigue due to the long hours they spend on  planes and their irregular sleep schedules. Many marshals also report  mental health issues and a reliance on medications and alcohol to fall  asleep.   Tragically, several marshals have died by suicide in the last decade,  including three officers in the last 3 years who were assigned to the  Washington, D.C., field office and served out of National Airport.   We here in Congress know firsthand how important it is to ensure that  law enforcement officers have access to mental and peer support, and I  am very glad H.R. 903 includes provisions that  [[Page H4889]]  allow TSA to work with air marshals to address mental health and  suicide rates.   My amendment simply ensures that work schedules, rest periods,  equipment, and training are also a part of that conversation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my amendment.
