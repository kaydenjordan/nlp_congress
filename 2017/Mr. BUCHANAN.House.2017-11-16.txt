 Mr. Speaker, I also want to acknowledge our incredible  chairman and his leadership over the last 7 years I have been here and  working this plan forward. It is an exciting time for all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  legislation to provide tax relief to middle class families and small- business owners across America.   As a businessman for more than 30 years, I have had the opportunity  to employ thousands of workers. I have seen firsthand how broken our  tax system can be for many hardworking Americans.   Under this bill, not only will the average family of four receive a  tax cut, but small businesses will finally be taxed at a lower rate to  help them expand and grow jobs in America.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, this bill will create 1  million new jobs and grow the economy by 4 percent, a growth rate this  country hasn't experienced since 2000.   It is time to give all Americans a break in terms of their taxes.  With passage of this bill, we will finally have the opportunity to help  middle class families and get our economy back on track.   I urge support for this critical bill to cut taxes and reform our tax  system.
