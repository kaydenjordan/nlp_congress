 Mr. Speaker, in recognition of Mayor John  Ostenburg of Park Forest, Illinois: son, husband, father, grandfather,  mayor, trustee, legislator, leader, collaborator, author, teacher,  speaker, editor, reporter, environmentalist, unionist, merchant,  director, adviser, lecturer, painter, reader, traveler, neighbor,  humanitarian, and ubiquitous friend.   ``We do not exist for ourselves,'' his mentor once said.   When theologian Thomas Merton uttered those simple words, it likely  tickled the eardrums and, certainly, the fancy of our friend, John  Ostenburg.   To be clear, John enjoys his various vocations, but it just so  happens that many endeavors share a common thread: to serve others for  the greater good.   He makes sure everything he does, every role he plays, positively  impacts others. That is who he is.   A perpetual student of mankind and relentless advocate of Chicago's  Southland, John's omnipotence comes complete with the genuine chuckle  of a friend, the wise grin of a mediator, the dignified humility of a  monk.   With career highlights too long to list and colleagues too numerous  to count, I commend and thank John Ostenburg for his longtime service  to residents across the Second Congressional District of Illinois.   On their behalf and on behalf of the Congress of the United States, I  wish Park Forest Mayor John Ostenburg Godspeed as he retires from  elective office, if not from public service.
