 Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Marine Corps  General Kenneth Franklin McKenzie, Jr., commander of U.S. Central  Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL. General McKenzie is one of  our Nation's finest military officers, and he will retire from Active  military service on April 1, 2022, with nearly 43 years of  distinguished service to our great Nation.   General McKenzie, a native of Birmingham, AL, graduated from The  Citadel in 1979 and was commissioned into the Marine Corps as an  infantry officer. During his distinguished career, General McKenzie  commanded at the platoon, company, battalion, Marine Expeditionary  Unit, service component, and combatant command levels. As a lieutenant  colonel, he commanded First Battalion, Sixth Marines. As the commanding  officer of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations  Capable), he led combat deployments to Afghanistan in 2004 and Iraq  from 2005 to 2006. From 2006 to 2007, General McKenzie served as the  Military Secretary to the 33rd and 34th Commandants of the Marine  Corps.   As a general officer, he served on the Joint Staff as a Deputy  Director of Operations within the National Military Command Center. He  was also selected by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be  the Director of the Chairman's New Administration Transition Team,  where he coordinated the efforts of the Joint Staff and the combatant  commands during a wartime transition of administrations. General  McKenzie later assumed command of the U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Central  Command, and most recently took command of U.S. Central Command, a  position he has held since 2019.   General McKenzie is an honors graduate of the Army Armor Officer  Advanced Course, Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and the School  of Advanced Warfighting. In 1999, he was selected as a commandant of  the Marine Corps Fellow and served as a senior military fellow within  the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense  University.   At a time of great uncertainty in the world, particularly in the  Middle East, General McKenzie led U.S. Central Command through multiple  momentous events while deterring Iran, defeating ISIS, and securing the  region. General McKenzie is an exceptional leader, selfless servant,  and American patriot who is committed to our Nation and our interests.  With profound admiration and deep respect, we pay tribute for all he  has done for the defense of our Nation for more than four decades.   Today, I am honored to recognize General McKenzie's long and  decorated career. On behalf of a grateful nation, I commend General  McKenzie for his dedicated service to the United States of America. I  also wish to recognize the sacrifices and contributions made by General  McKenzie's wife, Marilyn, as well as their son, K.R., daughter-in-law,  Kristin, and two grandsons, Noah and James. We are a nation truly  indebted to all of the servicemembers, veterans, and military families  who continue to give so much to defend our American values and  liberties. I extend my best wishes to General McKenzie and his family  on the occasion of his retirement.                            ____________________
