 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the career  achievements of Dr. Jack Law of the Idaho National Laboratory who was  named a fellow of the American Nuclear Society  [[Page S5419]]  and received the 2018 Glenn T. Seaborg Actinide Separations Award.   Fellow is the highest distinction conferred by the American Nuclear  Society and was awarded to Jack for his original research and  innovative leadership in chemical separation technologies, specifically  in the spent nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste treatment.   The Glenn T. Seaborg Award recognizes U.S. scientists and engineers  who have made outstanding and lasting contributions to the development  and application of actinide separations processes and methodology.   Dr. Law has made impactful contributions during his over 30-year  career at the Idaho National Laboratory, where he previously received  the laboratory's Individual Lifetime Achievement in Science and  Technology Award and the Department of Energy's Secretary's Achievement  Award.   I congratulate Jack on these outstanding achievements. The Idaho  National Lab has a truly outstanding scientist and leader in Dr. Jack  Law, and we wish him and the lab continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the people of Idaho are hard workers  who dedicate their time, skills, and energy into making Idaho the great  State that it is. With such dedication sometimes comes the occasional  injury in pursuit of a goal, and, luckily, that is where Bryan Wright,  doctor of physical therapy and founder of Wright Physical Therapy,  comes in.   No matter one's ailment, Wright Physical Therapy's goal is to provide  inspiration and healing rehabilitation to their patients through  expert-led sessions, creative treatment plans, and unparalleled  service. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct privilege to recognize Wright  Physical Therapy as the Small Business of the Month for July 2018.   Before opening Wright Physical Therapy in Twin Falls ID, Bryan  Wrightowned and operated a fitness center in nearby Pocatello with  helpful guidance from the Idaho Small Business Development Center,  better known as the Idaho SBDC. This marked the beginning of a  relationship that would help propel Bryan's business career to new  heights and enable him to pursue his passion of helping people. After  the completion of his doctorate in physical therapy and a move to Twin  Falls, Bryan started the process of opening his own practice. The  SBDC's assistance throughout the process was instrumental in  establishing Wright Physical Therapy. The SBDC provided Bryan with  feasibility studies for new locations, paired him with  universitystudents to conduct research on growth and progression, and  talked to him about franchise opportunities, organic partnerships, and  licensing. The SBDC's assistance paired with Bryan's expertise in his  field were key to Wright Physical Therapy's development as a member of  the Twin Falls community. Bryan's entrepreneurial spirit spearheaded  Wright Physical Therapy's expansion throughout Idaho into Kimberly,  Jerome, Wendell, Burley, Idaho Falls, and Shelley, along with the  addition of a second Twin Falls location.   Bryan has always been passionate about helping people, but his  interest in physical therapy blossomed after his mother seriously  injured her knee. His talent for physical therapy and knowledge of the  musculoskeletal system was so apparent that, when Bryan accompanied his  mother to her doctor's appointments, the physician mistook him for her  physical therapist. Although he often works on the knee, he now  specializes in the neck and spine. Bryan is the first physical  therapist in the Twin Falls area to be become a mechanically certified  back and neck specialist.   Bryan also has a strong commitment to family values, which is  apparent at all of the Wright Physical Therapy locations. Whether it be  celebrating a team member's new baby, balancing daddy-daughter day at  work, or walking together in a local parade, a focus on family life and  values is integral to Wright Physical Therapy's environment. This team- first, family-based mindset creates a welcoming community where  patients feel safe and assured that they are in caring hands. This year  marks the 10-year anniversary of Wright Physical Therapy's commitment  to innovative treatment.   In addition to practicing physical therapy, Wright Physical Therapy  operates three service divisions: WorkWright Industrial Solutions, the  W Fitness, and SciAthlete. These service divisions guarantee a holistic  approach to body care, including prevention and postcare programs. They  strive to make the workplace safer for employees whose jobs require  physical activity and optimize physical potential of local athletes.  The team at Wright Physical Therapy not only helps patients alleviate  their pain, but aim to prevent injuries before they happen.   Wright Physical Therapy's employees positively contribute to society  through volunteer work in Idaho and throughout the world. For example,  the Wright team volunteered at the 2015 Magic Valley Health Fair where  they provided complimentary musculoskeletal screenings to members of  the community. They have a unique social mission that involves donating  resources, time, and expertise to better the lives of children  worldwide.   I am proud to recognize a small business with a purposeful service- based mission. Wright Physical Therapy ensures that Idahoans can get  back to work and do what they love. From sports injuries to  preventative care, they strive to help all who come through their  doors. Once again, I am honored to recognize Wright Physical Therapy as  July's Small Business of the Month, and I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
