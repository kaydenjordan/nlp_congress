 Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives  released a way forward to dismantle and replace ObamaCare, which will  be to deliver on one of our biggest campaign promises made to the  American people, not just in 2016 but in essentially every election  since 2010.   We know ObamaCare has been an unmitigated disaster. Premiums on the  ObamaCare exchanges are up by 25 percent. Millions of Americans have  been kicked off their healthcare plans, and the economy has been  saddled with billions of dollars in new regulations.   The fact is, ObamaCare has been one broken promise after another.  President Obama and advocates of this law said if you wanted to keep  your plan, you could keep it, but that didn't pan out. They said if you  liked your doctor, you didn't have to find another one. That didn't  turn out to be true either. They promised people across the country  would have more coverage, more options, and better healthcare, all at a  more affordable price. Well, that ended up not being true either.   The truth is, ObamaCare hasn't made healthcare more affordable for a  lot of Americans. In fact, in Texas, if you have a gross income of  $24,000, you can end up spending up to 30 percent of your gross income  just on healthcare costs. That is not affordable healthcare. That is  unaffordable healthcare.   Clearly, ObamaCare is no gold standard. It is a failed piece of  legislation, one that is full of empty promises and one we have to  scrap and start over again. Now we have an opportunity to do better for  the people we represent, who are counting on us to deliver, to repeal  ObamaCare and replace it with options that work.   I believe the plan released last night is a major step in the right  direction. Patients need better tools like health savings accounts.  That way they have more control over their healthcare decisions, and we  can keep the bureaucracy out of it. We need to break down the barriers  that restrict choice and keep Americans choosing an insurance plan that  works for them and their families, and we need to empower employers,  particularly small business owners, to provide their employees with the  kind of affordable coverage that meets their needs.   To sum it up, we need to move healthcare decisions out of Washington  and send them back to the States and back to patients and families and  their doctors. That will only happen once we  [[Page S1615]]  repeal ObamaCare and replace it with options that work for more  affordable healthcare coverage that patients choose, not that the  government mandates and punishes you if you don't buy it but freedom of  choice at a better cost and meeting the needs of individual patients.   I am glad our colleagues in the House and our friends in the White  House fully understand why this is such a priority and why we need to  keep the promise we made. As soon as we can do that and deliver on that  major promise to the American people--the sooner we do that, a whole  lot of American families across the country will feel relief.                                 Nominations    Mr. President, this morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee  considered the nominations of Rod Rosenstein and Rachel Brand as Deputy  Attorney General and Associate Attorney General, respectively. Both of  them are longtime, well-respected public servants. Mr. Rosenstein has  spent his career serving the Justice Department and Presidents of both  political parties. In fact, Mr. Rosenstein started in the George H.W.  Bush Justice Department back in 1990, and he served every President  since that time. He is a career public servant who has served in a  bipartisan manner and has also been confirmed by the Senate. President  Bush appointed him to be U.S. attorney and so did President Obama.   When the Obama administration needed a prosecutor of the utmost  integrity to investigate national security leaks that looked highly  political, they turned--you guessed it--to Rod Rosenstein. Put another  way, if Rod Rosenstein is not an acceptable nominee, who is?   This morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I heard some of our  colleagues suggest that Mr. Rosenstein needed to make a pledge to  appoint a special counsel if he was confirmed as Deputy Attorney  General. We had two of our Maryland colleagues extoll his credentials,  and rightly so, and call him a person of the utmost integrity and  professionalism. Yet they, in essence, wanted him to fire himself once  he became Deputy Attorney General and appoint a special counsel to do  the job he would be confirmed and nominated to do. He wisely declined  to make that judgment, certainly before he has had access to the facts  and the information needed.   I believe he will make a formidable Deputy Attorney General, but  instead of actually vetting the candidates on the merits of their  impressive backgrounds and strong credentials, some used the hearing as  an opportunity to air their various grievances on the current Attorney  General, our former colleague Jeff Sessions. Over the weekend, some  went so far as to threaten to block Mr. Rosenstein's nomination if he  wouldn't agree to appoint a special counsel.   I hope my colleagues in this Chamber don't stonewall his nomination  or use it as a platform to disparage Attorney General Sessions. The  Attorney General made a decision to recuse himself from a further  official role in looking into the allegations of Russian involvement in  our election in 2016. I respect his decision. The fact is, we don't  need another commission to study Russian involvement in the last  election because we have a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee,  chaired by Senator Richard Burr and the Vice Chair is Mark Warner--a  bipartisan Senate Select Committee that is doing a deep dive into the  allegations, including gaining access to classified information which  would be important to consider in reaching a conclusion.   Yesterday I was out at CIA Headquarters and saw four large binders'  worth of classified material, which obviously I am not going to  discuss, but it demonstrates that this investigation is already well  underway. Members of the committee and our staff are already working  with the intelligence community to get the information we need in order  to reach an impartial and bipartisan conclusion.   The fact is, our Democratic friends have a short memory when it comes  to the Obama Justice Department, one of the most politicalized Justice  Departments in American history. Loretta Lynch, who privately met with  President Bill Clinton while her Department was investigating his  wife's email scandal, never recused herself from the matter.   Then there was Attorney General Holder. To my knowledge, he was the  first Attorney General ever held in contempt of Congress because he  refused to cooperate with our legitimate oversight responsibilities  when it came to Operation Fast and Furious. Well, he never recused  himself and never appointed a special counsel, even though I believe he  should have. Compare Attorney General Sessions, who did what he  believed was the right thing to do. He recused himself when there was  even a suggestion he might not be able to be impartial. He made that  commitment from the beginning, well before he was confirmed. He stood  by that promise last week. Attorney General Sessions' integrity is  intact, and he did the right thing, but Loretta Lynch didn't. Eric  Holder didn't.   For our colleagues now to suggest that Attorney General Sessions not  only should recuse himself but he should resign is beyond outrageous.  To suggest that the incoming Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein,  should somehow abdicate the role he has been nominated for, and to  which he will be confirmed, is to ask him to prejudge the case before  he has even had a chance to look at the evidence.   All I am asking for is our colleagues to have a little perspective.  These nominees are the right caliber of people with the exact expertise  we need to make sure our Justice Department runs effectively and  impartially follows the law of the land. These are the types of leaders  you want to handle the big issues facing the Department of Justice.   I hope soon our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will turn  their attention to doing what the American people sent them to do; that  is, to consider legislation rather than dragging their feet and  blocking the Trump administration from getting the team he has chosen  to work with in various Cabinet positions and sub-Cabinet positions.   Hopefully, soon they will decide not to obstruct progress and grind  this Chamber's business to a halt but rather will be partners with us,  working together to try to build consensus where we can and move the  country forward.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from North Dakota.
