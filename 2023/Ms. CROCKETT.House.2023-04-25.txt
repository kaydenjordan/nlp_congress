 Mr. Speaker, I rise today appalled by the Speaker's  debt ceiling bill. Right now, the Speaker stands alone, threatening to  not pay bills we owe to advance his personal policy preferences.   If we don't pay our bills, there will be catastrophic consequences  for everyone. The interest rate would skyrocket, making it nearly  impossible to afford a home or car and closing opportunities for upward  mobility for millions of Americans.   The stock market will crater as investors lose faith in the ability  of our government to perform even the most basic function because of  the Speaker's bill. The result would be millions of Americans'  retirement accounts wiped out.   For years, the threat of such economic catastrophe historically made  even the threat of default off-limits, but the Speaker knows that what  he has is an extreme minority in his caucus and that what he wants is  deeply unpopular, so he is trying to hold our government hostage.   He stands alone because he knows that no Democrat will support this  ransom, so he needs each and every Republican to fall in line behind  him.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that their  constituents are watching, watching to see who their Representative  came to Congress to fight for, your Speaker or your seniors.   The Speaker's bill will add additional work reporting requirements  for seniors in their fifties in order to receive basic food assistance.  Across the country, there are no less than 3 million  [[Page H1918]]  seniors who could lose food assistance because of this bill.   My colleagues must make a choice: your Speaker or your seniors.   Because everything in D.C. is filled with jargon, I want to pause for  a moment to make sure we all understand who the Speaker's bill is  targeting.   The people the Speaker is targeting are seniors in their fifties who  don't even have $6 a day for food. That is all SNAP pays, $6 a day for  food, but the Speaker's bill would deny even that paltry aid to  hundreds of thousands of our constituents.   Soon, those on the other side of the aisle must decide who matters  more to them, your Speaker or your seniors.   Make no mistake: This isn't about getting people to work. If you  worked twice what was required, a full 40-hour week at minimum wage,  which, frankly, is most of what is on the table for these seniors, you  would still be on SNAP.   The only way the Speaker's bill saves money, which he does say, is if  people have their benefits stripped away, if seniors go hungry.   Each of my colleagues must ask who matters more, your Speaker or your  seniors?   The Speaker's bill will kick seniors off SNAP rolls. Many seniors  can't find a job at all because they face age discrimination. There is  a reason that current law exempts those over 49. To expect them to have  the same odds of finding a job as a young recipient is callous and  cruel.   Ask yourselves, who did you come to Congress to serve, your Speaker  or your seniors?   Even though the bill is only supposed to apply to able-bodied adults  without dependents, that claim is laughable.   Many of our constituents in their fifties are grandparents. They have  childcare responsibilities even if the child isn't their dependent.  Requiring them to neglect their grandchild or else go hungry is cruel  and heartless.   I hope my colleagues ask themselves who they came to Congress to  serve, your Speaker or your seniors, because so many seniors will go  hungry if the Speaker's bill becomes law.   As the pandemic SNAP policies are ending, State agencies are  responsible for updating participants' information so those eligible  for assistance don't go hungry, but in many States, no outreach or only  perfunctory outreach was performed.   My concern is that if the Speaker's bill becomes law, tens of  thousands of seniors who think they aren't subject to these reporting  requirements will suddenly find themselves without benefits. If for any  reason these seniors are denied benefits under the Speaker's bill, they  will be ineligible for food assistance for the next 3 years.   When we vote on this bill, we will be voting on a very simple  question: support your Speaker or support your seniors.   The burden lies with each of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. It is within your range, your power, to protect our seniors.   Right now, the Speaker stands alone with a deeply unpopular proposal.  Each of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is asked to starve  our seniors. If that is the policy of this House, that responsibility  will be entirely on your shoulders.   The choice is now yours. Quite simply, each Republican must answer  the question: Who do you fight for, your Speaker or your seniors?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Reverend Dr.  Frederick D. Haynes III, who is celebrating 40 years of being pastor at  Friendship-West Baptist Church.   As a dynamic and influential teacher of God's word, he has remained a  beacon of hope for many in Dallas and across our country.   Joining Friendship-West as pastor in 1983, the church's membership  has grown tremendously, starting with just under 100 members and now  serving over 12,000.   As a servant leader, he has embedded himself in our communities. He  has remained at the forefront of empowering underserved people while  taking the lead in advocating for issues such as voting rights, fair  lending practices, just food policies, and criminal justice reform.  That is just the tip of the iceberg.   Through the years, Pastor Haynes has remained faithful to the  assignment God has called him to.   As a member of Friendship-West, his friend, and his Congresswoman, I  couldn't be any prouder of the work he is doing as he continues to  challenge the status quo and redefine what it means to be a pastor.   I congratulate Pastor Haynes on 40 years as pastor and your lifetime  of service to our community.                            ____________________
