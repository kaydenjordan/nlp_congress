 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Trudy Perkins, my  communications director and the former acting chief of staff of my  office, as she moves on to a new, well-deserved chapter--retirement.   Trudy's career has been unparalleled to say the least. She has spent  20 years working in Congress. Her service has made a difference for her  colleagues and for so many Americans.   She grew up in Albany. If you take Route 90 just about 150 miles  west--well, about 200 miles west, you will hit Cleveland. If you drive  about 110 miles west, you will hit my wife's hometown of Ashtabula, OH.  It is fitting that her final role in the Senate brought her back to a  city on I-90.   Trudy is a proud member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and is an  alumna of the State University of New York at Oswego. She spent the  early years of her career working in television news, first in Albany-- I know, in the Presiding Officer's State, you say ``All-ba-nee,'' but  up north, we say ``All-buh-nee''--and then in Baltimore.   In 2002, she started on Capitol Hill with one of the real superstars  in the House, now the late Representative Elijah Cummings, where she  worked her way up to communications director and deputy chief of staff  during her almost 20 years with that office. She served as an  invaluable adviser to Representative Cummings. He trusted her with  anything and everything. He often gave her phone number out to  constituents and told them ``Why don't you call Trudy'' because things  always got done. You know how Members of Congress don't always get them  done, but people like Trudy Perkins do. He knew, no matter what the  task was, that Trudy wouldn't just deliver, but she would do it kindly;  she would do it with a smile; and she would do it with a positive  attitude. It was easy for anyone to see her dedication to public  service and always, always, always to the constituents she served. She  was dependable. She was hard-working. She was an integral member of  their team and of the Cummings' office family.   Trudy has been an integral and trusted leader in my office. We were  so lucky to have inherited her, in a sense, after the death of  Representative Cummings. In January 2020, she joined my staff as the  communications director. At the time, she was the only Black  communications director serving in a Senate personal office. She had a  talent for communications and press and the experience to prove it.  That was clear to me before we ever spoke.   As I got to know her, I learned how much she cared about the issues  that I care about and that Senator Wyden does and Senator Warnock, the  Presiding Officer, does. I learned how much she cared about those  issues that matter most: civil rights, labor rights. She understood  this from the writings about Dr. King's speeches, when Dr. King spent a  lot of time talking to labor unions. Dr. King, in his last weeks of  life, went to Memphis because of a labor strike of sanitation workers,  and she understood, as I do and as John Lewis did, how Dr. King wove  workers' rights and civil rights and women's rights and human rights  all together. Trudy gets that.   From day one, she proved to be such an asset in our office by  stepping in and leading a robust communications team during some of the  most tumultuous years in the Senate that I have ever seen. In her first  month, we faced domestic and foreign crises that she navigated with a  steady hand. During her second month, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.  It was an uncertain time. We all know that, and all of us in the  country know that. We had never seen anything like it. Trudy stepped up  and delivered for Ohioans and for her team in our office.   She transitioned our press shop from an in-person operation to a  virtual one. It was a transition nobody had ever tried before that  brought challenges and technical difficulties but also new  opportunities to connect with Ohioans and with the Ohio media. At every  turn, Trudy Perkins led with grace. She made sure that Ohioans got the  information they needed to navigate the pandemic. She made a difference  for so many in our office and in our State.   Her impact can't be measured just by her ability to meet challenge  after challenge as her leadership also extended far beyond the  technical aspects of a difficult job. She was a compassionate resource  for everyone on her staff.    She took time to get to know the team and understand how they  operated as a unit and who they are as individuals. She listened. She  truly cared. And for the communications team, Trudy Perkins was a rock.  She was a smiling face on Zoom calls. She organized virtual game nights  and made a  [[Page S381]]  difficult time a little easier as our office and world settled into a  ``new normal.''   A couple of years later, when our chief of staff took a temporary  leave from the office, it wasn't even a close call. We knew Trudy was  the right choice to lead the entire office in the interim. It was a big  job to take on. She stepped up. The transition was seamless. She led  the office through a historic year that brought so many wins for  Ohioans: the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. She  led our shift back to an in-person work.   To say the least, it has been an eventful 3 years. Through it all,  Trudy has been a dedicated member of this office. She has been a  leader. This office wouldn't be the place it is today without her.   As a communications director, she always had her team's back. She  went to bat for them. She supported them in and out of the office,  attending events on her personal time, like choir concerts, to cheer  them on.   As a manager, she gave junior staff the room they needed to grow. She  listened. She recognized potential. She invested in every member of our  team. She made sure everyone was set up for success so they would move  forward even after she would leave.   She is a trusted adviser, a talented brainstormer. She is an advocate  for women, especially for women of color, across the Senate. She makes  colleagues feel appreciated and seen.   Most of all, Trudy believes in this office and this institution and  the good that each of us can do for Ohioans and Americans.   Every member of our staff--from the interns to the senior staff--have  learned from Trudy Perkins, whether it is her communications expertise  or how to stay calm in stressful situations or even just to show  kindness and smile after a long day.   We have certainly picked up a few of her sayings along the way, like  ``no ma'am pam'' and ``hot diggity dog.'' She doesn't always talk that  way, but sometimes.   We will miss her sense of humor. We will miss her laugh, which you  can hear from any corner of the office. And if the microphones were  loud enough, you could have just heard it then from this corner. I know  every member of Team Brown will miss having her as part of this team.   At the beginning of this Congress, I asked each member of my staff to  share a meaningful memory from the 117th Congress--and this is where  the Presiding Officer comes in. Trudy reminded me of the Letter from a  Birmingham Jail reading that she organized after former Senator Jones  asked me to continue the tradition. We chose three Republicans and  three Democrats to read Dr. King's immortal words. Trudy asked that  Senator Warnock read the final section, as Raphael is the first Black  Senator from Georgia and serves as the senior pastor of Ebenezer  Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Dr. King attended and Dr. King's  father was the pastor.   It was a moment of immense symbolism and joy as he read his  predecessor's words on the Senate floor. That letter also includes  perhaps my favorite Dr. King quote:         Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of       inevitability.    I will say that again:         Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of       inevitability.    Progress rolls in because we make it so. It rolls in because we  organize, we push, we work every angle for as long as it takes.  Progress rolls in because of people like Trudy Perkins who dedicate  their lives to fighting to make a difference in this world. Our country  is a better place because of her service and because of her leadership.   Trudy will be spending more time with her mother in Maryland. Her  dedication to her family has always been unwavering.   Trudy, you will be missed more than you know. We will continue to  fight for the values that you hold dear and make a difference in the  lives of all Ohioans.   On behalf of everyone in our office, the staff on the Banking and  Housing Committee, some of my colleagues who know Trudy, and all those  who have had the honor of working with her, we congratulate Trudy  Perkins on her career. We wish her well in retirement. We thank her  from the bottom of our hearts for her terrific service to our Nation.
