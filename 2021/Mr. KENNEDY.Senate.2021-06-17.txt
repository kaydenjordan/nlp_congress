Dr. Thomas has an exemplary career of service as a certified family  and pediatric nurse practitioner and has been providing health care for  over 25 years to medically underserved populations in the greater New  Orleans, LA, region. Dr. Thomas practices at a federally qualified  health center in New Orleans and is a clinical preceptor. As a primary  care provider, Dr. Thomas provides her patients with access to cost- effective, patient-centered healthcare. Dr. Thomas has continued to  work on the frontlines throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including  educating the public, diagnosing and treating patients, and going door  to door to vaccinate residents in New Orleans.   She holds a doctoral degree in nursing practice from Loyola  University New Orleans, where she was honored with the Post-Master's  DNP Nightingale Award, and she has a master's in nursing from Louisiana  Sate University Health Sciences Center. She was inducted as fellow of  the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners in 2012. In 2020, Dr.  Thomas was chosen as one of Modern Healthcare's 100 Most Influential  People in Healthcare.   The American Association of Nurse Practitioners is the largest  national professional membership organization for nurse practitioners.  Under Dr. Thomas's tenure, AANP membership has grown to more than  118,000 members. Dr. Thomas has helped lead nurse practitioners in  transforming patient-centered healthcare and has made tremendous  strides in ensuring that policymakers and the public understand the  care that nurse practitioners provide to millions of Americans each  year.   I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Sophia L.  Thomas on a successful term as president of the American Association of  Nurse Practitioners and in thanking her for the excellent health care  she has and continues to provide to her patients as well as her  leadership to the nurse practitioner profession.                            ____________________
