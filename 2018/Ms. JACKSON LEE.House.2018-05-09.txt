 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5645, the  Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act-- otherwise known as the SMARTER Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or  implementing ``smarter'' legislation.   Rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC).   H.R. 5645 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally  undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to  prevent anti-competitive mergers.   As we all know, the FTC was created by Congress with the specific  intent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and  supplemental authority to the Department of Justice (DOJ).   Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of its  power by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws  in larger merger cases, and by blocking its ability to use its  administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction.   The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same  enforcement process as the DOJ.   This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative  litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and  effectively removes the very core and functioning character of this  agency.   Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with  Congress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and  policymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political  and executive interference.   As enforcers of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and the  DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and  acquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend  to create a monopoly''.   Under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement  each other, and have developed over the years to specialize in  particular industries and markets.   Based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the  FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending. For example,  healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and  certain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet  services.   Whereas, the DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger  corporate industries like telecommunications, banks, railroads, and  airlines.   Thus, while the FTC and the DOJ have operated with a shared  responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal  agencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain  conduct.   Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the FTC and  DOJ rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and  harmonized standards and practices.   The SMARTER Act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any  meaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns  governing these longstanding agency operations.   In particular, in 2002 Congress sought to review and amend antitrust  laws and policies in light of the changing economy and rise in  technological advances.   In 2007 a report issued by the Antitrust Modernization Commission  (AMC) set forth specific recommendations for the FTC to eliminate real  or perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions.   According to the AMC, Congress should seek to ensure that the same or  comparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction  against a potentially anticompetitive transaction.   However, the SMARTER Act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to  chip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication  authority of the FTC.   In order to identify potential violations of the Clayton Act, the FTC  and the DOJ review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the Hart- Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the HSR Act), which provides  advance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and  acquisition transactions.   The heart of this concern is the alternate means by which the FTC and  DOJ carry out their enforcement roles during this HSR pre-merger  process.   Namely, H.R. 5645 is curiously motivated by the preliminary  injunction process utilized by the FTC and the DOJ to halt proposed  transactions that would violate the Clayton Act if completed.   Additionally, the DOJ typically consolidates the preliminary and  permanent injunction proceedings, while the FTC typically only pursues  preliminary injunctions.   While some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the FTC  would be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the DOJ,  this assertion has not been fully substantiated by the AMC.   The pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized  by the FTC and DOJ are the very procedural steps that characterize and  distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies.   This supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of  proposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition  proposals are found to not be in violation of the Clayton Act upon  undergoing the review process.    The FTC and DOJ review over a thousand merger filings every year.   Yet 95 percent of those merger filings present no competitive issues  or challenged transactions.   As reported by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI), the overall  concerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without  foundation.   In contrast, the overall work of the FTC has an incredible impact on  American consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely  impacted if disrupted.   As highlighted by the FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in her testimony  before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform,  Commercial and Antitrust Law, the FTC prioritizes the protection of  consumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices.   In fact, the FTC exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent  enormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and  small businesses.   For example:   In the past year, the FTC has challenged over 28 mergers, (although  in most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to  proceed).   At the consumer level in my home state of Texas, the FTC secured an  $82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the  Fair Credit Reporting Act in September 2017.   Also last year, the FTC ordered the largest divestiture ever in a  supermarket merger, requiring Albertsons and Safeway to sell 168  supermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring  that communities continue to benefit from competition among their local  supermarkets.   The FTC has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping  anticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting  such practices through administrative litigation.   In September 2017, the FTC secured a $1.1 million settlement to  consumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam.   And in the last two years, the FTC took action in 13 pharmaceutical  mergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that  treat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used  generic medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics.   Last year, on March 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted  investigation, the FTC approved a final order preserving competition  among outpatient dialysis clinics in Laredo, Texas.   That is, the FTC cleared U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s (the country's third  largest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis  competitor DSI Renal, on the condition that three of DSI's outpatient  clinics in Laredo, Texas be handed over to a third party.   Absent this agreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a  significant increase in market concentration and anti-competitive  effects.   The likely result, according to the FTC, would have included the  elimination of direct competition between U.S. Renal Care and DSI  Renal, reduced incentives to improve services  [[Page H3855]]  or quality for dialysis patients, and increased ability for the merged  company to unilaterally increase prices.   Notably, the DOJ has also been successful in securing investigations  and halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale  (in the health care and airline industry as of late).   In June 2016, the DOJ put pressure on several multibillion dollar  health insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with  near certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare  industry.   In August 2016, the DOJ issued civil investigative demands on several  major US airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers.   These cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the FTC  and its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger  and acquisition activities, as well as, anticompetitive business  conduct that harms consumers and restrains market activity.   The ability of the FTC to function independently is necessary to the  success of both the FTC and DOJ.   The far-reaching and elusive SMARTER Act fails to keep the  foundational integrity of these agencies and should be opposed.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this serious threat to our  fundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank the ranking member of  the committee, Mr. Nadler, and the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Goodlatte, who is now managing the bill; and I certainly acknowledge my  fellow Texan and know that he has all good intentions on important  legislation dealing with the question of safety and security.   H.R. 2152, unfortunately, has been noted possibly to have  requirements that would undermine the privacy of those who participate  in the program, who are disproportionately poor Americans, and  discourages the use of pretrial service programs in communities across  the country because of the punitive measures in this bill. I rise to  oppose H.R. 2152 because it is flawed and needs to address the  disparate treatment of poor Americans.   I believe the consideration of the issues underlying the bill is  timely but, unfortunately, not directed in the right way. The House  should examine pretrial services and bail issues with the goal of  reforming our Nation's bail system, not for the purpose of protecting  the use of money bail which is unfair to the indigent, unproductive,  and expensive for American taxpayers.   In fact, in Harris County, we have a money bail system, and a Federal  judge, Judge Lee Rosenthal, indicated that it was disproportionately  unfair to poor constituents in the State of Texas and, particularly,  Harris County. We have been working to come together and have an  agreement in our local community on recognizance bonds for individuals  who work, and put a certain criteria in.   Mr. Speaker, I can assure you, we are as concerned about the safety  and security of our constituents, but it would be inappropriate for us  to enhance the commercial bond industry, which I certainly appreciate-- they create jobs and they are businesses--in contrast to individuals  who simply cannot afford a money bond.   In this instance, this bill would penalize those entities, those  communities that use Federal funds for pretrial release programs if  they don't provide all of this data. Now, it might be important to  provide this data for someone who is particularly dangerous, but, Mr.  Speaker, you know just like I do, those individuals do not get a bond.   So, as I indicated, the Citizens' Right to Know Act would require a  State or local government that uses Justice Department grant funding to  pay for pretrial services, which are important programs, to report,  annually, certain information to the Department of Justice about  defendants who participate in the pretrial services program.    The very fact that you are in the program is an indication, in most  jurisdictions, that you are not a violent felon. You would hope that  you are not a person accused of sex crimes, sex trafficking, human  trafficking. Those are matters that can be fixed.   Information that will be required to be reported includes the name of  each defendant participating in the pretrial release program and each  occasion that the person failed to make an appearance, the record of  prior convictions of each participant, and the amount of money  allocated for the pretrial services program.   If a unit of government fails to comply with the reporting  requirement, it would lose its entire funding under the relevant  program for the following fiscal year, penalizing smaller communities,  innocent communities that didn't have the wherewithal to provide all  that data. Certainly, it would be better spent on making sure that they  use the pretrial program efficiently and safely and secure.  [[Page H3859]]    The requirements in this bill largely mirror legislative initiatives  being advanced by ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, in  the States, under the false guise of transparency.   Citizens have a right to know what their government is doing. I  absolutely agree with that, and I support the reporting of information  that will educate us as to what is taking place. As for H.R. 2152,  however, I question whether the categories and information that must be  reported under the bill are designed to do that or are adequate to tell  us about the efficacy of these programs. In addition, the bill requires  that this information be made publicly available by the Attorney  General.   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the ACLU, NAACP,  Human Rights Watch, and Color of Change have written to us opposing the  bill and expressing concerns about this publication requirement and the  harm to individuals resulting from a sharing of criminal records and  personally identifying information. I share these concerns. The groups  that I have named have been historic organizations that have dealt with  the civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, and constitutional rights  of Americans, no matter who they are.   Although the Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment to eliminate  the reporting of arrest records of the participating defendants, I see  no need to compile and make public information about prior convictions  and the failures to appear in connection with identifier-specific  defendants--maybe overall numbers, but this would be unnecessary and  unproductive.   The main crux of what we should be about is that a pretrial program  is a secure and safe program. The levels of a person who can  participate should be utilized with guidelines, restrictions, and,  certainly, local monitoring. But to penalize an organization, entity, a  governmental entity trying to do its best and to be fair and balanced  in the criminal justice system based on money bail is something that I  would raise the question.   You can document, in Harris County, that we have had an enormously  disproportionate impact on individuals with small offenses who have had  to go no other route but either jail or money bail. They have no money  bail. They are in jail. They could have a legitimate job. They could be  a teacher.   We just had an incident with a mother who was placed in--she was,  unfortunately, at least the allegations are, that she was driving,  unfortunately, in a school zone and had a minute amount of marijuana.  Whatever our positions are on that, she was sent to the Harris County  jail, of course, lost her job. She was gainfully employed and is,  obviously, distraught.   I hate to say it; her allegations are that she was raped in the  Harris County jail, sad to say that. But the point is, just think if  she could have been released on her own recognizance and/or a small  amount in a pretrial release program. Not given that opportunity, she  was taken in and, unfortunately, suffered these unfortunate  consequences.   Members submitted amendments to the Rules Committee to address some  of these concerns and also to encourage States to eliminate monetary  bail, but none were made in order for consideration on the floor today.  That is unusual, a closed rule on a Judiciary Committee bill that is  the arm of decency as relates to decency, dignity, liberty, justice,  and freedom.   Those are very important elements to the American people, and,  certainly, the amendments should have been at least given consideration  for the Representatives of the people of the United States in the  people's House to debate these amendments. That was not the case, so we  have a closed rule. I am baffled by that.   Instead of considering this bill, the House should be taking up  legislation to encourage States to end the practice of requiring money  bail, a practice that disparately impacts the poor and most vulnerable  in our society.   For instance, I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1437, the No Money Bail Act of  2017, which would reduce Justice Department grant awards to States that  do not eliminate money bail and would also eliminate bail at the  Federal level. Instead of considering H.R. 2152, we should be advancing  legislation such as H.R. 1437, or, minimally, both bills should on be  on floor at the same time.   Again, this is no attempt to undermine how we secure our communities.  I certainly take no backseat to the fact that our families,  communities, police officers, and people in the criminal justice system  should be protected, and those who have been given the benefit of a  pretrial release should adhere to the rules that are there; but I can  see no reason to be punitive to the local governmental entities as  relates to not reporting names and all those details, including prior  convictions, et cetera, et cetera.   What is the Federal Government going to do, say, if you have two  prior convictions, you can't be in the pretrial release program? That  is a local, State issue as opposed to a Federal issue, and what you are  doing is connecting desperately needed criminal justice dollars from  the Department of Justice to communities that may be trying to do their  best.    With the version of H.R. 2152 that was reported out of the Judiciary  Committee, we are not doing that, unfortunately. Therefore, I oppose  the bill and hope that the House will soon take steps to do something  about the real problem: our Nation's unjust money bail system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. He is  a dear friend. As we debate this question, I think it is a very  important moment as we look at comprehensive criminal justice reform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson), the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Courts,  Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me indicate and reemphasize points that I made and, as well,  points that Mr. Johnson made.   This will have a disparate impact, and what strikes me of great  concern is that this amendment was, in essence, a closed rule.   I submitted an amendment that would basically gather data--which, I  think, is what the proponent of this legislation wants--to ensure that  pretrial release is working, to show that people who would be a threat  to the community are not running without restraint, and to show the  number of people who would appear for their appearance, if you will, in  court who were beneficiaries of the pretrial release program. Those are  all good elements, but it concerns me, again, that we don't have any  clear parameters of whom this will hurt.   And also, small communities are dependent upon Federal grants. Their  structure may not be the best, and so, if you are now asking them for  reporting of individual names and past offenses, I beg the question of  the value of that information.   What we really should have is aggregate numbers of who, under the  pretrial program, is able to or is, in essence, not meeting the  criteria and is breaking the agreement and commitment they have to  either appear or to stay in a certain area. That is important  information, and I think the DOJ could utilize that in an aggregate  form.   Why are we giving names that will remain in the DOJ database for  someone who may ultimately go back to work, as this mother may go back  to her family and her life would hopefully--even though she experienced  a tragedy in the jail and lost her job, let's hope that she has a  future.   But if she were caught in this bill, would her name now be in the  database? I have not researched her case. It seems that this might have  been her first offense, but it certainly was a minor offense with a  small amount of marijuana. As the facts evidence, it was the  jurisdictional, the geographic area that she was in that caused the  greatest trouble.   So the other side of it is that money bail is another issue that we  should have looked at. We should have put both bills on the floor of  the House because there is a movement across the Nation to begin to  address, again, disparate treatment of money bail--not on the issue of  race, but on the issue of economics.   So the person working in the fast-food place is in jail and, most  likely, loses their job. We know that people who work in fast-food are  mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and grandfathers taking care of  families, and being in jail does not help them take care of their  family. You can be assured--unlike maybe other positions where you can  say I was on vacation or that you didn't even stay in jail because you  had the money to get out of jail--you cannot say you are on vacation  for a couple of days or that you were nothing because you are right out  back at work. You are fired.   A very evident case is the gentleman who was wealthy in Texas--a very  renowned case--found in a hotel room in Galveston. He had decapitated  his roommate's head and disposed of it--is my recollection. I stand to  be corrected if my recollection is not correct--in the Galveston Bay,  and because he could post a $100,000-plus bond, Mr. Speaker, he was  released. Put that on any poor person, and we would be aghast at even  how this person got bond set. But he did. Ultimately, he was acquitted  in that case. I still shake in my boots.   So the issue is there is more to this than giving names and putting  it in a database in the DOJ for persons who may never commit another  offense in life. Money bail contributes, again, to the unnecessary  detention of many low-risk pretrial defendants, inappropriate release  of high-risk defendants who have financial means--as I just indicated,  a person who decapitated a person's head--unwarranted financial burdens  on low-income communities, and the gamble of placing public safety  in the hands of a bail bonding industry that will always profit before  the public good, a real point to the unfairness of the money bail.    Yet you would deny funds to small towns that are doing pretrial  release, or even big counties and cities that are trying to do their  best, but they need these Federal funds. Find another way for us to be  able to assess what is going on.   Wealth-based detention has disastrous consequences: overcrowding of  local jails, lost jobs, lost housing, poor sanitation and medical care,  broken families, and it drains local budgets.   In many cases, an arrestee may be held longer in jail while awaiting  trial than any sentence she or he would likely receive if convicted.  Right now, in my own county and other big counties around the Nation  that have not corrected that, they are doing that right now: causing  innocent people to plead guilty to offenses that they did not commit in  order to shorten the lengthy pretrial detention. Individuals who are  detained are not able to assist their attorneys in the investigation of  charges against them, resulting in many wrongful convictions and longer  sentences.   So I only offer this thought so that we can have a viable discussion  on the money bail issue and the disparate treatment that this  legislation--though, not intended--would bring about when you ask  communities to give the names and prior convictions of persons who may  have had one or two marijuana or DUI--which all of us abhor-- convictions. But the privacy issues are a concern, and the lack of  debate on the impact of money bail and its unfairness are not being  discussed, and the lack of a rule that allows amendments, I think,  concerns me.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties  Union, NAACP, Human Rights Watch, and Color of Change, who expressed  their opposition to this legislation.                                                        May 8, 2018.   Vote ``No'' on the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act of 2017'' (H.R. 2152)         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union       (ACLU), the NAACP, Human Rights Watch, and Color of Change,       we urge you to vote ``No'' on H.R. 2152, the ``Citizens'       Right to Know Act of 2017,'' as the House considers this       bill. This legislation raises serious privacy concerns for       the civil and human rights community given the personally       identifiable data that is to be collected and publicly       reported by the federal government. The bill also undermines       efforts to eliminate or reduce jurisdictions' reliance on       money bail systems. We urge the members to instead consider       H.R. 1437, the ``No Money Bail Act of 2017,'' and other       bipartisan efforts to encourage the elimination of money bail       systems.           The Citizens' Right to Know Act Raises Privacy Concerns         The Citizens' Right to Know Act requires jurisdictions       receiving funds from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to       report to the Attorney General the names, arrest records, and       appearance failures for those participating in DOJ funded       pretrial services programs. The legislation allows the       Attorney General to make public the names, arrest records,       and failure appearances that jurisdictions report. Except for       a clause that subjects the data ``to any applicable       confidentiality requirements,'' the bill does not provide any       explicit privacy protections for those whose personally       identifiable information has been collected by the federal       government and is subject to public release. The bill       requires that the Attorney General penalize noncompliant       jurisdictions by denying them 100 percent of the DOJ grant       program funds that are used to support pretrial services       programs.        While we appreciate the need for the federal government to       collect and report data, personal privacy interests must be       balanced with public interests. When personally identifiable       information is being collected and publicly reported, we       believe that such information should be obtained and       disseminated only with individuals' informed consent. We also       believe that the potential to harm individual reputations       should be considered when arrest records are publicly shared.       We are troubled that the Citizens' Right to Know Act would       collect and publicly report personally identifiable       information of individuals participating in pretrial services       programs--individuals who have not been convicted of a crime       given their pretrial status.  [[Page H3863]]             The Citizens' Right to Know Act Undermines Bail Reform Efforts         The Citizens' Right to Know Act is inconsistent with       efforts to reform money bail systems, like the No Money Bail       Act, which many of our organizations support. By collecting       and reporting only certain data about pretrial services       programs and those participating in them, the Citizens' Right       to Know Act will depict a one-sided picture of pretrial       services programs and participants. For example, the       legislation's focus on when an individual has failed to       appear promises a negative narrative around the pretrial       stage. If this bill were serious about measuring the true       impact of pretrial services programs, it would collect a more       robust data set and not that which is of interest only to the       bail bonds industry.        We support bail reform that corrects the injustice of       basing a defendant's release on how much money the person       has. Instead of considering the Citizens' Right to Know Act,       Congress should take up the No Money Bail Act of 2017. This       legislation would incentive jurisdictions to reform their       money bail systems using federal resources. The No Money Bail       Act would build safer communities, stronger families, and a       fairer criminal justice system by ensuring that people who       are innocent in the eyes of the law are not deprived of their       freedom because they cannot afford money bail.        For the above described reasons, we urge members of the       House to vote ``No'' on the Citizens' Right to Know Act.       Instead, we encourage the House of Representatives to give       serious consideration to bail reform bills through       legislative and oversight hearings on the issue.            Sincerely,          The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,             American Civil Liberties Union, NAACP, Human Rights             Watch, Color of Change.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am clear and I think my colleague Mr. Johnson is clear  on the pretrial release versus the money bail, but in many instances,  pretrial release may have a negative impact on a poor, alleged actor of  criminal activity as the money bail system. But this will add  additional pain and lack of promise.   As I said, my amendment was to have the aggregate number of those who  did not appear. That is viable and important information. You could  have it by counties, small towns, villages, and cities to indicate what  the impact is of pretrial release.   What strikes me as a concern is to have names and prior convictions,  because it becomes part of a DOJ database and these persons may never  commit another crime. They might have been in the hospital, maybe they  get back and say why--I don't know what it means if you didn't make the  first one and they got information that Mr. Smith was in the hospital,  didn't have a lawyer, is coming back, but his name has already been  sent out. And then you are going to penalize the local jurisdiction for  the Federal funds that they are so desperately in need of.   By the way, I am grateful that in the omnibus that we recently  passed, we plussed up all of those numbers. And I can assure you, our  communities are jumping for joy in the work that they have to do in  criminal justice reform or to secure or to make safe their communities,  particularly, our police officers for whom I have championed the COPS  on the Beat, and I just wish we could really plus that program up  because it is a very viable program that we had from the 1990s.   So taking money away is going to be, in this instance, when there  could be a positive alternative to giving the information, something  that I would be concerned about.                                time  1515    I have already mentioned the issue that wealth-based detention has  disastrous consequences: overloading the local jails, the lost jobs,  the lost housing, poor sanitation, medical care, broken families, and  draining local budgets. So let us have a moment on the floor that we  can discuss the reform of money bails, as was done in the Federal court  in the Southern District of Texas.   In closing, I would like to reiterate that this bill is, as they say,  an effort at finding a problem. It is important that we promote  transparency and accountability in government, but this bill does not  move in that direction. I am willing to extend my hand of friendship to  my friend from Texas. We will see where this bill goes.   But we know what it may really do. The bill was written for the  purpose of burdening pretrial services programs, publicizing the  sensitive information of defendants who are charged with but not  convicted of a crime--and I think that is an important element; you  really do deserve privacy if you are just an accused and not yet  convicted--and in order to undermine the efforts to reform the money  bail system.   That is why civil rights organizations have written to oppose this  bill. I would like to think that they would be willing as well to work  with us and come halfway to address the question of the money bail  disparate treatment, discriminatory impact. By the way, it is not just  a racial disparate treatment; it is a poor people's disparate  treatment; it is a working people's treatment, when they don't have  money.   We have heard the stories. They put up grandmother's house, their  house, and it becomes a real tall mountain to climb. The money bail has  been harmful and, in some instances, shameful in what it has done to  poor, working families. And instead of considering the  [[Page H3864]]  bill that would help us reform that, we should be considering--rather,  this bill with the ask of private information. I would like to see if  we have to have this bill to do it in aggregate. No names on it would  be very helpful. And we should be advancing legislation to eliminate  the placing of financial conditions on someone's release from jail  pending trial, which is taking money away from the local jurisdiction.   The bill today does that, and I think that we can work to do better.  And I am not pleased to be opposing, but I would ask my colleagues to  consider all that I have said about bail reform and disparate treatment  and how we can best handle the needs of finding out who leaves pretrial  release and who doesn't. Let's just get the numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I will be voting against this bill. I ask my colleagues  to join me, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted, if I might say, to be  with Professor Raskin today, and I would like to use that terminology,  or Congressman Raskin, but it means that he gets into both the theory,  the practice, and the passion of an idea. That is what teachers do.  They try to instruct their students to look at the holistic concept of  a theory.   Mr. Speaker, the loss of food stamps is not a theory, but it has  passion in the loss of such. It has a broad landscape of impact. It  certainly has a theory of which I don't adhere to, and that is that  Americans who have asked for a hand up are the ones deserving of the  brunt of an enormous tax cut that has created an enormous deficit that  was not asked for by the top 1 percent, who are getting the major  aspect, or major benefit, of this tax cut.   As a member of the Budget Committee, we took pains, the Democrats, to  parse through the ultimate negative impact of the $1.4 trillion-plus  tax cut.   During the Obama administration, we discussed a corporate rate  reduction. Many of us would have considered that on the idea of job  creation, coming from the early thirties, if you will, down to about  the mid-twenties. We did more than--when I say ``we,'' this bill did  21, unasked for by any corporate entity, which added, again, insult to  injury as it relates to those families, disabled, and seniors, children  who are dependent upon these programs.   We have many Americans who are dependent upon means-tested programs,  70 percent. The supplemental nutrition program, unlike the 21 percent  corporate rate reduction for taxes, is $1.40 per person.   One of our colleagues in the other body, Senator Booker, as we all  know who are familiar with him, and I think maybe we should join in  that effort, spend that much per meal, all of the Members of the House  of Representatives, because what we are dealing with today is the farm  bill.   The farm bill takes to shutting down the SNAP program and to cutting  it drastically, and to ignore and underfund important programs because  we find ourselves in a predicament of the deficit, the tax cut, and  what choices do we make.   The decision to limit SNAP is not limited to red States or blue  States. Eighty-five of the top 100 counties of individuals receiving  SNAP benefits are rural communities, and many of them are, in fact,  Republican represented.   The disastrous changes to SNAP would jeopardize the food security of  42 million people, including 30 million children, 4.8 million low- income seniors, and 1.5 million low-income military veterans.   So in conclusion, I came to the floor today to ask the question: Why  in the farm bill?   There is something about having a little seniority in this House. I  can remember that of all the bills in this Nation that came out of this  House and Senate--and I might say, joyfully, because I have been  supported by the Farm Bureau. I come from a State of ranchers and  farmers. We used to take pride in having that nexus between farmers and  the SNAP program and the continuity of such.   So here we are. We have breached it. We have blown it up for no  reason other than to pocket the money for the tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing us together. I ask my  colleagues to vote against the farm bill, because that would be  standing up for maybe a better pathway of that bipartisan farm bill  that we have had over the decades to make a difference in the lives of  all Americans.
