 Mr. President, I rise along with Senator Burr to urge our  colleagues to support the confirmation of Professor Richard Myers to  serve as a district court judge for the Eastern District of North  Carolina.   President Trump has nominated an eminently qualified and principled  individual to serve in the Eastern District. In his career, Professor  Myers has worked as a journalist, a prosecutor, and a professor. Each  step Professor Myers has taken in his professional career has prepared  him for this role. From the newsroom to the courtroom to the classroom,  Professor Myers has shown his commitment to the principles of truth, of  justice, and of wisdom. I cannot imagine a more solid foundation upon  which to place the responsibility of a district court judgeship than  that of Professor Myers, which he has exhibited throughout his career.   Professor Myers is a first generation college graduate who has close  ties to Wilmington, where he has chosen to locate his chambers. Once  confirmed, Professor Myers will hold court in Wilmington, the same city  where he was raised, where he went to college, and where he was a  journalist. North Carolinians are lucky to have someone like Professor  Myers with his caliber and his sense of duty to represent us in the  Eastern District of North Carolina.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for Judge Myers', or soon-to-be  Judge Myers', confirmation when it comes up later today.   I yield the floor.
