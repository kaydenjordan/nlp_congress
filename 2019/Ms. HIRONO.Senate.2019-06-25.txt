 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the  Patsy T. Mink and Louise M. Slaughter Gender Equity in Education Act,  which I was proud to reintroduce today with several of my Senate  colleagues. I also want to thank Congresswoman Matsui, who introduced  the bill in the House.   Our legislation recognizes and builds on the progress started by two  gender  [[Page S4508]]  equity champions: Patsy Mink of Hawaii and Louise Slaughter of New  York.   Patsy Mink, the first Asian American woman and woman of color to  serve in Congress, was a pioneer and a strong champion for gender  equity in education as one of the principal authors of Title IX of the  Education Amendments of 1972. Congresswoman Louise Slaughter's  commitment to public service and fierce advocacy for women's equality  and empowerment helped strengthen educational opportunities for all  Americans.   The Gender Equity in Education Act (GEEA) would honor their legacies  by providing more resources for K-12 schools, colleges and  universities, States, school districts, and others to fully implement  Title IX, also known as the ``Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in  Education Act,'' which has transformed the educational landscape in our  country by reaffirming the fundamental principal that sex-based  discrimination has no place in our nation's schools.   Since its enactment, Title IX has opened countless doors for women  and girls, and created important opportunities for students across the  country--whether in the classroom, on the playing field, or in the  boardroom. But barriers still exist, and more work remains to make sure  all students have access to safe learning environments free from bias  and discrimination. We need to work to make sure schools treat students  equally with regard to athletic participation opportunities, athletic  scholarships, and the benefits and services provided to athletic teams.   We need to work to improve gender equity in career and technical  education, in higher education, and in science, technology,  engineering, and math (STEM) fields while strengthening the STEM  pipeline. We need to address sexual harassment and assault in our  nation's schools.   We need to address discrimination based on pregnancy or parenting  status by providing better accommodations and increased support for  pregnant and parenting students, because currently only half of teenage  mothers earn their high school diplomas before they turn 22 years old,  and nearly one-in-three young mothers never get their diplomas or GEDs,  which is unacceptable.   And, at a time when nearly nine-in-ten LGBTQ students reported being  harassed or assaulted based on a personal characteristic, we need to  address discrimination based on stereotypes of actual or perceived  sex--including sexual orientation and gender identity.   GEEA provides important resources to continue this work--not only to  protect the progress we have made, but also to build on that progress  and create more opportunities for students.   By improving and strengthening Title IX, we uphold the great work of  champions like Patsy Mink and Louise Slaughter, who fought to make sure  no students are denied equal access to educational opportunities or  have to worry about whether they are safe on campus. We must remain  vigilant in this endeavor.   I thank my colleagues for joining me in reintroducing this important  legislation as we continue our work to advance Title IX and to ensure  equal access to educational opportunities for all.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Ernst):   S. 1967. A bill to promote innovative approaches to outdoor  recreation on Federal land and to increase opportunities for  collaboration with non-Federal partners, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
