 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to urge my  colleagues to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment before us.  [[Page S5469]]    In debating this measure over the past week, we voted on several  amendments. We hope to include dozens more in a managers' package that  we are working with the Democrats on that continues to evolve. We  sought to achieve a fair process on this package. The bill managers  have gone to great lengths to accommodate Members' interests within the  framework that has allowed us to make so much progress thus far in the  appropriations process.   I want to thank my colleagues. I especially thank Senator Leahy for  working together with us in a bipartisan way. We hope this will  continue to be a constructive process because all of us benefit. In  this light, I urge my colleagues to vote yes so we can continue to move  forward on this package and build upon the momentum we have generated  thus far.
