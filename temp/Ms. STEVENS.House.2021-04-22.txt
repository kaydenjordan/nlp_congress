 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 51, in the  esteemed tradition, the responsibility that we have as legislators of  this body to evaluate adding a 51st State to this Union, to form a more  perfect union; yes, in the tradition and in the written words of our  Constitution because, as when my native Michigan became the 26th State  in 1837 added to this Union, the President recognized that we will  admit Michigan on equal footing.   But we know that the Founders and the originators of our beautiful  Nation did not know a Michigan when they were writing our Constitution.  They did not know a Wyoming. So we ask ourselves here, as the  ambassadors of democracy, what message we send to the world when we  deny over 700,000 people the right to vote; when we tax them without  the proper representation.   This, my friends, is an exciting and profound and welcomed day in  this body that deserves debate, and this legislation deserves to pass.
