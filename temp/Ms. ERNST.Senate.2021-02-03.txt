 Madam President, on January 20, I joined my colleagues on  the front steps of the Capitol for the inauguration of our 46th  President, Joe Biden. At a time when divisions run deep within our  country, I thought President Biden's call for unity, where he pledged  to be a President for all Americans, struck just the right tone.   As my Democratic colleagues in this body can attest to, I am always  willing to work with anyone--Republicans, Democrats and Independents-- on issues that will improve the lives of my fellow Iowans and all  Americans. Sadly, the actions we have seen in the first few days of  this administration do not seem to honor the promise President Biden  made to Americans throughout his campaign and again on Inauguration  Day.   In just 2 weeks, the President has already signed over 25 Executive  orders, that is a significantly more amount than any President in  recent history in a short amount of time. Let's be clear, folks. He is  not just breaking norms, he is obliterating them. Even the New York  Times editorial board called on him to ``Ease up on the Executive  Actions.'' And they are not wrong, folks. That is something that I  don't say very often.   Now, I fully understand that the power of Executive order is often  unpopular when your party does not control the White House, but when  you set out to be a ``unifier-in-chief,'' which is something we hoped  President Biden would be, one would hope that the actions you take  would unify or at least be a little more mainstream.   The reality is, that has just not been the case. What the new  President has done in just 2 weeks on the job is show us his true  colors and his desire to appease the more radical wing of his party. It  is disheartening for someone who believes that the way we should be  working together is a bipartisan path.   We have already seen disastrous decisions harmful to American  businesses and workers--decisions that resemble the likes of the  radical Green New Deal.   Keeping our air and water clean and protecting our environment for  generations to come are shared concerns of every Iowan and all  Americans. But on day one, as many predicted he would do at some point  during his tenure, President Biden issued a harsh punishment for  American businesses by rejoining the Paris climate agreement. This  agreement saddles hard-working folks with overburdensome government  regulations, all while letting one of the world's biggest polluters,  Communist China, completely off the hook. Instead of inhibiting  economic growth, we should be focused on reducing our emissions and  meeting our energy needs through market-driven, innovative solutions.   Iowa actually leads the way in creating renewable energy sources,  from wind and solar to biodiesel and ethanol, but we haven't done it  through heavyhanded government mandates.   The President has also raised concerns for folks in my home State of  Iowa who work hard to grow and produce clean ethanol and biodiesel with  his recent action to begin transitioning Federal Government vehicles to  electric vehicles.   Ethanol and biodiesel are actually cleaner choices of fuel for folks  at the pump. A recent study found that greenhouse gas emissions from  corn ethanol are 46 percent lower than gasoline. At the same time,  renewable fuels provide for the livelihoods of folks across the  heartland.   It is critical we continue to invest in our biofuel industry, not  move away from it. That is why I urge President Biden not to give in to  the misguided political demands of the left. Change course and,  instead, promote the adoption of higher biofuel blends and invest in  expanding biofuel infrastructure.   On the same day he got us back into the Paris climate accord,  President Biden unilaterally canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline,  destroying thousands of jobs during a pandemic when millions of hard- working Americans are already struggling to make ends meet. Even  Canada's Prime Minister, one of our top allies and closest trade  partners, expressed his disappointment in the decision.   Unfortunately, the Green New Deal lite is not the only policy of the  liberal left the Biden administration has already chosen to implement.  As many Iowans know, I have long been working to pass Sarah's Law, my  bill in honor of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowan who was tragically  struck and killed by Edwin Mejia, who entered the country illegally and  was driving drunk--three times the legal limit.   While Mejia was initially detained by local law enforcement and faced  State charges of motor vehicle homicide, a loophole in immigration  policy under the Obama-Biden administration allowed him to post bond,  disappear, and escape justice.   Sarah's Law would close that loophole and require U.S. Customs and  Immigration Enforcement to take custody of an illegal immigrant who is  charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of  another person. It is common sense, folks, and it would prevent  tragedies like what happened to the Root family from ever happening  again.   The Trump administration was successful in implementing parts of this  important legislation. But as many expected, the Biden administration  is already working to roll back immigration enforcement. That is why,  last week, I reintroduced Sarah's Law with the support of 19 of my  colleagues--more than ever before--and I am going to keep fighting to  get this bill across the finish line.   If the November elections taught us anything, it is that the American  people want us to work together. They elected a 50-50 Senate and a slim  majority in the House of Representatives.   So, Mr. President, it is time the Biden administration follows its  own advice.  [[Page S289]]    I am an eternal optimist, and I believe we can come together and  truly deliver for all Americans, but I need my colleagues across the  aisle and our new President to do the same so that his calls for unity  don't fall on deaf ears                         March for Life and Abortion    Madam President, on another topic, we did have the March for Life  this past week. So I want to begin today by recognizing the grassroots  advocates of our pro-life movement.   Last Friday, thousands of Americans and many Iowans joined in this  year's virtual March for Life. These folks are the ones who actively  serve our vulnerable women and families who need support in order to  choose life. These hard-working Americans are the ones who are on the  ground, changing hearts and minds all year long.   Even though things looked a lot of different for this year's event, I  have no doubt that our grassroots pro-life movement will continue to  grow in communities all across the country, thanks to these inspiring  folks who understand that protecting life is not just a political issue  for debate.   In DC, lawmakers and executive branch bureaucrats get easily trapped  into looking at abortion as just another issue. But that mindset, even  from the pro-life perspective, is a dehumanized approach. I challenge  my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to instead  approach the sanctity of human life as more than just a policy issue.   Surely, the challenges of 2020 reminded us how very precious life is,  taking to heart that we must cherish life--all life at all stages. If  we devalue life in the womb, then we are only setting the groundwork  for diminishing human worth and value at every other stage of life.   This mindset is why I approach the duty to protect life with  steadfast determination. And it is why I know preserving life is a  cause that can and should bring us together.   President Biden and his administration have clearly stated their goal  is to unify our country, but the recent policy changes and Executive  actions surrounding the abortion issue have certainly signaled a  different message to many Americans.   There was a time when the most basic policy stance was that taxpayer  dollars should not support the abortion industry. It was a bipartisan,  noncontroversial stance--one that many of my Democratic colleagues used  to hold. But the abortion lobby has moved the goalpost so far down the  field by making commonsense safety regulations on abortion absolutely  untouchable; whereas, my pro-life colleagues and I have always been  willing to meet in the middle. Think about it.   I believe life begins long before 5 months in the womb, but we know  many colleagues feel differently. So Senator Graham has repeatedly  brought the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act forward each  Congress in the hopes that protecting our most vulnerable from painful  death at the 5-month mark of pregnancy would be a unifying and  humanitarian cause.   Sadly, that has not been the case. We had an estimated 143 babies who  died between 2003 and 2014 after surviving abortion attempts. This  shows the current law obviously needs to be strengthened there, which  is why Senator Sasse brought forward the Born Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act--but, no, even that bar was too high.   Last year, Senator Cotton and I first introduced a bill that would  ensure we have complete and accurate abortion-related data from every  State. Wouldn't a full picture of the abortion landscape in our country  be knowledge that any lawmaker would want in order to make informed and  responsible decisions? And when it comes to ensuring women are treated  with dignity and respect as patients, I will be introducing the  Informed Consent Act to solidify this commonsense cause.   My colleagues may recall a whistleblower report from September 2020,  claiming that hysterectomies and other sterilization procedures were  being performed on immigrant women held at the Irwin County Detention  Center in Georgia without their consent.   As it turns out, a sterilization or abortion procedure that occurs  without informed consent from the patient is not already established as  a crime in our Federal Code. My House colleague, Congressman Chris  Smith, and I are introducing this legislation to strengthen the law  here. Surely, this is another baseline that we can find common ground  on. I welcome my pro-choice colleagues to join us in this effort and  take a step toward unity.   I believe once you focus the heart and mind to approach life as more  than just a policy issue, you will find that preserving life promotes  unity.   If you really look at how our culture is shifting, life is winning.  At the State level, nearly 60 life-affirming laws were enacted across  the country in 2019. The vast majority of Americans agree that Federal  tax dollars should not be used to support the abortion industry.   So, folks, we do have common ground to stand on going into this new  Congress. Protecting life brings us together, so we must stand up for  the most vulnerable. We will be a stronger nation for it.   With that, I yield the floor.
