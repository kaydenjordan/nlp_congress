 Mr. Speaker, I have rarely heard such pernicious nonsense  as we heard from the minority leader a few minutes ago. He accused Mr.  Swalwell of having a Chinese spy or Chinese agent in his campaign. I  understand he has introduced a resolution to remove Mr. Swalwell from  his committee for that purpose.   The fact is we all have hundreds of people in our campaigns--hundreds  of people.   Can we vouch for any of them? Do we know everybody's associations? Do  we know whether someone in the campaign is a spy or a thief, or  whatever? Do we do a police investigation, an FBI investigation of  every member of our campaigns?   That is absurd. And I think Mr. McCarthy ought to be ashamed because  he is an experienced campaigner--he knows this--for raising these  spurious allegations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6) to authorize the cancellation of removal and  adjustment of status of certain aliens, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, is  vital legislation that establishes a path to lawful permanent resident,  or LPR, status for two critically important populations that are in  dire need of protection.   The Dream Act creates an earned path to LPR status for Dreamers,  individuals who entered the United States in their youth and who have  lived here for most of their lives. Dreamers are part of the fabric of  our Nation, aptly demonstrated by their commitment to bettering our  country through the pursuit of education, military service, and  employment.   It is undeniable that Dreamers enrich our Nation. They are our  neighbors and coworkers, they are classmates with our children, and  they serve in our military with distinction. They are an essential part  of our communities, where they contribute to our thriving economy and  make America a stronger, more united, and more diverse Nation.   Similarly, the American Dream and Promise Act provides a path to LPR  status for individuals who either held, or were eligible for temporary  protective status, TPS, as of January 1, 2017; or deferred enforced  departure, DED, as of January 20, 2021.   TPS is a form of humanitarian relief provided to individuals from  countries experiencing dangerous conditions and crises. DED is like  TPS, but it is derived solely from the President's constitutional  powers to conduct foreign relations.   Like Dreamers, TPS and DED recipients are essential to our  communities. Many of them have lived in the United States for decades.  They make up a significant portion of the workforce in key industries,  including construction, food service, and home healthcare. They  contribute to the U.S. economy, not only through their work, but also  through consumer spending and tax revenue, and they have been  particularly essential in serving our country during the COVID-19  pandemic.   I have no doubt that some of my Republican colleagues will stand  before us today and use what they claim is a crisis at the border as an  excuse not to support this bill. But let's get one thing straight, this  legislation is not about the border, this legislation is about finally  delivering on our promise to America's Dreamers and others who are  equally deserving of our protection.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Lucille Roybal-Allard,  Nydia Velazquez, and Yvette Clarke, for their commitment to this  important legislation, and to the millions of people this legislation  will protect.   I hope that all my colleagues will stand up for them when it truly  counts and will support H.R. 6 today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We do have a crisis in this country: the crisis consists of a  shortage of workers. As our birth rate goes down, as our aging goes up,  we have fewer and fewer workers. And since economists tell us that the  number of workers is what produces prosperity, this is a crisis for the  country.    Fortuitously, we have a situation where we have several million  people in this country who are Americans, who have lived almost their  entire lives in America, who, as was mentioned before, find out they  weren't born in this country only when they apply for a driver's  license when they are 18 years old. They are a resource for this  country, and they ought to be legalized, which is what this bill does,  so that we can utilize their talents properly and remain under rule of  law.   Madam Speaker, organizations, associations, and industry leaders from  across the political spectrum support passage of H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act of 2021. They include among them: United We  Dream, Service Employees International, the AFL-CIO--and these unions  do not fear competition, they know it is good--the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops, United States Chamber of Commerce, Apple, and the  National Education Association.   After closing the books on 4 years of disastrous and inhumane  immigration policies, today we begin a new chapter, one based on  compassion, reason, and the fundamental values we hold dear as  Americans.   Passage of H.R. 6 is long overdue. Today's vote will dictate the  future of millions of Dreamers and recipients of the TPS and DED and  will greatly help the economy of this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the  American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 233, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1603) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  provide for terms and conditions for nonimmigrant workers performing  agricultural labor or services, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1603.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of  2021 addresses an issue of critical national importance: the growing  labor challenges that are damaging the American agriculture sector.   Solving this issue is paramount to the sustainability of American  farming. It is also a matter of food security, and thus, national  security. As domestic food outputs decline, we have become more  dependent on food imports and more vulnerable to food contamination.  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these vulnerabilities as travel  restrictions impacted our food supply chain, and over 500,000  farmworkers tested positive for the virus.   With fewer U.S. workers turning to agricultural work as their chosen  pursuit, most of today's hired farm laborers are foreign-born.  Unfortunately, our immigration laws have not been updated to reflect  the needs of our 21st century economy.   As a result of these outdated laws, undocumented workers now comprise  about half of the U.S. workforce. But they are living and working in a  state of uncertainty and fear, which contributes to the destabilization  of farms across the Nation.   H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, addresses these  challenges head on. The bill provides temporary status to current  farmworkers with an optional path to a green card for those who  continue to work in agriculture. The bill also addresses the Nation's  future labor needs by modernizing the H-2A temporary visa program,  while ensuring fair wages and workplace conditions for all farmworkers.   This is a bipartisan, balanced solution, one that we should all be  able to get behind. It is a victory for farmers who have struggled with  persistent labor shortages for decades.   It is also a victory for farmworkers who have worked tirelessly in  the field growing and harvesting food without proper labor protections  or any guarantee that they can remain in this country. No acceptable  solution can fail to deal with this reality. That is why H.R. 1603 is  the right solution.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will vote today in favor of  providing a seat at America's table for those who have long grown the  food we serve on it.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Ms. Lofgren of  California, the chair of the Immigration Subcommittee, for her  leadership and steadfast commitment to the bipartisan process that led  to today's vote on the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support our farmers and  our farmworkers by supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).
