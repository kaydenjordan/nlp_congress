 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as the  chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have come to the  floor to speak about Hamas's attack on Israel. I joined with Senator  Reed--10 Senators, 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans--to visit Israel 2  weeks ago. We saw the brutality of Hamas firsthand. We met with the  families of the hostages. We made it clear that we stand with Israel's  right to defend itself, and we strongly support President Biden's  efforts and the supplemental appropriations to provide those funds to  Israel.   So why do I have concern about the unanimous consent request that has  been presented? Because it is not bipartisan. If you want to look at  bipartisanship, look at the work of Senator Murray and Senator Collins  on the Appropriations Committee. They have worked to get the type of  unity we need in order to pass appropriations bills and get them into  law, consistent with the agreements that were reached earlier this  year, recognizing the division in our Congress. We need to have a  bipartisan supplemental appropriations bill on the floor as quickly as  possible.   So I am extremely disappointed by the action of the House because it  is urgent that we consider the supplemental appropriations bill, and,  because of the action in the House, it will now be delayed. Make no  mistake about that. If the House would have acted in a responsible,  bipartisan way, including the package that was submitted by President  Biden, we would have had an excellent opportunity to pass a  supplemental appropriations bill before November 17--the date, by the  way, that our continuing resolution expires.   I am now deeply concerned, as a result of what happened in the House,  as to whether we are going to be able to get that supplemental  appropriations bill done before November 17, and it is urgent that we  do this.   So let me speak about Ukraine. Ukraine is the frontline in defense of  democracy. We know that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was not just aimed  at taking over Ukraine. Mr. Putin would not stop with Ukraine. The  Baltic States are clearly in his vision, and Moldova, Georgia, and  beyond.   And as Senator Reed pointed out, it is a lot better for us to have  the frontline with the use of our funds defending our democracy than  having to send American soldiers to Europe.   It is urgent we get assistance to Ukraine. We missed an opportunity 2  months ago. We have got to show the world that we are committed to the  defense of democracy--U.S. leadership.   Just think about the message it would send if we say: We are going to  help Israel, but I am sorry, Ukraine, we don't have time for you.   That is giving Mr. Putin a gift. We can't do that.   U.S. leadership is critically important. We need to make sure that we  provide the leadership, and, quite frankly, our allies around the world  are joining us, providing in total more assistance than we are. But it  is absolutely essential that America lead, and we must get this  Ukrainian aid moving forward. We need to do it in a bipartisan way.   It is a good investment. It is a good investment in protecting our  democracy in Ukraine. It is a good investment in degrading Russia's  military.   So let me try to connect the dots here, if I might, because Russia's  war of aggression in Ukraine is very much related to Hamas's attack in  Israel. Two of the most dangerous and brutal dictatorships in the  world, Iran and  [[Page S5379]]  North Korea, have joined forces with Putin to support Russia's war  efforts. Make no mistake about it. It was Russia that invaded Ukraine.  Iran's proxy, Hamas, attacked Israel. Connect the dots.   We can't ignore Russia and think we are going to be safe in the  Middle East. We need to provide the type of security that will help us  with our own national security.   Iran is building factories in Russia to pump out new drones. North  Korea is sending munitions to help Putin rearm his forces. We need a  supplemental appropriations package that counters all of these threats,  and we need to do it now.   So for the sake of our national security, we can't waste time. That  is exactly what the House is doing by sending us this supplemental  appropriation. We need to come together and show the leadership--the  bipartisan leadership--in the Senate. Keep the package together. Let's  put America's security first, and let's get to work immediately.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Dr.  Monica M. Bertagnolli, whom President Biden nominated to serve as the  next Director of the National Institutes of Health--NIH. As current  director of the National Cancer Institute--NCI--and a distinguished  professor and surgeon, Dr. Bertagnolli certainly possesses the  experience that will make her an effective leader for our Nation's  preeminent research center.   The NIH serves as the pinnacle of biomedical and behavioral research  in the United States and provides valuable insights that are used  around the world for saving lives and improving people's health.  Whether we know it or not, the NIH and the research done there has  touched all of our lives by giving our healthcare professionals the  resources they need for success. We in Maryland are proud to have the  NIH headquartered in Bethesda, with so many in our State contributing  to its important mission.   Thanks to Dr. Bertagnolli's decades of experience as a physician- scientist, she has obtained a well-rounded view of medical research  that I am confident will properly inform her decisions as NIH Director.  Her work to better understand the development and treatment of various  types of cancer highlights the diligence and effectiveness that qualify  Dr. Bertagnolli for this position.   As NCI Director, Dr. Bertagnolli has demonstrated her leadership  capabilities alongside her efficacy as a researcher, working with the  Biden Administration to reignite the Cancer Moonshot, which aims to  reduce cancer mortality by 50 percent over the next 25 years. This  ambitious goal reflects the determination of our cancer research  professionals and President Biden's continued commitment to investing  in programs, consortia, and research projects that aim to end cancer as  we know it. The NCI, along with spearheading the Cancer Moonshot  initiative, has also partnered with the Biden Administration to address  disparities in cancer outcomes for Americans living in low-income  areas, working to implement community-based programs in locations  facing persistent poverty.   Just a few weeks into her tenure as director of NCI, Dr.  Bertagnolli's work became much more personal as she was diagnosed with  early-stage breast cancer following a routine mammogram. She was forced  to balance her new role as our Nation's leading cancer researcher with  her own personal battle with the disease. I cannot commend Dr.  Bertagnolli enough for the strength she has shown to continue her  service to Americans in the face of such a daunting challenge.   If the Senate confirms Dr. Bertagnolli today, I would encourage her  to take aim at some of the most pressing healthcare issues facing our  country. As things stand, significant health disparities exist in the  United States, with many Americans not receiving equitable access to  care. Dr. Bertagnolli's confirmation provides her with the chance to  utilize the NIH's National Institute for Minority Health and Health  Disparities to work towards solutions for underserved populations that  aren't receiving the care they need. Her new role would also empower  her to build a stronger, more diverse healthcare workforce, one that  would be well-equipped to face the challenges of today.   As a Marylander, I would be proud to welcome Dr. Bertagnolli to our  State. She will be tasked with addressing many crucial and complex  issues as Director of the NIH, but I am confident that she is up to the  challenge.   I ask the Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Bertagnolli  for the outstanding work she has done as a researcher and surgeon, to  support her confirmation, and to wish her well in her new role should  she be confirmed.    Mr. President, on October 7, Hamas brutally assaulted  Israel, killing over 1,000 people--Israelis--and taking 240 hostages.  On October 22, I was in Israel with 10 Senators--5 Democrats, 5  Republicans. We were there to see firsthand what Hamas had done.   To tell you that it was beyond description--it hit each one of us  extremely hard. We saw the anguish in the country. The most difficult  meeting we had was not with the war cabinet--and we met with the war  cabinet, the major members of the war cabinet--but it was meeting with  the families of the hostages.   It broke our heart. The hostage families told us: You are not going  to see tears because there are no tears left in our body.   Unspeakable things happened, and the horror was beyond description.   I know my colleague Senator Collins has put up a photo of Abigail, a  3-year-old--a 3-year-old--who was taken hostage by Hamas.   We expressed to the Israelis our commitment to stand with Israel,  Israel's right and obligation to defend itself, the need to take out  Hamas, and our commitment to do everything we possibly can to bring the  hostages home safely.   I want to start by thanking President Biden for his extraordinary  leadership on behalf of our Nation in that mission. He has held  meetings with the hostage families, with government leaders from Israel  and other countries, and so have we.   We have had numerous meetings here in Washington and in our States  with families of the hostages. We have had personal meetings and calls  with leaders of other countries that we think could play a constructive  role in bringing the hostages home.   We are committed to always putting a spotlight on the hostages until  they are brought home safely. We stand ready to do anything we possibly  can.   So let me just give you an example of my weekend. On Friday night,  the Jewish community in Baltimore hosted a Shabbat dinner with 240  empty seats at a table. My wife Myrna represented me at that gathering,  reading a letter that I had written in solidarity with the community.   On Saturday, I attended religious services at B'nai Israel in  Montgomery County, and I was proud of what that congregation did to put  a spotlight on the hostages and demanding their safe return. Cantor  Perlman rendered a beautiful rendition in honor of our continued  commitment to bring the hostages home.   And then, on Sunday, on which we normally have morning prayers at our  congregation at Beth Tfiloh--normally, there might be 15 or 20 who  might show up for morning prayers on a Sunday morning--we had in excess  of 240 representing every hostage, remembering their plight in our  prayers, and making it clear that we are committed to doing everything  we can to bring them home.   So that is why I am on the floor, speaking to my colleagues and  expressing my views as a Senator, as chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, and as a human, that we will not forget the  hostages, and we will continue to do everything we can to bring them  home.   On October 7, for many, the last they heard from their loved ones was  the moments before the attack began, or, worse, just as they were being  taken hostage. One woman was texting with her family as Hamas  terrorists approached. She wrote:         If I don't live, stay happy in your life and take care of       mom and dad all your life.    Then:         They're here.    One man's wife and children were missing after the attack. The  soldiers could not identify them among the dead. But then they learned  that someone had seen them being led off away alive, being taken  hostage. The person said: Well, it sort of felt like winning the  lottery.   Winning the lottery because your loved one was abducted and not  murdered? Such painful combinations of hope and dread, but this is the  unspeakable shock and grief being felt by so many since October 7,  because, for every hostage, there are family members and loved ones  praying that they are still alive, who cannot sleep at night as they  imagine the pain and danger the hostages are facing in the tunnels of  Gaza right now, who have been enduring a nightmare since October 7.   On my trip to Israel we met with the families of the hostages, like  the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was last seen loaded into a  truck by Hamas after losing his arm in a grenade attack.   I am on the floor today because I want to tell just a few of the  stories of those Hamas abducted and represent all the families of the  hostages, families whose young children are being held by terrorists.  Their stories are moving not only because of their suffering but  because of their bravery.   I heard about a family that Hamas captured at gunpoint. In a moment  of incredible heroism, the mother handed her toddler to her husband  because he was a faster runner. He ran with bullets flying overhead so  their daughter could be safe.   Yarden, the mother, is still in captivity. The families of the  hostages will not give up. Their grace and bravery in the face of such  horror is an inspiration.   The father of Itay, the father of Edan, the parents of Omer--all  three of whom are from the New York area and even live near each  other--they didn't know one another until this terrible tragedy  unfolded and which now has brought them together.   Many of the families are communicating with each other, working  together through WhatsApp groups. Within hours of the attack, they have  created a website called ``Bring Them Home Now.'' They are making sure  the world hears their pleas. I want to make one thing crystal clear: We  hear you. We stand with you in your effort to return your family  members home safely. And I can assure you the Biden administration is  working around the clock to help bring them home. They are working with  governments who have the ability to negotiate using all the leverage  they have to release them.    American personnel from the FBI and the Pentagon are working to  support Israeli special operators. U.S. Special Forces are offering  their expertise on hostage situations. Secretary Blinken said that  ``the entire United States Government will work every minute of every  day'' to bring them home. ``Working as though these family members are  our own,'' as I am.   President Biden has spoken repeatedly with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  They have discussed efforts to locate and secure the release of  hostages, including American citizens. On behalf of the Foreign  Relations Committee, I want to assure you that we in the United States  Senate stand with you as well. We must keep up the effort for the sake  of those being held in Gaza. Don't forget they can come home safely. I  am not naive. It will be tough, but it can happen.   One of the hostages that has already been released is an 85-year-old  woman from a kibbutz in southern Israel, whose husband remains in Hamas  captivity. She described her experience in  [[Page S5386]]  Gaza, being beaten while lying on a motorcycle and going through  tunnels. Like many of the hostages, she lived near the Palestinians in  the kibbutzim outside of Gaza. They would regularly drive Palestinian  patients from Gaza to the hospitals in Israel for treatment.   Like Lilach, a woman that Hamas murdered, who actually worked in the  field of trauma relief focusing mainly on children, she was a longtime  activist of Women in Black, an anti-war movement that was established  by Israeli women after the first intifada. Seven of her family are  still being held hostage, including a 3-year-old.   The cruel irony of the Hamas terrorist attack is that those who face  the worst of October 7 believe the most in peace. They cared for their  Palestinian neighbors. They believed in the two-state solution. This  attack has changed their community and all of Israel forever.   I know that the kind of sheer evil we saw in the attack on October 7  is shocking and horrible. I was 15 months old when the Auschwitz- Birkenau and other concentration camps were liberated. I was too young  to understand the headlines. But when I grew up, I heard the stories of  life and death from survivors firsthand.   This experience of the Holocaust was imprinted on me and on an entire  generation of Jews. It shaped our values in how we work, how we enact  policy, and how we live with our families. It guides me today here on  the floor of the Senate. It tells me that, despite this being the  darkest days for Jews since the Holocaust, we must have faith. Despite  bearing witness to some of the most horrific evil acts ever committed,  we must find a way to reserve hope.   So, in closing, to the families of loved ones who are being held by  Hamas: Do not lose hope. We will never stop standing with you. To the  hostages themselves, you are not alone. We will not stop working for  your safe return. I pray that you will be back home soon playing  soccer, practicing piano, celebrating your birthdays, living life in  Israel that is safe and secure and at peace.   That is our prayer, but it is also our mission. We will not rest  until we do everything we can for the safe return of the hostages.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
