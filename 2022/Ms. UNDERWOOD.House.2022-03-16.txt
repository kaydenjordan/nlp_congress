 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the bipartisan fiscal  year 2022 appropriations bill becoming law, I am proud to have secured  over $10 million to fund 10 projects in communities across northern  Illinois.   These essential projects will reduce wait times for mental  healthcare, upgrade infrastructure to ensure clean water, make college  more affordable and accessible, support foster youth and families, and  strengthen local emergency response and community safety.   Last summer, I visited many of the organizations that sponsor these  projects to learn more about how these funds will impact Illinoisans.  Independence Health & Therapy will receive $60,000 to expand tele- psychiatry hours and reduce wait times for mental health services in  McHenry County.   The DeKalb County Regional Office of Education will receive $150,000  to expand the work of the DeKalb County Kindergarten Readiness  Collaborative and provide quality early learning opportunities to  residents of Sandwich, Sycamore, and Hinckley.   The Lake County Stormwater Management Commission will receive nearly  $1.4 million to prevent impending dam failure of the Sylvan Lake Dam  and protect nearly 500 homes from flooding and damage.   The Kendall County CASA Program will receive $200,000 to establish a  CASA clubhouse which will serve the growing foster youth population by  providing a free, safe location for families to meet during court- ordered visitation.   McHenry County College will receive $825,000 to expand dual credit  and dual degree programs, offering low-cost college credits to high  schoolers across McHenry County.   The Wauconda Fire Protection District will receive $36,000 to replace  a 28-year-old natural gas emergency backup generator to power the fire  station's emergency operations center, which provides essential  services to the 40,000 residents in Lake and McHenry Counties.   And over $7.5 million is being directed to critical water  infrastructure projects to ensure safe, clean, and sustainable drinking  water for residents of Joliet, Pingree Grove, and Richmond.   From day one, I have worked hard to bring the voices of the 14th  District to Congress. And as a member of the House Committee on  Appropriations, I will continue to ensure that our communities'  priorities are reflected within Federal funding.    These projects will create jobs and improve the well-being of our  communities, and I am so proud to deliver this $10.5 million investment  to my constituents.   This month, the House passed the bipartisan Honoring our PACT Act  which would expand healthcare for 3.5 million veterans exposed to toxic  substances during their service.   As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and an original co- sponsor of the bill, I am proud to champion this historic legislation.   Simply put, the Honoring our PACT Act is a full accounting for the  true cost of war. When our servicemembers signed up to defend our  country and our freedoms, we made a promise to care for them when they  returned home. For too long, we failed to keep that promise.   By passing this bill, we are upholding our end of the pact and  ensuring every veteran has access to the care they deserve.   The Senate must pass this comprehensive toxic exposure legislation  swiftly. Our veterans deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
