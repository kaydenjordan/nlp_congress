 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a sense of Congress resolution that  makes no change whatsoever in law or policy. It is a messaging bill  rather than legislation that actually does something on a substantive  issue.   So, one may ask, why bother opposing a bill that doesn't do anything?  I have a couple answers.   Part of the answer, to me, is that we normally do not bring isolated  issues in the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee to the  floor.   Part of the reason that a national defense authorization bill has  been signed into law every year for 58 straight years under Presidents  of both parties and Congresses of both parties is that we try to look  at national security as a whole as it relates to the Department of  Defense. There have been a few isolated instances where something  needed immediate attention, but, generally, we try to look at the  whole, not bring isolated issues to the floor. I worry that doing so,  even with a messaging bill, undermines that bipartisan approach that  has been so successful.   Another part of the reason, Mr. Speaker, is that we also normally try  to keep our troops above and beyond politics. Bringing a messaging bill  that does nothing to law or policy also threatens to undermine that,  and I worry about that.   On its face, the resolution, the messaging bill that is before us,  includes a number of statements that are just flat wrong. It says that  President Trump reversed the prior policy on transgender individuals in  a tweet. In fact, well before any Presidential tweet, Secretary of  Defense Mattis had put a delay on implementation of the policy that had  previously been announced so that there could be a 6-month review.  There was a 6-month review with experts, with uniformed and civilian  people from all the services, with medical experts, with a whole  variety of folks.   It is serious and thoughtful, despite some of the characterizations  that have been made from time to time. I recommend that Members  actually read it, because I think they will be impressed. They may not  agree with all of the recommendations, but they will see the serious  and thoughtful approach that the Department took to this issue.   As a result of this review, the previous policy was modified. It  didn't go back to the way it was. Again, those details are in the  report.   The resolution before us today says that the Mattis policy is a ban.  It is not. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found, on January 4, 2019,  that it is factually inaccurate to call it a blanket ban. In reversing  the lower court, the court of appeals said: ``The district court made  an erroneous finding that the Mattis plan was the equivalent of a  blanket ban on transgender service.''   This resolution before us says that there is a global medical  consensus on transgender care. But the World Professional Association  for Transgender Health says that they offer flexible clinical  guidelines that cannot possibly reflect all the differences and  situations which exist.   Mr. Speaker, turning to the substance of the matter for a second, to  me, the heart of the issue is contained in the very first sentence to  the Department report, which was issued in February 2018. The first  sentence says: ``It is a bedrock principle of the Department of Defense  that any eligible individual who can meet the high standards for  military service without special accommodations should be permitted to  serve.''   Any eligible individual who can meet the standards without special  accommodation should be permitted to serve. That is what I believe, Mr.  Speaker. I think that is what this policy attempts to achieve.   Now, it is a fair point to say it went too far this way or it didn't  go far enough this way. We can have those substantive, serious debates  at an appropriate time and place. But a messaging bill is not going to  get that job done.   I would say, finally, Mr. Speaker, that our committee heard the day  before yesterday a reminder that only 29 percent of Americans aged 17  to 25 are eligible for military service. Only 29 percent meet the  physical, mental, and legal requirements to be eligible for military  service, even if they want to. That means 71 percent are not eligible,  for whatever reason.   There could be, and maybe there should be, a debate that the  standards are too high, that we need to lower the standards, that we  need to make some changes in the standards so that more people are  eligible. But the point is, our view of military service is that anyone  who meets those standards should be allowed to serve. If someone  [[Page H2893]]  cannot meet those standards, for whatever reason, through no fault of  their own, then they are not able to serve. They can serve in a  different way, but not in military service.                                time  0930    I think, again, Mr. Speaker, if we were to really be discussing the  substance of the issue rather than a messaging bill, then we could talk  about the high standards for military service without special  accommodation and there would be a substantive discussion. That is not  what we are doing today. It is a messaging bill, and that is too bad  because there are serious issues that need to be discussed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr.  Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the Chair whether the  gentleman from Washington, the chairman, has any further speakers other  than himself.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the current House leadership seems  rather consumed by Presidential tweets. As a matter of fact, just a few  moments ago, the Speaker of the House, herself, was one of those  Members who had to be reminded that it is a violation of the rules of  the House to disparage the character of the President.   I guess we could do this every day. The President could tweet, and we  would have a sense of Congress to comment on it, and the President  would tweet. But generally, Mr. Speaker, I think there is a higher and  better purpose for this House to work on the  [[Page H2898]]  problems that confront the American people.   As I mentioned a few moments ago, this is a messaging bill. It  changes no law. It changes no policy. It could also be done down in the  House radio-television correspondents' gallery. Somebody could give a  speech, and there could be a press conference. It would have the same  effect as having this resolution on the floor.   I don't have the time to correct all of the misstatements in the  resolution or that have been made on the floor today. I will say this,  Mr. Speaker: If we are going to do messaging, then my primary message  is that every individual who serves our Nation in the military is  entitled to respect and our appreciation--every single individual--and  I am among those who are very impressed, by the way, by the transgender  individuals who testified in front of our Military Personnel  Subcommittee just a few weeks ago.   But on the substance of this issue, I believe the principle for the  Department of Defense is that any eligible individual who can meet the  high standards for military service without special accommodation  should be permitted to serve.                                time  1015    Any eligible individual who can meet the standard without special  accommodation should be permitted to serve.   I think that is the standard. That is not exactly what we have been  talking about today, but that is the standard, and it should be the  standard.   There may be some differences about what a special accommodation is,  about various medical diagnoses and conditions. I understand that. But  the standard is, if you meet the standard without special accommodation  you should be permitted to serve.   And those who serve deserve our respect and our appreciation. That is  the point. But that is not really the point of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
