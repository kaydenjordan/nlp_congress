 Mr. President, as we celebrate Women's History Month, I  am proud to spotlight Wyoming's great history and achievements for  women's equality.   Wyoming is the ``Equality State''--the first State to give women the  right to vote and hold public office. We actually did it before  statehood. Long before statehood, in 1869, the Wyoming Territory was  the first to grant women the right to vote.   Louisa Ann Swain of Laramie became the first woman in the United  States to vote in a general election in 1870, and Wyoming insisted on  protecting women's right to vote as a precondition for even joining the  Union in 1890.   Now, that is not all. The first elected woman Governor in the United  States, Nellie Taylor Ross, was Wyoming's 14th Governor.   Wyoming women continue to hold key elected offices today, with strong  leaders like U.S. Representative Liz Cheney.   The State owes a debt of gratitude to all of these extraordinary  women leaders.                              The Green New Deal    Now I would like to turn to this week's debate over the Democrats'  so-called Green New Deal.   The Green New Deal isn't about protecting our environment. It is  about increasing the size and scope of the Federal Government.   Every Democrat Senator running for President supports the Green New  Deal. They have cosponsored it--each and every one of them, every  single one.   By cosponsoring the Green New Deal, these Senators have shown  Americans what they actually do support as candidates and as an agenda  for America, and that is massively increasing the size of government.   This year the Federal Government is projected to spend over $4  trillion. That amount includes everything--Social Security, national  defense, Medicare, all of it. If we were to pass the Green New Deal, it  would cost up to $93 trillion over the next 10 years. That is $9.3  trillion a year--more than double what our government currently spends.   So, you see, the Green New Deal would massively expand the Federal  Government, and that is exactly what Democrat Senators running for  President want and plan to do, if elected. Don't be confused by Senate  Democrats' ducking this vote on the Green New Deal. This is where  Democrats would take our country if they were to retake the White  House.   The Green New Deal would bankrupt our Nation, would wreak havoc, and  would wreck the economy.   Republicans' pro-growth, pro-jobs policies have strengthened the  economy and improved the lives of American families in their everyday  lives at home. Because of tax relief, millions of families have more  money now in their pockets to decide what to spend, what to save, and  what to invest.   The Green New Deal plan would eliminate fossil fuels by requiring 100  percent renewable, carbon-free energy in just 10 years. Talk about  having extra money in your pocket to fill your gas tank, but just  putting gas in the car would be extremely difficult if the Green New  Deal were to come to pass.   On the issue of climate change, climate change is real, but the Green  New Deal is unrealistic. While it is important, in 2017 wind and solar  energy generated just 8 percent of our electricity. Should we have  more? Yes, but 8 percent of what we need is certainly inadequate.   Affordable and reliable fossil fuels, like coal and natural gas,  power three out of five U.S. homes and businesses. Excluding fossil  fuels would snuff out the bright lights of Americans' prosperity. It  would threaten national security. It would threaten jobs. It would  threaten our independence from foreign energy, and all Americans'  higher standard of living.   What Democrats are proposing is essentially a pipe dream. It is no  surprise that Democrats have yet to provide a cost estimate. They don't  want Americans to know that the Green New Deal could cost up to $93  trillion over the next 10 years. That is roughly $65,000 each and every  year for each and every family in America.   The Nation is already over $22 trillion in debt. So how are they  planning to pay for this? By doing what they often plan to do--raising  taxes.   Paying for a $93 trillion bill would empty just about every  Americans' savings account in the country, and let's not forget that  the Green New Deal would not actually solve the problems they are  trying to solve. Really, the proposal amounts to unrealistic economic  disarmament.   Plus, U.S. economic decline would harm the environment. That is what  we are hearing from the Green New Deal. It would be unilateral harm to  our economy and no improvement to the overall global climate. They want  it done immediately. They want it done drastically. It is a level of  alarm that is not in any way called for.   When you think about the American economy and what we are able to do  in this country, it is a strong economy that allows for a clean  environment. The stronger the economy, often the cleaner the  environment is. That is certainly the case here, when you compare us  around the world to other countries and their economies and their  environments.   The label ``Made in America'' means more than just the country of  origin. It means the better the environment. We are being asked to  destroy--that is what the Democrats are asking us to do with this Green  New Deal--our strong, growing, and improving economy and allow the  largest polluters in the world to grow at our expense.   Right now, 13 percent of emissions comes from the United States, but  33 percent comes from China and from India, and emissions in the United  States have been declining over the last dozen years, while they  continue to go up in China and India and in other locations around the  world.   Why do Democrats want to do this? Well, they would like to engineer a  big government takeover--or, I should say, as they say,  transformation--of the U.S. economy.   There is a real solution that will not wreck our economy, will not  hurt our Nation, will not hurt people's jobs, and will not hurt  American families. The solution is not taxation. It is not regulation.  It is innovation. Republicans continue to work, and we do it in a  bipartisan way to advance innovative strategies for reducing carbon  emissions.   First, we are working to promote carbon capture, and then using that  carbon and sequestering it, taking it away. That means taking carbon  out of the atmosphere and using it productively. We can use it for  medical projects, construction projects, and for extracting oil. You  can push the carbon dioxide into the ground in the area of oil wells  and get out more oil, as a result, leaving the carbon dioxide  underground.   Last year, the Senate passed the bipartisan FUTURE Act. It was signed  into law, and it expands tax credits for carbon capture facilities.   Now we are advancing the bipartisan USE IT Act, which will help to  turn carbon that has been captured into valuable products.   A second way Republicans are working in a bipartisan way to reduce  emissions is by supporting nuclear power. Nuclear power generates about  60 percent--60 percent--of American-produced carbon-free energy. By  far, that is the largest source of American carbon-free energy. It is  much more than double solar and wind power combined.   In late December, we passed the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Innovation  and Modernization Act. This legislation had Republican and Democratic  support and was signed into law by President Trump. This law will help  innovators develop advanced nuclear reactors that are safer, cleaner,  and more versatile. That is what we need to do. It is simplifying the  process on the front end for the innovators to build state-of-the-art  nuclear reactors. These advanced reactors are going to power the next  generation of nuclear plants. We need them to expand the use of carbon- free energy. We also need to maintain our existing nuclear powerplants,  and Congress needs to address how we manage nuclear waste. Nuclear  power is an area with broad bipartisan support. We must continue to  work together on nuclear power.   A third approach that Republicans are taking to reduce emissions is  increasing the use of renewable energy. Republicans have repeatedly  passed tax incentives to promote clean energy. These include tax  credits for wind and solar panels, as well as incentives for biodiesel  and compressed natural gas.  [[Page S2029]]    We know all these innovative strategies work. We see it in America's  unparalleled success in reducing emissions. This progress is not the  result of taxation; it is not the result of regulation; it is the  result of American innovation. Our cutting-edge technologies can be  adopted globally.   Republicans want to make America's energy as clean as we can, as fast  as we can, while investing in promising innovations for the future.  Democrats want more government control. That is what they asked for  with the Green New Deal--control of our economy and control of our  lives, despite the cost to American families and American taxpayers.   Let's continue to pass real climate solutions, not these far-left  fantasies. Let's focus on what works for our environment and our  economy, not what works for Democrats who are running for President.   Republicans are going to continue to oppose unrealistic, unworkable,  and unaffordable proposals like the Green New Deal. It is a big green  bomb. The Democrats are ducking it, they are dodging it, and they are  now distancing themselves from it by showing up on the floor of the  Senate--those who have cosponsored it, those who have gone on TV and on  the hustings around the country saying they would support it and be for  it--and voting not for it but present. The Democrats are ducking this  for a good reason: They know what a disaster it would be for our  Nation.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
