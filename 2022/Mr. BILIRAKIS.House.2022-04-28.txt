 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the utter  failure of President Biden's dangerous open border policies.   In March, there were over 221,000 illegal encounters at our southern  border, a 542 percent increase, bringing the total under Biden's watch  to more than 2.4 million. Forty-two of those apprehended were on the  terrorist watch list. This can't happen.   Illegal migrants are being dispersed into communities throughout  country, making every State a border State, Mr. Speaker.   Meanwhile, my constituent, an American citizen, has been told his  wife and daughter, who have fled war-torn Ukraine, must wait up to 2  years outside the United States for a visa interview.   This is wrong. These policies reward those who violate our laws and  punish those trying to do the right thing.   They also put law enforcement officers in serious peril, as evidenced  by the death of Texas National Guardsman Bishop Evans. May his memory  be eternal. He tragically drowned last week while courageously working  to save individuals trying to cross the Rio Grande River illegally.   This insanity has to stop.                            ____________________
