 Mr. Speaker, I thank our future chair for yielding me  the time. I appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to sit on the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, where we fund agencies  and departments that are important not only nationwide, but especially  in my home State of Maine. So it is particularly heartbreaking to be  here today urging my colleagues to reopen these agencies as we open a  21st day of an unnecessary government shutdown.   Today marks the first day that many Federal Government employees will  go without a paycheck. There are over 1,100 Federal workers and their  families in Maine alone. These include families at Maine's Acadia  National Park and the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, the USGS  research centers and the air and water program officers at the EPA.  This shutdown has made life extremely difficult for these workers and  these families, and it has halted the critical duties that they  perform.   This bill funds vital programs that we use every day to protect our  resources, to learn about the environment, and to connect Americans to  our national treasures.    So far, the administration has used accounting gimmicks to give the  appearance that these parks and agencies remain open, but you can't  hide the real consequences of this shutdown. For example, at our  national parks, there have been reports of habitat destruction,  injuries, and even deaths since the beginning of the shutdown.   We don't need gimmicks. We need to reopen the government. Despite the  President's refusal to do his job, I am proud that we are doing ours in  Congress by moving these appropriations bills forward to reopen the  government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the American  taxpayer, to support Federal workers and  [[Page H491]]  their families, and to support the vital environmental programs that  are funded in this bill. Please vote ``yes'' on H.R. 266 and end the  shutdown.
