 Mr. Speaker, it is spring, the beginning of summer, but  it is also Caribbean-American Heritage Month this June. It brings me  great pride to join Virgin Islanders and other Caribbean people across  the country in celebrating Caribbean-American Heritage Month.   As a Virgin Islander and an American of Caribbean descent, I am proud  to celebrate the life, legacy, and achievement of Caribbean people in  this country. Virgin Islanders and other Americans of Caribbean lineage  have made enormous contributions to the United States through academia,  athletics, the arts, and more.   Caribbeans have been involved in this country since its inception,  such as des gens de couleurs libres, who included 800 French-Caribbean  soldiers, 500 of whom were Haitian free men of color who fought at the  battle of Savannah for the Colonies in the American Revolution.   Caribbean-American Heritage Month was officially celebrated and  recognized on June 5, 2006, by Presidential proclamation signed by  President George W. Bush. It had been unanimously adopted in the House  in 2005 through the unwavering power of our colleague Barbara Lee, who  sponsored the legislation. Since 2006, the White House has released an  annual proclamation recognizing June as National Caribbean-American  Heritage Month.   Caribbean Americans have added to the history, culture, and  communities in America in countless ways. The unique relationship  between the United States and the Caribbean has enriched both regions,  and this month is a wonderful time to celebrate our shared past and our  future.   We should also look for opportunities for us as Americans to pursue  new partnerships on a number of issues with the Caribbean. From trade,  immigration, disaster preparedness, poverty eradication, and ending  HIV/AIDS, the United States and the Caribbean share a number of mutual  policy interests.   This year, the COVID-19 pandemic adds a new challenge to both our  country and our Caribbean neighbors. I will keep fighting to ensure  that the United States works to be an active and constructive partner  in safeguarding the health and welfare of our third border.   The people of the Caribbean are as much a part of the fabric of this  country as anyone else. We are not monolithic, nor do we represent one  culture, one ideology, or even one ethnicity.  [[Page H2752]]  Alexander Hamilton, the drafter of the United States Constitution and  our first Secretary of the Treasury, was born on the island of Nevis  and spent his childhood and formative years on my home, St. Croix, in  the Danish West Indies, what is now the Virgin Islands.   Caribbean-American heritage not only flows through the fabric of this  country; it also flows through the Halls of Congress every day. Shirley  Chisholm, a personal hero of mine, was the first African-American  Congresswoman and the first Black woman to run for President, nominated  by a major party. Her heritage hails from Barbados and Guyana. Without  her, Caribbean women, even Black women, myself, and many other of my  colleagues would not be here today: Yvette Clarke, Jenniffer Gonzalez- Colon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sheila Jackson Lee, Frederica Wilson,  former Members Mia Love and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and many more. Even  our current Vice President, Kamala Harris, is of Jamaican descent.   The Caribbean people have done so much more than just fight and make  laws for this country. That doesn't even scratch the surface. The  building we are standing in right now was designed by Dr. William  Thornton, who was born on the island of Jost Van Dyke in the British  Virgin Islands. The symbol of our democracy was designed by a Caribbean  American.   Our works in the arts are felt every day: news commentators Joy Reid,  Yamiche Alcindor, Karine Jean-Pierre; from Sidney Poitier, the first  Black man to win an Academy Award, to Kerry Washington. Who can forget  Cicely Tyson and Harry Belafonte; great minds like Edward Wilmot  Blyden, the father of Pan-Africanism; Denmark Vesey; Malcolm X; and  Stokely Carmichael.   In music, we have managed to not only be great but iconic as well:  Maxwell, who is considered to be the godfather of neo-soul and the R&B  movement; Biggie Smalls, a fellow Brooklynite born to Jamaican parents,  changed hip-hop forever; and Nicki Minaj, who is changing it even more  in the modern era.   Some of the greatest athletes of our time are Caribbean, from Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar, whose family is from Trinidad, to Tim Duncan, from my  home on St. Croix, who was just elected to the hall of fame, and even  Ramon Harewood in the NFL.   During this unique time in our country's history, I encourage  everyone to learn more about the contributions of Caribbean Americans.                            ____________________
