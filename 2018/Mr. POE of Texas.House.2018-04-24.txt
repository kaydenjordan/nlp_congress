 ``Have courage and be kind.'' These were the words  Megan Rondini left behind on a whiteboard in her school apartment.   Yesterday, at a Sexual Assault on Campus Forum at Rice University in  Houston, Texas, sponsored by the Victims' Rights Caucus, Megan's  father, Mike Rondini, spoke these words. He is from Austin. He tries to  live by these words every day.   Megan Rondini was sexually assaulted while a student at the  University of Alabama in 2015. Doing everything a sexual assault victim  should do, Megan immediately called the police and went to the  hospital, but the hospital did not have a sexual assault forensic  examiner or a SANE on staff, meaning no one there was trained to  properly deal with a sexual assault victim or properly collect DNA  evidence for a rape kit.   As a former prosecutor and a judge, I have seen, firsthand, the  trauma and pain that rape causes victims. Sometimes that pain never  goes away. The hospital's failure to provide adequate care left Megan  feeling hopeless and alone.   After the hospital, she went to the police station, and there she was  treated with disdain. The police didn't believe her and instead read  her, the victim--get this--the Miranda warnings. Are you kidding me?  Rape is never the fault of the victim.   When Megan sought counseling at the university, the counselor  abruptly interrupted her and told her she was close to the family of  the rapist and promptly turned Megan away, providing no other  counselor.   Megan was completely failed by the system--by the university, the  hospital, and the police. Mr. Speaker, not long after, she took her  life.   Megan's story is heartbreaking, but her memory reminds us that we  must be tenacious in fighting sexual assault on campus and everywhere  else. The unfortunate reality, Mr. Speaker, is that stories like  Megan's are common.   Congressmen Olson, Culberson, and I joined together at the forum  yesterday, and we all heard stories about this, firsthand, from  victims. It is always personal. When victims are ignored and rejected,  they feel like they have been abandoned, and in many cases, they have  been. They are forced to relive their attack over and over again.   Last year, I introduced, along with my friend, Carolyn Maloney, the  bipartisan Megan Rondini Act, a bill that would require hospitals to  provide access to a SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensics Examiner) or a SANE  (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) or have a plan in place to get a victim  to a nearby hospital that can provide forensic medical services.  Professor and sexual assault nurse examiner Nancy Downing from Texas  A&M testified yesterday that by providing SANEs to rape victims, a  hospital can dramatically improve a victim's chance to recover  emotionally and medically from the attack.   In addition, I am a cosponsor to Carolyn Maloney's (NY) bipartisan  legislation to require colleges to have a sexual assault victim  advocate on staff to assist and advise sexual assault victims. There  should be no more school counselors that turn victims away.   The director of public policy for Texas Association Against Sexual  Assault, Chris Kaiser, also testified, and he talked about how the  Association and other associations are working on many levels to  provide a culture of change within law enforcement and the attitude of  peace officers regarding this type of crime, and also, more reporting  require.  [[Page H3459]]    Treating victims like criminals is never okay. Remember, Mr. Speaker,  rape is never the fault of the victim. As we become more aware of this  dastardly crime, some schools, like Rice University, have made  excellent strides to address sexual assault on campus. The Rice dean of  undergraduates, Dr. John Hutchinson, and former Rice student body  president, Justin Onwenu, both testified about the many positive  proactive steps Rice has taken; a guide for other universities.   Rice University requires all students to participate in a student- driven 6-week course that teaches young college students to notice the  signs of sexual assault and work to change the culture that allows  sexual assault to occur on campus. It is work like this that will help  foster a culture change where survivors of sexual assault will feel  supported by our community.   Sexual assault on campus must end. We must change the culture to  prevent this crime. We must give victims support to recover and become  survivors, and we must let offenders know they will be held accountable  for their acts, and they will meet the law.   Mr. Speaker, we should follow the words of Megan Rondini: ``Have  courage, and be kind.''   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 447) to require reporting on acts of certain foreign  countries on Holocaust era assets and related issues.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 447         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Uncompensated       Survivors Today (JUST) Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON HOLOCAUST ERA ASSETS AND RELATED ISSUES.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;        (B) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;        (C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives; and        (D) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives.        (2) Covered countries.--The term ``covered countries''       means participants in the 2009 Holocaust Era Assets       Conference that are determined by the Secretary of State, or       the Secretary's designee, in consultation with expert       nongovernmental organizations, to be countries of particular       concern relative to the issues listed in subsection (b).        (3) Wrongfully seized or transferred.--The term       ``wrongfully seized or transferred'' includes confiscations,       expropriations, nationalizations, forced sales or transfers,       and sales or transfers under duress during the Holocaust era       or the period of Communist rule of a covered country.        (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a       report to the appropriate congressional committees that       assesses and describes the nature and extent of national laws       and enforceable policies of covered countries regarding the       identification and the return of or restitution for       wrongfully seized or transferred Holocaust era assets       consistent with, and evaluated with respect to, the goals and       objectives of the 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference,       including--        (1) the return to the rightful owner of any property,       including religious or communal property, that was wrongfully       seized or transferred;        (2) if return of any property described in paragraph (1) is       no longer possible, the provision of comparable substitute       property or the payment of equitable compensation to the       rightful owner in accordance with principles of justice and       through an expeditious claims-driven administrative process       that is just, transparent, and fair;        (3) in the case of heirless property, the provision of       property or compensation to assist needy Holocaust survivors,       to support Holocaust education, and for other purposes;        (4) the extent to which such laws and policies are       implemented and enforced in practice, including through any       applicable administrative or judicial processes; and        (5) to the extent practicable, the mechanism for and an       overview of progress toward the resolution of claims for       United States citizen Holocaust survivors and United States       citizen family members of Holocaust victims.        (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       after the submission of the report described in subsection       (b), the Secretary of State should continue to report to       Congress on Holocaust era assets and related issues in a       manner that is consistent with the manner in which the       Department of State reported on such matters before the date       of the enactment of the Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Engel), and I ask unanimous consent that he be  allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the Nazis ravaged Europe, confiscation of property  was just one of the many injustices Holocaust victims endured.   In the almost 75 years since World War II ended, helping to repair  the wrongs inflicted by the Nazis by restoring the property of millions  of people who had their lives torn apart has proven a difficult and  challenging problem.   The 2009 Holocaust Era Assets Conference addressed the ongoing  injustices created by the Holocaust, including guidance related to  restitution of  [[Page H3461]]  property wrongfully seized. However, among the 46 signers to this  declaration, including the United States, there are vast disparities in  the degree to which the laws and policies of each country fulfill these  principles to compensate survivors.   This act will help hold governments accountable that have fallen  short of their commitment to these important principles.   This bill requires the State Department to assess the laws and  policies regarding the return or restitution for wrongfully seized  Holocaust era assets by countries that participated in the 2009  Holocaust Era Assets Conference.   This bill states that it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary  should continue to report to Congress on Holocaust era assets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, and I ask unanimous consent that he control that  time.    Mr. Speaker, the Iranian regime is the number one  state sponsor of terror in the whole world, and they commit terrorist  acts even against their own people.   I am proud to support H.R. 4744, the Iran Human Rights and Hostage- Taking Accountability Act, introduced by my friend, Chairman McCaul.   The mullahs in Tehran are among the world's worst human rights  abusers. This year, we have witnessed their brutality again on display  as they continue to mercilessly crush dissent from their own people.   International attention has faded, but the Iranian people are still  in the streets demanding their rights, whether they be economic  opportunity, access to water, religious freedom, or gender equality. In  response, the regime has murdered dozens and locked up thousands, as it  has done so many times before, without punishment from the outside  world.   This is nothing new for the Islamic Republic. Look no further than  the 1988 massacre, where 30,000 of Iran's political prisoners were  systematically murdered by the regime.   This barbaric mass execution occurred by public hangings, firing  squads, and included teenagers and pregnant women who refused to  announce their political affiliations, including many from the MEK,  today's leading Iranian dissident group.   So horrific was the act that deputy to Iran's ruler at the time,  Ayatollah Khomeini, called it: ``The greatest crime committed during  the Islamic Republic for which history will condemn us.'' And, yes,  history now condemns the regime for these acts of murder.   This bill will provide for that condemnation and call for  investigation into this crime against humanity. It also urges our  government to work with international partners and investigate other  major human rights abuses, such as the dozens more killed during  protests in 1999, 2009, and 2017, and sanction those responsible.   In all cases, the families of those murdered by the regime were never  told what happened to their loved ones' remains. This important bill  will pressure the Iranian Government to disclose the final resting  place of the missing so their families may have a small bit of peace.   Mr. Speaker, now is the day of reckoning for the Iranian regime.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I also want to thank and express my support for Ranking Member  Engel's bill, H.R. 4681, the No Assistance for Assad Act. As he said,  Assad is a butcher, a butcher of his own people.   Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad continues to murder the Syrians en  masse and destroy what was once a great ancient land. Because of the  world's inaction, he is close to victory. He has proven that evil  triumphs when good men and women do nothing.   Now Syria is in ruins and it must be rebuilt, but in the lands that  Assad and his thugs control, we should play no part in helping his  regime look like the saviors of the country. He and his Russian and  Iranian backers must foot the bill for the destruction they brought  upon Syria. Assad and his murderous supporters will try to use any  reconstruction to cover up for their crimes.   That is why it is important we pass H.R. 4681, to restrict any U.S.- funded reconstruction assistance to areas the Syrian regime controls.   The American people are kind; they are generous and will always help  those in need. We always have--history proves it--but we will not pay  for a propaganda win for brutal dictators like Assad.   Let Assad and his buddies, the Iranians and the Russians, rebuild  Assad's territory. His regime has weaponized humanitarian aid  throughout the war, and we can only expect him to continue to do so as  he tries to retake territory.   So, for now, let Assad rule over the ruins of the old Syria, the  Syria he destroyed, and no U.S. money should ever go to Assad. One day,  the Assads will be gone, but until then, we should not provide a dime  of American money to strengthen his rule and grip over that land.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, it is remarkable that Harris County,  Texas, Precinct 4 Deputy Constable Christopher Gaines is alive.   On April 17, Deputy Gaines and three other officers responded to a  domestic violence call in Atascocita, Texas, where we both live.  Approaching the house, the officers were cautious, and rightfully so.  After all, Mr. Speaker, 22 percent of police officers that are shot  occur during domestic violence calls.   Suddenly, the outlaw dashed out of the house with his guns blazing.  The deputies returned fire, but with little or no area to take cover,  2-year veteran of the force Deputy Constable Gaines was shot in the  abdomen at point-blank range with a shotgun. Gaines' wife even heard  the shots from their nearby home.   Gaines' fellow officers rushed him to the hospital and put him  directly into surgery.   Gaines' only thoughts were of his wife and his 4-year-old daughter,  Zoey. Thanks to the good Lord, and the medical professionals at  Memorial Hermann, Zoey's dad is alive. After speaking with him, he told  me he is in high spirits and expected to recover. He is already talking  about returning to work.   Mr. Speaker, Deputy Christopher Gaines is one of the rare breed of  American lawmen that always stand ready to protect and defend the rest  of us from evildoers.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
