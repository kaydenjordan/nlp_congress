 Mr. Chair, Joe Biden has forced Americans to  foot the bill for hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine while our  southern border is being invaded by terrorists, drug cartels, gangs,  and human traffickers.   I oppose sending any additional money to Ukraine oligarchs in a proxy  war that we are being dragged into because Ukraine was paying the Biden  family $1 million a year in cash.   Americans deserve a spending bill that puts America first by securing  our border and putting us back on the path to energy independence,  which was achieved by the Trump administration.   Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman Greene for offering this amendment.
