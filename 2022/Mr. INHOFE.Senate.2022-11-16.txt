 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for as much time as I shall consume.    Mr. President, as I reflect on my 28 years serving in the  U.S. Senate, I am reminded of the lessons I learned from my former  colleagues and friends who have served beside me in the Senate. I had  the privilege of serving with many great titans for a fairly long  period of time. Some maybe thought too long. I had the privilege of  serving with the people whom I have known very well--people like Orrin  Hatch and Mike Enzi, friends I miss dearly. I single them out because  they are no longer with us.   In Senator Hatch's farewell speech in 2018, he reflected on the  striking shift in polarization and partisanship of the Senate, and he  yearned for the days of Members finding common ground and breaking  bread together.   Orrin reflected on this in his farewell speech. He said: Could two  people with polar-opposite beliefs and from vastly different walks of  life come together as often as Teddy and I did? And the answer is yes.  Can conservative Republicans and Democrats come together today? All the  time, and they will in the future. But you may not hear about it  because it is not newsy. The media doesn't really care if everybody  loves everybody.   Then there is Barbara Boxer. Not too many people who are making their  last speech talk about Members of the other party, but I will do this.  I have shared this story many times with all of you about how former  Senator Barbara Boxer of California and I worked together for many  years as chair and ranking member of the EPW Committee to get things  done. You can't get two more ideologically different Senators than  Barbara and me--Barbara, a proud Democrat of the most far left State in  the Nation, and me, a  [[Page S6726]]  proud Republican from the most conservative State in the Nation. But we  were able to see past our ideological differences to work together, and  we did. We got stuff done. We passed landmark legislation, from highway  bills like the FAST Act to the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act.  You remember that. Most people still remember that. We did it, and we  did it time and time again.   Every Wednesday, as Republicans in this meeting in the Senate where  the chairmen will go--I shouldn't probably be telling all you guys what  Republicans do. But they go around the room and give an update on what  their committee is working on. And I would always say at that time: Now  is the time to hear from the committee that gets things done.   And I can say that--that Barbara Boxer and I got things done. And do  you know what? We actually enjoyed it. Nobody believed that we would  enjoy it so much and actually get things done.   Then there is Jack Reed. Today, I have a similar relationship with  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am a Republican,  and he is a Democrat. Jack is from Rhode Island, a very blue State, but  we have worked together for years to pass the annual Defense  authorization bill, which is the most important bill we pass every  year.   I believe the secret to getting this bill done--and any bipartisan  bill, for that matter--is determination, but also trust and respect in  the Member that you are sitting across the table from, a lesson Senator  Hatch set very well. In working with Senator Reed over the years, he  has my trust, and I have his respect. And it is why we have been  successful in what I consider to be the most significant thing that we  do every year.   For me, I was a builder and developer prior to running for public  office and never contemplated getting involved in politics until one  day on the job in South Texas. I was told that I needed more than a  dozen permits to build a single dock. Now, that didn't make much sense  to me, and so I decided at that time to run for office and try to get  things done where people in this body are actually responding  favorably.   I remember when I first came to the Senate from the House. After I  gave a very spirited speech on the Senate floor, Senator Byrd came up  to me and he said: Young man, the Senate doesn't work like the House.  Let me tell you about the Senate. That day happened to be November 17,  1994, which was my 60th birthday. Until the day he died, I was still  ``young man.'' And Senator Byrd explained to me--and this is something  that a lot of the new Members who are just being sworn in as we speak,  and are here for the first time, realize--that this is discipline and  major differences. If you make enemies in the Senate, you are wiped  out. That is not true in the House. I spent a lot of years in the House  before.   Also, I remember friends across the aisle, like former Hawaii Senator  Danny Akaka, who led our Prayer Breakfast each week; Ted Kennedy, who I  helped out of the Capitol during one of the September attacks that was  taking place; and former Majority Leader Harry Reid, who would  sometimes move our voting schedule around so that I could get home and  watch my grandkids' football games.   And then there is the one that we all love, Susan Collins, who is  well-respected because she makes this institution a better place, and  not just because of the Maine lobster rolls that are her signature fare  for the eating groups.   Real friendship does exist in the U.S. Senate, but nobody knows it.  It is a big secret around here.   Then there is a bipartisan Bible study that we have. Some of you know  about the Senate Bible study that meets every Thursday in my hideaway  in the Capitol. I have made a point not to miss a Thursday Bible study  in 28 years. So I have a record going. There is no one who is going to  beat it. Well, they could beat it, I suppose. After I was first elected  to the House in 1986, I attended a Bible study led by a guy named Tom  Barrett.   I am going to tell you a story that most people don't want to hear,  but one day, Tom Barrett and a Member of Congress from Kansas invited  me to the Members' dining room after Bible study. Keep in mind, this  was 1986.   They said to me: Inhofe, we think that--we have been with you now for  over a year, since you got here, and we think you never really accepted  Jesus.   Well, I got mad. Who is this young guy there telling me about Jesus?   And they said: All right, when did you ask Him?   And I said: Well, every day.   They asked: How long have you and Kay been married?   At that time, we were newlyweds. We were probably, I think,  celebrating our 29th wedding anniversary.   And they said: Do you propose to Kay every day?   And I said: No.   And they replied: Why?   And I said: Because we are already married.   Well, bingo, that meant something. And I thought--I was a little  cautious because these guys were younger, and I wasn't sure I knew them  that well. I said, just in case they were right in the Members' dining  room at 2:30 in the afternoon on September 22, 1988, I reaccepted-- reaccepted--Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior. Now, that is life- changing.   OK. Now there is Africa. Since joining the Senate, I have made 172  African country visits, alongside good friends from here, like Mike  Enzi, John Boozman, Mike Rounds, Trent Kelly, Tim Walberg, and arguably  my closest friend, Mark Powers, a real brother, but it all started with  Doug Coe. You see, people think of Doug Coe as having been someone who  was a great diplomat. He had political influence and all that.   Years back, an article about Doug said this:         The extent of Coe's influence in American politics is       [real] . . . important figures have acknowledged his role on       the national and international stage. For instance, speaking       at the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast, President George H. W.       Bush praised Coe for his quiet diplomacy.    Not many things are quiet around here. Doug spent his years in the  countries across the world taking Jesus's name to the Kings. I remember  him asking me for 8 years. He said: Inhofe, I wish you would go to West  Africa.   And I had no interest in going to West Africa.   And he kept saying--and this lasted for 8 years. For 8 years, I said  no to this guy, but he was very persistent. And I can't tell you why it  happened, but then finally I said yes. And I still to this day can't  figure out how that happened. But that changed lives, including mine,  and it all came from Doug Coe.   You know, I would like to mention some of these people who were  really heroes around here that most people don't even know. They don't  remember. But they go back and they look them up and they see what  great contributions they made. Not many people are aware of this, but  here in the U.S. Senate, every Wednesday morning, we meet in the Spirit  of Jesus. This is something Doug Coe started many years ago during the  Eisenhower administration. It is scripturally based, Acts 2:42. We get  together, eat together, pray together, fellowship together, and talk  about the precepts of Jesus together.   I will always be thankful to Doug for his efforts to quietly speak of  Jesus in most every country around the world.   Over my 172 African country visits as a Senator--sure, I did my  military job while I was there--but I developed a deep love and  appreciation for the people of Africa whom I will hold here with me  forever.   One thing from my visits remains clear. Building meaningful and  lasting relationships with African leaders is vital if the United  States is to have a role on the African Continent. I was proud to lead  the effort to establish AFRICOM. Some of you don't remember this, but  AFRICOM didn't exist for a long period of time. Every other part of the  world did but not Africa. But we set that up as a separate combatant  command in 2007, and I have seen the benefits across the continent  since that time.   The presence of U.S. military across Africa means a great deal to our  friends and is a worthwhile investment for the United States. A strong  and robust relationship with the United States has helped spur economic  growth and regional stability across the continent.  [[Page S6727]]    I think it is important to talk about these things that other people  don't talk about. I have faith that my colleagues in the House and  Senate will continue the United States-African friendship long after I  have retired from the Senate.   Western Sahara. Western Sahara. Over the years, I have been very  outspoken about the situation in Western Sahara. A few years ago, I  visited the Sahrawi refugee camps. I visited the children who lived  there. They were joyous and happy and ordinary children who didn't know  yet that they were part of the frozen, forgotten conflict, where their  hopes and dreams were dying a cruel death.   I urge my colleagues to remember our ideals of democracy and extend  that to the Sahrawians. Don't let the world forget them. I urge  everyone in this body to stand strong to support Western Sahara's right  to self-determination and reject Morocco's relentless attacks on  Western Sahara.   Ethiopia. Then there is Ethiopia, a nation that is close to my heart  for many reasons. The human suffering happening there is heartbreaking.  Instead of focusing on the importance of creating lasting friendships  with the Ethiopian people, some in the U.S. Government look for ways to  punish them. Nineteen of my African visits have included Ethiopia,  where I have watched firsthand the economic transformation that  occurred.   Their middle class is growing; they have become a regional  superpower; and they are a good friend of the United States of America.  Their military is professional, capable, and they are punching above  their weight in the war against terrorism that continues to plague the  continent.   They promote regional peace and security by being one of the top  contributors to the United Nations when they are called upon.  Hopefully, we can find ways to grow this friendship, the Ethiopian  friendship.   Then there is Zegita Marie. Now, many of you already know that I have  an adopted granddaughter who was born in Ethiopia. Her name is Zegita  Marie. We call her the Z-girl. She has a very special story and has  grown up to be a very impressive star. Knowing the joys of adoption in  my own family, I have worked to ensure all families who choose to adopt  can.   In 2017, when Ethiopia decided to close intercountry adoptions, I  worked directly with my friend then-Prime Minister Hailemariam so the  families who were pending adoptions were able to complete their  adoptions to bring their children home. That was a major thing, a major  undertaking. You wouldn't think it would be. That should be natural.   Now, the Constitution. Yes, you have heard me say this line before.  There are two things we should remember here in Congress:  infrastructure and defense. That statement rang true 28 years ago when  I got to the Senate, and it will ring true in the years to come.   Infrastructure--and we have gotten a lot done together on that front  over the years. We passed bipartisan landmark infrastructure  legislation from SAFETEA-LU to MAP-21, to the FAST Act, all of which  rebuilt our Nation's crumbling infrastructure so the future generations  of Americans still have safe roads and bridges to cross.   Before 2005, Oklahoma--my State--was a donor State to the highway  trust fund. Now, what that means is we were paying more into the  highway trust fund than we were receiving out of it, and of course we  were going to change that.   SAFETEA-LU created a fair formula for apportionment so Oklahoma--I  just want to say this. I want to make sure that people in Oklahoma,  since I am bugging out of this place, realize some of the things that I  have done. I know it is controversial in some circles to say this, but  I have been one of the staunchest defenders of congressionally directed  spending also known as earmarks. And an ``earmark'' must be defined as  something that is both authorized and appropriate and should be the job  of Congress to decide how the American people--how their taxes are  spent, not unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. And that is  what we are trying to get away from when we are looking at why we  should be using earmarks.   We have worked across the party lines to ensure the National Defense  Authorization Act is signed into law every year. And as I said earlier,  the NDAA is the most important bill that we do every year and for a  good reason. This year will be the 62nd time that the NDAA has been  signed into law--62nd time.   And I am proud to have had a hand in crafting the last 28 years of  that bill. The Defense authorization bill ensures that our service men  and women have the training, equipment, and other resources they need  to defend America, here and on the road.   It also ensures that the families of the men and women who serve are  taken care of. Some elected leaders criticize our military spending,  but they need to know that our greatest expense in the military is  taking care of our troops and building schools for the young people and  how important that is. And why does it cost more for us to do that than  other countries? than communist countries? It does because we do  actually take care of our people.   With growing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and others around the  world, it is more important now than ever that our troops have what  they need to counter this aggression. Ronald Reagan used to say we  maintain the peace through our strength, and that continues to be true  today. After all of these years serving on the Senate Armed Services  Committee, I have come to know with certainty that America cannot lose  its focus on fully investing in its defense capabilities.   And I have got to say this about Oklahoma. Oklahoma has come out  pretty well. You all don't need to feel sorry for Oklahoma because I  will take care of that. They are very happy right now. Oklahoma has  five major military installations. From training pilots to building  bombs, each is unique in its mission to support our military.   Since 1988, we have gone through five BRAC rounds. That is Base  Realignment and Closure Commissions. And in each round, the Department  of Defense closed bases and military installations in accordance with  their performance. This is something we ought to be doing. And in each  round, Oklahoma and the Department of Defense grew its presence in  Oklahoma. So Oklahoma has done very well in that period of time.   I am going to tell a story here that will surprise a lot of people  because the star of the story is--none of these kids will remember,  except for reading about it--Ronald Reagan. When I was about 6 years  old, my dad was a claims adjuster in a building where Ronald Reagan was  an announcer for WHO radio, a sports announcer in Des Moines, IA--my  dad and Ronald Reagan. In fact, I thought he was--I was about 6 years  old at that time, and I thought that he was related to me. My dad and  Ronald Reagan used to play the pinball machine together. He would come  out to the house, and I always thought he was an uncle or some  relative.   When I was young, my family moved from Des Moines to Tulsa--Tulsa,  OK--but we never missed a Dutch Reagan movie, which is what my dad  called him, Dutch Reagan.   We would drive--I remember one time we went all the way down from  Tulsa to Durant, OK, and that was before turnpikes. We drove for hours  to watch a Dutch Reagan movie. Never missed one of those. It is not a  big deal, but it is to me, and I am the guy who needed it.    Fast-forward to when, as mayor of Tulsa and Ronald Reagan was  President, when President Reagan wanted someone to tout his domestic  agenda, he used me. We would appear on all the TV shows, sometimes  together, and tell the people what they needed to know and what was  happening in the administration.   I will always remember when, as mayor of Tulsa, I pushed the  construction of a low-water dam on the Arkansas River. It ended up  being one of the largest public projects in America that was totally  privately funded. It had a lot of opposition, but it is pretty amazing.  Go back and read about this, and you will see that anything Ronald  Reagan wanted, he got.   Then there is the Wiley Post flight around the world. Now, people may  not know who Wiley Post is. Everyone knows who Will Rogers is. Well,  Wiley Post and Will Rogers were both pilots. The difference is, Wiley  Post had just one eye and he was good. In fact, they were together when  they died.  [[Page S6728]]    Back in 1991, I was still in the House, and a few friends and I  created a Wiley Post 1931 flight around the world in my twin engine  Cessna aircraft. It is hard to believe that was 30 years ago when we  made that trip that left out of Oklahoma, with several stops on the  east coast, then in Europe, and then in the Soviet Union. Wiley Post  had my plane beat on the travel time. He did his in 8 days; it took me  16 days.   Looking back, I am not sure how Tom Quinn and I survived those stops  in the Soviet Union. I remember praying: Lord, you got more for me to  do. Get me out of this mess.   Fighting far-left environmentalists, it is no shock to anyone that  the Washington Post has dubbed me public enemy No. 1 for radical  environmentalists for decades now.   For much of my time in the Senate, I was chair and ranking member of  the Environment and Public Works Committee. Throughout that time, I  pushed back against the Obama administration's far-left policies  designed to upend the--sought to upend the lives of Oklahomans, like  the Paris climate agreement, the waters of the United States rule, the  Clean Power Plan, and many others. These policies were really about  giving Washington bureaucrats sweeping control over the lives of  millions of Americans. We are debating a lot of these same issues  today, and I expect these disagreements will continue into the future.   Lastly, I want to take a second to say thank you to all of my current  and former staff. They are hanging around out here now. I didn't get  much work out of them today. They were pretty busy, but my staff knows  that once they leave my office, they always have a place here. We have  become very close. We don't have people who leave; they become friends.   I lovingly call my former staff the Has-Beens. It is something of a  mark of honor. And to all of you, thank you. You are all about to be  Has-Beens.   Most importantly, to my family: I love you.   When Kay and I got married 63 years ago, I could never imagine I  would be standing here today with 20 kids and grandkids saying goodbye.   Thank you to all you guys for all you have done all these years, and  thank you for putting up with me.   To Kay, my best friend and rock, I can never put into words what you  mean to me.   Finally, I want to say to the people of Oklahoma that I really thank  you for what you have done for me all these years. Thank you very much.  I love you guys.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  intern and fellow from my office be granted floor privileges until  November 18, 2022. They are J.P. Cooper and Laura Hill.
