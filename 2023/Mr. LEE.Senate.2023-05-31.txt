 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, $32 trillion--it is a colossal sum  burdening every single American taxpayer. It is a tangible reflection  of the prodigious debt accumulated over many decades of reckless  spending.   Now, the ramifications of our bloated national debt are far-reaching,  felt in the daily lives of hard-working families crushed under the  weight of relentless inflation. The prices of everyday necessities  continue to rise, eroding purchasing power and placing an intolerable  burden on the shoulders of every American family. The staggering figure  ought to jolt us from our complacency, send shivers down our spines,  and compel us to confront the dire consequences of Congress's  longstanding recklessness when it comes to fiscal matters.   Amidst the gravity of our Nation's current predicament, we find  ourselves standing at a precipice, a pivotal moment where our choices  today will inevitably shape our economic outlook tomorrow and for years  and, in fact, decades to come. The burden of our national debt and the  relentless grip of inflation have placed us at this critical juncture,  demanding nothing less than a resolute and visionary response.   Regrettably, the lopsidedly negotiated Fiscal Responsibility Act, as  it is called, heralded by Speaker McCarthy and President Biden, fails  to provide the respite our Nation desperately needs. Rather than  offering substantive solutions to tackle the root causes of our fiscal  woes, it appears to be a palliative pill. It is a bad deal for America,  a missed opportunity to confront our challenges, an abdication of our  responsibility to protect Americans' economic security and well-being.   We can and must do better. We must abandon the complacency that has  brought us to this point and chart a new course, a course that values  something approaching fiscal sanity. We can no longer afford to settle  for half measures or short-term fixes, and we desperately need a  comprehensive and responsible plan, one that addresses the root causes  of our fiscal predicament, curtails the bloated bureaucracy, and  empowers American families once again to thrive.   It is time to go back to the drawing board. Failure to do so and to  do so right now, at this very moment, is to ignore the lessons of  history. Nations that neglect their fiscal health often face economic  calamity and social upheaval as a result. We are obligated to ourselves  and to future generations of Americans to break free from this cycle of  debt and inflation and forge a path of prosperity and sustainability.   I talk about it in terms of the cycle of inflation and debt because  the two go hand in hand. We cause inflation when we spend more than we  have and spend more than we should. That makes every dollar that  Americans earn, save, or have previously saved purchase less.   So I must express my profound disappointment over the Orwellian-named  Fiscal Responsibility Act. In harsh juxtaposition to the Limit, Save,  Grow Act, the ambitious plan by the House of Representatives, the  meager offerings of the Biden-McCarthy deal are profound.   First, House GOP leadership proclaims that the Fiscal Responsibility  Act will save $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period through the 2-year  caps deal. But, see, therein lies the deception. The supposed savings  are largely--in fact, almost entirely--illusory. The bill contains a  mandatory 2-year caps deal for discretionary spending; but, in reality,  the spending limits for the other 4 years, the out years, are  unenforceable and easily waived--in fact, easily ignored.   It is a shell game of sorts, a carefully orchestrated act to create  the false illusion of savings. But history has shown us that no caps  deal has ever been fully enforced against future appropriations. The  most recent and relevant example of this may well be Congress, in its  decision in the Budget Control Act of 2011, to impose statutory caps on  discretionary spending and then to raise those caps on four separate  occasions, in a bipartisan fashion, over the decade that followed the  adoption of those caps, completely negating the stated purpose of that  bill.   And unlike the BCA's 10-year statutory caps, all of which were, in  fact, statutory, the FRA has only 2 years, which can be maneuvered  around themselves. Just 2 years of statutory caps; that is all. You can  get around those, too. It is just a little bit harder. But after those  first 2 years, it is not even a difficult thing because these aren't  statutory caps at this point.   It is a largely symbolic and ultimately feckless gesture. Yet House  leadership wants us in the Senate to rubberstamp a mammoth increase of  $4 trillion in new debt in exchange for supposedly $1.5 trillion of  claimed deficit reduction, the vast majority--in fact, the overwhelming  share--of which will never be realized.   I am confident stating that, predicting it, right now. This is a pipe  dream, and they know it.   And what did they demand in return for raising the debt ceiling,  effectively by $4 trillion? What did they extract to ensure that this  colossal sum, once borrowed, wouldn't go unchecked? A meager $12  billion, a drop in the ocean compared to our Nation's monumental  burden. And that is a best-case scenario.   Considering that rather than raising the debt ceiling by a specific  amount--which, I think, is the right way to do this and the way that  Congress has usually done this in the past--the deal raises it; it  suspends the debt ceiling altogether through January 1, 2025. It grants  the Treasury authority to issue debt without any numerical limit to  restrain its appetite. It is a carte blanche, a blank check of sorts,  for the government to spend, to borrow more money without  accountability.   This deal begs the question: With Republicans like these, who needs  Democrats?   We deserve better. We deserve a deal that genuinely reflects the  urgency of our economic challenges and delivers meaningful results. To  grant such a colossal debt ceiling increase while settling for a mere  $12 billion in immediate savings is also an act of fiscal  irresponsibility and betrayal of the trust placed in us by those who  elected us.   Equally disheartening is the state of work requirements within the  deal. These work requirements were supposed to be part of the deal and  a  [[Page S1821]]  meaningful change in the law and supposed to help things get better,  help us not spend as much money, help people get out of poverty, help  make sure that we don't have to come back to the well just 18 months or  so from now and raise the debt ceiling yet again.   Limit, Save, Grow championed a robust approach, acknowledging the  importance of promoting self-sufficiency through work requirements. In  contrast, this swamp deal that we are actually facing offers only token  requirements, riddled with exemptions and phaseouts. It is a farce of  sorts. It is a charade that perpetuates the vicious cycle of  entitlement, leaving countless Americans trapped in the clutches of  dependency.   Limit, Save, Grow adds significant work requirements for TANF, food  stamps, and for Medicaid. This bill strips the Medicaid work  requirements altogether. With respect to TANF, arguably, it doesn't do  much at all, if anything. With respect to food stamps, according to  some figures that we are studying from CBO, it arguably costs more  money than it saves.   In matters of fiscal prudence, Limit, Save, Grow stood firm in its  determination to repeal the Democrats' $1.2 trillion Inflation  Reduction Act. Talk about Orwellian names, that is one for you. Yet in  its lamentable capitulation, the McCarthy-Biden deal preserves every  cent of the Inflation Reduction Act, leaving our Nation mired in a  quagmire of unsustainable and expensive policies that have done  anything but reduce inflation.   In fact, when you go throwing around trillion-dollar increments that  you don't have, that is what it does cost. It is more inflation, and  that is, indeed, what it has caused.   Now, the consequences of this surrender in this bill are grave. If  enacted, this bill would grant President Biden everything without  meaningful safeguards or provisions to address the pressing issues.   While it may be hailed as some sort of triumph of bipartisanship, the  American people will ultimately bear the brunt of its shortcomings. You  see, not everything that is bipartisan is, in fact, in the interest of  the American people.   Bipartisanship and compromise are an inevitability in anything that  moves through the U.S. Congress. Some work for the benefit of the  American people, but when a small handful of Members of Congress get  together and decide what will be easiest for them, what will work best  for them, what will make them look the best, without due regard to how  it will impact the American people, that is not compromise. That is  better described as collusion.   Look, it is the American people who will bear the brunt of this bill  with the implementation of President Biden's half-trillion-dollar  student loan plan--a plan which now stands as a testament to President  Biden's misplaced priorities, a millstone around the neck of hard- working individuals who will never benefit from such largesse.   It is a stark reminder that, while the government claims to champion  the cause of equality and opportunity, it is very often the very  policies it enacts that perpetuate inequality and hinder genuine  progress. The hard-working veterans, the diligent plumbers, and  countless others are made to shoulder the weight of others' degrees-- often, degrees of people who now earn a whole lot of money--while  relegating their own aspirations and dreams to the sidelines. It is a  profound injustice when we shift the burden of personal choices and  individual responsibilities onto those who have already toiled and  sacrificed.   That is what we are voting for with this bill. We are saying that it  is OK to force those who labor in essential trades to bear the  financial burden of others' educational pursuits.   This is a patently unfair and boldfaced patronage racket. And, like  all good rackets, you need your strong-armed collector, and this  administration found theirs in the IRS.   The egregious expansion of the IRS is epitomized by the Democrats'  allocation of $80 billion to this bloated Agency with a demonstrated  history of unethical targeting of conservative nonprofits, among  others.   The compromise reached between Biden and McCarthy, which retains 98  percent of the IRS expansion--98 percent--is nothing short of a  surrender, an anticipatory capitulation of sorts. It is a thing that is  going to cause more problems.   And so armed with a hefty budget and a woke agenda, the IRS will  become an even stronger instrument of political bias and partisan  manipulation. The merging of ideology and bureaucracy poses a grave  threat to the fabric of our Republic, eroding the trust and confidence  that should underpin our tax system.    It might be true that this bill attempts to claw back some of the  unspent COVID funds and the CDC global health funding. But while they  point to rescinding roughly $28 billion in unspent COVID funds, we must  acknowledge that much of that will merely offset spending increases  elsewhere. This deal falls woefully short, failing to seize this  opportunity to maximize the potential of these unutilized resources.   Perhaps the cherry on top of this deal from hell is the glaring  omission of an essential regulatory reform measure, called the REINS  Act. The REINS Act is a proposal. It is an acronym. It stands for  Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny. Limit, Save, Grow,  the debt ceiling bill passed by the House about a month ago,  incorporated the REINS Act, which seeks to ensure that every major  regulation put forth by a Federal Agency has to pass through  congressional scrutiny. It has to be affirmatively enacted by Congress.   This is already required by the Constitution. The very first  operative provision of the Constitution--the first clause, the first  section of the first article--says: ``All legislative powers herein  granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall  consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''   Legislative powers or the power to make law--article I, section 7  makes it clear that this is the only path to do it. Article I, section  7 reiterates and builds upon the legislative powers clause of article  I, section 1 by saying that, in order to pass a law--a Federal law--any  Federal law must become law only after it has been passed by the House  and the Senate and presented to the President for signature, veto, or  acquiescence. You cannot make a Federal law otherwise.   Executive branch Agencies have been getting around this for a long  time with the assistance, sadly, of Congress. Congress has delegated,  increasingly, lawmaking power to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats-- people who don't work for the American people, who can't be fired by  them. This is a big problem.   Now, look, Limit, Save, Grow incorporated the REINS Act, and that  would have done a lot of good by subjecting this lawmaking power to  elected lawmakers to give them--us, the people elected to make laws-- the final say.   We were finally going to close that loop and say that Agencies can  write laws that would be considered proposed bills--bill proposals-- within Congress, but only Congress can enact them.   They are laws--laws made by the unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats  who have no constitutional lawmaking authority--that would not, under  the REINS Act, be self-executing. Congress would have to be the  lawmaker, as the Constitution already makes clear.   The REINS Act really is about so much more than regulatory reform. It  is about accountability to the public, the same kind of accountability  that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers when they wrote article I,  section 1 and article I, section 7. It is about the republican form of  government as a whole. It is about representative government, about  people through the democratic process being able to elect those who  will create laws to which they will become subject. It is about the  American people being put adequately on notice as to what their legal  responsibilities and obligations are.   James Madison, in Federalist 62, spoke somewhat presciently when he  wrote:         It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are       made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous       that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot       be understood: if they be repealed or revised before they are       promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes, that no man       who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be       tomorrow.    We are now suffering through a circumstance where not only are our  laws  [[Page S1822]]  so voluminous, complex, and ever-changing that we can't read them and  understand what they require of us, but they weren't even written by  men and women of our own choosing. This is wrong. This is as big of a  miscarriage of justice as exists in this country. This is unreviewable  legislative discretion of the sort that has historically been reserved  for despots and tyrants.   Despotism and tyranny to this degree, in this unique way, exist in  America today in our executive branch Agencies. Limit, Save, Grow was  going to address this through the REINS Act. But, sadly, that provision  was removed from this measure.   Now, the sudden excuse for this glaring exclusion--something that was  really important to Republicans and should be really important to  Republicans and Democrats and everyone else--is that the deal imposes  an administrative pay-as-you-go provision, or pay-go, as it is known.  However, this is easily waived. It is bereft of any significant  congressional role in the regulatory process.   Let's not be naive to the realities of implementation. This process  will be artfully manipulated in the hands of the Biden-appointed  Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   The bureaucrats--the masters of their bureaucratic chicanery--will  exploit every nook and cranny of the legislation, every nook and cranny  that generates fake direct savings. The noble intentions behind this  provision will be buried beneath a mountain of smoke and mirrors.   So when you read section 263 of the Biden-McCarthy deal, you will see  this regulatory pay-go measure. But if you keep reading and you get to  section 265, you see that section 265 destroys it. It takes it away. It  effectively nullifies it. A restriction on a government actor that is  then in a subsequent section, 265, given the power to exempt herself  from that restriction is nothing at all. See, within the fine print of  that loophole, in section 265, is language that renders the entire  endeavor of regulatory pay-as-you-go completely toothless. The OMB  Director possesses complete waiver authority. If she deems it  ``necessary for program delivery,'' then she can circumvent the  provisions that purport to rein in the excesses of the bureaucratic  machinery--section 263. This is akin to placing the fox in charge of  the henhouse and then granting the fox discretion to determine when the  rules apply and when they can be conveniently cast aside. If the fox  wants to consume the hen, the fox will, if the fox deems it necessary  and appropriate.    Don't believe me?   Well, it didn't take long yesterday for the OMB Director to say the  quiet part out loud. When asked about the PAYGO waiver authority  included in the Biden-McCarthy deal, OMB Director Shalanda Young said:         If that waiver is deemed necessary to make sure President       Biden's agenda is carried forward, we're going to use that       authority.    Translation. This means one thing: The regulatory PAYGO measure means  nothing. It is worth no more than the paper it is printed on. Less than  that, in fact. Nothing. It does nothing.   So if you are tempted to vote for this, perhaps taking some comfort  in the idea that this is going to rein in regulatory excesses, please  look elsewhere for comfort. It does not exist here.   What irks me is not just that the REINS Act measure was removed--that  is plenty irksome in and of itself. It shouldn't have been removed. We  should have insisted it be in there. If some objected to it, we should  have at least insisted it be in there as long as this debt ceiling  issuance Mardi Gras remains in effect. It should be there. If you are  going to take that out and replace it with the regulatory PAYGO  measure, don't claim that it is real when, in fact, it is fake.   This is appalling. With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?   Look, they are not even pretending to negotiate in good faith. In  fact, while Republicans claim that this is a big victory for  Republicans, meanwhile, the Democrats are doing everything they can to  hide their excitement over this deal. Representative Jamaal Bowman, a  Democrat from New York, Member of the House of Representatives who is  listed as undecided, said President Biden ``kicked McCarthy's butt.''  Fair point; he did.   Madam President, in contemplating the magnitude--the sheer weight,  volume, mass of our national debt, a colossal sum of $32 trillion--$32  trillion that will soon escalate to $36 trillion under this awful  deal--one cannot help but be seized by a sense of awful foreboding.  This staggering figure should serve as a haunting reminder of the  consequences of our profligate ways, a testament to the grave  irresponsibility that has permeated our political landscape for decades  far too long.   Instead of confronting this existential threat head-on, this deal is  racked with complacency and false, cowardly compromise--placating the  disconnected without addressing the root of the problem. It is the  child of uncertainty, born out of cowardly fear of confrontation and  lack of conviction; and it represents the victory of expediency over  integrity. I cannot support it, and I will emphatically vote no absent  material changes that will render this bill something other than what  it is--a fake response to burdensome debt.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let's talk  about a few things.   First of all, we have heard talk of clear legal authority, clear  legal precedent.   I wasn't here when the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island was  providing that, but my understanding of it is that he is making the  claim that there are judicial precedents for this. At least one of the  cases he cited was from 1981. Significantly, that is a full 3 years  before 10 U.S.C. section 1093 was even enacted into law. Talk about  excruciating ironies. That was enacted into law as part of the Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1985, and it was voted on by, among  others, then-Senator Joe Biden. He voted for it.   So whatever 1981 case you are citing I don't know, but I am certain  that it couldn't have involved 10 U.S.C. section 1093, the very statute  that we are dealing with here, because it did not yet exist.   I am equally certain that whatever personnel within the Department of  Justice that blessed this, whatever lawyers within the Department of  Defense that blessed this are also part of the Biden administration and  are ultimately serving at the pleasure of the President. So I wouldn't  expect that they would come back with an answer that he didn't want  because he and his administration have made clear that this is an all- of-government approach to make sure that the more abortions, the  better, in the wake of Dobbs.   So I find it impossible to believe that any court could have  addressed this particular issue, setting aside whether that 1981  judicial precedent that he cited that I haven't seen is the only one.  Let's assume there were others. If there were others--there couldn't  have been others even if they were decided after this was enacted into  law in 1984 as part of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1985 because this policy didn't exist. No, this policy didn't exist  until just a couple of months ago. So it couldn't have come up.   Courts don't answer these questions in the abstract. Under article  III of the Constitution, the courts are empowered only to resolve cases  in controversy. The case in controversy requirement of article III  means that you have to have standing. To have standing, you have to  have an injury, in fact, fairly traceable to the conduct of the  defendant that is subject to being remedied by competent authority of a  court. That would have been lacking here because until just a couple of  months ago, this did not exist. They could not have addressed this. So  I am not sure what authorities the Department of Justice officials to  whom my colleagues are referring were relying on, but it is not a ripe  controversy that could have been capably adjudicated.   But, yeah, this is truly full of excruciating ironies--the fact that  the same President who voted to support 10 U.S.C. section 1093 which  unmistakably makes clear that we don't want Department of Defense  funding going to perform abortions. No, they rely on this argument that  is reminiscent of Pinocchio in the movie Shrek 3. I think it was  technically called ``Shrek the Third.'' Pinocchio, in that movie, gets  [[Page S1831]]  away with all kinds of things by speaking in a form of legalese that  would make any lawyer blush. It wouldn't be entirely untrue if I didn't  say that I weren't entirely not opposed to this nonpolicy. It confuses  people. That is sort of what they are doing here.   Now, look, if you want to make the argument that this is legal, first  of all, I don't agree with it. This violates at least the spirit, if  not also the letter, of the law. And even to the extent that it is  somehow compliant with the letter of the law on a point that I am not  willing to concede because this is, in fact, funding the process of  getting abortions; this is, in fact, funding the endeavor of an  abortion--something that we go out of our way in American law to do.  This is one of the things that unite Americans of different political  backgrounds, of different party affiliations.   Regardless of how you feel about abortion and under what  circumstances it should or shouldn't be legal, Americans are  overwhelmingly united behind the concept that we shouldn't use U.S.  taxpayer dollars, thus forcing the American people at the point of a  gun--because, ultimately, when you pay your taxes, you are paying at  the point of a gun because, if you don't pay your taxes, people with  guns are going to show up and make you pay. We don't force people, with  the point of a gun, to fund abortions because we fundamentally  recognize that is wrong regardless of how any individual feels about  abortions themselves.   But this comparison is too cute by half. The very best I can say it  is to analogize it this way: You really want to park in that handicap  spot that is reserved for persons with disabilities and you are annoyed  that it is there, so you park right up next to it, thus rendering it  unusable space within the actual handicap spot. That is the best I can  analogize this to.   To whatever extent you are complying with the letter of the law--and  I don't concede that you are because I don't think you are--you are  still really messing with the underlying purpose of the bill.   As to the point made moments ago by my colleague from Massachusetts-- a distinguished lawyer, a Harvard law professor herself--that this  somehow is lawful because Department of Justice lawyers said it is  lawful, this is the same Department of Justice that has from time to  time made mistakes, and I am understating that quite significantly  here. This is, in any event, a clear affront to the men and women who  elected each of us.   These laws are policy changes. Yes, they saw the need for a policy  change in 1984 when they adopted the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 1985. They understood that to put that in place, they  couldn't just rely on Department of Defense policy; they needed to put  it in statute. So they enacted a statute to do that. This flies in the  face of that. You are actively promoting, encouraging, and facilitating  the performance of abortions.   Make no mistake, don't think of this as an evenhanded approach, one  that aims broadly to facilitate reproductive care. No. The American  people are not stupid. They cannot be fooled. We certainly must not be  here. This is about Dobbs. This is about their disagreement, their  fundamental rejection of Dobbs. This is about their fundamental  disagreement and rejection of the notion that the U.S. Constitution  doesn't give this authority over abortion to unelected judges who sit  across the street in the Supreme Court of the United States. And it was  never a constitutional principle to begin with. The Constitution  doesn't address it. They disagree with that. I get it. But it is their  disagreement about this that prompted this policy. They have been  unmistakably clear about that.    Look, at the end of the day, this is a policy change. Policy changes  need to be made by Congress--policy changes that involve a departure  from the policy established in statute in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1985, which remains legally binding  and in effect to this very moment. If they want to get that changed, it  is not incumbent upon those who oppose this policy to get the statute  changed; it is those who want this policy to go into effect.   So I return to my long-used refrain. If Secretary Austin wants to  make policy, he should run for the Senate. He can't set this kind of  policy from the E-ring of the Pentagon. It is wrong.   As to the points about military readiness, look, I don't think there  is anyone more concerned about military readiness than my colleague  from Alabama. He sits on the Armed Services Committee. He is a faithful  member of that committee. He performs his oversight responsibilities  very faithfully, very conscientiously. Nobody is more concerned about  military readiness than Senator Tommy Tuberville--no one. But to  whatever extent this impinges upon military readiness--the fact that he  has concerns with this and is therefore raising objections--that door  swings both ways. If anything, it cuts stronger in the opposite  direction. To the extent this is interfering with military readiness,  we should set down this policy right now and allow Congress to decide  this in connection with the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2024, which we will be turning to in the coming weeks and  months. Let's let Congress decide that. In the meantime, set aside this  policy--this policy that is a departure, a clear violation of at least  the spirit if not also the letter of the law--and let that be decided.  If, in fact, this interferes with military readiness, let's put this  down and not allow American national security to be impaired by that.   Now, I don't believe we are in that position. I believe that while it  is ideal for us to be able to move these nominees forward and get them  moved, it is also very legitimate for a U.S. Senator to identify a  problem, a simple problem arising out of the fact that the Department  of Defense has a couple of things it wants to get done. It wants to get  these people confirmed so that they can be promoted, and it also wants  to put in place a policy. It wants to do both at the same time.   Senator Tuberville won't--in fact, Senator Tuberville can't  physically--under the rules of the U.S. Senate, he cannot, he is  physically unable to stop them from confirming these people. There are  ways of going about it; it is just time-consuming to do it without his  assent. So they want a shortcut, and they are asking for him to do them  a favor--a favor that is unreciprocated--not just unreciprocated but a  favor that he warned them he would not give them if they took this  unfortunate step. He did that, I think, back in December. So knowing  that as they did, they incurred this risk, to whatever degree.   They are right that this impacts military readiness at the expense of  American national security. This is on him. He knew it would have this  effect, and now he wants to force Senator Tuberville, shame him--to  shame him into doing him a favor by expediting this process so that the  Senate won't have to go through the additional steps that the Senate  will have to go through in order to get these people confirmed without  Senator Tuberville relinquishing it.   That is a shameful strategy on the Secretary of Defense, and he  should be ashamed of the fact that he has become a policymaker. You  can't legislate from the E-ring of the Pentagon. He has no business  doing that here. He is thwarting, he is desecrating, he is  disrespecting this institution and the sacred laws of our country-- passed with really good reasons--in order for him to promote his own  woke policy agenda. Shame on him for doing that.   I object, Mr. President.    Madam President, I want to be very clear about a couple  things. No.  [[Page S1836]]  1, this is the law. It is not called the Hyde amendment. There is a  thing called the Hyde amendment that applies elsewhere outside the  military. The military, the Pentagon, has its own statutory provision.  It is not the Hyde amendment; it is 10 U.S.C. section 1093, adopted in  1984 as part of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1985. It  has been the law ever since then.   You can't use Pentagon money for this purpose, nor can you use  Pentagon facilities for this purpose. Saying that you are not doing  that even though you are paying people, you are giving them 3 weeks of  paid leave time and paying all their travel expenses and their per diem  in order to do this--that is openly flouting the spirit of the law, if  not also the letter, in order to circumvent it.   I will go back to the analogy I used earlier. You go up to a parking  space, thinking you want to park there, but it is a handicap space. It  is reserved for people with disabilities. You don't have the disability  symbol on your car, so you park next to it, but you deliberately park  so close to the line that you render that spot unusable for anyone with  disabilities who should need access to it. It still has the same effect  because you are openly flouting the law. You are doing it in a  deliberate attempt to cause the very same harms that particular law was  designed to prevent.   Now, this is a policy choice, and it is a policy choice that Congress  deliberately took away from the Department of Defense, deliberately  took out of the hands of the Secretary of Defense. He seized that back.   Senator Tuberville saw this coming. Back in December, he told  Secretary Austin in no uncertain terms: You should not do this. This is  in violation of the law, and if you do this, there will be problems. I  will no longer cooperate with you if you try to seek unanimous consent  to facilitate the confirmation of these flag officer promotions.   He made that really clear.   Secretary Austin made his choice the moment he decided to legislate  from the E-ring of the Pentagon. He took on that risk, and now he has  the audacity, through surrogates in the Senate, to come back to Senator  Tuberville and say: I got what I wanted. I did so in violation of the  law. I am openly flouting the law--its spirit if not also the letter-- and I also want you to cooperate with me, Senator Tuberville. I want  you to do what I say because that is more convenient for me.   That is not fair. That is not lawful. It is not legal. It is not  kosher. It is not cool.   Look, the fact is, we could end this right now. I would love to end  it right now. I can't speak for Senator Tuberville, but I have a  sneaking suspicion he would let these go right now. He would let you  get every one of these men and women confirmed this very moment if you  take this thing off the table. But Secretary Austin took this hostage.  He took all of these men and women hostage the moment he did this,  having been forewarned by Senator Tuberville. He can't now be heard to  come back--having waived his right to do that--to come back and demand  that Senator Tuberville be somehow shamed into cooperating, into  facilitating.   The other point here is, they can still get these people confirmed  even without that compromise, which you could make tonight. If you put  this thing off the table, you stop trying to achieve this through  extortion, he will let them go right now. I am 99.99 percent sure of  that, and that is pretty confident from me. He will do that right now.  But even if you are not willing to do that, you could still get these  people confirmed. You just don't want to do the hard work of doing it.  It takes more time to do it without Senator Tuberville's full  cooperation.   So, look, if you really are serious about end-strength readiness,  then that is what you would do. That is what someone would do if they  were worried about end-strength readiness.   Let's talk about that for a moment. End-strength readiness shouldn't  be confused with flag officer promotions. It is not where we see end- strength readiness, with flag officer promotions. It doesn't mean these  men and women aren't deserving of their promotions or we wouldn't be  willing and interested to see them confirmed so that they can have  their promotions. But to say that it affects end-strength readiness  disregards what flag officers are doing in the capacity they hold. I am  not aware of any reason why that would affect our end-strength  readiness, nor am I aware of any compelling reason why, without this  policy--this policy that openly flouts the law--our military would  suffer from an end-strength readiness problem. It is an absurd  argument. In any event, it violates the law. They can't do this. It is  the wrong branch of government. He doesn't have this power. He was  forewarned, and he did the wrong thing anyway. We don't reward bad  behavior that way. We certainly don't reward unlawful behavior.     With great respect for my friend and colleague from  Massachusetts, the Pentagon itself acknowledged that while military  abortions had been counted at maybe 20 or 30 per year in the past, this  policy, which funds abortion--it just does--has increased to about  4,400 to maybe 4,500 a year. The causation and the number were  estimated by the Pentagon itself based on this subsidy. This is a  subsidy for abortion. They are, in fact, subsidizing abortion. The fact  that they have engineered in a way that they think gets them around the  technicalities of the law should mean very little to us as  policymakers, as lawmakers, to the fact that they are openly flouting  the law.   They are going through this trickery only because they don't like the  law. They hate the fact that this became law, so they are trying to  find a way to get around it.   They are, in fact, funding abortions. That is what you do when you  pay somebody to travel, when you give them 3 weeks of paid leave to do  something, when you fund their per diem--so you cover everything for  them--you are funding abortion.  [[Page S1837]]    If the only argument you are left with is ``we are not paying for the  actual surgery itself; we are just paying for everything around it,''  when the value attached to the travel, to the per diem, to the paid  leave time is a significant expense--an expense that I suspect in many,  if not most, instances would well outpace the cost of the medical  procedure itself--that's too cute by half. They are, in fact, funding  abortion. That is what this does. It is done knowing, expecting,  anticipating, and desiring that this would increase the number of  abortions performed in the military every year to a significant degree.  That is what they are doing, and it is wrong.
