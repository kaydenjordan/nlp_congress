 Madam Speaker, these CRs, these fits and starts of  prioritizing the Nation's resources and allocating these resources so  we can run the people's government, are inefficient at best, they are  dysfunctional, it is disgraceful, it is pervasive, and it is a  structural issue that both Republicans and Democrats have to solve  ultimately. I am trying to be fair about this, because I have seen this  happen when Republicans have been in charge, in all fairness.   I think the difference this time in the life of our country is that  my Democrat colleagues have been distracted while trying to pass a  massive tax-and-spend bill. It is the largest expansion of government  and the largest tax hike. It is the biggest transfer of wealth. It is a  lot of things, and they ain't good.   Meanwhile, we are just totally punting on managing our budget. Three  years in a row, my colleagues have not put forth a budget.   What I would like to see us do, to fix this for both sides, is to  consider when we are talking about CRs and the debt ceiling and we are  putting on display for the entire world how dysfunctional we are with  respect to budget and appropriations, is that we would actually put  forward bipartisan reforms like enforceable spending caps. Those are  gone after this year. How about paygos and CutGos that are actually  enforceable so that we force Congress to do what everyone else in the  country does, which is live within their means.   There is a whole list here. Debt targets; no budget, no recess. How  about we stay here and celebrate Christmas together and the holidays  until we get a dadgum budget passed?   There are lots of bipartisan measures that I implore my colleagues to  talk to their leadership about while I am talking to mine, so we can do  something about it and not just keep this dysfunction going infinitum.
