 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Equality Act.   As the proud sister of a trans brother and a gender-nonconforming  sibling and the proud representative of Hillcrest, the heart of San  Diego's LGBTQ-plus community, this bill is deeply personal.   The protections in the Equality Act will be life-changing for so many  of my constituents.   Mr. Speaker, the first version of this bill was filed in 1974, 15  years before I was even born. It had one cosponsor and never got a  vote. But this week, I am proud to say we are going to pass the  Equality Act, cosponsored by the entire Democratic Caucus.   This was made possible by all those who marched and protested and  raised their voices, like San Diego's own Larry Baza. Last week, we  lost Larry to COVID, and today would have been his 77th birthday. Larry  demanded justice and equality and dignity for all. I urge my colleagues  to support the Equality Act.                            ____________________
