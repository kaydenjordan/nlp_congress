 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4176. This horrifying bill  would require all Federal agencies that collect demographic data to ask  Americans about their sexual orientation or gender identity; and that  goes all the way to including the Census, ultimately, affecting every  American.   I realize the majority party will claim that you don't have to fill  out this form. But we all know, as a practical matter, almost all  people presented with a form will fill out the whole thing. There are  very people who have the gumption or whatever to say,  [[Page H5859]]  I refuse to fill out such and such a question.   Now, honestly, this bill affects adults. And I am old enough to  remember when the gay rights movement was supposed to be about, we are  not going to poke around and see what people are doing in the bedroom.  Now we are kind of going in the opposite direction. We are going to  require everybody to talk about their sexual orientation which, by  itself, is a little bit offensive.    But I am also going to focus more on the fact that this bill  requires--doesn't require but asks for responses from people under 18  years of age, which is just almost beyond belief.   If a parent gets randomly selected to fill out the National Survey on  Children's Health, Democrats want the Federal Government to ask parents  to disclose if their 3-year-old son is attracted to boys or girls. That  is why we should call this, steal our children's childhood act.   When public schools report data to the U.S. Department of Education's  Civil Rights Data Collection, schools will ask kindergartners through  12th graders what their sexual orientation is or which gender they  think they are.   What exactly are you supposed to respond if you are an 8-year-old  child?   What are they supposed to do with this question?   Johnny, here we have a question for you. And what is he going to say?  I am gay because my favorite cartoon character is gay. I'm trans  because I like my mother's dress.   I don't know what they are supposed to do with this question, and I  think it is absurd that we would ever expect anybody to ask these  questions of a little child. But clearly, that is what the majority  party wants.   And we hear about today like people you couldn't tell what they are  when they are 6 years old or 5 years old. I mean, really beyond belief.   And like I said, our corrupt popular culture today, we are told  people are identifying as something or other when they are 7 or 8 years  old.   So in any event, I think it is obvious to vote ``no'' on this bill. I  don't know how, as a country, we got to a place where we are asking 7-  or 8-year-olds to declare a sexual preference, but that is where we are  today; and the majority party thinks it makes perfect sense.   The Democrats must know this is wrong.    I guess we can about wrap this up.   I want the American public, though, to stop and think where we are  today. We are going to pass a bill in which 7- or 8- or 9-year-olds are  supposed to declare a sexual preference.   I will close by saying, the clergy of this country should ponder how  we got this far and what they want to do about it.    Mr. Speaker, not a lot has been said about the conflict  in Ukraine right now, but it doesn't mean we should take our eye off  the ball. There is a division, I think, on elected officials between  two groups, and it is important for the press to identify which one of  these two groups has the upper hand, not only in Congress but in the  Biden administration.   Some people feel that it would be good to wrap up this war, including  me. Ukraine has the second-lowest birth rate of any sizeable country in  the world, and the population of Ukraine has sunk about 5 percent in  the last few years. Russia also has a low birth rate and is having a  lot of people leave their country. So we have two countries that should  be primarily concerned about keeping the few young people they have  alive rather than engaged in a war. For that reason, I would like to  believe that if an off-ramp is provided for Mr. Putin then we could end  the war before we have more people dying.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the press corps to weigh in a little  bit and find out where the Biden administration stands on this.                            ____________________
