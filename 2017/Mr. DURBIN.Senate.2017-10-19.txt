The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today in support of  the budget resolution for one reason. It is because it provides the  Senate a path forward on tax reform. I strongly support this effort to  fix America's burdensome tax system. It is my hope that reform will  lead to simplifying the Tax Code, strengthening the middle class, and  ultimately boosting our economy.   Unfortunately, I cannot offer my support without reservation, so I  have come to the floor today to explain my concerns and remind my  colleagues of the important work ahead of us. Even as we support this  resolution as a means to achieve meaningful tax reform, we must  acknowledge the fact that the underlying budget contains an  insufficient level of funding for national defense. As chairman of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, my highest priority is to ensure that  our men and women serving in uniform have the training, equipment, and  resources they need to keep our Nation safe.   The Senate budget resolution will set fiscal year 2018 defense  spending at the levels dictated by the Budget Control Act cap. This  budget is $54 billion less than the President's request and $86 billion  less than this body authorized just last month in the National Defense  Authorization Act. We passed the National Defense Authorization Act by  a vote of 89 to 9, a demonstration of the overwhelming bipartisan  belief that the Budget Control Act level of defense spending is  inadequate and unacceptable.   Let be me clear. There is no BCA-level defense budget that would be  sufficient to provide our military with what they need to fulfill  current missions and prepare for future threats.   For those of us who have been paying attention, we heard the warnings  of the steady decline of our military. Time and again our senior  military and civilian defense leaders have sounded the alarm about the  dangers of the Budget  [[Page S6613]]  Control Act spending caps. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  our highest uniformed military officer, General Dunford, has warned  that if we continue on the current path, he assesses that ``within 5  years, we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we  defend the homeland, and advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance  commitments.''   Make no mistake about what that means. America's military advantage  is degrading. Without the ability to project power, the United States  will no longer be a global power. That means that we put at risk not  only our ability to secure our interests and protect our Nation but  also the unprecedented era of security and prosperity that American  global leadership has provided the world.   I might add for the benefit of my colleagues that former President  George W. Bush today gave a very strong statement emphasizing this  problem and the challenge we face. This is the strategic reality we are  facing in the next 5 years. It should not be a surprise. We have seen  the steady degradation of the military. The strain of constant  operational tempo, combined with inadequate and unstable funding has,  over the past 16 years, worn down the greatest military in the world.   Just this week, Secretary of Defense Mattis sent a letter to the  Armed Services Committee expressing his concerns with regard to the  National Defense Authorization Act that we are currently negotiating  with the House. The very first thing he said before addressing any of  the policy changes and reforms in the bill is that his primary concern  is the Budget Control Act, and we know why--because the defense  spending caps are doing such immense harms to our military. Secretary  Mattis wrote:         As I have testified before your committee, no enemy has       done more to harm the warfighting readiness of our military       than sequestration.    I will repeat that for the benefit of my colleagues.         . . . no enemy has done more to harm the warfighting       readiness of our military than sequestration. Current caps       continue to unnecessarily defer critical maintenance, limit       aviation availability, delay modernization, and strain our       men and women in uniform.    We have seen the evidence of this harm. Over the last few months  there have been a rash of training accidents, collisions, and crashes.  We are seeing the tragic accidents in the news far too often.   Seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a  containership off the coast of Japan.   A Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board.   An Osprey helicopter crashed off the coast of Australia and that  resulted in the deaths of three marines.   An Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five  soldiers presumed dead.   Ten sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near  Singapore.   An Army Black Hawk helicopter went down during a training mission off  the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died.   One soldier died during helicopter training at Fort Hood.   An amphibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15  Americans.   A demolition accident in Fort Bragg killed one soldier and injured  seven others.   Two Navy pilots died in a T-45 crash in Tennessee.   My friends, we are now losing more of our men and women in uniform in  totally avoidable training accidents than we are in combat. There is  plenty of blame to go around for all of these incidents, but we cannot  ignore the fact that Congress's inability to provide adequate, stable,  and predictable budgeting has contributed to the troubling state of  affairs. While increased funding is not the only answer, there is no  scenario where our military can get healthy and ready to meet the  challenges of an increasingly unstable world without additional  resources. There is broad, bipartisan agreement about that from Members  of the House of Representatives, here in the Senate, and the President.  Yet we are about to vote for a budget resolution that severely  underfunds the military because the reality is that we all know that it  would not impact the actual appropriations. To solve these problems and  to fulfill our duty to the men and women in uniform we must negotiate a  bipartisan budget agreement that will lift the caps on defense  spending. Only then can we rebuild the military, reverse the disturbing  readiness crisis, and retain our ability to project power and secure  our interests around the world.   I remind my colleagues that the fiscal year started 3 weeks ago and  that the Defense Department is currently operating under a continuing  resolution. We know the harmful effects it will have on the military.  That is why getting to work on a budget deal is so urgent. We must  delay no longer.   The budget resolution is not meant to provide that broader budget  agreement. This budget resolution is simply a means to get us to tax  reform. However, this budget resolution does represent something  extremely troubling. The Republican Party used to be unified in its  support for a strong national defense. If our leaders in Congress and  the White House don't immediately get to work negotiating a deal to  lift the defense caps and fund the military at a higher level than in  this budget resolution, I am not sure we will be able to claim that  mantle any longer.   I just want to sum up by saying that we have a problem in the  military today, and that is, whenever there are cuts in defense  spending, the first thing that goes are the easy ones--the training,  readiness, the spare parts, the flying hours. Those are the ones that  get cut first because they are the easiest. Cutting a major weapons  system or program is extremely difficult.   So now we have this list, as I just read off, of men and women  serving in the military and we are responsible, at least partially, for  their death and injury. Why? Because they are not able to be trained.  They are not able to be equipped. They are not able to be maintained,  and 60 percent of the F-18s are not able to fly. We have sailors and  airmen who are working 100-hour workweeks. We have gigantic problems  with the ability to simply operate.   Meanwhile, our adversaries are stepping up their capabilities.  Obviously, every time we turn around there is another crisis of some  kind. Look at the world 8 years ago and look at the world today. You  will find an incredible deterioration of America's position and  influence in the world. The front page of the Economist magazine this  week has a picture of the dictator of China and the title is ``The  world's most powerful man,'' and it is true.   So here we are with a budget resolution that basically has cut our  military--that is basically not funding what we need. My friends, I do  not mean to get emotional, but why should we send these young men and  women in uniform in harm's way without all they need in order to fight  and defend this Nation? Right now, they are not ready. Right now, their  planes can't fly. Right now, they are not able to operate and train.  They are not ready, and that is not just McCain's word. That is our  military leaders' words and those of some of the most respected people  in America and in the world. General Mattis, General McMaster, and  General Kelly will all tell you the same thing.   We are sending our young men and women into hazardous situations  without their being completely equipped and capable of defending  themselves. That is wrong. What greater responsibility do we have than  to the men and women who are serving us in uniform today? Four just  died in Niger. How many of the 100 Members of this body knew that we  even had an operation in Niger? I will not go into the details, in  deference to the family, but this is wrong, what we are doing. We saw  it in the 1970s, and now we are seeing it again. It was Mark Twain who  said: ``History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.'' It is  beginning to rhyme, and if we don't, with this resolution that we are  going through, increase our spending to the level as authorized by the  National Defense Authorization Act, then we will bear some  responsibility for what happens.

Amendment No. 1298    The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally  divided, prior to a vote in relation to Paul amendment No. 1298.   The Senator from Kentucky.    Mr. President, Wade Nelson was a friend who began his  professional life as a journalist and served at many levels in public  service.   He was regarded as an honest professional in all of his life's work,  a father and husband truly dedicated to his family, and a joy to count  as a friend.   His colleague and friend, Bob Secter, wrote a remembrance, which I  include with this statement. It was given to those of us in attendance  at Wade's memorial service at the Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL, on  October 7, 2017. The speakers at the service included his wife, Ellen  Warren, a respected journalist in her own right, and his sons, Ted and  Emmett. They each shared touching stories of Wade as a husband and  father. Rick Kogan emceed the celebration with his own signature style  and Wade's friends Bern Colleran, Terry Kelleher, Hanke Gratteau, and  musician Jon Webber each added great memories to the service.   As Bob Secter wrote:         Back in the rambunctious days of Chicago newspapers, Wade       Nelson worked for the legendary columnist Mike Royko who sent       his ``legman'' to check out a tip that Cook County judges       were issued cushier toilet paper than that stocked in public       restrooms.        The easy part for Nelson was grabbing samples from public       toilets in the Loop courthouse, now known as the Daley       Center. Obtaining tissue from a judge's inner sanctum was       trickier.        So, Nelson made up a pretense to interview Chief Judge John       Boyle, then excused himself mid-talk to use the toilet       attached to the judge's chambers. He emerged to confront the       startled judge with the incriminating evidence, and a great       column was born.        Charmin-gate was hardly the highlight of Nelson's days as a       reporter. Yet it demonstrated the resourcefulness, spunk, and       droll whimsy that propelled him on a rich career path       involving being press secretary for the late U.S. Senator       Alan Dixon of Illinois, communications director for the       federal military base closure commission, political       consultant, and chief speech writer for former Chicago Mayor       Richard M. Daley.        That resume hardly defines the sum of Nelson, however.       Friends remember him as someone with boundless curiosity and       a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about interests as varied       as Midwestern architecture, jazz, the Cubs, anything Chicago       related, the minutia of the small Southern Michigan town of       Sturgis where his ancestors were early settlers in the 1800s,       and the secret to the perfect martini.        Edward Wade Nelson Jr. grew up in west suburban River       Forest, attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park and the       University of Missouri where he graduated with a degree in       journalism.        As a young adult and beyond, his greatest devotion was       reserved for performers at Chicago's varied night club,       cabaret and piano bar scene where men and women who played       and sang there came to embrace Nelson as an honored guest and       friend. He became an audience fixture at venues, most now       long gone, like The Acorn on Oak, Toulouse, The London House,       the Green Mill, and Yvette. Nelson even came to name his       family pets after 20th Century jazz legends.        As Nelson climbed the rungs of journalism jobs, from City       News to the suburban Wilmette Life and then the Chicago Daily       News, his career tracked closely with another young reporter,       Ellen Warren, who later became a White House correspondent       for the old Knight-Ridder news service and then a columnist       for the Chicago Tribune. They eventually married and had two       sons.        Nelson moved back to River Forest, but he rejoined Dixon in       the mid-1990s when the former senator chaired a politically       sensitive federal commission charged with recommending the       closure of surplus military bases across the country.        In subsequent years, Nelson served as a spokesman for then-      Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Aurelia Pucinski, now an       appellate court judge, and the Illinois State Board of       Education and became a program officer and grant manager at       the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a Michigan-based non-profit       specializing in education grants. Wedged in between these       jobs was a multiyear stint as the chief speechwriter for       Richard Daley, a difficult task making Chicago's notoriously       ineloquent mayor sound eloquent.    Wade is survived by his wife and sons, Ted--and his wife, Sarah--and  Emmett of Chicago; a sister, Karen Nelson of Chicago; and a brother,  Ted--and his wife, Terry--of Spicewood, TX.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, Elaine Nekritz retired  after more than 14 years of service representing the 57th District in  the Illinois House of Representatives. Along with being a good friend  and dedicated public servant, Elaine was a real leader for her  constituents in Northbrook, Arlington Heights, Wheeling, Buffalo Grove,  and across her district.   Elaine's legacy in Illinois will always be visible as people travel  on high-speed rail from Chicago to St. Louis and throughout the State.  As the chair of the Illinois House Railroad Industry Committee, Elaine  was a leader in advocating for high-speed rail before it was popular.   During her service in the State House, Elaine championed women's  [[Page S6636]]  rights, the environment, and criminal justice reform as well. Because  of Elaine's efforts, kids who have had run-ins with the law have a  better shot at staying out of adult courts and avoiding getting caught  in an endless criminal cycle.   Elaine was always willing to listen to colleagues and friends on both  sides of the aisle, even when partnership was challenging. She helped  craft bold legislation to rescue Illinois from its dire economic  circumstances. As house assistant majority leader, she was a leader in  working to reform pensions in our State. Fiscal responsibility was  always her core value.   The people of the 57th District were lucky to have such a strong  advocate. Her energy, creativity, and thoughtfulness will be missed.   I thank her for her service to Illinois and her friendship. I wish  her the best of luck in her next adventures and salute her husband,  Barry, for his strong partnership with his talented spouse.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
