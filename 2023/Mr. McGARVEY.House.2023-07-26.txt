 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule on H.R.  4366 and the underlying bill. I oppose this bill because it hurts our  servicemembers, it hurts our veterans, and it weakens our military.   This bill fails our servicemembers and hurts our military readiness.  It cuts over $1.5 billion for military construction projects all over  the country, and includes no funding, no funding to make military  installations like Fort Knox and Fort Campbell more resilient against  climate change and the natural disasters that have ravaged my home  State of Kentucky.   Instead of writing a bill that strengthens our military or will  improve resources for our servicemembers, my Republican colleagues are  bringing to the floor a bill riddled with the partisan provisions to  get rid of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, restrict women's  access to abortion and reproductive healthcare, and make VA facilities  less welcoming for all of those who served our country.   These are distractions. We shouldn't pick and choose which  servicemembers we honor. Anyone who answers the call to serve our  country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and they  deserve to have access to quality healthcare, food, housing assistance,  and more.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to actually support our military,  our veterans, and our servicemembers.
