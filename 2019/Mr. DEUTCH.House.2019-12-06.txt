 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel, and I rise in  support of a resolution that speaks to a two-state solution that  enhances the security and stability of Israel, a two-state solution  that recognizes the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  for a state of their own and one that will come about only through the  direct negotiations of Israelis and Palestinians.   The words in this resolution matter. The words that reaffirm that it  is in the national interest to continue to stand by our ironclad  commitments under the MOU, which seeks to help Israel defend itself  against a wide range of threats, is a critical statement at this moment  in our Nation's history.   Those are the words that are the language of this resolution. That is  why I support it.
