 Madam President, in a short time we will gather before  proceeding to the rotunda to honor the life of George Herbert Walker  Bush, the 41st President of the United States.   George H. W. Bush will be greatly missed in many ways. He was  undeniably dedicated to his country, from his time as a young Navy  pilot through his long career in public service, in both elective and  appointed offices, as our Ambassador to the United Nations, our Envoy  to China, and Director of the CIA. In a life that spanned 10 decades, 7  decades of George H. W. Bush's life was spent in faithful and humble  service to his country.   Though our careers intersected only briefly, I knew him to be a fine  man, a decent man. Even when he opposed your views, you knew he was  doing what he thought was best for the United States of America.   He embodied the characteristics we admire in a President: integrity,  civility, dignity, humility, and a sincere interest in bipartisanship.  He valued public service and had respect for government as a noble  force--a force for good.   When he wanted to say something to someone, he would sit down to  write them a handwritten and usually heartfelt note. He used the word  ``friend'' often, and when he said it, he meant it. His yearning for a  kinder, gentler Nation seems more needed now than when he first called  for it.   Not all of his efforts will be celebrated, and, of course, that is  true of every politician who has reached high  [[Page S7258]]  office. But as we look back at his life and career, it is clear that  George H. W. Bush cared deeply about more than just his country and its  ideals. He cared deeply about its citizens, no matter what their  situation. His early involvement in the YMCA, his advocacy for the  Americans with Disabilities Act, and his support for volunteerism and  service throughout his career are a testament to that fact.   He called on Americans to be ``a thousand points of light,'' and he  was too modest to say that he and his wife Barbara were two of the  brightest.   Our hearts are with the Bush family today.                            ____________________     Madam President, my heart is also heavy today at another  loss: Giles Perkins, who was one of the top lawyers in Birmingham, AL,  and the former head of the Alabama Democratic Party. He died of cancer  over the weekend.   He was a close friend and mentor of one of our friends here in the  Senate, Mr. Doug Jones, who called him the ``Yoda'' of his campaign.   I talked to Giles frequently--in fact, just a few days ago--and he  was always filled with a desire to do good, a desire that the right  thing be done, and a desire to help his friends--Doug Jones at the top  of the list.   Giles was a booster of many things Alabama, and he will sorely be  missed by his family, his dear friend, the junior Senator from Alabama,  the State he loved, and by me.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
