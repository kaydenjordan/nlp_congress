 Madam President, today I rise to recognize the  New Britain Lions Club as they celebrate 100 years of devoted community  service and positive impact on countless families and organizations in  New Britain, CT, and the surrounding area.   The New Britain Lions Club is one of the five original Lions Clubs  organized in Connecticut. Since their founding in 1922, the Club's core  focus has been to meet the needs of children, although they have  touched the entire community over the years. As a testament to their  far-reaching impact, President Herbert Hoover sent a telegram in 1930  which read: ``There is hardly an institution or community effort where  the New Britain Lions Club has not been involved, including the  library, Salvation Army, Scouts, sports, the American School for the  Deaf, community festival, and literally scores of others.''   The Club has developed leadership skills in its membership and ten of  the Club's members have served as District Governor, displaying  extraordinary leadership ability and helping establish programs that  continue to this day to serve New Britain. Among these leaders was Lion  Thomas Leonard, one of the founders of the Connecticut Lions Eye  Research Foundation--CLERF--Lion Howard Wry, who began the annual  eyeglass collection and initiated the New Britain Lions Emergency Food  Bank in 1981, and Lion Otto Strobino, who served as President of the  Lions Eye Research Foundation and initiated the planting of the Lions  Memorial Forest at the University of Connecticut. The New Britain Lions  Club has set the standard of excellence in Lionism through their  history of exceptional leadership and commitment to public service.   Over the past 2 years, despite the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic, the New Britain Lions have continued to operate their free  eye clinic, oversee the local Warm-The-Children program to provide  winter clothes for children in need, and facilitate vision screening  services to over 5,000 school children in the New Britain Public School  system.   Their most recent initiative is a collaboration with Connecticut  Children's Medical Center, Yale New Haven, and the Meriden YMCA  Mountain Mist Camp to create a weeklong Diabetes Camp to help children  and young adults manage the disease. In addition to their local impact,  the New Britain Lions Club has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars  for the Lions Club International Foundation to reach those in need all  over the world.   As the New Britain Lions Club celebrates its centennial this  September, I applaud them on their extraordinary contributions--not  just to the city of New Britain and State of Connecticut, but to our  great Nation and the world. I hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating the New Britain Lions Club on 100 years of committed  public service.                            ____________________
