 Mr. Speaker, more and more Americans are recognizing  that Donald Trump is unfit to be President--his divisive tactics, his  racism, and his mendacity--but this Trump shutdown has shown further  that he is truly incapable of being President.   His fabled dealmaking ability appears to be just a television act.  When he reaches an agreement, his extremist cohorts will not let him  close the deal. He mistakes tweeting for government. He just cannot  lead.   Since this Trump shutdown began, this self-described ``stable  genius'' has failed to hold a single bipartisan meeting, nor even make  a public appearance, though he did dispatch his son, Eric, to declare-- amazingly--that the government shutdown is a ``good thing for us.''   It is not a good thing for America. This Congress must lead in  supporting the needs of our people and recognizing that we must put  America first in this situation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________
