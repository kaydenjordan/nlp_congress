 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res.  599, seeking a political solution in Yemen and putting pressure on Iran  to stop their nefarious activities there. I thank Chairman Royce and  Mr. Khanna for bringing this to the floor today.   Like Hezbollah and Syria, these Houthi rebels are just another  Iranian proxy, nurturing Iranian hegemonic ambitions in the region  which continue to destabilize the Middle East and impede our efforts to  reinforce the historic Sunni balance of power.   A few thousand Houthis--a distinct minority--are trying to subjugate  27 million Yemenis.   Iran supported the Houthis' overthrow of the elected President. They  continue to export weapons to Yemen, including rockets and ballistic  missiles. Some of these things involve antiship weapons and sea mines,  which could threaten our own U.S. Navy.   Houthi rebels have directly attacked Saudi Arabia's property, further  escalating the tensions and bringing us to the brink of a broader  conflict in the area.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this important  resolution to the floor.
