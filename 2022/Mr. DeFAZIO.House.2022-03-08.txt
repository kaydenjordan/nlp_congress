 Mr. Speaker, the President just announced that he will  ban the importation of Russian oil. It is a tiny fraction of the oil we  consume, so it shouldn't mean a big run-up in price. In fact, prices  have already run up 30 percent since the invasion of Ukraine, they have  already priced it in, and they are already profiting from it.   We need to become energy independent, as the President pointed out.  We have to break our addiction to Big Oil. We need to be self- sufficient on renewables, but we don't need to price gouge the American  people on the way there.   Last year, the oil companies reported record profits, bought back $7  billion worth of stock, and had record dividends. This year, they say  there is a $22 billion stock buyback, bigger dividends, bigger profits.  They should not be price gouging during a crisis.   I am introducing legislation for a price gouging profits tax with  rebates to consumers.   Colleagues, join me in this effort. Don't let Big Oil gouge the  American consumers under the guise of an international crisis.                            ____________________
