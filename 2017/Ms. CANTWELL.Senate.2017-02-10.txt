 Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon  with my colleagues to speak about the nomination of Steve Mnuchin for  the Secretary of Treasury.   We all know this is a very important economic position in our Federal  Government, but it is also a position of great importance for the  entire world economy. The Secretary of Treasury is a key Presidential  adviser on important economic and tax policy, and has an impact on the  lives of millions of people across the United States. But most  importantly, the Secretary will be on the front lines protecting and  restoring our economy from the unbelievable economic crisis that we  faced in 2008.   I like to say that this crisis--which, according to the Dallas Fed,  which cost us $14 trillion--is not over. That is, average Americans  still have not recovered from the crisis when it comes to their 401(k)  or their pension or the opportunity to send their kids to school or  perhaps even homeownership. It is very important that we have a  Treasury Secretary who not only says that they will protect the United  States in the future from another financial crisis, but that they are  also on the job making sure we restore economic opportunities for  everyday Americans.   I would have to say that Mr. Mnuchin certainly has lived the American  dream. You would say that he is a man who has achieved financial  success. But is he going to fight for the average American who has not  achieved that success because of the economic downturn in 2008? Is he  going to make sure that our resources and dollars not only grow the  economy, but make sure that those who have been impacted the most are  restored in some way?   I personally did not support the bailout of the banks. I did not give  the keys of the Treasury to those big organizations, and many people in  the State of Washington and across America during this last campaign  want to know why they did not receive financial help during that  downturn, but people were so willing to bail out these  [[Page S1088]]  large organizations. So it is very important that we look at the  nomination today in light of what has transpired and what we are going  to do moving forward to help the economic security of so many  Americans.   This position, which includes chairing the Financial Stability  Oversight Council and moderating systemic risk to our entire financial  system, is a very big job. It requires someone with both expertise in  policy and experience in public service, as well, because you are  balancing these issues for the public.   I find it sometimes very difficult to explain in detail those  policies to my constituents, particularly about balancing the public  interest, when they have seen that all some want to do, as I said, is  give the keys to the Treasury to those large financial organizations.  There is a lot to talk about that here today.   In my opinion the Treasury Department needs a seasoned and  experienced public servant who understands our ship has been sailing  through turbulent waters, and will focus on making sure that America  returns to economic stability.   I had an opportunity to meet with the Treasury Secretary nominee. He  has admitted throughout his confirmation hearing that he was the chief  fundraiser for President Trump during his election. In fact, when I  asked him why he wanted to be Treasury Secretary, he told me that he  had spent many hours campaigning with the President-elect around the  United States and he wanted to continue that relationship. This isn't  exactly the type of experience that I am looking for. I want somebody  who is going to continue to help us dig out of those economic problems  that plague so many average Americans--on many issues, whether it is  pensions or investing in education or growing our economy at a robust  rate, that bring everybody up to a higher economic standard of living.   One issue that plagues me the most in thinking about this particular  nominee is the issue of Glass-Steagall, the separation of commercial  and investment banking.   Why would that issue be so important?   It is so important because this was the law of the land for more than  60 years in the United States of America after the Great Depression.  Why? Because people understood we should not be putting individual  savings--and taxpayer money--at risk when you have a financial crisis.  So we implemented that law of the land.   I have not been shy about trying to work with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to reinstate Glass-Steagall, and, during the  financial regulatory reform debate, make sure we were putting strong  laws on the books. I always felt that there would be a time when  average Americans really could look back on all that Congress had done  and say they were satisfied or dissatisfied with the rules that were in  place.   Well, I think that time happened during the last election. There was  a lot of discussion that while we had passed what was then called Dodd- Frank--the regulatory reform that this Congress passed, I felt like we  could do more. A lot of the discussion was that Dodd-Frank didn't go  far enough, that somehow we needed to do more. The compromise shaped  here in the Senate, was said by some people, was as much as we could  do, and that we should put those rules in place and see how they worked  for the U.S. economy. I supported it because it was enough to get on  the books, to start getting disclosure, to start making sure that these  transactions would have more oversight, but I never thought--never  thought--it was the bright line that we needed to separate commercial  and investment banking.    So you can imagine that it was to my great delight when I saw last  summer the debate between the Republican and Democratic platforms in  which the Republican platform actually started to embrace Glass- Steagall. They had a campaign, they had a Presidential candidate, and  they certainly had a Presidential campaign manager who were all  embracing it and touting it. I don't know if that was an effort to try  to distinguish between some of the candidates on the other side of the  aisle, or my colleague from Vermont who has also been a big supporter  of Glass-Steagall, but they clearly put in their platform something  that was unambiguous. It basically said: ``We support reinstating the  Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits commercial banks from being  engaged in high-risk investment.'' That is what their platform said,  and that is what our now-President's then campaign manager also said  they were for. That caught my ear because I thought maybe we had  finally reached a point with the frustration of the American public  about how they had been left behind after the financial crisis, and  that they finally were seeing two candidates and several campaigns  talking about this issue, putting it in their platform, and moving  ahead.   It was the Trump campaign manager who said:         ``We are supporting the small banks and Main Street. We       talk about legislation that affects, you know, some of the       mistakes that were made in repealing Glass-Steagall.''    This was the party platform of the other side of the aisle. In fact I  have to say I almost thought it was probably a better platform than we  had on the Democratic side, and I wanted to make sure that my  colleagues knew and understood that. But now I see that it was nothing  more than a cynical ploy to try to convince the American people that  somehow the Trump administration was really going to be on the side of  Main Street against Wall Street.   In fact, one of my first conversations with Secretary-nominee Mr.  Mnuchin was to ask him whether he in fact supported Glass-Steagall. He  said to me: No, that was just a campaign promise in our platform. That  is not what we are going to do.   That caught me by surprise because I really had hoped that maybe  President Trump, having been in business, having seen the challenges of  working with big banks, maybe was really going to be on the side of  Main Street, was really going to fight to make sure that we protected  the capital that needed to go into small business, that needed to go  into investment, that needed to go into new products and manufacturing,  and protect us from those kinds of Wall Street shenanigans.   My constituents want to make something in America besides exotic  financial instruments. They want those dollars to be invested in small  businesses that are creating products and selling them in a worldwide  market.   Mr. Mnuchin, instead, came to the Finance Committee and basically  said he is not for that version of what was in their party platform. In  fact, he and the President now support rolling back the minimal law  that we put on the books, known as the Volcker rule, within Dodd-Frank.  So, the fact is that not only are they not supporting what we were led  to believe they did support, but they are now putting someone in the  position of the chief economic official on these issues, who is saying:  Let's start rolling back the regulations that already exist.   So I am very frustrated by that, and I can say just on that point  alone that I would oppose Mr. Mnuchin's nomination to be Treasury  Secretary. I think it is time that we have someone who is not like  putting the fox in the hen house, but is instead there to do the job  and will protect our investment in the future and hopefully unwind this  economic problem from the past.   There are other reasons, though, why I don't support Mr. Mnuchin's  nomination to Treasury Secretary, and many of my colleagues here this  morning have already talked about that as related to the economic  crisis. OneWest Bank, with Mr. Mnuchin as chair, booked billions in  profits on the backs of foreclosure victims. According to reports, Mr.  Mnuchin's investors pocketed nearly $4 billion in the time they  controlled the bank. Mr. Mnuchin reportedly made $100 million when he  sold OneWest in 2015 for double what he paid the government.   We saw this in the Northwest, and I can tell you it was a great  frustration. These profits were booked on the backs of thousands of  struggling Americans, and we don't know exactly how these people  suffered because we don't have all the information.   The victims of OneWest are at least 50,000, including 1,600 in the  State of Washington. OneWest used ethically troubling and actually  illegal methods to seize homes from struggling homeowners and not give  them a fair process.  [[Page S1089]]    Under their agreement with regulators, they were supposed to modify  mortgages whenever possible and keep people in their homes. However,  according to the California attorney general, OneWest engaged in  ``widespread misconduct'' to kick many people out of their homes. Even  Mr. Mnuchin admitted this. In 2011 he signed a consent order with the  U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision that found that OneWest had filed or  caused to be filed potentially false affidavits ``not based on personal  knowledge or review of relevant books and records.''   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record one of these  actual agreements.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR THE COUNTY OF KING         CIT BANK, N.A., Plaintiff, vs. YVONNE C CARR, an       individual; MIDLAND FUNDING LLC, a limited liability company;       and all other persons, parties, or occupants unknown claiming       any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or       interest in the real property described in the complaint       herein, adverse to Plaintiff's title, or any cloud on       Plaintiff's title to the Property.--Defendants.

Plaintiff, CIT BANK, N.A., (``Plaintiff) is a       corporation duly authorized to conduct business in the State       of Washington.        2. Defendant YVONNE C CARR, an individual (hereinafter       referred to as ``Defendant'') is a resident of King County,       Washington.        3. Defendant MIDLAND FUNDING LLC is a limited liability       company doing business in the state of Oregon.        4. Venue is proper in this action as the Defendant resides       in King County and the property that is the subject of this       Complaint is located in King County.        5. Defendant is the record owner of the real property       commonly known as: 4916 48TH AVE SOUTH, SEATTLE, WA 98118       (``Property'') and legally described as: ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT       ``1.''        6. On or about November 9, 2010 the Defendant, for valuable       consideration, made, executed, and delivered to EAGLE HOME       MORTGAGE LLC (``Eagle Home Mortgage LLC'') a promissory note.       A copy of the Note is attached as Exhibit ``2.''        7. At the same time that the Defendant executed and       delivered the Note, and as part of the same transaction, the       Defendant, in order to secure payment of the Note, made,       executed, and delivered to Eagle Home Mortgage LLC a Deed of       Trust encumbering the Property, which is attached hereto and       incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit ``3'' (``Deed of       Trust''). The Deed of Trust was recorded on November 15, 2010       with the King County Auditor under Instrument No.       20101115001766.        8. Defendant MIDLAND FUNDING LLC, has, or claims to have,       some interest in the subject property or some part thereof by       reason of a judgment in the amount of $1,353.05. Said       judgment was entered by King County Circuit Court on January       26, 2015 and relates to case no. 145-16318.        9. Plaintiff is holder of the Note and assignee of the Deed       of Trust.        10. As of January 29, 2016 the balance due and owing is       $230,364.41 plus interest at 5.390% per diem, which continues       to accrue until paid. The amount due is comprised of the       following:  Principal Advances......................................     $167,175.00 Accrued Interest........................................      $53,842.70 Initial MIP.............................................       $4,352.00 Monthly MIP.............................................       $4,994.71     Grand Total.........................................     $230,364.41           11. Plaintiff has exercised and does hereby exercise the       option granted in the Note and Deed of Trust to declare the       whole of the balance of both the principal and interest       thereon due and payable, as the property has ceased to be the       principal residence of the borrower.        12. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges       that All Other Persons, Parties, or Occupants Unknown       Claiming any Legal or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien,       or Interest in the Real Property Described in the Complaint       Herein, Adverse to Plaintiff's Title, or any Cloud on       Plaintiff's Title to the Property are individuals having a       subordinate claim or interest in the Property. The interests       of said Defendant in the Property shall be eliminated at the       time of the foreclosure sale by Plaintiff. As of the date of       the filing of this Complaint, the identities of these       Defendants are not known. Once the identities of these       Defendants are known, these pleadings will be amended to       reflect their true names,        13. No other suit or action has been instituted or is now       pending upon said Note or to foreclose the Deed of Trust.        14. The terms of the Note and Deed of Trust provide that,       in the event of any action to collect the same or to       foreclose the Deed of Trust, there shall be included in the       Judgment a reasonable sum for attorney's fees, together with       all expenses incurred in pursuing a default action and       including the costs of title evidence.        15. Plaintiff is entitled to judgment permitting it to bid       all or part of its judgment sale.        16. Plaintiff does not seek a monetary judgment against       Defendant MIDLAND FUNDING, LLC. Rather, Plaintiff seeks to       foreclose its deed of trust which secures its promissory note       against the Property, and extinguish all subordinate       interests in the property thereby.        WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for Judgment against Defendants       as follows:        1. For judgment in the sum of $230,364.41 together with       interest from January 29, 2016 at the rate of 5.930% per       diem, late charges, and for such other sums advanced under       the terms of the Note and Deed of Trust, for taxes,       assessments, municipal charges, and other items which may       constitute liens on the Property, together with insurance and       repairs necessary to prevent impairment of the security,       attorney's fees and costs of reasonable and necessary       amounts, if this matter is uncontested, or as submitted by       counsel, and such other amounts as the Court shall deem       reasonable in case this action is contested, together with       the costs and disbursements herein;        2. It be adjudged, in the event of non-payment of the       judgment forthwith upon its entry, that the Deed of Trust be       declared as valid first lien upon the land and premises       described herein; that the Deed of Trust be foreclosed and       that the Property covered thereby sold at a foreclosure sale       in the manner provided by law, and the proceeds thereof be       applied on said judgment and increased interest and such       additional amounts as the Plaintiff may advance for taxes,       assessments, municipal charges, and such other items as may       constitute lien upon the Property, together with insurance       and repairs necessary to prevent impairment of the security,       together with interest thereon from the date of payment;        3. By such foreclosure and sale, the rights, claims,       ownership, liens, and demands of each of the Defendants and       persons claiming by, through or under them subsequent to the       execution of the Deed of Trust should be adjudged inferior       and subordinate to the Deed of Trust lien and be forever       foreclosed, except only for the statutory right of redemption       allowed by law and surplus funds allowed by law, if any;        4. The Plaintiff be permitted to become a bidder and       purchaser at the foreclosure sale;        5. Adjudging that each of the Defendants and all persons       claiming under each Defendant, after execution of the Deed of       Trust, whether as lien claimant, judgment creditor, claimant       under a junior trust deed, purchaser, lien holder, or       otherwise be barred and foreclosed from all rights, claims,       interests, or equity of redemption in the Property and every       part of the Property when the time for redemption has       elapsed;        6. For an Order directing the Sheriff, after the time for       redemption has elapsed, to execute a deed to the purchaser of       the Property at the sale, and directing that any such       purchaser be let into possession of the Property upon       production of the Sherriff's Deed;        7. For an Order eliminating such redemption rights should       the subject property be found vacant for at least 6 months       prior to application for judgment; and        8. For such other and further relief as the court deems       just and proper.        DATED: February 9, 2016            Respectfully Submitted,        MALCOLM  CISNEROS, A Law Corporation.

Joshua Douglas, Reg. # 1418458, King County.     This is an actual foreclosure document from one of my  constituents. What is most amazing  [[Page S1090]]  about this is that they are basically saying that this property should  be seized and foreclosed on, saying that there was no one living there.  But when one actually sees the service of the document, the service of  the document shows that it was served at an address where somebody  answered the door and took the document. So even in and of itself, you  can see how ludicrous this operation was--just going through a robo- list of names, signing documents, and putting people out of their  homes, when in reality, they were there living in them and should not  have been foreclosed on.   Many of these behaviors have been described by my colleagues, and I  hope that we get to the bottom of this issue. We heard from victims of  a foreclosure, where on a 98-year-old woman, being 27 cents short on a  payment, and another where they changed the locks on her home in  Minnesota in the middle of a blizzard.   Is that what we did for Goldman Sachs? I don't think so. I think we  gave them the keys to the Treasury.   This behavior, the callousness of this issue, is another reason why I  cannot support Mr. Mnuchin's nomination for Treasury Secretary.   Mr. Mnuchin's answers to questions about the administration's tax  reform plan are another issue. His tax reform policy and that of the  administration just doesn't add up to me. The nonpartisan analysts who  have looked at the President's tax reform plan found that it would do  just the opposite of what Mr. Mnuchin says, and it would actually  increase the deficit by $7.2 trillion over 10 years.   I don't think those are economics that I can support, and I don't  think I can support his nomination.   I would just say, in concluding, that there are other issues that  also concern me with this nominee and his responsibility to help us  solve our economic challenges.   I did have a chance to talk to Mr. Mnuchin about our pension  programs. One-third of Americans have zero retirement savings or a  pension plan--one-third. Those who do are not saving nearly enough and  the median balance for those nearing retirement is only $14,500. This  is going to be a crisis for us.   According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, our  nation's retirement savings gap is somewhere between $6.8 trillion and  $14 trillion. That is the gap that we are looking at in the United  States.   So, yes, when the Dallas Fed says that bailing out Wall Street and  the implosion of the Wall Street problems cost our economy $14  trillion, and that just happens to be the same gap in pensions and  retirement savings, it makes me furious.   I want to see a Treasury Secretary who has a plan on how we are going  to deal with these issues. The Secretary of the Treasury sits on the  Board of Directors of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. They  make important decisions as it relates to the multi-employer pension  plans and the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act. The PBGC currently has  a deficit of $76 billion.   These issues are so important, not just to mineworkers but to average  Americans. When Mr. Mnuchin sat on the board of Sears, he oversaw the  finances of the company's pension, which was massively underfunded and  accumulated $8.3 billion in net losses. We cannot afford to let that  happen to the PBGC.   If that is not enough, I want a Treasury Secretary who is going to be  aggressive in protecting the American taxpayer from further cause and  effects of the crisis in Puerto Rico. I was not a fan of the plan that  we crafted here in the Congress. Why? Because, again, we gave Wall  Street all the opportunity and left the taxpayers of the United States  and Puerto Rico with all the cost. That is going to be a challenge for  all of us in the future, and I hope that we will have a Treasury  Secretary who will be aggressive in recouping our losses as taxpayers  from Wall Street.   So while I know that people here and on the other side of the aisle  think their minds are made up, I would just ask them to look at his  record, to look at what we need to do as a country to move our economy  forward to recoup from the financial crises, and to say that Mr.  Mnuchin is not the man to lead us where we need to go. He certainly has  realized his financial dreams, but we have not heard enough from him  that makes me convinced he is going to help Americans realize theirs.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.                            ____________________
