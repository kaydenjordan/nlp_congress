 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial  [[Page S858]]  spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the Jerald Sulky  Company of Waterloo, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week for  the week of March 13, 2023.   The Jerald Sulky Company has been synonymous with excellence for over  125 years. Since 1898, the company has manufactured sulkies, vehicles  similar to horse sleighs, leading the company to become world famous in  the showring and on the racetrack. Today, Jerald Sulky Company is the  last commercial manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the world. The  company began in Osage, IA, when Samuel E. Jerald, Sr., a top craftsman  in the horse-drawn vehicle business, decided to build race sulkies.  Shortly after, Samuel and his team relocated to Waterloo in 1901 and  became known as one of the most innovative companies in the industry,  utilizing the latest materials and pioneering new technology. In the  early 1900s, there were over a dozen sulky manufacturers; however, the  1930s saw the introduction of the automobile, World War I, and the  Great Depression. Innovations in technology, global war, and mass  economic downturn took a toll on the sulky industry, and when the dust  settled, Jerald Sulky Company was one of only two companies that were  still in operation.   During WWII, Jerald Sulky Company recognized the importance of aiding  the country's war effort and began manufacturing field ambulances, also  know as litter carriers, to hurry fallen soldiers off the battlefield.  The company ensured that each field ambulance was crafted with care, to  honor each injured soldier, knowing the journey on the field ambulance  might be a soldier's last. The company achieved great success during  the post-war boom due to the abundance of materials and an influx of  horsemen eager for vehicles that were not available during the war; the  company modernized many of their classical designs which are still in  production today such as the Fine Harness Buggy and the Show Pleasure  Cart. Hard times fell on the Jerald Sulky Company in 2014, forcing them  to close. Fortunately, at this same time, Erik and Shelli Lee were  looking to buy a show cart. They called up Jerald Sulky Company to  inquire about purchasing a cart and ended up buying the whole company.  Erik and Shelli turned the company around, and now, they ship sulkies  domestically and internationally to customers all over the world, while  still focusing on the excellence and integrity of their product.   In a world that is growing increasingly automated, the Jerald Sulky  Company is committed to handcrafting each of their horse carriages  because, for them, it is not a product, it is an art. Their custom-made  horse carriages take 6 to 10 weeks to create and are worked on by a  staff of 12 artisans who, all combined, have over 200 years of  experience in the craft. The carriages range from $1,500 to $15,000 due  to the time and labor spent to make them. Furthermore, they source most  of their materials locally. As they only want to use the best materials  for their carriages and because there are not many producers that  create the parts they want, the company's biggest challenge is  combating supply chain issues. Even though their supply chain can be  difficult to navigate and despite the fact there is not a large market  for traditional horse carriages, the Jerald Sulky Company is not  worried. They have a loyal customer base that maintains a constant  demand for horse carriages. Today, the company, on average, builds 150  new carts each year, a vast improvement from 2014. Additionally,  through expanding to more foreign markets, Jerald Sulky Company has  continued to grow their customer base, proving that this 125-year-old  company is resilient as ever.   The Jerald Sulky Company's commitment to excellence also extends to  their local community. In the chaotic days of the beginning of the  COVID-19 pandemic, they did not hesitate in offering to use part of  their warehouse as a temporary assembly operation to put together  disposable face shields for hospital and clinic staff. More than 60  volunteers from the local community came together at the warehouse to  assemble 10,000 shields. Additionally, this past year in March 2022  when tornados ravaged Iowa and destroyed two local horse barns, the  Jerald Sulky Company raised awareness about the tragedy and rallied the  local community to donate to a GoFundMe for each barn. Similar to when  the company sprang to action during the First World War, Jerald Sulky  Company continues to answer the call of their community.   Through their drive for excellence, the Jerald Sulky Company has been  referred to by some as the Rolls-Royce of the horse-drawn vehicle  world. They have received numerous accolades throughout the years.  Their sulkies have been on the cover of Sport Illustrated several  times. Furthermore, the company's impact on the U.S. horse world has  been so great that their sulky was featured on a U.S. postage stamp. In  1996, the company was inducted into the Iowa Harness Racing Hall of  Fame. More recently, their sulkies have been featured in pop culture on  the hit television series ``Duck Dynasty.'' Never compromising the  integrity of their product or cutting any corners, the company has gone  on to become a leader in the horse world and has achieved great  success. I want to congratulate the entire team at the Jerald Sulky  Company for their continued commitment to excellence in their work both  locally in Iowa and throughout the world. I look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
