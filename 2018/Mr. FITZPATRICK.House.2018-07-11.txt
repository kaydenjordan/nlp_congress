 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that recently celebrated  its 15th anniversary.   The Twilight Wish Foundation, based in Doylestown, seeks to grant the  wishes of low-income senior citizens. These wishes can be big or small,  ranging from meeting Philadelphia Eagles players to the purchasing of a  new pair of eyeglasses.   As a society, Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon all of us as both  public servants and citizens to support programs and support policies  that protect our senior citizens. I commend the work done by the  Twilight Wish Foundation, and I applaud the leadership of founder and  Chairman of the Board Cass Forkin. I would also like to thank Vice  President Robin Kardane; Director of Community Relations Mary Farrell;  and Director of Wish Management Michelle Bowren, for all their  incredible work for our community.                         Recognizing Bob Consulmagno     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize a resident of  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently broke his fourth world record.   Bob Consulmagno of Morrisville successfully broke the record for the  most outstanding ab wheel rollouts while wearing a 40-pound weight  vest. Making this feat more impressive is that Bob, a retired marine,  completed this major accomplishment to raise awareness of mental  illness.   Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder,  Bob turned to sports and physical training to battle mental illness.  Using his athleticism to garner attention to those who struggle from  mental illness, Bob hopes to end the stigma with which it is often  associated and to promote treatment for military veterans.   I am proud to call Bob my constituent, and I am thankful for his  service to our community and for turning challenging experiences into  positive and educational engagements.                  Recognizing the Kaitlin Murphy Foundation     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is working tirelessly  to assist those struggling with drug addiction.   The Kaitlin Murphy Foundation, established to honor the life and  memory of Kaitlin Murphy of Doylestown, partners with law enforcement  agencies and organizations with similar missions to provide resources  to those suffering from substance abuse, along with their families.  [[Page H6046]]    Some of these organizations include the HEART Program, which serves  to rehabilitate females suffering from addiction at the Bucks County  Correctional Facility; the Moyer Foundation's Camp Mariposa; and Bucks  County Police Assisting in Recovery. For their work, the Kaitlin Murphy  Foundation recently received a grant from Warrington Cares, the  employee charity of Warrington Township.   I am proud to represent such thoughtful and generous people in our  community, and I applaud the work of the Kaitlin Murphy Foundation and  Warrington Cares, and I will continue to do my part here in Washington  to end this public health crisis.   Lastly, I would like to extend my appreciation to Kaitlin's parents,  Tim and Pat Murphy of Doylestown; Kaitlin's brother, Sean; and the  organization's president, Annemarie Murphy of Warrington for all their  work for our community.                            ____________________
