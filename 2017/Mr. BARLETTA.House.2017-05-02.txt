 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1665) to ensure that the Administrator of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency considers severe local impact in making a  recommendation to the President for a major disaster declaration, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disaster Declaration       Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. LOCAL IMPACT.         In making recommendations to the President regarding a       major disaster declaration, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall give greater weight and       consideration to severe local impact or recent multiple       disasters. Further, the Administrator shall make       corresponding adjustments to the Agency's policies and       regulations regarding such consideration. Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of this section, the       Administrator shall report to the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the changes made to regulations and policies       and the number of declarations that have been declared based       on the new criteria.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  [[Page H3020]]  Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1665, as amended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1665, as amended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1665 is to ensure that, in making a  recommendation to the President for a major disaster declaration, the  Administrator of FEMA looks at the intensity of the impact in a  localized area as well as the impact on other recent disasters.   My colleagues from Illinois are to be commended for working so  persistently on this bipartisan piece of legislation. Their Illinois  districts have been impacted by several devastating disasters, but each  time the communities were told that the damage was not severe enough to  warrant Federal disaster assistance.   In recent years, there has been more evidence of devastated small and  rural communities not receiving disaster assistance in a fair manner  compared to other larger communities and neighboring States. I know all  too well how devastating this can be for those affected by disaster, as  I am dealing with a similar issue in northeastern Pennsylvania.   In March, much of the area I represent was hit with a crippling  snowstorm that dumped as much as 30 inches of snow or more.  Municipalities had to exhaust much of their yearly budgets on snow  removal efforts and emergency services. However, due to the fact that  the statewide threshold needed for Pennsylvania to request  reimbursement funding from the Federal Government was not met, local  municipalities were left with massive holes in their budgets.   This bill helps ensure the severe, remote, and localized impact  endured by communities like those in Pennsylvania and Illinois get due  consideration and they get the help they need when disaster strikes.  The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA  Disaster Assistance Reform Act.   Again, thank you to the gentleman and gentlewoman from Illinois for  working with the subcommittee on this legislation to address the  concerns of their constituents and other communities in this situation.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barletta  and Ranking Member Johnson. I also look over this House floor and thank  my colleague, Mrs. Bustos, from Illinois, for joining me in this effort  because, if you travel to my district or Mrs. Bustos' district in  central and, in my case, southern Illinois and you ask my constituents  about their opinion of FEMA's disaster declaration process, they are  going to tell you that it is broken.                                time  1330    You don't have to look any further than the State of Illinois to see  how FEMA's public assistance formula is failing hardworking families  across this country because it simply does not put all communities on a  level playing field.   In 2012, tornadoes devastated Harrisburg in southern Illinois, but  the State was denied public assistance while Missouri and Kentucky  received aid due to the damage inflicted by the exact same storm. Just  a few short years ago, the towns of Gifford and Washington in central  Illinois were denied public assistance as well, despite those  communities suffering millions in damage. And just last year, Illinois  was once again denied public assistance following extensive damage done  in late December 2015 and early January 2016 caused by severe storms  and flooding in the central and southern parts of our State.   Under existing regulations, FEMA currently takes into account several  factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance.  However, there is currently no standard to determine which factor is  more important than another during the disaster declaration process.  This leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave  States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is  considered.   By working with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last  year during the markup of the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act, we  were successful in including important language based on legislation I  introduced that requires the administrator of FEMA, when making  recommendations to the President regarding a disaster declaration, to  ``give greater weight and consideration to severe local impact.'' This  bill ultimately passed out of the House under suspension last Congress,  but, unfortunately, the bill died in the Senate.   This Congress, I have introduced this language again, along with my  friend and colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), as the Disaster  Declaration Improvement Act.   Passing this bill will have a real impact on States like Illinois,  where a large portion of the population is concentrated in a small  northeastern corner of our State. Because of the population density in  the northern part of my State, rural parts, where I live and where I  represent, are having to meet an arbitrarily high standard in order to  qualify for a disaster declaration. Enacting this language is going to  help level the playing field and help ensure rural areas are given a  fair chance when disaster happens and help is needed.   During our March markup of this bill, we also added important  language that strengthens the bill by way of an amendment offered by my  friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves). This language also  requires FEMA to place more consideration on recent multiple disasters,  to take into account the cumulative impact such events can have. So I  want to thank Chairman Graves for working with my office on including  this language and for being a cosponsor of my bill.   I also want to express my personal gratitude to Chairman Shuster and  Ranking Member DeFazio for working with us during the last Congress and  this Congress, and for moving this bill so early. Again, I want to  especially thank Chairman Barletta for being a cosponsor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, central and southern Illinois just experienced another  flooding event this past weekend. And while it is not yet clear what  the damage is, it is clear that Congress must act to  [[Page H3021]]  ensure that folks get a fair shake if it is determined that Federal  assistance is needed.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood).   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1665, the  Disaster Declaration Improvement Act. I thank my colleagues, Mr.  Barletta and Mr. Rodney Davis, for their leadership on this important  issue.   Rural areas are the heart of not only my district, but of America as  a whole. They are the source of food and resources, and are home to  millions of American families. When natural disasters come to these  communities, we should be doing everything in our power to help them  get back on their feet. Instead, the regulatory regime forces these  areas to meet a higher and unfair threshold in order to get the FEMA  resources that they need.   My district faced this problem back in 2013, after a tornado swept  through Washington, Illinois, destroying nearly 1,000 homes. This was a  massive loss, but FEMA's formula for public assistance kept Washington  from getting the assistance it needed to repair the public  infrastructure damaged by the storm. While individuals could get some  relief for personal property, this damage to infrastructure affects  every member of the community.   This is why I am a proud cosponsor and supporter of H.R. 1665, the  Disaster Declaration Improvement Act. This bill will change and  modernize FEMA's formula so that it is easier for rural areas and areas  with lower population density to get the support and assistance they  need after a disaster.   I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage today to ensure that all  Americans, regardless of the town they live in, can know that help will  be on the way after such tragic events happen.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1665, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1665, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1679) to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's current efforts to modernize its grant management system  includes applicant accessibility and transparency, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1679         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FEMA Accountability,       Modernization and Transparency Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency shall ensure the ongoing modernization of       the grant systems for the administration of assistance under       the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) includes the       following:        (1) An online interface, including online assistance, for       applicants to complete application forms, submit materials,       and access the status of applications.        (2) Mechanisms to eliminate duplication of benefits.        (3) If appropriate, enable the sharing of information among       agencies and with State, local, and tribal governments, to       eliminate the need to file multiple applications and speed       disaster recovery.        (4) Any additional tools the Administrator determines will       improve the implementation of this section.        (b) Implementation.--To the extent practicable, the       Administrator shall deliver the system capabilities described       in subsection (a) in increments or iterations as working       components for applicant use.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on H.R. 1679.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on H.R. 1679.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1679, the FEMA Accountability, Modernization and  Transparency Act of 2017, is to enhance FEMA grant applicants' access  to information.   I commend my colleague from Louisiana for working so hard for the  people of his State to tackle the challenges those communities and  individuals have been facing in the wake of last August's floods and  other disasters.   On average, FEMA distributes almost $6 billion a year in assistance  to individuals, communities, and organizations impacted by disasters.  That taxpayer money must be managed in an efficient and transparent way  to prevent duplication and provide disaster survivors with needed  access and visibility.   More efficient and transparent delivery of disaster assistance will  help speed disaster recovery and reduce the administrative burden on  applicants. This legislation requires the FEMA Administrator to include  online access and information sharing as the agency modernizes its  disaster grant delivery system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1679, and I yield back the balance of my time.

The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1678) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act concerning the statute of limitations for  actions to recover disaster or emergency assistance payments, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1678         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 705 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5205)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1)--        (A) by striking ``Except'' and inserting ``Notwithstanding       section 3716(e) of title 31, United States Code, and       except''; and        (B) by striking ``report for the disaster or emergency''       and inserting ``report for project completion as certified by       the grantee''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (1) by striking ``report for the disaster       or emergency'' and inserting ``report for project completion       as certified by the grantee''; and        (B) in paragraph (3) by inserting ``for project completion       as certified by the grantee'' after ``final expenditure       report''.        (b) Applicability.--        (1) In general.--With respect to disaster or emergency       assistance provided to a State or local government on or       after January 1, 2004--        (A) no administrative action may be taken to recover a       payment of such assistance after the date of enactment of       this Act if the action is prohibited under section 705(a)(1)       of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5205(a)(1)), as amended by       subsection (a); and        (B) any administrative action to recover a payment of such       assistance that is pending on such date of enactment shall be       terminated if the action is prohibited under section       705(a)(1) of that Act, as amended by subsection (a).        (2) Limitation.--This section, including the amendments       made by this section, may not be construed to invalidate or       otherwise affect any administration action completed before       the date of enactment of this Act.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1678 is to establish a statute of limitations for  FEMA to recover disaster assistance payments. This bill would provide  some finality in disaster assistance, and it would minimize  administrative costs.   This is a bipartisan issue, and I appreciate my colleagues from  Florida for their continued leadership on this issue.   H.R. 1678 reinstates the 3-year statute of limitations on FEMA's  ability to reclaim funds when there is no evidence of fraud, waste, or  abuse.   In my district, I have seen FEMA tell a community that a project is  eligible for funding, allowing the town to move forward to complete a  disaster recovery project, only to have FEMA change its mind years  later and take the money back. Not only is this devastating to the  community and to disaster recovery, but the administrative time and red  tape involved in second-guessing is a waste of taxpayer dollars.   Again, my thanks to the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentleman  from Florida for their continued work on this issue and for introducing  this bill.   The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA  Disaster Assistance Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).
