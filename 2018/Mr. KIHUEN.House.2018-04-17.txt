 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Calla  Medig.   Going to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas had become an annual  tradition for Calla. She would always take time off from her job as a  waitress in Edmonton, Canada, so she could travel to Las Vegas just for  the festival.   Calla was a hard worker and was about to become the newest manager at  her restaurant. She was a mature, grounded, and lighthearted person.   Calla will be remembered for being kind and warmhearted and for being  someone who would always greet you with a beaming smile.   I extend my condolences to Calla Medig's family and friends. Please  know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole  country grieve with you.                            ____________________
