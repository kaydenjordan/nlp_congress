 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and the ranking  member for this amazing legislation.   To my good friend from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, I remember that bill year  after year after year because the post office was given the death  penalty. That is what happened in the dark of night.   I worked for the post office. Yes, I remember sorting the mail in  those old days. But what I most remember is the 1 million new delivery  points every year that the post office adds. While others are making a  lot of money, they go to the rural areas.   I also remember the letter carriers, the rural postmasters, and all  the hardworking men and women who were coming to us week after week,  day after day, and said: We are dying out here, and we need to be able  to have our healthcare taken care of.   But guess what? The post office had to prepay it. No one else had  ever had to do that. It was one of the highest liabilities. Along with  that, they were required to fund their pension liabilities at a much  higher level than the rest of the Federal Government.   To conserve cash, they hadn't been paying since 2012. Can you  imagine, they stopped paying their bills since 2012 because they didn't  have any money?   By more closely integrating Medicare, USPS estimates it can save  $22.6 billion over 10 years. What a smart thing to do.   Then, of course, the Postal Service Reform Act would eliminate the  requirement of the prepaid retirement. And, then, it would require USPS  to develop a public-facing online dashboard.   Again, the idea is to save the post office for the American people,  save it for the workers, and save it because it is patriotic to do so.  I congratulate you.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House and the Committee on  Homeland Security, and as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and a member of the Equality Caucus,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act of  2022.   Passage of this legislation is urgently needed because USPS incurred  its fourteenth consecutive net annual loss in 2020, and even if USPS  continues to default on mandated payments, it would likely run out of  cash to fund its operations prior to 2024.   Madam Speaker, USPS funds the universal mail service it provides to  nearly 159 million delivery points solely through the sale of postage.   USPS adds one million new delivery points every year, even as mail  volume continues to fall.   This means USPS must deliver less and less mail to more and more  places.   In addition, several congressional mandates imposed when mail volume  was at its peak put USPS on the road to insolvency.   USPS is required to pre-fund the health care costs of its employees,  regardless of whether they actually serve until retirement.   USPS is also required to fund its pension liabilities at a much  higher level than the rest of the federal government.   To conserve cash, USPS has defaulted on retiree health care payments  since 2012.   That is why the key reforms in the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021  are so important.   First, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 would require future  Postal Service retirees, who have been paying into Medicare their  entire careers, to enroll in Medicare.   Currently, roughly a quarter of postal retirees do not enroll in  Medicare even though they are eligible, which means USPS is stuck  paying far higher premiums than any other public or private sector  employer.   By more closely integrating Medicare, USPS estimates it could save  approximately $22.6 billion over 10 years.   Second, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 would eliminate the  requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for all current  and retired employees for 75 years in the future.   No private company or other federal government entity is required to  comply with such a burdensome requirement and its elimination is  estimated to drastically reduce its prefunding liability and allow USPS  to save roughly $27 billion over 10 years.   Third, USPS Reform Act of 2021 would require USPS to develop a  public-facing, online dashboard with national and local level service  performance data updated each week to provide additional transparency  and promote compliance with on-time delivery of mail.   Fourth, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 would require USPS to  deliver both mail and packages at least six days per week across an  integrated network.   Finally, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 would allow USPS to  enter into agreements with State, local, and tribal governments to  provide non-commercial property and services that provide enhanced  value, do not detract from core postal services, and provide a  reasonable contribution to Postal Service institutional costs.   In addition, the legislation contains several provisions that will  improve the effectiveness of the Postal Service, including:   The expansion of special rates for local newspaper distribution to  promote local news organizations;   A Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) review of cost attribution  guidelines for different Postal Service products to ensure pricing  accuracy and better accounting;   Increased funding autonomy and control for the Postal Regulatory  Commission to increase its budgetary resources commensurate with its  mission of regulating the Postal Service, and to shield the PRC from  government shutdowns;   A study on operational inefficiencies in Postal Service flats and  magazine processing;   Regular congressional reporting on Postal Service operations and  financial performance to enable accountability of stated cost savings,  revenue, and infrastructure investment goals;   Adjustments to the considerations USPS must make when deciding which  mode of transportation to use to deliver mail in order to ensure  greater consistency and reliability; and   The consolidation of the PRC's small Inspector General Office into  the more robust Postal Service Office of Inspector General.   Madam Speaker, the Postal Service's unmatched network and Universal  Service Obligation serves 159 million homes and businesses every day,  processing and delivering an average of 430 million pieces of mail and  packages per day.   In fact, USPS often delivers seven days a week due to demand and  necessity.   This has been especially true during the Covid-19 pandemic as  American homes, businesses and private shippers have relied on the  Postal Service to meet their needs in these extraordinary times.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform  Act of 2021.

A study on operational inefficiencies in Postal Service flats and  magazine processing;   5. Regular congressional reporting on Postal Service operations and  financial performance to enable accountability of stated cost savings,  revenue, and infrastructure investment goals;   6. Adjustments to the considerations USPS must make when deciding  which mode of transportation to use to deliver mail in order to ensure  greater consistency and reliability; and   7.

Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform  Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, many of our jurisdictional committees  have oversight over the major league sports teams, from baseball to  basketball to football.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been engaged with my  committee in the oversight of the National Football League. In fact, I  remember more than a decade ago we were the first committee to deal  with brain concussions and the lack of response by the NFL to the  players.   Today, I rise for the lack of response to racism and racial  discrimination in the NFL. I take note of the lawsuit filed by Coach  Brian Flores and would hope that the words, ``it is without merit''  will not stand.   I believe it is important, with the number of minority players versus  the number of coaches to that in terms of statistics, that we address  the seeming appearance of racial discrimination in the NFL. I think it  is important to reassess the Rooney rule to give a criteria for how  coaches are selected, so mistakes like the coach from Boston sending  the wrong notice that ``you have been hired'' to someone else would not  happen.   To Mr. Goodell and the owners, let's work together, let's get the  teams to look like America.                            ____________________
