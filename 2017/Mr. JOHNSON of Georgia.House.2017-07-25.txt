 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman, and I  rise in strong support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on  the important topic of forced arbitration.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 111. Forced  arbitration is a modern twist to an old trick, tricking people out of  their day in court. Forced arbitration tricks people out of their  constitutional right to a jury trial on their claim against corporate  special interests. Forced arbitration prohibits consumers from taking  their case to court for a jury trial and forces the consumer into the  back room with a secret arbitrator selected by the corporation who then  decides the case for the corporation. It doesn't take a genius to know  what happens when you get behind those closed doors.   The outcome will be against the consumer. It is not fair; it is not  right; and it is not justice.                                time  1615    Corporate special interests trick consumers into giving up their  rights to a jury trial by hiding forced arbitration clauses in the fine  print of consumer agreements that they require consumers to accept when  there is no other choice.   Consider the latest example from Wells Fargo, which was caught red- handed engaging in unscrupulous banking practices to the detriment of  their customers. They were ruining the credit of their customers by  opening millions of fake accounts in the names of their unsuspecting  customers.   When Wells Fargo got caught, their customers were barred from going  to court because they had unknowingly agreed to the forced arbitration.  If this is not adding insult to injury, I don't know what is.   Congress authorized CFPB to consider banning or limiting forced  arbitration in cases of consumer financial products or services. The  CFPB found that forced arbitration clauses denied consumers the ability  to obtain justice. That is why Congress should vote in approval of the  rule for the CFPB and reject H.J. Res. 111.
