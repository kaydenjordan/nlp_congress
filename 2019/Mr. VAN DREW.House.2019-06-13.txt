 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my  sponsorship in the Fairness to Pet Owners Act, H.R. 1607.    Mr. Speaker, all Americans, all people have the right  to accessible and affordable healthcare.   While I am proud that we have recently passed five bills that improve  and strengthen healthcare accessibility, lower prescription prices, and  protect access for those with preexisting conditions, we still have  much more work to do.   Healthcare is the people's issue. When polled, 75 percent of  Americans listed it as the most important issue to them, and not just  healthcare, but affordable, accessible healthcare. We must fight to  improve our healthcare system.   We must fight the opioid crisis.   We must fight to lower prescription prices, and we must unite to make  sure that Americans do not go into debt because they or a loved one has  an emergency or are diagnosed with a terrible illness.   The only way we are going to make real change, the only way we can  protect people is if we work to come together to really form real  solutions.   My message should be clear: healthcare is truly a right.                            ____________________
