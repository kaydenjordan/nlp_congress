 Mr. Speaker, as a point of personal privilege, I wish my  daughter, Julianna Elena, a very happy first birthday today, April 19.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the success of some of our  athletes in schools across New York's 17th District.   Earlier this month was Student Athlete Day, a date on which we  celebrate the achievements of the young men and women competing in  interscholastic sporting events across our country.   It has been a great winter season for our Hudson Valley athletes, and  I would like to take a moment to congratulate some of these teams and  individuals.   Congratulations to Section 1 Boys Basketball champions, Tappan Zee  High School, as well as the Boys Swimming champions, Horace Greeley  High School.   Congratulations also to Carly Sardo from Tappan Zee High School who  was this season's floor champion in gymnastics, and Dami Modupe from  North Rockland High School who won the girls 55-meter hurdles in indoor  track and field.   Our athletes should all be commended for their hard work during this  season and throughout the year.                            ____________________
