 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the  Democratic leadership to answer the question from my constituents as to  why the Articles of Impeachment were not yet transmitted to the Senate.   It was urgent enough to have the first-ever partisan articles pass  this institution almost 3 weeks ago but not urgent enough to follow our  Constitution by walking them from this House, out that door, through  Statuary Hall, under the Capitol dome, and to the Senate floor.   It will take only a matter of minutes to get them there, and it will  codify the first-ever partisan impeachment process in our Nation's  history.  [[Page H6]]    History will not judge this process and this impeachment favorably.  If you don't like who gets elected, work to elect someone else.   Instead, Democrats will ask themselves years from now, ``Why did we  allow partisanship and hatred of this President to change history and  precedent?'' when this institution is paralyzed by future partisan  impeachments of duly elected Presidents of both parties.                            ____________________
