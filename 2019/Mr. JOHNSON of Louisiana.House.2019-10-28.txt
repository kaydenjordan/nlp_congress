 Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, I  rise to bring awareness again to the alarming rate of veteran suicide.   This country owes all of our veterans and armed services personnel a  limitless debt of gratitude for their sacrifices, so many that they  made on our behalf. Our country simply wouldn't be the Nation it is  today, of course, were it not for the many ways in which they have  valiantly served.   Very sadly, veteran suicide remains an urgent crisis that devastates  too many families across our Nation every single day. The statistics  are staggering. We know now that we lose up to 6,000 veterans to this  unspeakable tragedy every year.   For far too long, our country's brave men and women who fought abroad  for our freedoms fall victim to suicide when they return home, and, of  course, they leave families without fathers, mothers, brothers and  sisters, sons and daughters.   There are few things more heartbreaking than to hear of another brave  soldier taking their own life, and we naturally ask the questions: How  could this one have happened? Is there more that we could have done to  intervene?   I just want to say this. Here in Congress, we have a moral obligation  to ensure that our veterans are given top priority and the resources  and quality healthcare they need and truly deserve.   We will continue to work on that priority. We will continue to  advocate for all of those who served, and we will continue to draw  attention to this terrible crisis in America.   May God bless and watch over all of our troops and all those who have  served the call of freedom.                            ____________________
