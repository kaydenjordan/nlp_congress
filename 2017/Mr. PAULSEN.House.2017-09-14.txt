 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to September  being National Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Month and the bipartisan  resolution that I and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) have  introduced.   Pulmonary fibrosis is an incurable lung disease that impacts 200,000  Americans, and for whose who aren't familiar with it, you may be  surprised to learn that the mortality rate for those with pulmonary  fibrosis is as high as those with breast cancer. It kills one American  every 13 minutes--40,000 Americans die each and every year. There is no  known cure, and there is no known reliable treatment to relieve its  symptoms nor prolong the life of its victims.   Eighty percent of those who contract pulmonary fibrosis do not live  more than 5 years after receiving that diagnosis, and the median  survival rate is just half that time.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue my efforts in working with the National  Institutes of Health as well as patient advocacy groups to find a cure  for this deadly disease.                            ____________________
