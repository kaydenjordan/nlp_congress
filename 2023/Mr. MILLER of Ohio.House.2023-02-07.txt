 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of John Adams, a man who needs no introduction in Cleveland or  Progressive Field, thanks to his passion for baseball and his iconic  drum. John passed away last week at 71 years of age.   John, a 1969 graduate of Parma High, bought a base drum at a garage  sale and first hauled it to an Indians game in 1973. Over the next 46  years, John and his drum would attend more than 3,700 games, including  all three All-Star games, 11 playoff series, and three World Series. He  missed just 45 games over nearly five decades of fandom.   John and his drum were the beating heart of Cleveland baseball, and  they have rightfully been immortalized with a statue at the field.   I thank John for the memories. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
