 Madam Speaker, condemning Rising Antisemitism, H.  Res. 1125, acknowledges the multitude of contributions that American  Jews have made to our nation. This legislation also condemns the  documented and dangerous rise of Antisemitism globally and  domestically.   This month we celebrate Jewish American History Month and remember  the contributions that Jewish people have made to our nation. As a  Nation of immigrants, the United States is better and stronger because  Jewish people from all over the world have chosen to become American  citizens. Since first arriving in the America's in 1654, Jewish  Americans have achieved great success, strengthened our country, and  helped shape our way of life.   Through their deep commitment to faith, family, and community, Jewish  Americans remind us of a basic belief that guided the founding of this  Nation. We must take the opportunity to not only remember these  contributions, but also thank the many Jewish Americans who defend our  ideals as members of the United States Armed Forces.   I am proud to vote for H. Res. 1125 today. Anti-Semitic attacks and  rhetoric must be met with clear voices of condemnation. Our Nation is  facing a rise in Anti-Semitism and White Supremacist extremism. I will  lend my voice to denounce Antisemitism today and every day and continue  to stand in solidarity with Jewish communities in California and across  our Nation.
