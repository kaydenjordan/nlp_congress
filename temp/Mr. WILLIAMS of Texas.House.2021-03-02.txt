 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak for  thousands of music venues, movie theaters, and museums that are  struggling to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.   Over the past year, Congress has come together in a bipartisan manner  to pass over $3.5 trillion in pandemic assistance. While much of this  aid was necessary, government bureaucracy has routinely delayed getting  this money into the hands of the American people. As of today, there  are still $1.3 trillion in unspent COVID-19 relief.   In December, the House passed my bipartisan Save our Stages Act,  which established the $15 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant,  providing direct relief for music venues, movie theaters, and museums  devastated by the pandemic. These businesses were the first to close  and will be some of the last to reopen.   Nine weeks have passed since President Trump signed this into law,  and the SBA still has not even produced the application for venue  owners to apply. At this rate, some grants won't be delivered until  summer.   This is unacceptable, and the SBA needs to get to work immediately.  Every day we wait, there is another door that permanently closes. The  bottom line is: The shows must go on.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
