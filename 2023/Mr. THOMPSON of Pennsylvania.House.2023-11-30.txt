 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the critical point that we, as Americans, stand at with our domestic  energy supply. We are living in a self-created energy crisis because of  bad energy policy. It is unacceptable that many hardworking Americans  are struggling to make ends meet because this administration refuses to  utilize the abundant resources that we, as a Nation, are blessed with.   Pennsylvania is key to restoring American energy independence. Before  President Biden took office, America was the largest energy producer in  the world. In just over 3 years, the Biden administration has  effectively waged war on our domestic energy production and kneecapped  innovation in our oil and gas industries. As a result, American  consumers are seeing increased demand and higher prices for  conventional fuels.   By utilizing the Commonwealth's resources, we can provide jobs and  invest directly into our communities that have suffered at the hand of  the Biden administration's antienergy policies. Thankfully, my  colleagues and I in the House have passed several bills that will put  America back on top as the global leader in energy production.   For example H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, will allow our energy  producers to remain market-responsive by removing bureaucratic red tape  and streamline the production of our critical energy resources. We also  updated the flexible air permitting rule, a Federal air emissions  permit, by ensuring that operators can have changes made to their  production approved up front, without having to wait for subsequent  reviews of the changes. This flexibility allows owners and operators to  act quickly and without government regulation slowing down the  production of critical energy resources.   In my fight to restore energy independence, I was proud to cosponsor  the Natural Gas Tax Repeal Act which will eliminate President Biden's  plan to increase burdensome fees and taxes on energy companies. This  bill will prevent further cost increases for consumers, a burden that  falls most heavily on lower-income Americans.   House Republicans also led on a number of permitting reforms that  were included in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Most notably, we passed  the first significant reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act,  NEPA, that removed burdensome environmental consideration requirements  and reduced redundancies within Federal agencies to end the delays to  critical energy infrastructure projects.   Mr. Speaker, another key aspect of unleashing American domestic  energy is that we need to invest in renewable energy to counteract high  gas prices and global volatility. No amount of talk of electric  vehicles or speaking in platitudes about a green economy will change  the fact that everyday Americans are paying an unnecessary price at the  pump. We cannot go electric overnight. However, we can unleash American  energy production in the short term and allow our producers to fill  both domestic and global demand. The United States has an abundance of  clean-burning natural gas, especially in Pennsylvania, which is the  second largest producer of natural gas in the United States. Unleashing  domestic production of energy can only add certainty to the United  States energy supply.   It is my hope that with our continued work here in the House, we can  ultimately return to our status as a leading producer of energy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Emma Zacherl, a student at Clarion-Limestone, for her award-winning  artwork.   Emma is a talented artist who continues to wow teachers and  professionals alike. At the Laurel Festival in Brookville this past  summer, she earned the best of show for her watercolor of Till  Lindemann, a German singer and songwriter.   During Clarion's Autumn Leaf Festival this year, the teenager earned  third place in the professional category. Zacherl competed in that  division because she was commissioned to do illustrations in ``The Iron  Furnaces of the Cove!'' That is a book by her relative, Byron Smail.   Earlier this year in Clarion, during Summerfest, Zacherl won in her  age group with her chalk drawing of Batman. She has also received  recognition for her work of the Juniata furnace.   Mr. Speaker, Emma continues to pursue her passion while also  maintaining straight A's, being a member of her local Girl Scout troop,  playing on her high school volleyball team, and being a member of a  band.   I congratulate Emma on her art awards. I wish her the best of luck as  she continues to pursue her dreams.                            ____________________
