 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of this  funding extension, which includes a vital, long-term reauthorization of  the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. This bill  provides the longest extension in the history of the CHIP program and  provides security for millions of kids and pregnant mothers.   It is important to remember the House has already acted responsibly  three times to extend CHIP. In November, this Chamber passed the  CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act on a bipartisan vote. The bill not only  would have extended CHIP for 5 years, but it also addressed other  important public health programs like federally qualified health  centers. Regretfully, partisanship and political gamesmanship left that  bill to languish in the Senate.   My constituents remain frustrated that the majority of my Democratic  [[Page H534]]  colleagues in this Chamber have voted three times against CHIP. The  delays and posturing are inexcusable.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone in the House votes to pass  this extension today so we can get to work on quickly reauthorizing  community health centers and other important public health priorities.   I encourage my colleagues to put aside the political games, vote  ``aye'' on the bill--the only correct vote--and then tell the Senate to  do the right thing as well.
