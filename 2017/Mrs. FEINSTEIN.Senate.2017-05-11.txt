 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to  improve the safety oversight of products that affect every single  family on a daily basis. Whether it's shampoo or shaving cream, lotion  or make-up, hair dye or deodorant, personal care products are a part of  our everyday lives. I thank Senator Collins for her support and hard  work on this important legislation.   However, even though our bodies absorb many chemicals in these  products through our skin and even our nails, their ingredients are  largely unregulated. It's time to modernize our safety oversight and  correct this problem. Most people assume these products have up-to-date  federal oversight, but in reality the Food and Drug Administration's  authority to do so is sorely outdated--in fact, it's based on a law  from the 1930s that has changed little over the past eight decades.  There are questions about the safety of some ingredients in these  products, which not only leads to health concerns but also causes  uncertainty for companies working to innovate and expand domestically.   Over the last several years, Senator Collins and I have worked with a  wide group of stakeholders that represent both industry and consumer  groups. Those stakeholders include small and large companies, doctors,  consumer advocates, patient advocates, scientists, and the Food and  Drug Administration. Together, we have drafted bipartisan legislation  that puts commonsense measures in place and has the support of both  industry and consumer and health organizations.   The Personal Care Products Safety Act sets up a process for reviewing  the safety of ingredients in personal care products. The bill requires  manufacturers to register so consumers know who produces personal care  products sold in the United States.   The legislation also modernizes authority for the Food and Drug  Administration so the agency is better equipped to deal with public  health concerns, such as being able to recall contaminated products if  companies choose not to do so voluntarily. The updated system is  completely paid for by industry fees. Companies will provide  information about the ingredients in their products to the Food and  Drug Administration, and attest to their safety. Many companies  manufacturing in the United States currently follow strict voluntary  standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the lack of  federal standards leaves this to chance. Under this legislation, the  agency sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies  meet minimum requirements. Companies will also need to report adverse  health events related to their products to the Food and Drug  Administration.   Last year, we heard about WEN shampoo, a product that was causing  significant hair loss. Among those affected were children, including a  little girl named Eliana who lost all of her hair after using WEN. She  shared her story with my office and several of my colleagues. What's  shocking is that the company received more than 20,000 reports of this  happening, but under current law WEN had no legal obligation to tell  the Food and Drug Administration. Under this legislation, companies  would be required to do so.   Another example of concern is the ongoing use of formaldehyde, also  called methylene glycol when mixed with water, in the popular hair  treatment called a Brazilian blowout. Formaldehyde is released into the  air during  [[Page S2919]]  this beauty treatment. It can cause shortness of breath, headaches, and  dizziness in the short-term. Over the long-term, formaldehyde has been  linked to cancer.   I am also greatly concerned about the effect on the health of salon  professionals who are constantly exposed to a variety of chemicals  daily. In addition to reviewing the safety of chemicals they may be  exposed to, this legislation also ensures that the salon products they  use are properly labeled with ingredients and warnings.   The Food and Drug Administration will be required to evaluate at  least five ingredients per year for safety and use in personal care  products. In addition to reviewing the latest scientific and medical  studies, the agency will consider how prevalent the ingredient is, the  likely exposure, adverse event reports, and information from public  comments. Public input will be critical to the review process. There  will be opportunities for companies, scientists, consumer groups,  medical professionals, and members of the public to weigh in on, not  only the safety of particular ingredients but also, which ingredients  should be a priority for review. After review, the Food and Drug  Administration may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under  certain uses or under certain conditions. The agency will also have the  authority to require warning labels as needed for certain ingredients  and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in personal care  products. For example, some ingredients may only be safe for use by  adults or when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting.   The Personal Care Products Safety Act is the result of many diverse  groups working together with the common goal of modernizing the federal  oversight system to ensure the safest products possible are on the  market. We have worked closely with small businesses to ensure that the  legislation recognizes their needs and supports their growth. This  legislation incorporates changes to increase flexibility for small  businesses, particularly those making low-risk products. The bill  recognizes the unique nature of the handmade cosmetic industry and  meets their needs to encourage growth and innovation.   I am pleased that the major organizations representing these small  businesses (Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, Coalition of Handcrafted  Entrepreneurs, Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild), have said that the  provisions within this legislation ``afford producers in the handmade  cosmetic industry the opportunity to continue to innovate, grow, create  jobs and produce safe, quality handmade products in communities across  the nation.''   I am pleased to have the support of a broad coalition, including  Environmental Working Group, Society for Women's Health Research,  Endocrine Society, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, Au Naturale,  Coalition of Handcrafted Entrepreneurs, Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic  Guild, Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, Herban Lifestyle, The Honest  Company, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Babo  Botanicals, Goddess Garden Organics, Caregiver Action Network, March of  Dimes, EO Products, Eclair Naturals, Juice Beauty, National Psoriasis  Foundation, and the following major companies that together represent  over 99 brands of products: The Estee Lauder Companies, Johnson and  Johnson, Procter and Gamble, Revlon, Unilever, and L'Oreal.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this much needed  legislation to modernize our outdated regulatory system for personal  care products, and I hope the Senate will pass this long overdue  legislation this year.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr.          Franken, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms.          Harris, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          Coons, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Reed, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Leahy):   S. 1114. A bill to nullify the effect of the recent Executive order  laying a foundation for discrimination against LGBTQ individuals,  women, religious minorities, and others under the pretext of religious  freedom; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President. I rise today to join with my  colleagues in introducing a rescission bill to nullify President  Trump's Executive Order 13798, titled ``Promoting Free Speech and  Religious Liberty.'' Unfortunately, this Executive Order does not live  up to its title. Instead, it furthers the aim of this administration to  diminish critical protections for women, minorities, and LGBT  Americans.   I am deeply troubled by Section 3 of the Order, which paves the way  for the Trump administration to roll back protections to preventive  health services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), especially for  women and LGBT individuals. Through new regulations issued pursuant to  this Order, companies could use ``conscience-based'' objections to deny  their employees coverage for preventive services that they have a right  to under the ACA. This means that because of their employers' moral  objection, women could lose access to contraception, and those in the  LGBT community could lose access to essential services, including  cancer screenings or counseling for domestic violence.   I respect that we all have religious and moral convictions, but it is  wrong to put employers' religious views above individuals' rights to  access basic health care. I also note that this section of the Order  invites members of the President's Cabinet to eliminate an  accommodation President Obama administration made allowing religiously  affiliated nonprofit employers, including large universities and  hospital systems, to opt out of providing their employees with  contraception coverage based on religious objections.   Importantly, women working for objecting employers can receive  contraception coverage directly through their insurance companies.  Seven federal courts of appeals have upheld this accommodation in the  face of religiously based challenges. But with this Order, the  President signals that his administration is likely to do away with the  accommodation, which would deny contraception access to women whose  bosses want to make this important and intimate decision for them.   The Order also directs the Attorney General to issue guidance to all  agencies on ``religious liberty protections in Federal law.'' This  language is concerning as it opens the door for the Attorney General to  eliminate protections in federal rules and regulations for LGBT  individuals and minorities. The Attorney General's duty is to enforce  and protect the civil rights and constitutional freedoms of all  Americans. This Order's direction for guidance that could change the  implementation of critical rules affording equal treatment for all in  America is a disturbing step backward. For example, there are rules  protecting same-sex spouses' ability to visit their partners in the  hospital and ensuring that LGBT individuals have equal access to  federally funded emergency housing. Under this provision, however, new  religious exemptions may be implemented to weaken these protections.  Shelters could turn LGBT families away because of who they love. As the  Human Rights Campaign has described, this provision opens the door to a  ``license to discriminate'' even where basic services funded with  government dollars are at stake.   This Executive Order opens the door to weakening the enforcement of  longstanding tax laws against individuals, houses of worship, and other  religious organizations engaging in political campaign speech. Notably,  the Johnson Amendment was proposed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1954 and is  part of our tax code. It prohibits 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entities,  including churches, from engaging in political campaign activity on  behalf of candidates. The Johnson Amendment does not bar nonpartisan  voter education and registration activities, which are important to a  strong democracy, nor does it prohibit speech on moral issues.   The President has promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment. Doing so  could have a significant impact on political campaign fundraising and  would change the current tax consideration for certain political  contributions. While repeal of the Johnson Amendment is something only  Congress has the power to do, this Executive Order clearly indicates  the administration's intention to undermine the separation  [[Page S2920]]  between tax-exempt charities and religious organizations and political  campaign activity in the tax code.   It remains to be seen whether the President and the administration  will implement this Order in ways that will realize our worst fears  about the kind of discrimination it could enable. But we know for  certain that this Order represents a disturbing statement of principles  and values. Instead of seeking even greater protections from  discrimination, this administration has set the stage to undermine  protections, especially for women and LGBT individuals. That is not  what our country stands for.   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  the bill I am introducing today to nullify this troubling Executive  Order.   Thank you. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to  improve the safety oversight of products that affect every single  family on a daily basis.
