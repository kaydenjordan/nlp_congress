 Mr. President, the first thing I want to do is  comment on the discussions we just had.   I have been up here a little less than 2 years, and the thing that  surprises me is, invariably, the Democrats won't stand up against the  Communist Party in China.   The case that we are dealing with now is they are going to stand up  for Hollywood rather than rights, rights that we have here that I am  going to talk about in a second.   We ought to be standing up against Communist China stealing our jobs,  our technology. We ought to be attacking the Communist Party for what  they have done to Uighurs, for organ harvesting, for taking away the  basic rights of Hong Kong citizens.   Invariably, I watch my Democratic colleagues; they won't stand up  against Communist China. I don't understand it. This is a party that  clearly wants to dominate our society, our way of life. They completely  disagree with our way of life.   I want to thank Senator Ted Cruz for his continued fight for rights,  for all the rights that we have in this country but fighting for those  rights so people, whether in Hong Kong or in Communist China or in  Taiwan, have the same freedoms that we have.   So I want to thank Senator Ted Cruz for showing up today and doing  this.    Mr. President, today what I want to talk about  is religious freedom. Religious liberty is our  [[Page S7694]]  first freedom under the Constitution of the United States. Americans  have the right to freely exercise religion, a sacred right that I will  always fight for.   There is no pandemic exception to the First Amendment. Unfortunately,  we have seen liberal Governors and mayors across the country use the  coronavirus pandemic to go after churches, synagogues, mosques, and  other houses of worship. For months, they have argued that houses of  worship should not meet and congregants could not sing. They have  condemned in-person worship services as a threat to public safety, all  while they applaud massive political protests.   We saw it happen right here in the Nation's Capital. Mayor Bowser  refused to grant a waiver to the Capitol Hill Baptist Church for  religious gatherings but supported mass protests that violated her own  orders. The church had to sue the city in Federal court for the right  to gather, and the court ruled in favor of the church.   It is simply hypocritical and unconstitutional to target religious  institutions while letting other businesses operate. We know those on  the left will take every opportunity to infringe on Americans' First  Amendment rights, but we won't let it happen.   This year has been challenging, and for many of us, our faith and our  communities have helped us through it. Government doesn't have the  right to take this away from American citizens.   I am proud to lead a resolution today with 15 of my colleagues to  call out those who have wrongly tried to prevent Americans from  practicing their faith. This is about rights granted to Americans under  our Constitution.   What is the one thing every American believes in and has agreed to  uphold. It is our Constitution, which we have each sworn to uphold as  elected officials also.   We each took the same oath of office:         I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the       Constitution of the United States against all enemies,       foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and       allegiance to the same; that I will take this obligation       freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion;       and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of       the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.    There is no reason anyone should object to upholding our  Constitution. I will always fight for the religious liberty of all  Americans, and I look forward to my colleagues passing this important  resolution today.   However, I now am going to wait because I understand one of my  Democratic colleagues is going to come object to upholding the  Constitution and the First Amendment, the Bill of Rights. This is  shocking to me.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 806, submitted earlier today;  further, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, freedom of religion shouldn't be  controversial. This is a fundamental right of our Nation, as stated in  our Constitution: ``Congress shall make no law respecting the  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''   What this resolution says is that the Senate affirms its support for  the rights, liberties, and protections enshrined in the U.S.  Constitution.   There is no pandemic exception to the First Amendment. For months,  across this country, liberal politicians have targeted churches,  synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship. To let this happen  undermines the principle of our Nation and the Constitution we have  each sworn to uphold as elected officials. I don't understand why my  colleague, who swore to uphold the Constitution, would object to a  resolution that simply reaffirms our commitment to upholding the  Constitution.   We are blessed to live in a great nation that respects religious  liberty and  [[Page S7695]]  the right to worship, especially as we see countries around the world  like Communist China and Iran deny their citizens these same rights.  Americans have the right to worship, and government doesn't get to  decide for them.   I am clearly very disappointed that my colleague doesn't want to  protect the First Amendment, but I will continue to stand against these  misguided and hypocritical attempts to target religious institutions. I  am never going to stop fighting for the religious liberty of all  Americans, even during a pandemic.   I yield the floor.    Let's remember, the concern was that he didn't  like the section about New Jersey and said that was inaccurate, but the  idea that the Senate will support religious freedom, he is not willing  to stand behind.   I yield the floor.
