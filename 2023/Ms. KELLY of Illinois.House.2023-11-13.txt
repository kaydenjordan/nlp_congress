 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge  National Diabetes Month.   As chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, I have long been focused on  how diabetes disproportionately affects Black Americans.   From lack of investment to a racist healthcare culture, Black  Americans face significant obstacles to treating and preventing  diabetes.   Black Americans undeniably face unique and significant stressors  because of racial discrimination. Research shows a clear link between  social stress and health outcomes, emphasizing we must not only address  the physical aspects of diabetes but also its underlying social  determinants.   We can address risk factors from diabetes from the earliest moments.  Exposures before birth, such as undernutrition, maternal stress, and  maternal obesity, can substantially increase the risk of developing  type 2 diabetes in adulthood.   Our efforts can continue outside of the traditional medical system by  increasing access to healthy food, reducing food insecurity, and  expanding opportunities for nutrition therapy and counseling. We can  reduce the risk of diabetes without first turning to more costly and  time-consuming treatments.   Let me give a special shout-out to Shontel Brown for bringing CBC  members together to highlight this issue.                                time  2000                                 THE MATH
