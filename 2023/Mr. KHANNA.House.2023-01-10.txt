 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this select committee.   As an Asian American who represents the only Asian majority district  in the continental United States, I would never support a committee  that I thought would engage in xenophobia or attacks on the Chinese  people.   I am pleased that this committee is not directed against China but is  directed against the Chinese Communist Party in the crafting of the  language.   I am pleased that it is going to focus on things that have been a  bipartisan concern: human rights violations that Representative  McGovern has advocated in standing up for the Uyghurs.   The fact is, this country has lost our industrial base. For 40 years,  on a bipartisan basis, we have watched as jobs were shipped offshore,  factories shut down, our trade deficits going from $70 billion to  almost $400 billion. That has hurt the working class. It has hurt our  ability to be a superpower, and it has led to rising tensions with  China.   If we want to deal with Asian hate in this country, one of the things  we need to do is rebalance our production. It is the loss of our jobs  that has fueled some of the xenophobia. It is the loss of those jobs  that fueled the killing that Representative Chu talked about in  Michigan with Vincent Chin.   I believe this committee cannot only stand up for American interests.  I believe when done well, it can help get us to peace and reduce the  tensions with China by rebalancing trade, by ensuring that China  doesn't invade Taiwan, and by standing up for human rights.   I am pleased on a personal basis that Representative Gallagher will  be chair of this committee. We have had heated debates in the Armed  Services Committee. We don't agree on many things, but I know that he  is a marine, a patriot, and someone who is going to make sure that the  committee is focused on the issues.
