 Mr. President, I want to recognize a Federal employee I  have had the privilege of working with for the past 5 and a half years,  Judy DesHarnais, deputy for programs and project management with the  St. Paul District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Quite simply  put, she is one of the finest and most dedicated public servants I have  had the opportunity to work with in my time in the Senate.   Judy joined the district in 1985 as one of the first female  engineers. In 2001, she was promoted to be the district's and the  Corps' first female deputy district engineer for programs and project  management. Throughout her time with the St. Paul District, Judy has  stood out as an individual who could tackle complex, sensitive water  resource issues. With top leadership in the district changing every 3  years, Judy has been the one steady hand that has remained constant,  guiding the district through preparation and response to historic  floods to helping communities secure permanent flood protection.   To community leaders in North Dakota, Judy is a trusted public  servant and an important partner. She has been on the frontlines with  us on so many flood fights, helping to coordinate emergency response  measures to protect families and businesses. She has also led efforts  to help communities get critical flood protection projects that have  saved lives and prevented more than a billion dollars in property  damage. No matter what the challenge, Judy has always been able to meet  or exceed it, and the positive impact of her work can be seen across  the State in Grand Forks, Wahpeton, Devils Lake, Minot, and so many  other communities.   Judy's contributions to the Corps of Engineers are numerous, but one  that will always be recognized is her efforts to make the agency truly  responsive to the needs of the communities it serves. After a  distinguished career in public service that has spanned more than 30  years, I want to thank Judy for her service to the Corps of Engineers  and the State of North Dakota. She will be greatly missed, remembered  for her professionalism, and honored for the positive change she  brought to the Corps, and I wish her all the best in her retirement.                            ____________________
