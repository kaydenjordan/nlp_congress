 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  Stuart MacVean of Aiken, president and CEO of Savannah River Nuclear  Solutions, for being honored as a 2020 CEO Who ``Gets It'' by the  National Safety Council's Safety and Health magazine.   This award is presented to those who go the extra mile through risk  reduction, performance measurement, safety management solutions, and  employee engagement--safety first.   Stuart has made keeping his employees safe and healthy a top  priority. His dedication has resulted in successful site mission  operations for support of our Nation's nuclear complex.   Stuart has been recognized by his local community. This month, I was  present when Stuart was named Man of the Year for his leadership,  community impact and involvement, and integrity by the Aiken Chamber of  Commerce, led by President David Jameson and Chair Julie Whitesell,  succeeding Pastor Paul Bush.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the leadership  of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
