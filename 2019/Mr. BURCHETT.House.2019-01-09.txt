 Madam Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to speak  about my constituent, Pierce Corcoran. On December 29, 2018, Pierce was  struck and killed by a vehicle operated by an undocumented immigrant in  Knoxville.   This is a personal matter for me, Madam Speaker, because I have been  friends with Pierce's family for many years, and they remain in my  prayers. Pierce was an incredible, hardworking, fine Christian young  man who will be deeply missed.   People want to come to our country for new opportunities and the  pursuit of happiness, and this Nation is full of incentives that  attract not only legal, but also illegal immigrants. The most recent  data shows that there are approximately 606,000 overstayed visa  recipients and 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants.   Removing incentives that encourage unlawful immigration and  demagnetizing that attraction must be a priority for Congress moving  forward.   With stronger laws and increased border security, tragedies like the  one that occurred in my home district could and should be avoided, and  families like Pierce's might be saved from such a heartbreaking  situation.                            ____________________
