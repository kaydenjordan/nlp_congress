 Mr. President, today I wish to welcome President Tsai  Ing-wen of Taiwan to my home State of Colorado.   On Friday, July 19, President Tsai will land in Denver as she  transits through the United States on to her way home from official  visits with diplomatic allies in the Western Hemisphere.   President Tsai will be the first sitting Taiwan head of state to  visit the beautiful State of Colorado. It will indeed be a historic  occasion.   This visit to Colorado will highlight the special relationship that  our State shares with Taiwan. Colorado exports $222.7 million in goods  to Taiwan, making it the 10th largest export market for the Centennial  State, the sixth largest in Asia. It is estimated that over 2,400 jobs  in Colorado support the export of services to Taiwan.   Our relationship extends well beyond trade ties. Denver recently  became the new home for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in  2015. Colorado Springs and Kaohsiung City have been sister cities since  1983.   The shared values of freedom, democracy, and prosperity provide for  the strong basis of the longstanding friendship between our two  nations. Taiwan is a shining example to its neighbors. In 2019, Taiwan  was ranked the second freest country in Asia by Freedom House. It was  also ranked the 10th freest economy in the world by the Heritage  Foundation.   The strength and vitality of Taiwan's democratic and economic system  has made it a beacon of democracy in the Indo-Pacific and throughout  the world. The relationship between our two countries is critical for  the United States, as we continue to advance the goal of a free and  open Indo-Pacific and to promote our shared values in that region.   This is why, during my time in the Senate, I have championed the ties  between the United States and Taiwan. On December 31, 2018, President  Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which  declares that it is the ``policy of the United States to support the  close economic, political, and security relationship between Taiwan and  the United States'' and requires regular U.S. arms sales and endorses  high-level reciprocal visits between our nations.   President Tsai has graciously welcomed me to Taiwan on four  occasions, including a memorable visit several  [[Page S4904]]  months ago, when she graciously took me on a tour of Taipei's iconic  Dadaocheng neighborhood. It is now my pleasure to return the favor this  weekend when she visits my home State.   Welcome, President Tsa, to the Centennial State, and may we continue  to strengthen the bonds of friendship between our nations and our  peoples.                            ____________________
