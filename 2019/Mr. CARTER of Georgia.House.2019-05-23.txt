 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Miguel Lorenzo Holmes, who passed away at the age of 22 on May 6  while serving his country in Afghanistan.   The First Congressional District of Georgia was home for Mr. Holmes,  but he was also stationed there as part of the 48th Infantry Brigade  Combat Team in Savannah.   He was raised in Hinesville, in the First District, close to his  grandparents, where he attended Bradwell High School. There, he entered  the Fort Stewart Youth Challenge Academy, which inspired him to join  the National Guard.   He passed away after being wounded in Nangarhar province of  Afghanistan. This is a sobering reminder of the danger that soldiers  face while working to make our country and world a better place to  live.   I thank all who serve.   Mr. Holmes' family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
