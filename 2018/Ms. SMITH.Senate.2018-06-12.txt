I  spoke about how important it is for women to be represented in our  government and why it is so important to keep working so that our  legislature reflects the views and experiences of all Americans.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S3748, June 12, 2018, near the top of the first column,  the following language appears:  Mr.  President, last week I gave my . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================     While increasing the number of women in this Chamber is important, it  won't be enough by itself. Elections cost too much, and that is a big  problem in our country. The sharp rise of secretive, unregulated money  in politics means that we have no idea who is spending money on  campaigns and candidates or why, and that is a profoundly troubling  problem for our democracy.   While there are many causes of the rise of money in politics, perhaps  the biggest is the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC.  The 5-to-4 decision in Citizens United struck down key limitations on  campaign contributions that were enacted on a bipartisan basis in 2002.   That decision has had dire consequences for our democracy. Since  Citizens United, there has been successively more money poured into  each congressional campaign cycle. Much of that money has come from  super PACs and other secretive organizations that are structured  specifically to hide the identity of their donors. Other funds have  come from large corporations that can afford to spend millions on  political activities in order to further their own special interests.   What is the upshot of all of this? Super PACs and other dark money  organizations spent some $1.4 billion in the 2016 election. We often  have no idea who did the spending or why.   This kind of secretive, unlimited, corporate-driven political  spending is unfair to voters in Minnesota and around the country. That  is why I am fighting so hard to reform our campaign finance system.   One of the most important things we can do is to enact a  constitutional amendment to reverse the Citizens United decision. In my  very first month as a Senator, I cosponsored Senator Tom Udall's  legislation to do that. A few wealthy donors shouldn't dominate the  political conversation in this country.   Reversing Citizens United isn't the only thing necessary to restore  fairness to our political process; we should also pass Senator  Whitehouse's DISCLOSE Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. This  legislation requires super PACs and big political spenders to disclose  to the public exactly where their donations are going. No  constitutional amendment is required for this key measure. In 2010, the  DISCLOSE Act came up just one vote short in the Senate, and I urge the  Senate to immediately take it up again so we can finally pass this  important bill.   We also should replace the Federal Elections Commission, which is  mired in political squabbling and hindered with weak enforcement  authority. The FEC should be replaced with a new campaign finance  agency that has a strong mandate to enforce the law, with new rules to  ensure that one political party can't shut down the agency simply for  political gain.   I also believe that we should enact a small donor matching funds  program. Many Americans who aren't wealthy want to support a candidate  they believe in, but they simply can't afford to write a check for  thousands of dollars like the big donors do. A matching funds program  will help amplify the donations of these smaller donors and working  families and would be a key step toward leveling the playing field for  working families who want to support a candidate.   Finally, we should improve voter registration. Increasingly, some  have sought to disenfranchise others--especially voters of color--by  making it harder to register to vote, harder to get a ballot, or simply  through voter intimidation. It is time that we restore the Voting  Rights Act and crack down on discriminatory voting rules that block  access to the polls. This includes fixing the terrible recent Supreme  Court decision allowing States to kick voters off the rolls if they  don't vote regularly, even without offering same-day voter registration  for those voters to easily rejoin the rolls if they do wish to vote  again.   I believe that all Americans should be represented here in the U.S.  Senate, not just the wealthy few. Our democracy is built on the  principle that the American people have the power in our elections, so  I am going to keep fighting to reform our campaign finance rules.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
