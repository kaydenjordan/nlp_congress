 Madam President, I am honored to follow the  distinguished ranking member on our Environment and Public Works  Committee and one of the coauthors of the Waxman-Markey bill--the one  significant piece of climate legislation that has passed a House of  Congress--and to add my voice.    Gladly.    It goes the other way.   Sometimes it seems that our friends on the other side of the aisle  think that the only people who are watching this conversation are  fossil fuel industry lobbyists and CEOs and electioneers.   So we are going through, shortly, a truly preposterous exercise on  the floor of the Senate, which is that a party that has brought up no  significant legislation in the time that Leader McConnell has had the  floor is now going to bring its first measure related to climate for a  floor vote, and it is something they intend to vote against. It is  something they intend to vote against. When you bring a measure to the  floor that it is your intention to vote against, that is not  legislating. Something else is going on.   Now I think this was a very clever stunt. We don't know quite where  it was cooked up, but we have observed that the Wall Street Journal  editorial page is a relentless mouthpiece for the fossil fuel industry,  having published climate denial articles literally within the last  year. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called for this stunt  vote, and it was less than 24 hours before the Republicans in the  Senate jumped up, scampered out, and did exactly what they were told to  do by the fossil fuel industry's mouthpiece, the Wall Street Journal  editorial page.   I am sure there were champagne corks banging into the ceilings of the  boardrooms for ExxonMobil, Americans for Prosperity, and the Koch  Industries as all of these fossil fuel executives and lobbyists cheered  this stunt. But in the Senate, we actually have a larger audience than  just fossil fuel donors; the country is watching and the world is  watching, and what they are seeing right now is, frankly, an  embarrassment.   It is not just this stunt that reflects a broken Senate; it is a much  larger problem of a Senate that cannot deal with the climate change  issue in a bipartisan fashion.   I would state that when I got here in 2007, the Senate could deal  with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2008, the Senate could  deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2009, the Senate  could deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. The reason I  know that is because I was here then, and I saw as many as five  bipartisan efforts to deal with climate change during that period, with  different Republican and Democratic Senators. Then along came the  Citizens United decision in January 2010, and from that moment after,  it was like watching a patient drop dead in the emergency room. The  heartbeat of activity on climate change just flatlined on the  Republican side of this Chamber.   I think the fossil fuel industry--I know the fossil fuel industry  asked for that decision from the Supreme Court and the five Republican  Justices. I think they anticipated what the decision was going to be,  and they immediately went to work to squelch and crush any dissent from  their orthodoxy  [[Page S1471]]  on that side of the aisle. The result has been that there has been no  significant piece of climate legislation to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions and to deal with this problem since Citizens United that any  of our colleagues now will cosponsor or support. It has just been  silent, and it is a dramatic failure in this greatest deliberative  body.   I will state, as others have stated, as Ranking Member Carper and  Senator Markey have said, that the science on this is now beyond  dispute. The science on this is irrefutable. If we fail to deal with  this problem, the consequences will be catastrophic and irreversible.   ``Irrefutable science.'' ``Catastrophic and irreversible  consequences.'' I am actually quoting somebody when I say that. Do you  know whom I am quoting? I am quoting from 2009 Donald Trump--Donald  Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the Trump  Organization signed this full-page advertisement in the New York Times  in 2009. ``If we fail to act now,'' they said, ``it is scientifically  irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible  consequences for humanity and our planet.'' So as much as the fossil  fuel-funded mockery in which the Republican Party has engaged,  challenges these facts, even the Trumps knew this a decade ago.   In trying to describe the Green New Deal, one might describe it as  something that, if you invested in it, would ``drive state-of-the-art  technologies that will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs,  and increase our energy security all while reducing the harmful  emissions that are putting our planet at risk.'' That is a pretty good  capsule of the Green New Deal.   Guess what Donald Trump and his family said in the same  advertisement.         Investing in a Clean Energy Economy will drive state-of-      the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create       new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while       reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at       risk.    All you have to do is listen to the 2009 Donald Trump to understand  that the science of climate change was then irrefutable and it is even  stronger now and that the consequences of our failure to act and our  obedience, our adherence to fossil fuel-funded propaganda and orthodoxy  will lead to consequences that are catastrophic and irreversible--said  a decade ago. We have had 10 more years of unrestricted emissions since  then.   Just the basic tenets of the Green New Deal are ``a clean energy  economy [that] will drive state-of-the-art technologies that will spur  economic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy  security.''   With the words of Donald Trump, I rest my case and yield the floor.
