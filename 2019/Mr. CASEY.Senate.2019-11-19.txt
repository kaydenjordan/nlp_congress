 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, beginning with Russia's interference in our  2016 national elections, to the recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from  Syria, President Trump has made multiple statements and decisions that  serve only to benefit Vladimir Putin's agenda to undermine democracy  and expand Russia's influence around the world.   Taken together, these actions aren't just a threat to U.S. national  security, but they also undercut and diminish some of the core tenets  and values of American democracy and global leadership. The U.S.  Senate, as part of a coequal branch of government, must recognize this  threat and act as a body to ensure our institutions at home and  interests abroad are protected. Thus far, we have not lived up to this  solemn responsibility.   Let me start with a seminal news article from the Washington Post,  just recently. White House reporter Anne Gearan, in her October 15,  2019, article, catalogs how the Trump administration has allowed Russia  to assert dominance globally. The headline reads: ``Trump's moves in  Ukraine and Syria have a common denominator: Both help Russia.''   Anne Gearan writes as follows, and I will quote in pertinent part.         . . . President Trump has taken action that has had the       effect of helping the authoritarian leader of Russia.        . . . [The President's] actions in Syria and Ukraine add to       the list of policy moves and public statements that have       boosted Russia during his presidency, whether that was their       central purpose or not, confounding critics who have warned       that he has taken too soft a stance toward a nation led by a       strongman hostile to the United States.    Anne Gearan goes on to discuss how President Trump's withdrawal of  U.S. troops from Syria has allowed Russia to assert a more dominant  role in the region. She also discusses how the President's intimidation  of Ukraine's recently elected President Zelensky has become the subject  of a domestic impeachment inquiry and distracted from actual engagement  and support to Ukraine as it continues to grapple with Russian  aggression.   Anne Gearan also notes:         [President] Trump has publicly questioned the usefulness of       NATO--the post-World War II military alliance established as       a bulwark against first the Soviet Union and now Russia--as       well as the utility of the European Union, a political and       economic alliance Putin would love to weaken.    This is all written by Anne Gearan.   These actions have led to a growing consensus among the national  security community that the President is not serving the national  interest. Let me move to a second part of this.   Sadly, President Trump's recent actions with regard to Syria and  Ukraine are, unfortunately, not isolated. President Trump has been  consistent in taking actions that favor Russia. As early as April of  2016, then-candidate Donald Trump vowed to pursue closer ties to Russia  if elected to the Presidency. Even before he took office, by way of  Twitter and other platforms he was signaling to Vladimir Putin his  deference to a Putin-driven U.S.-Russia dynamic.   From there, the American people have only learned more about the  Trump campaign's ties to Russia and Russia's interference in the 2016  Presidential election.   The intelligence community's unclassified report concluded:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency. We further       assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear       preference for President-elect Trump.    The interference with our election process by a hostile government  was an attack on our democracy and a threat to our national security  carried out by Russian operatives at the direction of Vladimir Putin  himself.    Since Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel  to investigate Russia's attack, 34 indictments have been returned in  connection with the investigation, including indictments against  Russian individuals and Russian companies, as well as former Trump  campaign manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign manager Rick Gates,  who were charged with ``conspiracy against the United States.'' Special  Counsel Mueller also secured guilty pleas from other campaign advisers,  including George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn.   Despite this ample evidence of wrongdoing, the President attempted to  impede the Russia probe at every step of the way. The U.S. intelligence  community, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Robert Mueller and  his team of investigators have done a great service to our Nation in  investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and Russian  interference in our election. The findings further confirm that  President Trump not only benefitted from Russian interference but, as  Anne Gearan wrote in the October 15 Washington Post story, President  Trump ``has also disputed, at times, the U.S. intelligence community's  conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost his  candidacy, and he only reluctantly signed a bill imposing sanctions on  Russia for the transgression after weeks of resisting the measure,  which he called, `seriously flawed.'''   Anne Gearan is referencing the Countering America's Adversaries  Through Sanctions Act, known by the acronym CAATSA, or C-A-A-T-S-A.  That is legislation that I supported, and it passed both Houses of  Congress with bipartisan support to impose sanctions on U.S.  adversaries, including Russia, for its incursions into Ukraine and  Syria and interference in our elections.   I believe it is likely that if CAATSA did not clearly prohibit it,  President Trump would have removed preexisting Russia sanctions by now.   So the evidence is clear. By interfering in our national elections  and  [[Page S6637]]  elevating Donald Trump's prospects for success as a candidate, Vladimir  Putin was assuring that a personal ally would be installed in the White  House and that that particular ally would clear the way for Putin to  advance his foreign policy goals around the world.   Let me move to a second--or, I should say, a third--part of this. If  it isn't bad enough that the President is himself undermining our  intelligence community's findings, he has deployed Attorney General  William Barr to try and discredit those findings--those findings by our  intelligence community with regard to interactions with allies.   William Barr has been traveling the world chasing conspiracy theories  and investigating President Trump's complaints about the origins of the  government's investigation into Russian election interference.  Specifically, the Attorney General is examining whether U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement agencies acted properly when they  examined possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which  ultimately led to Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. We have  learned that this probe is now a criminal investigation, suggesting  that it is focused on the unfounded allegations pushed by the  President's allies about how the Russia probe was started.   Considering that Special Counsel Mueller, the intelligence community,  and the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee all confirmed in great  detail that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, it is entirely  unclear what legal or factual predicate Attorney General Barr is even  relying on to justify this criminal investigation into the origins of  the government's investigation into Russia's election interference.   Attorney General Barr is pursuing these efforts, despite the fact  that Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated that Italy's  intelligence services played no role in the Russian investigation. It  appears that Attorney General Barr is using the Justice Department to  chase unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that could benefit the  President politically and also undermine Special Counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia investigation.   The Attorney General has also demonstrated eagerness to prejudge his  own investigation by already telling lawmakers in April that he  believed that ``spying did occur'' by the FBI on the Trump campaign. So  the President has dispatched a top U.S. law enforcement official around  the world to pursue a biased investigation into an effort to undermine  our intelligence agencies and to undermine the work of a special  counsel who was appointed by the very same Justice Department that  Attorney General Barr leads, with the primary goal--the primary goal-- being to clear Vladimir Putin's government of wrongdoing. It is hard to  comprehend or adequately articulate how disturbing that is.    Let me move to another part of the evidence with regard to how the  President deals with President Putin and his government--the Helsinki  summit. President Trump's dangerous deference to Vladimir Putin was  most evident at the July 2018 summit in Helsinki. Putin and President  Trump had a 2-hour one-on-one meeting, followed by an unprecedented  press conference.   President Trump appears to overwhelmingly favor one-on-one, closed- door, direct communications with Putin on a regular basis. I have to  ask at least two questions, among many we could ask. Question No. 1 is,  What is he hiding? No. 2 is, Why not have experienced U.S. personnel  present at such bilateral meetings?   Even more disturbing were the President's statements following the  Trump-Putin meeting. Here is a brief summary of what happened at that  meeting:   President Trump praised Putin and his leadership.   No. 2, he repeatedly sided with Putin over our intelligence  community, asserting that Russia did not, in fact, interfere in the  2016 elections. The President repeatedly siding with Putin over our  intelligence community was a grave offense by the President that made  our Nation less safe--in my judgment, for sure less safe. It was one of  the worst moments in any American Presidency.   No. 3 in my brief summary of that public meeting in Helsinki is that  Mr. Putin was silent the whole time when this was happening.   President Trump's rambling comments over several minutes reflect not  only the President's disturbing desire to flatter and to show support  for Putin but also his complete failure--in that instance, his complete  failure--to advance U.S. interests.   Let me move to the impeachment that is underway regarding Ukraine.   The transcript of the now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian  President Volodymyr Zelensky that is the subject of the current  impeachment inquiry also reflects the President's failure to prioritize  U.S. national security interests when it comes to Russia.   Going back to Anne Gearan and the Washington Post story of October 15  of this year, she wrote: ``During that call, Trump did not mention  longstanding U.S. policy goals for Ukraine, including standing up to  Russian pressure, and he may have tarred and weakened Zelensky and his  winning anti-corruption platform by dragging him into domestic U.S.  politics.''   Such major omissions send a clear signal to Putin that he could  expand his aggression in Ukraine beyond Crimea and to the Ukrainian  people and also the message to the Ukrainian people that Zelensky is  not going to be the strong leader with U.S. backing that Ukraine needs  at this time.   We have already seen the impact of President Trump's abandonment of  Ukraine amid this impeachment scandal. In early October, President  Zelensky was effectively backed into a corner to sign Ukraine on to the  so-called Steinmeier Formula, which sets the path toward elections in  the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine and eventual negotiations with  Russia over the future of Russian-occupied territories. He did this  without achieving previously imposed preconditions of Russian troop  withdrawal and security for the elections.   Zelensky was effectively shamed into pursuing this Steinmeier Formula  after President Trump urged him to negotiate with Putin--with Putin-- several times on camera during the United Nations General Assembly  meetings in September. As Anne Gearan puts it, ``The result: A country  that was looking for strong U.S. backing, amid worries that Russia  could seek to move its aggression beyond the annexation of Crimea, has  been left to wonder about the Trump administration's commitment to its  national interests.''   Let me move to Syria. President Trump's latest moves in Syria only  further amplify the alarm over this President's affinity for Vladimir  Putin.   In early October, President Trump announced the abrupt withdrawal of  U.S. troops from Syria, clearing the way for Turkey to pursue a  military operation against Kurdish allies of the United States in  northern Syria. Following an initial U.S.-brokered ceasefire, Turkish  and Russian authorities have agreed to a more permanent status, sharing  control of Syria's northern border.   Turkish and Russian forces are not only occupying Kurdish-held areas  but also further expanding Russia's role in Syria and committing war  crimes against Kurdish civilians, according to the United Nations.   Russia has already occupied U.S. military camps in the region, and  Turkish President Erdogan's deepening relationship with Vladimir  Putin--as evidenced by Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile  system--only undercuts U.S. influence in Syria, all but guaranteeing  that U.S. interests will not be represented in a future Syrian  political settlement.   President Trump's decision serves to benefit Vladimir Putin. Prior to  withdrawal, the United States was Russia's only military equal in  Syria, but Russia is now the primary and, according to some analysts,  the sole power broker in Syria.   In the vacuum left by the United States, Putin will be able to return  control of the country to Bashar al-Assad, exercise increased control  over Turkey--a NATO ally--and return to Russia's Cold War-era dominance  in the Middle East.   As Georgetown University Russia specialist Andrew Bennett put it,  ``[W]hat is clear is that Russia and the [Bashar al-] Assad regime that  it backs have been the big winners in Trump's abrupt retreat. . . .  Now, suddenly  [[Page S6638]]  Putin is back in the driver's seat in Syria, with leverage over all  sides.''    Mr. President, it is even worse than that. Let me recount some recent  news with regard to actions by Vladimir Putin.   President Trump's transgression goes beyond simply allowing Russia to  fill a vacuum. On October 13, just 2 days before Anne Gearan's  Washington Post story, the New York Times reported that ``the Russian  Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush  the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad.''   The Times published evidence in that story that the Russians bombed  four Syrian hospitals in a 12-hour period in May of this year. During  the assault, the Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital in Idlib Province was  struck four times in 30 minutes. Let me say that again. A hospital was  struck four times in 30 minutes. Dozens of hospitals and clinics in  Idlib Province have been struck since, and Syrian medical workers live  in constant fear of the next strike.   Russia continues to act with impunity. Not only did it bomb another  hospital in Idlib last week, Russia is using its sway at the United  Nations Security Council--where U.S. leadership has diminished  significantly under this administration--to limit the scope and the  impact of a U.N. inquiry into these bombings.   Such atrocities go beyond the pale of violating the Geneva  Conventions and the laws of war; they demonstrate just how ruthless  Putin and his regime are and the lengths they are willing to go to  assert Russia's influence in the Middle East. The tragedy is, this  administration is allowing it to happen. Under this administration, we  have seen U.S. leadership erode and multilateral institutions  deteriorate to the point where the U.N. is powerless to hold Russia  accountable for these atrocities.   I cannot emphasize enough that this administration is not only  failing the American people with regard to our relationship with Russia  and national security interests, but it is also making us less safe by  allowing unspeakable atrocities to occur against innocent civilians-- all on our watch.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge immediate passage of  the bipartisan FUTURE Act, which is H.R. 2486, to restore critical  funding for historically Black colleges and universities, known by the  acronym here in Washington as HBCUs, as well as minority-serving  institutions, so-called MSIs.   The $255 million in funding that HBCUs and MSIs rely on lapsed on  September 30 of this year. Both the historically Black colleges and  universities and the minority-serving institutions are underresourced  and don't have the flexibility to operate in the red in the hopes of  potential reimbursement later on.   Campuses are already feeling this impact. Just 2 weeks after this  program expired, some campuses notified employees that their positions  and programs may be terminated. We are talking about real people losing  their jobs and programs being cut that play a critical role in  graduating and retaining students in the STEM field--science,  technology, engineering, and math fields. All of this is impacting  students across the country. Presidents of some of these institutions  have told us that planning has ``all but stopped.'' This funding lapse  is urgent, and it must be addressed now.   From the perspective of my home State of Pennsylvania, we have two of  the oldest historically Black colleges and universities--two of the  oldest in the whole country--Cheyney University, as well as Lincoln  University, and, in addition to that, a growing Hispanic-serving  institution, in this case, the Reading Area Community College.   We know that the investment made by the FUTURE Act will support  college completion and academic opportunities at these and all  historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving  institutions across the country. The FUTURE Act is fully paid for. It  would not add to the deficit. It has strong bipartisan support in both  Chambers.   My colleagues in the majority are holding this funding hostage in an  effort to pass what I would argue is a partisan bill. That is not just  my argument or my opinion; some of my Republican colleagues have said  this is the reason they are holding up this critical legislation.   Instead of passing a bipartisan comprehensive reauthorization of our  future higher education law, which my colleague Senator Murray is  pushing for, some Republicans want to force Democrats to support a  partisan bill.   Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to fix our current system  so it works better for students, families, and teachers, they want us  to support a so-called micropackage, the Student Aid Improvement Act.  This act, in my judgment and the judgment of others, fails to address a  number of critical areas, including improved campus safety and access  to higher education affordability and accountability. Because of that,  it maintains the status quo.   Make no mistake, the Student Aid Improvement Act is a partisan bill.  The bill fails to address the challenges students are facing in  obtaining a college degree--including childcare, housing, food and  mental health, among others--nor does it address the needs of first- generation students, students of color, and students with disabilities.  [[Page S6646]]    Let's debate these issues. Let's come to the table to negotiate on a  bipartisan overhaul, but let's not hold historically Black colleges and  universities and minority-serving institutions hostage in the meantime.  We can get something done in the short run that would be beneficial to  these institutions.   We need to ensure that colleges and universities have the resources  to provide support to all students they serve, including students with  disabilities. A couple of examples of some of my bills--the Higher  Education Mental Health Act, which is supported by over 250 college and  university presidents, including 15 of the historically Black colleges  and universities--would help institutions of higher education identify  the resources and services needed to support their students with mental  health needs.   A second bill of mine, the RISE Act, would make it easier for  colleges to provide support to students with disabilities by accepting  student assessments from high school and smoothing the transition to  higher education.   A third bill, my Expanding Disability Access to Higher Education Act,  would increase the funding for TRIO Programs that serve first- generation students with disabilities and make higher education more  accessible.   These bills would provide the resources needed for students to be  successful as they pursue higher education, but without a comprehensive  bill, the needs of these students will continue to go unmet. Rather  than blocking vital resources from flowing to our Nation's historically  Black colleges and universities, we should immediately pass the FUTURE  Act. This would restore funding, while providing us time to work on a  comprehensive reauthorization that addresses the needs of all students.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as in legislative  session, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar  No. 212, H.R. 2486. I ask unanimous consent that the Murray amendment  at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read  a third time and passed; and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just want  to make a couple of comments by way of response.   I really want to go back to what we said earlier. There is no reason  we can't at least get this piece of legislation done. I will say it  again: These institutions are underresourced. They don't have the  flexibility to operate in the red in the hopes of potential  reimbursement later on.   We are also told by the institutions themselves that planning has  ``all but stopped.'' Campuses are feeling this impact already. Just 2  weeks after this program expired, some campuses informed employees that  their positions and programs may be terminated. So I would argue that  the present circumstance is not acceptable.   I realize the chairman wants to proceed to other issues, and I  respect that, but when you consider what he is proposing, there are  some changes that should be pointed out.   First of all, when considering the proposal he has, in comparing what  it would do, for example, on the Second Chance Pell proposal, that only  contains a limited repeal of the ban rather than a full repeal of the  ban. Any reference to the JOBS Act making short-term programs eligible  for Pell grants--a bipartisan bill that was introduced--excludes for- profit colleges. In this micropackage that the chairman is proposing,  the for-profit colleges are added back in.   No. 3, just by way of some examples, in the Grassley-Smith bill on  financial aid award letters, some changes were made to that on  financial aid award letters that weren't contemplated by the bill's  original authors.   Our legislation is fully paid for. It reinvests up to $55 million in  recovery programs. For several reasons, by way of contrast but also by  way of what is happening right now with regard to these institutions-- for those and other reasons, I object.    Just a couple of points on where we are: There is no  question that, in my judgment, if you have more time to consider these  issues for a full reauthorization, we could address some of the  shortcomings that have been proposed already. I mentioned earlier  issues that are not addressed, such as childcare, housing, food and  mental health, the needs of first-generation students, needs of  students of color, and students with disabilities. We can do that if we  can get through this short-term period. We are asking for help only for  a very limited timeframe so that we can work through these other  issues.   The second point I would make is, I can't stand in the shoes of the  leaders of these institutions, but when they tell us that they are in a  difficult circumstance in the short run, I will take their word for it.  The word of the Department of Education--just from my point of view-- doesn't compare to what these institutions are telling us. So I think  we should rely upon the representations by the leaders of the  institutions and act in a short-term fashion, all the while committing  ourselves to have a longer process to fully explore and try to reach  consensus on a range of issues that come under the broad purview of  reauthorization.
