 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2615, the  Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act. The Gulf Islands  National Seashore is a national park that draws millions of visitors to  the islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf Islands National  Seashore includes the Mississippi barrier islands of Petit Bois, Horn,  East and West Ship, and Cat, as well as the Davis Bayou Area. I am  proud to have this important park, its natural beaches, historic sites,  and wildlife sanctuaries within my district.   The Gulf Islands National Seashore has been a part of the Mississippi  Gulf Coast community since Congress established the park in 1971. Since  that establishment, the Gulf Islands National Seashore has worked  closely with the Mark Seymour Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW Post 5699.  In fact, the post has shared a road with the seashore for the better  part of the last 30 years.   The Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act would make  permanent a 30-year easement that has provided an access road and  driveway for the VFW. In exchange, the VFW will give the Gulf Islands  National Seashore some of its acreage, which includes valuable  wetlands. The Gulf Islands National Seashore and the Mark Seymour VFW  both strongly support this land exchange, but the Department of the  Interior needs congressional approval before it can make the land  exchange official.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I encourage the House to pass this bill as  a suspension vote. I would also like to thank the subcommittee chairman  as well as Chairman Bishop and the ranking member of the Committee on  Natural Resources for their support and help in bringing this bill to  the floor.
