 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay special recognition to Army  Specialist Michael Marteney for an incredible act of heroism. While off  duty, Specialist Marteney displayed remarkable selflessness and courage  in the rescue and treatment of a fatally wounded civilian.   On May 27, 2017, a motor home traveling in Oak Grove, Kentucky,  collided with a civilian building. With complete disregard for his own  personal safety, Michael pulled his car over to the site of the  accident and rushed to the scene. The front of the motor home was  crushed, and Michael saw that the driver had life-threatening injuries  to his head and leg.   With gasoline still rapidly spilling from the vehicle, Michael was  able to gain access to the passenger side of the motor home and fashion  a makeshift tourniquet. Oak Grove Police Officer Sergeant Havens  arrived on scene and handed Michael a combat application tourniquet,  which he swiftly applied.   Despite the imminence of fire or explosion, Michael went into the  back of the motor home to locate a first-aid kit. Michael conveyed  lifesaving information to EMS about the driver's disposition that  prompted the call for immediate flight evacuation services.   If Specialist Michael Marteney had not taken control of the situation  and implemented key medical assistance, the wounded driver would not  have survived the trauma sustained.   I am honored to recognize Specialist Marteney's lifesaving actions,  an inspiring illustration of the good will of others and the  consequences of brave deeds. I thank Specialist Marteney for his  bravery and all others in Oak Grove who were involved in the rescue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Senator Jim Bunning. I met Senator Bunning in 1983, when I was 10 years  old. He was running for Governor. At the time, he was a State senator  in Kentucky, and my grandfather was chairman of the Republican Party of  Monroe County.   So when he ran for Governor, my grandfather was the chairman of the  county for his election. And I went up to him, a 10-year-old boy, and I  had my baseball in my hand--because that is what you did when you saw  Jim Bunning, you gave him a baseball to sign--and I said: ``Mr.  Bunning, I am like you. We have two things in common.'' I said: ``I am  a fan of sports and a fan of politics.''   And he laughed and patted me on the head, and he said: ``We are going  to get along just fine.'' And he figured out who I was, who my  grandfather was, and we stayed close through the years.   When I ran for State representative in 2000, he was one of the first  people to call and encourage me and offer his support. I won that  election. I served in the Kentucky General Assembly. He was always a  supporter. He was always there for me.   I ran for commissioner of agriculture in another statewide office,  and he was always there for me. I think the world of Jim Bunning just  because I knew him and I knew that he cared and he remembered things.   In 2004, he was running for reelection for the U.S. Senate, and it  was a tough election. It was a very close election. In fact, there were  120 counties in the State. With 118 counties in, he was behind in that  election. And there were two counties left, Metcalfe County and Monroe  County, two counties in my State House district. So he knew he was  going to win because he won those counties by 4-to-1 margins.   So every time I would see him, he would remind me that he is in the  Senate because of those counties in south central Kentucky. Most  politicians probably wouldn't remember that, but he did.   So I am honored to stand here tonight with Representative Barr and  show my support and appreciation for Jim Bunning. Kentucky is a better  State because of the leadership of U.S. Senator Jim Bunning.
