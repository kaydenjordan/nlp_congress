 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of human life and  protections for newborn infants. This should be a noncontroversial  thing. Newborn babies deserve access to medical care.   In the weeks since Democrats blocked the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act in the Senate, my House colleagues have called  for a vote on this important, commonsense legislation. I am a proud  cosponsor of Congresswoman Ann Wagner's bill to define any infant who  survives an abortion as a legal person and ensure the baby receives the  same medical care that any newborn receives.   This is in stark contrast to the legislation just passed in the State  of New York and the proposal in the State of Virginia which legalizes  late-term abortion even up until birth. These radical attempts  demonstrate that this is a human rights issue that we must address.   Protecting the dignity of human life upholds our society's highest  values, and denying lifesaving medical care for newborn babies should  defy our Nation's collective conscience.
