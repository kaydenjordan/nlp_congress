 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The gentleman makes a very good point. Are we here condemning two  sheriffs from California getting shot while sitting in their car? No.   Are we here talking about the innocent lives that are being killed  night after night in Chicago or other cities? No.   Are we here, in the last hours before this body rushes to the airport  to leave, to debate the help that we need for COVID, for those who are  unemployed, or the small businesses that are going to continue to lay  off somebody or are wondering whether they can survive the next day, or  for the schools wondering if they will have the resources they need, or  the States? No, we are not doing that.   We are not doing any of that. But I will make this one promise to  you: If the majority was on the other side, we would have already done  that.   Madam Speaker, Democrats are neglecting the real issues.   Month after month, they have refused to end our dependence on China  or even acknowledge that the Chinese Communist Party is a national  security threat.   I have read it in the paper. We have heard it out in the public  domain that the Communist Chinese Party wants to influence the election  even. They have picked a side.   Now, in January, Democrats were too busy impeaching the President to  pay attention to what was happening in Wuhan.   There is a common denominator here. Let's just go through the  calendar.   In January, they were too busy with impeaching.   In February, they backed out of what should have been a bipartisan  China Task Force. They actually said yes. The Washington Post actually  had the article written. The members were already chosen. But the hour  came, and the Democrats thought that was wrong.   Then, let's move to May. Speaker Pelosi said focusing on China is a  diversion. I look forward to hearing what the Speaker says about this  resolution. Is that a diversion from solving the COVID relief that we  need?   In June, Chairman Smith of the Committee on Armed Services on this  very floor, just over at that mic, said this about China: It is not  actually their job to tell the American people about the coronavirus.   Seriously? Those were the words that were spoken by the chair of the  Armed Services Committee.   In July, Chairman Schiff--remember who he is and what role he has. He  is the chairman of the Committee on Intelligence. He said it was an  escalation for the Trump administration to close down the Chinese  consulate that was, according to the Secretary of State, the hub of  spying and IP theft in Houston. He was the only one who thought that.    And now, today, while Democrats deny the real threat of Communist  China, they are delaying a coronavirus relief package because they  despise the President.   I heard a Member here, Madam Speaker, who said we are adults, so we  think differently. You know what adults do? They give adult  supervision, and they focus on things that are important.   We only have a few hours left before people leave. I know Madam  Speaker told us before August that we will not leave unless we get a  COVID relief package.   I am not sure if I should believe her then or believe her now,  because I know people are going to leave in a few short hours.   I know, as the majority, you have the power to schedule what comes to  the floor. That was one of my jobs. So this is what they picked? This  is what we are doing? Seriously?   My question to the Democrats is simple: Is debating a nonbinding  resolution the best use of our hour? Apparently, you have made that  decision. You thought long and hard long before we came to this moment  in time. You spent hours on this.   I will promise you this: There is no kitchen in America that thinks  this is the priority.   What makes today's resolution so harmful is it does not stop  discrimination. It simply spreads disinformation.   At the heart of this resolution is an absurd notion that referring to  the virus as the Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as  contributing to violence against Asian Americans, which I will tell you  nobody on this side of the aisle supports.   In fact, we have heard time and again--I just heard from my colleague  on the other side. The Democrat-led Foreign Affairs Committee held a  hearing titled ``The Wuhan Coronavirus'' in February.                                time  1015    Should we put an ethics complaint? Are Democrats saying that their  own committee members are encouraging discrimination against Asian  Americans?   Likewise, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, The Guardian, all other  major media outlets were referring to COVID-19 as the Wuhan coronavirus  long before most Americans knew what it was.   Now, let's put this in contrast, because you are wasting our time;  you are spending hours on it. You think it is the most important thing,  when someone is sitting there in the unemployment line or a small  business is questioning whether they can stay open. So let's take this  moment in time on this floor talking about it.   Republicans condemn crime and discrimination in all forms. Listen to  what the President said in March: ``spreading of the virus is not their  fault in any way, shape, or form.'' But I guess you can't take his word  for it, so let's waste another hour on this floor on a nonbinding  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I wonder--because every Member who comes here works  hard to get here, I wonder the number of times Members in a debate said  they would take their time to have nonbinding resolutions on the floor.  I wonder the number of promises they made. Because I listened, Madam  Speaker, to the Speaker up there when I handed her the gavel on what  they said they would focus on.   I have spent a lot of time trying to wonder what one problem this  Democrat majority has solved. I have actually asked Democrats: Name me  one that you solved.   I haven't read a tweet from probably the most prominent of the new  party's chief of staff. They had the same question. They couldn't  answer it.  [[Page H4502]]    The President's words express what every good and decent American has  known from the beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for  COVID-19.   Let me be very clear. Let me state that again. The President's words  express what every good and decent American has known from the  beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for COVID-19.   Now, let me tell you everything else every American understands. We  have an economic problem. We have people unemployed. We have small  businesses questioning whether they can stay open. We have schools that  are wondering could they have the money to be able to open again.   But you chose an hour of this time on the last day before we leave to  debate a nonbinding resolution. Congratulations. Well done. You fought  hard for a majority, and this is what you decided.   Unfortunately, while Democrats waste an hour of the House's time on  this ridiculous resolution, the opportunity costs of the inaction are  rising. And do you know who is paying the price? The American people.   For months, every reasonable American has understood that America  must end our dependency on China; we must move our supply chain out of  China for critical needs like medicine.   Do you realize we don't make penicillin? We don't make vitamins here,  personal protective equipment that we strive so hard to get, and  technology.   The American people want safety and security. They want to return to  the American way of life.   I am not sure what this nonbinding resolution does, but I know we  have done a lot of them since you have taken the majority.   Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to hack our  vaccine research at this very moment. That is why I introduced  legislation earlier this summer to sanction these cybercriminals. My  bill had real consequences.   And you know what is so unique? I introduced the bill because there  were reports out there that Russia, China, Iran wanted to hack our  universities, our businesses to get that vaccine, not to work with us,  but to steal it.   Do you know what happens when they do that? It slows the process  down.   Do you know what happens when it slows the process down? It takes  longer before people have a safe vaccine that would cure this virus.   It is very interesting. That moment on the floor, the day after I  introduced it, we actually--the FBI found two Chinese who were doing  this, coming into our country, slowing the process down.   We had the opportunity to have a motion to recommit on this floor.  Nobody in America thought that bill would be partisan. It would only  sanction those people who were caught, about right and wrong, about the  safety, the security, a safe and effective vaccine being slowed down  because of a foreign country coming in. So, as one, we had an  opportunity to do something about it.   Do you know what happened? The Democrats voted against it and  defeated it. Not only did they defeat it, let me tell you, again, what  the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said about it. He stood up  at that microphone. He literally said it is not actually their job to  tell the American people about the virus, referring to China, while  they are hacking our own companies working to provide a safe and  effective vaccine.   You wouldn't spend 1 minute on that, but you are spending an hour on  this. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident.   Madam Speaker, the majority won't even work with the Republicans to  protect our vaccine research from hackers, and they will attack the  very companies that are working around the clock to provide that safe  and effective vaccine for the American people.   They won't work with Republicans to restore American manufacturing to  rebuild the American medical supply right here, but they will call the  House back into session to debate conspiracy theories about the post  office.   And while we were here in that emergency meeting--and, Madam Speaker,  I should probably talk about it, because there were a lot of Democrats  who didn't come even though it was an emergency meeting called by the  Speaker. I think it was one-third of all of them did not come.    But while we were here, that one moment, the one opportunity that the  Republicans had, we offered a motion, a motion to recommit, to put up  funding for COVID relief. Once again, the Democrats did the exact same  thing.   Instead of stopping the hackers from China, what they said no to,  instead of giving another COVID relief bill that opportunity--because  we were in an emergency, it was the only time we were coming back, even  though, Madam Speaker, the Speaker said we would not leave--they voted  it down. They voted it down, the only window that we had.   They won't even work with Republicans on what was supposed to be a  bipartisan China task force, but they wasted an hour on a nonbinding  resolution.   Is this how you expect to manage the Chamber? Is this why you took  the majority, to waste the American people's time?   Madam Speaker, it is time for us to stop acting like the House of  resolutions and start acting like the House of Representatives.   Make no mistake: China aims to displace America as the world's  economic superpower. If they succeed, we will have more than viruses to  worry about.   The stakes are too high for petty partisanship. If we want safety, if  we want independence, we know what we have to do. We have to rebuild  our economy, bring back our supply chain, protect our vaccine research  and, yes, end our dependency on China.   Our President is doing that. House Republicans have made a commitment  to America to do just that. We have done it time and again, bringing  the idea to the floor. Unfortunately, the majority has thought  otherwise.   Madam Speaker, I make this promise to you: If the sides change, if we  have the opportunity and the privilege to determine what comes to this  floor, we will not waste America's time in a time of crisis. We will  not tell people they will not leave and then let them go. We will not  have Members call it an emergency meeting and let them stay home.   We believe Congress is essential. We believe the American public  expects that.   Madam Speaker, we have a COVID crisis. We have an economy crisis. We  have a dependency on China that harms us when it comes to our health  issues. We have hackers from foreign nations trying to slow a safe and  effective vaccine. We have schoolkids that continue to learn from home,  not in school. We have veterans who want to be able to pick their own  doctors. We have an infrastructure that is crumbling, but a 5-year plan  to make a difference. These are all the problems that, if the majority  would switch, would be addressed.   But no, today, on our last day this week, we will once again have a  nonbinding resolution.   I hope you fought hard for this majority. I hope you spent a lot of  time and a lot of hours deciding what would come to the floor. But if  this is what it is, you have fallen well short of what America expects  of this Chamber.
