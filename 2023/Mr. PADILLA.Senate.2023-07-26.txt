 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  outstanding academic achievement on the world stage by none other than  two California students. Earlier this month, the 2023 International  Biology Olympiad--IBO--showcased the remarkable talents and  encyclopedic knowledge of pre-university students in the field of  theoretical and laboratory biology.   To even qualify was a challenge, but after competing in a field of 44  States, over 600 schools, and nearly 10,000 students at the national  competition and then competing among their peers from over 80 countries  at the international level, two California students stood out. Richard  Zhu of North Hollywood Senior High School earned a silver medal, while  Yufei Chen of University High School in Irvine not only earned a gold  medal, he earned the highest score in the world.   Both students demonstrated a remarkable intellect, a refreshing  passion in the field of STEM, and an example for every other California  student to follow to achieve their dreams. I can't wait to see where  their talents will lead them next.   Congratulations, once again, to Yufei Chen and Richard Zhu, on the  hard-earned and well-deserved recognition.                            ____________________
