 Madam Speaker, I don't know what my friend from Indiana  is talking about.   I do know this: Thank God the Democrats insisted that this bill help  the small businesses intended to be supported. Too many big guys got  supported over the little guys, and that is what we are trying to fight  for today.   Second point, we have got to help State and local governments. They  cannot be allowed to go bankrupt. That is social Darwinism at its  worst.   And, thirdly, we have got to help our postal workers and the Postal  Service who serve all Americans.
