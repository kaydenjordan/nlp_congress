 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to Calendar No. 57, S.J. Res. 15.    Madam President, I will be back a little later to  debate the resolution.   For the information of my colleagues, we expect a vote on passage of  the joint resolution of disapproval around 5:30 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I am on the floor to urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the resolution that we  will be voting on shortly. This is a resolution to protect all of our  constituents against predatory lenders--people who lend others money at  loan shark rates and often in deceptive language that can be very  confusing to consumers until they get the phone call, and they are told  they owe unaffordable amounts on loans.   And States have been working very hard to protect consumers. In fact,  45 States--States with Republican Governors and Democratic Governors,  Republican attorneys general and Democratic attorneys general--45  States and the District of Columbia have passed laws to protect their  constituents, their consumers from these loan shark-type loans, from  these predatory lending practices.   But we have seen these predatory lenders find a way around these  State efforts to protect their consumers. And the tactic they used has  come to be known as ``rent-a-bank.'' And the way it works is that  national banks can make loans into any State, even if they are not  chartered in that State. And so what has happened is, some of these  lenders then go to a national bank and essentially just borrow their  name, buy the rights to their name and, using that mechanism, then can  make loans into all 50 States, in violation of the State law  protections against these usurious loans. That is what is happening  now.   Now, when this whole problem began to emerge, we saw the Federal  Governor take action. In fact, the minute the OCC and the FDIC and  State governments caught wind of this new trick in the loan shark  playbook, they took action. In fact, under President George W. Bush,  the OCC--the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--called these  ``rent-a-bank'' schemes ``an abuse of the national bank charter.'' And  President Bush's Comptroller of the Currency explained that the OCC was  ``greatly concerned with arrangements in which national banks  essentially rent out their charters.''   And that stance and that position was echoed by State legislatures-- again, legislatures from both parties, Governors from both parties who  then worked to pass laws, State laws, to limit the amount that people  could charge as interest rates on loans.   In fact, just last year, in the State of Nebraska, voters passed a  ballot initiative with more than 70 percent support to cap interest  rates at 36 percent on consumer loans. That is the same cap we have in  my State of Maryland and the same cap that more and more States are  adopting across the country. So States are taking measures to protect  their constituents, their consumers, against these end-runs around  their laws designed to prohibit these predatory practices.   But last October, in the middle of the pandemic, when many working  families were plunged into economic uncertainty and turmoil, the former  administration--the Trump administration--  [[Page S2437]]  gave these ``rent-a-bank'' schemes a free pass to exploit these  loopholes again, to create an end-run around those State protections  for their consumers.   In the last administration--the Trump administration--the OCC  unveiled what they called the true lender rule. Well, it is a nice- sounding name, an innocent name, but the consequence of that is to  unleash the full force of predatory lending on working families. And it  reneges on and reverses decades of both State and Federal government  policy to prevent this end-run on usury caps.   What we have seen is predatory lenders move quickly into the space  when the Trump administration opened the door to it. One online lender  recently told its investors that it was going to get around  California's new interest rate cap by making loans through ``bank  sponsors that are not subject to the same proposed State level rate  limitations.''   So what you do is you go to a national bank, and you essentially rent  their name. And by doing that, you create a loophole that allows you to  avoid the State laws that have been put in place to protect against  this kind of predatory lending. And we are seeing that now emerge like  wildfire around the country.   I do want to be clear, there are many innovative fintech  partnerships. These are lenders who use the internet. There are many  who are not exhibiting these kind of predatory behaviors. And we should  craft a rule that allows legitimate lending consistent with State laws  through those fintech practices.   But the way this rule was written during the Trump administration, it  opens the door to all the bad actors. It opens the door wide to the  predatory lenders to exploit this loophole.   And that is why we are on the floor today, because this resolution is  designed to stop the predatory lending practices that were unleashed by  the OCC rule. It is to shut the door on that Trump administration OCC  rule that now has allowed predatory lenders to rush through it.   And what we are seeing now are rates of 100 percent, 200 percent-- whatever they want. I mean, the sky is the limit. Some of these  interest rates would make loan sharks blush.   So we just saw, in fact, one OCC-regulated bank that has been helping  a short-term lending company pilot an online ``rent-a-bank''  installment loan program that runs at 179-percent APR. And the OCC rule  is being litigated in court right now to defend a $67,000 loan to a  restaurant owner at a 268-percent APR rate that violates the State law  where that restaurant is.   So this is a perfect example of where a small restaurant owner took  out a loan--$67,000--deceptively portrayed, only to discover that it  was 268 percent APR. And when the restaurant owner says, ``Wait a  minute, I thought the limit in our State was 36 percent,'' all of a  sudden they discover that the Trump OCC opened the door to this end-run  against their State law protections.   That is why we have State attorneys general from red States and blue  States, from Nebraska and North Carolina, who have called these ``rent- a-bank'' schemes a ``sham'' and urged us to act. They wrote to us here  in the Senate, saying:         The most efficient course to prevent unrestrained abuse and       avert immediate and ongoing consumer harm would be for       Congress to invalidate the [True Lender] Rule pursuant to its       remedial oversight powers under the Congressional Review Act.    That is what we will be voting on soon. North Carolina's attorney  general, Josh Stein, just also said in a separate statement:         We need every tool at our disposal to uphold state law and       stop [predatory lenders] from coming back into our state[s].    I hope that we will act right now to stop what is a rush by many of  these predatory lenders to exploit the opening created by the Trump  administration's OCC. Then let's take a pause. Let's take time to craft  a proper rule that allows legitimate lenders to make loans in ways that  do not violate the State protections for the consumers and do not, at  the end of the day, wreak havoc with families who get sucked into  unsuspecting terms through deceptive practices. So I urge the U.S.  Senate to vote to pass this resolution to protect consumers around the  country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, if I could just actually say one more  thing, this has been something that the Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs Committee has been working on. We held a number of hearings on  this. And I do just want to thank my friend and colleague, the chairman  of that committee, Senator Brown from Ohio, who has been a stalwart in  protecting consumers. I don't know if he has been to the floor yet, but  I just wanted to thank him and other members of the committee for their  efforts and also thank the Biden administration, which just sent down a  statement of administration support for overturning the OCC rule and  for voting in favor of this resolution.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
