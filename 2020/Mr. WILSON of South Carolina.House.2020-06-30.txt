 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the  Paycheck Protection Program, PPP, which has been crucial to helping  families, small businesses, and communities maintain and promote jobs.   President Donald Trump's leadership of achieving record job growth,  and now job recovery, is appreciated.   This program has helped 4.4 million small businesses procure loans,  and over $511 billion has been processed in aid. The deadline to apply  for the loans is today, and so far, these loans have been great news  for small businesses making a difference for jobs. I am thankful that  the Paycheck Protection Program has been so widely successful to  support small businesses and maintain jobs in the midst of the global  pandemic of the Wuhan virus.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never  forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
