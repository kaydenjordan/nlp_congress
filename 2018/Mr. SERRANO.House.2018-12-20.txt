 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  this time. For me, this is a very simple thought; it is the same  thought I have had all along; this country, of all countries, should  not be building a wall. This country, the land of opportunity, the land  of freedom, the land where people come to build a new life, should not  be building a wall.   So what do we do? There isn't the support necessary for building the  wall, for funding it. So at the last minute, we sneak it into a so- called must-pass bill, or otherwise, you shut the government down.   But the President has already said that he doesn't mind taking credit  or taking responsibility for shutting this government down. This is  very simple.   People say, well, there is aid here, disaster aid. We have been  dealing with this disaster issue now for over a year, and still, we  don't do the right thing.   This is simple for me. We can't build a wall. This wall will be a  waste of money. I don't know who, but as we speak here, there are  people already who know how to get over, through, and under the wall.  The wall is not what we need. What we need is immigration reform, and  we need another outlook.   But, lastly, again, I repeat: of all of the countries in the world,  this is the one that can't go down in history as being the greatest  democracy when it builds a wall. And in my city, there is a statue that  says: Give me your tired; give me your poor. But not if they come from  Mexico.
