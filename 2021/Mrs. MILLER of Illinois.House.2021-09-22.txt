 Madam Speaker, from the cradle to the grave,  the mission of House Democrats is a socialist transformation of  America, which will bankrupt our country and make the U.S. dollar  worthless, diminishing the buying power, savings, and pensions of  regular Americans.   House Democrats want to fund their $3.5 trillion spending spree by  raising our taxes and increasing the debt on our children and  grandchildren. After opening our southern border to allow 200,000  illegal immigrants to cross every month, they are now attempting to ram  through amnesty so foreign nationals can vote in our elections.   The crisis in Del Rio, Texas, is the direct result of failed open  border policies of the Biden-Harris administration, which put human  traffickers and cartels in control of our border.   The Bernie Sanders spending plan was produced by socialist Democrats  who have never run a business, signed a paycheck, or kept to a budget.   Our Nation's taxpayers deserve the utmost respect when it comes to  our Federal budget. The Federal Government has no money, except for  what they extort from us and the future of our children and  grandchildren.   Fiscal responsibility is vital for a stable, strong, and long-lasting  economy. Under the Biden administration, inflation continues to  skyrocket and the price of everything from gas to groceries has gone  up.   Gas prices are at their highest since October 2014. Fertilizer prices  are the highest since the financial crisis of 2008.   Crime, especially homicide, is on the rise in our cities, where these  Democrats have pushed to defund the police.   The American people do not want failed politicians who have created  crises upon crises, from our borders to ruinous cities, in charge of  everything and every aspect of our life. We reject the House Democrats'  cradle-to-grave socialist takeover.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding  and for hosting tonight's special order.  [[Page H5083]]    I can attest that the most sacred gift we have is our ability to  create life. Children are the greatest resource of our Nation. It  doesn't matter if the unborn child has a fully-developed heart, arms,  legs, fingers, toes, or pain receptors, at any time during a pregnancy  even until birth, Democrats want to allow abortions, and they plan to  finance it with your tax dollars.   And it is a fact when it is legal and free, it is an inducement to  women who find themselves in a hard spot to have an abortion.   I remember seeing the sonogram of my first child and all six of my  children after that. A sonogram is a window to the womb.   Interestingly, the Democrats are also anti-informed choice. They want  to rush women through and withhold the truth from the pregnant women by  withholding required sonograms. I have spoken to many people involved  in the industry, and women change their minds when they see the baby in  the womb.   Hearing the heartbeat, there is no doubt that my first daughter was a  human being. The party that says ``trust the science'' would have you  doubt the humanity of an unborn child.                                time  2000    The right to life is the first right enumerated in the Declaration of  Independence. House Republicans support a culture that defends innocent  lives and protects the voiceless children in the womb. We also want to  protect the women from making the worst decision of their life. This is  not about protecting women. You are making victims out of the women  also.   Democrats in Congress continue to stand in the way of us protecting  those who cannot protect themselves. The American people from all  faiths and walks of life have to choose what kind of society they want  to live in, one that defends and protects a 9-month baby in the womb or  one that is going to sell its body for parts.   May we fear God's coming wrath and weep and mourn over this great  national sin.
