 Madam Speaker, according to an analysis by Issue One,  House Members running for reelection this year raised $207 million over  the past three months, an average of $3,400 per Member, per day.   Back in Minnesota, people ask me all the time how busy Members of  Congress--compensated by taxpayers--could raise that much money every  single day.   Well, we know the dirty truth around here: Rather than meeting with  constituents, studying policy, writing legislation, or attending  committee meetings, Members of the House and Senate collectively are  spending 10,000 hours per week dialing for dollars or attending  fundraising receptions. It is downright gross.   So that is why my colleague,   Mike Gallagher, and I have introduced  the On the Clock Act. Our bill won't fix America's corrupt campaign  finance system, but it will ensure that Members of Congress spend more  time working for the people and less time raising money for themselves.                            ____________________
