 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come weekly to the Senate whenever  we are in session to give my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, talking about  climate change and, quite often, talking about the climate denial  campaign that prevents us from taking action and, quite often, talking  about the campaign finance problems in our country that make climate  denial effective. Here, in Congress, it is not hard to connect the dots  from campaign finance to climate denial.   The Supreme Court's Republican majority's disastrous Citizens United  decision was requested by the fossil fuel industry, and the fossil fuel  industry took instant advantage of it--almost like they saw it coming.  The industry and its front groups instantly used their new power  conferred by Citizens United to come after politicians--Republicans in  particular. Ask Bob Inglis, who backed responsible climate policies.  Citizens United created new American dark-money emperors, and--no  surprise--the new emperors love their new political power.   Their first payoff was that Republicans in Congress fled from any  legislative action on climate change. Before Citizens United, there  were multiple bipartisan climate bills. Year after year--when I was  here in 2007, 2008, 2009--there were bipartisan climate bills to the  left of you, bipartisan climate bills to the right of you, bipartisan  climate bills cropping up all over. Today, we watch our Republican  President trying to undo curbs on carbon emissions and, to the cheers  of Republicans in Congress, withdrawing the United States from the  historic Paris Agreement. We join Syria and Nicaragua as the only  nations to reject this common cause. That, my friends, is the heavy  hand of fossil fuel influence, driving us into isolation and abdication  of American leadership.   Of course, right now, no Republican can safely sponsor any bill to  limit carbon dioxide emissions, and so none do. Very different than  before the Citizens United decision in January of 2010. That changed  everything. When those five Republican justices opened up unlimited  political spending to the big Republican special interests, that  unlimited political spending was inevitably going to find dark-money  channels. Dark-money channels hide the identity of the political donor,  so that big special interests can pollute our politics with their money  with seemingly clean hands.   The climate denial scheme of the fossil fuel cartel is powered  politically by dark money. Whether through the lure of dark money  coming in for you in a political race or the threat of dark money  coming in against you in a political race, dark money powers climate  denial. Well, we have just learned something new about dark money.   Chairman Graham and I held hearings in our Judiciary Subcommittee on  Crime and Terrorism to look at Russian interference in the recent 2016  election and what it portends for elections to come. Our witnesses  warned us that Russia has strategically manipulated politics in Europe  for decades. They started working in the former Soviet Union countries,  and they expanded to where they are manipulating politics in France,  Germany, Holland, England, and all over Europe. The witnesses warned us  that we in America must be prepared for that. They jumped the Atlantic  to manipulate the 2016 elections, and they are not going away.   One identified weakness of the United States against Russian  influence was this dark money in our politics. Why is that? Well, it is  obvious. Once you allow dark money in, dark is dark. Cash from Vladimir  Putin is no more traceable than cash from Charles and David Koch. One  witness, a former Republican national security official, told us: ``It  is critical that we effectively enforce the campaign finance laws that  would prevent this type of financial influence by foreign actors.''   ``It is critical that we effectively enforce the campaign finance  laws'' against foreign influence by foreign actors.   The two best studies of Russian influence in Western Europe in their  elections and in their politics are ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' by CSIS,  or the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and ``The  Kremlin's Trojan Horses,'' by the Atlantic Council. Both of them report  that Russia takes advantage of nontransparency in campaign financing to  build its shadowy webs of influence and control. If you leave dark- money channels lying around, it is likely that Vladimir Putin and his  oligarchs will find them.   The ``Trojan Horses'' report warns this: ``The Kremlin's blatant  attempts to influence and disrupt the U.S. presidential election should  serve as an inspiration for a democratic push back.'' That is a lower  case ``d'' for ``democratic push back,'' and it points to one key way  we need to push back.   I will quote them again.         Electoral rules should be amended, so that publically       funded political groups, primarily political parties, should       at the very least be required to report their sources of       funding.    That is, end dark money.   Likewise, the ``Kremlin Playbook'' report warns:         Enhancing transparency and the effectiveness of the Western       democratic tools, instruments, and institutions is critical       to resilience against Russian influence.    Enhancing transparency means ending dark money.   Our hearing and these reports reveal another political influence tool  used by the Kremlin: fake news. As we shore up our democracy to defend  against Russia's fake news information warfare, we must remember this:  Climate denial was the original fake news.   To give an example, here is a story that may sound familiar. An  unknown hacker illegally breaks into and steals an organization's  emails. The organization's emails are held until they can be released  at a politically strategic moment. At the strategic moment, emails are  leaked to a website with shady ties. The leaks are then amplified and  spun by fake news, driven into the regular media, and have their  desired political effect. Does any of that sound familiar? Of course,  it is the methodology of the Russians' hack of the Democratic National  Committee, right? Unknown hacker, stolen emails, strategic release,  caching them until they can be used, shady website, fake news spin-up,  regular media takes the bait, political damage.   If you step back and look at just the methodology, we have seen this  pattern before--so-called climategate, the  [[Page S3676]]  fake scandal years ago cooked up by the climate denial machine. It was  2009, not 2017. The organization hacked was not the DNC but the Climate  Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.  The release was timed to the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen, not  the Presidential election. The documents went to climate skeptic  blogs--with, interestingly, the first upload in Russia--instead of to  WikiLeaks, but the mainstream media took the bait, and the political  damage was done.   At the time, the New York Times wrote:         The[se] revelations are bound to inflame the public debate       as hundreds of negotiators prepare to negotiate an       international climate accord at meetings in Copenhagen next       month.    This climategate scheme worked so well that in November 2011, the  climategate operation did it again just before the U.N. climate  conference in Durban in what was dubbed climategate 2.0. Of course, the  whipped-up climategate hysteria was all fake news.   As the Guardian wrote in February 2010:         Almost all the media and political discussion about the       hacked climate emails has been based on soundbites publicised       by professional [climate] sceptics and their blogs. In many       cases, these have been taken out of context and twisted to       mean something they were never intended to.    Eight times, everyone from the inspector general of the U.S.  Department of Commerce, to the National Science Foundation, to the  British Parliament found no evidence of any misconduct by the  scientists, but for the climate denier groups, the truth was never the  point.   This climategate stunt was the product of a fake news infrastructure  built by the fossil fuel industry to attack and undermine real climate  science--disinformation campaigns, false-front organizations, stables  of paid-for scientists, and propaganda honed by public relations  experts. This denial operation aspires to mimic and rival real science,  and it is an industrial-strength adversary with big advantages. It does  not need to win its disputes with real science; it just needs to create  the public illusion of a real dispute. It doesn't have to waste time in  peer review, and it doesn't have to be true; it just has to sound like  it might be. This industrial fake news operation isn't going anywhere.  It is too valuable to the big polluters.   As we prepare to face down Russia's campaign of election  interference, we will have to face up to these two hard facts:   If the Kremlin wants to deploy fake news information warfare in our  country, the climate denial fake news infrastructure already exists.  Remember, climate denial was the original fake news.   If the Kremlin wants to deploy a surreptitious financial influence  campaign, the dark money infrastructure already exists. The fossil fuel  industry's dark money election manipulation machinery is ready to go.  Putin doesn't have to build a thing. The fossil fuel dark money and  fake news infrastructure stands ready to go.   Unfortunately, we know it works because it has worked for years for  the fossil fuel cartel, particularly since Citizens United allowed the  fossil fuel industry to enforce silence on the Republican Party.   The dangers of fake news, dark money, climate denial, and foreign  interference in our elections are all intermixed. They have brought us  to the point where the President of the United States will leave the  Paris Agreement, betraying the country's interests, in the service of  the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers' climate denial operation,  and Breitbart fake news.   This calls for an American response. Dark money and fake news are a  sinister combination, whoever is behind them. America must address the  twin threats of fake news and dark money. It is bad enough when these  are the tools of the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operation,  but we are on notice now. We are on notice from these reports and from  multiple witnesses that the Kremlin can borrow these tools too.   I will close by asking that we clean up this mess. It may take  citizen action, given the stranglehold dark money and fake news have on  Congress, but this is a fight worth having. There is no good that comes  out of dark money and fake news, whoever is behind them. We should rid  ourselves of this sinister combination.   I yield the floor.
