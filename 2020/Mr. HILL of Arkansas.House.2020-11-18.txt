 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address a  pressing problem that concerns Americans' constitutional rights. The  liberties enshrined in the Constitution still apply to every American,  even in the midst of a national emergency.   It is becoming clear to many Americans that our national life has  slid toward a double standard. For weeks, officials have asked the  public to put life on hold and help fight this virus. The American  people did their part and are doing their part, have made sacrifices to  help our Nation, and continue to do their part.   But throughout this pandemic, we have seen a troubling trend of State  leaders leaning on religious institutions harder than any other group  or organization.   In 2018, Pope Francis, while addressing ``red martyrdom,'' those who  face death and persecution on account of their religious beliefs, also  warned our nations about ``white martyrdom,'' which occurs in  democratic countries when freedom of religion is restricted.   So far, lawsuits claiming that State restrictions on religious  gatherings infringe on freedom of religion have been filed in Kentucky,  California, Louisiana, Virginia, and elsewhere.   In Virginia, at Lighthouse Fellowship Church's Palm Sunday service,  there were only 16 people present, all properly socially distanced.  Yet, the pastor was subjected, Mr. Speaker, to a criminal citation.   In Kansas, two churches settled with Democratic Governor Laura Kelly  after they sued over her 10-person limit for religious services. A  Federal judge ruled that the State appeared to have singled out  religious activities for stricter treatment. Now, Kansas churches can  hold those services as long as they abide by the protocols for  businesses and other establishments, such as providing hand sanitizer,  face masks, and social distancing.   In Kentucky, despite claiming that his order allowed congregants to  attend drive-through services, Governor Andy Beshear had State police  leave notices to self-isolate on churchgoers' windshields on Easter  Sunday service at the Maryville Baptist Church outside of Louisville.   In defiance of the Governor's mandate, Pastor Jack Roberts, along  with congregants, ripped up those notices and filed a lawsuit.    Mr. Speaker, a Federal appeals court sided with the pastor and  blocked part of Beshear's order, allowing congregants to attend drive- in services. In the ruling, the three-judge panel of the Sixth U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals expressed support for the church's argument  that it wasn't being treated fairly, noting ``hundreds'' of cars parked  in the lot of the nearby grocery store on the same day the police  informed churchgoers that they were violating the law.   ``The breadth of the ban on religious services, together with a haven  for numerous secular exceptions, should give pause to anyone who prizes  religious freedom.'' That is what the judges wrote.   They continued, ``But it is not always easy to decide what is  Caesar's and what is God's, and that is assuredly true in the context  of a pandemic.''   Mr. Speaker, I commend the judges for standing up for the fundamental  right of religious freedom, including the freedom of worship.   Americans have shown that they can convene for religious services in  a responsible way. The compassion and care for communities of faith  throughout the pandemic are needed now more than ever.   Our first Chief Executive, President Washington, prized our First  Amendment to the Constitution, saying, ``No one would be more zealous  than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of  spiritual tyranny and every species of religious persecution.''   Let's urge our colleagues in Congress, our State legislatures, our  Governors, and down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to honor Washington's  passion for our enshrined right to religious liberty.                      Calling for Targeted COVID Relief     Mr. Speaker, during this lame duck session,  this House needs bipartisan leadership to achieve critical, needed  COVID relief for central Arkansans.   The majority of these issues are easy and have significant bipartisan  support.   We need to extend and expand the Paycheck Protection Program and ease  paycheck protection forgiveness.   Pandemic unemployment payments need to be addressed in a way to help  families but also encourage work.   Finally, States need flexibility on spending money from the CARES  Act,  [[Page H5872]]  and they need to change the deadline from the end of this year, 12/31,  to a time in 2021.   We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.   We call on Speaker Pelosi to call targeted, focused relief to the  House floor today.                            ____________________
