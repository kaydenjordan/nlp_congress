 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and  my friend and co-lead on the Democratic Women's Caucus. I must say, she  is always the shining light when it comes to finding purpose and the  opportunity for women to succeed. She has proven herself over and over  again as we have seen our numbers of women grow here in the Congress of  the United States.   To my good friend Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, today was a great  day of celebration as VAWA was reauthorized. I know you concurred with  me when President Biden said, Why don't we make this permanent? That is  precisely what we should be doing. But somehow, it is a law that has to  be reauthorized every 5 years. It used to be almost something that we  did in a bipartisan fashion, and reauthorization was almost automatic.  But recently, that wasn't the case.   So to Congresswoman Jackson Lee, thank you for the very complete and  comprehensive review of women in America that you just provided us.   As we celebrate national Women's History Month, we were all asked to  talk about someone that we wanted to pay special attention to. I  decided that I was going to speak about a particular group of women who  represent what the essence of womanhood is, which is that they are  tenacious, that they are courageous, that they are gritty, and that  they will go wherever they need to go to achieve their goal.   There was what was called the Night of Terror in November 1917.  During that whole period of time, women would march every day here in  Washington, D.C., thousands of them. For the first time, they went and  picketed outside the White House. It had never been done before. They  chained themselves to the cyclone fence at the White House.   On this night in November 1917, there were 35 of these women who were  arrested. They were beaten, and they were spat upon. They had rotten  eggs thrown in their faces. The food they were given in jail was so bad  that many of them went on a hunger strike, and then they had tubes put  in their noses to force-feed them. One woman was struck between the  eyes and lost one of her eyes.   What were they doing this for? So women could get the right to vote  in the United States.                                time  1830    Because up until that time women were, for all intents and purposes,  chattel. There were people like George Bernard Shaw who said: If women  got the right to vote there would be a crushing tax on bachelors in  America. Another one from the Seneca Falls Review that said: If women  got the right to vote they would become thin-lipped, fat-handed, and  flat-chested. Oh, my God.   Those were the kinds of thoughts that somehow women did not have the  mental capacity to vote because in their skull they only had puppies  and chocolate and babies that were in their brains; that somehow that  was the kind of political cartoon that was represented.   Certainly, women who were menopausal couldn't vote because they were  near extinction. Women who were pregnant or having children couldn't  vote because they were lactating. You name it, they came up with it.  Having said all that, there were true sheroes of that generation.   Madam Speaker, I want to speak tonight about a different group of  women who are fighting for the lives of their countrymen and -women,  and that is the strength of the Ukrainian women.   Here is a Ukrainian woman. Here is someone bloodied by Putin's weapon  systems: she is still standing; she is still alive. We can't say that  about all the women in Ukraine. The world looked on in absolute horror  as images of injured and murdered Ukrainian women and children have  spread around the globe.   When the hospital in Mariupol was bombed, we saw pregnant women  holding their bellies, climbing down stairs. Then we saw a stretcher of  a women on a towel--it looked like it was a colorful towel that she  brought with her to the hospital. The photo of this pregnant woman who  was rushed out of the maternity hospital in Mariupol last week made my  blood run cold. The news yesterday that she and her baby had died  outraged me.   She was taken to another hospital in Mariupol and when she realized  she was losing her baby, medics said that she cried out: Kill me now.  Her pelvis was crushed. Her hip detached. The baby was delivered by C- section, but showed no signs of life. She died shortly thereafter.   That is an imprint on my mind that will never leave me and should  never leave any of us because what is happening to women in Ukraine is  sinful, it is immoral. It is in fact a crime against humanity.   Putin's forces also killed Tetiana, her son Mykyta, 18, and her  daughter Alisa, 9, as they tried to flee Kyiv with a church volunteer.  She worked for a Silicon Valley software company and was married to her  husband of 23 years. He said, ``I have lost everyone and lost the  meaning of life.''   Women in Russia are suffering, too, and they are showing lots of  guts. They are speaking out against Putin. Here you see a woman, her  name is Marina Ovsyannikova. She ran on to the live TV set on a Russian  TV station, the most-watched news program in all of Russia, to protest  the war. Her sign, which is written both in English and in Russian,  reads: No war. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda, they are  lying to you.   After she was taken into custody, she was questioned for 14 hours.  She wasn't  [[Page H3771]]  allowed to sleep, to access her family, her lawyers, and she refused to  recant her message. Somewhere in Russia right now is Marina, another  courageous woman who is speaking truth to power. Russian mothers are  angrily demanding Putin to be held accountable for using their sons, as  many as 6,000 of whom have already been killed in Ukraine, using them  as cannon fodder for his egotistical legacy project.   I am also in awe of the brave Ukrainian women literally leading the  fight to protect their country. Nearly 22 percent of Ukraine's armed  forces are female--22 percent. Here you see them in their camouflage.  The 22 percent is one of the highest percentages of females serving in  the military in the world. In the United States it is only something  like 18 percent. And more women are joining the fight every day.   Even women members of Ukraine's parliament have taken up arms to  defend their homeland. I think about that and I think how many of us  women parliamentarians in Congress would do the same? It is a good  opportunity for us to do some soul-searching.   We must have the backs of all Ukrainian women. I am proud that the  United States has imposed unprecedented sanctions and export controls  on the Russian economy. Just last week we stood on this floor and  passed the bipartisan $13 billion aid package for Ukraine to assist the  military and provide for the humanitarian needs.   Today, the President announced another package of weapons that are  going to be sent to Ukraine, including Javelins and switchblades and  body armor and helmets and drones, all in an effort to try and provide  more protection for the people of Ukraine.   We must hold Putin accountable for the immeasurable death and  suffering he has wrought. In doing so, I hope we can show a fraction of  the grit and perseverance of the Ukrainian people, and especially the  women of Ukraine.    Madam Speaker, I thank the leader of our caucus, Ms.  Frankel.   Madam Speaker, I am just going to close with some expectations. I am  leaving Congress this year, and I want to convey to you, Madam Speaker,  to the leadership of the Democratic Women's Caucus, and to all of my  colleagues how important I think that you are as guardians of  womanhood. Our job is never done.   So while we may celebrate these small victories from time to time,  the ERA is not part of our Constitution. Of the 193 countries in the  world, 165 have the ERA in their Constitutions. The United States does  not. It is 24 little words. Thirty-eight States have passed it. We have  this deadline that we have struck from the legislation in the House.  The Senate has not taken it up.   Femicide is a huge problem in Latin America. The Democratic Women's  Caucus will have a presentation this Friday on that. The 5,000 missing  Native-American women in this country that really we had no cognizance  of until we had a Native-American woman in the Congress to talk about  it.   Finally, a new issue--probably not a new issue--is one that has just  percolated to the surface, and that is female inmates in Federal  prisons who are raped by the wardens, the chaplains, and the guards.  Congresswoman Bass, Congressman Swalwell, and I went to the Federal  correctional institution in Dublin this week.   Now, at that one prison, the warden had raped inmates, the chaplain  had raped inmates, and two of the guards that we know of had raped  inmates.   It is profound that we change the culture in these prisons to prevent  that from happening and from the training of guards and leadership at  those facilities to treat these women with a certain amount of dignity  that you would just provide to another human being.   What we heard about the kinds of things that are said about them-- they are called hos and called just horrible things that make us  realize that we still have a lot of work to do.   So as I conclude, let me just say, Madam Speaker, that we are the  guardians of womanhood for the future, and I will look on with fondness  and great appreciation.
