 Mr. Chairman, I thank my fellow Great Lakes Member,  Representative Schneider, for yielding the time. I also want to thank  the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman  Lowey, for offering this amendment.   I rise in support of this effort to help communities that are left  with radioactive waste after the closure of a nuclear power plant. The  Great Lakes region, I might point out, has no energy umbrella like the  Bureau of Reclamation for the 17 Western States, or for portions of the  South, the Tennessee Valley Authority, that can help communities  readjust on a large scale for energy disruptions or changes.   In my district of northern Ohio, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power  Station is scheduled to be shuttered. We are not waving the white flag  just yet, but this community and its people need the tools to cope with  the aftermath, should the worst happen.   When nuclear power plants close, the impact on local economies, due  to the loss of jobs and tax revenue, will be severe. For years, the  Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station has provided 700 good jobs and  generated $20 million a year in tax revenue for a rural county, called  Ottawa County, in which $12.1 million each year goes to its school  district. That 900-megawatt power plant does more than produce power.  It builds community.   This major financial support could disappear and leave the community  and that entire county struggling to support schools, law enforcement,  and roads. Therefore, I strongly support this amendment to help these  communities adjust, as necessary, to access Federal resources and make  a plan for economic revitalization.   I thank Congressman Schneider for offering this commonsense  amendment, one that is so vitally necessary, especially across the  Great Lakes region, which is so often neglected. I also want to thank  Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko for their leadership and urge  my colleagues to support it.
