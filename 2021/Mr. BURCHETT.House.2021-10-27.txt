 Madam Speaker, the American taxpayers are expected to  write the Democrats a blank check for this socialist scam. Democrats  [[Page H5955]]  want to squeeze as much money as possible from successful individuals  and businesses.   Madam Speaker, this is completely wrong. We shouldn't be punishing  success in America to finance this far-left political agenda. It is  obvious why Joe Biden is pushing so hard for an aggressive expansion of  government dependency programs and the dismantling of domestic energy  production. He wants to virtue signal to his globalist pals during the  United Nations climate summit this weekend in Scotland.   Democrats like Biden are embarrassed and ashamed of our country. He  desperately wants acceptance from European countries to boost his  progressive ego.   Why do we care what foreign elitists think of our country, Madam  Speaker? Biden needs to prioritize American citizens instead of  European politicians.   We do things differently than the rest of the world. I am proud of  our national values. The leader of our government should take pride in  the country he leads, too.                            ____________________
