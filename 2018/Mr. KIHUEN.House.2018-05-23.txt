 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of  Cameron Robinson. He attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Cameron found his perfect balance in his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.  They loved each other immensely, and Cameron loved Bobby's children as  if they were his own. Bobby describes Cameron as a man who never did  anything halfway. Whether it was cooking fancy meals or working in the  Las Vegas City Attorney's Office, he put his all in everything he did.   Cameron loved people without judgment and without condition. He is a  man who is remembered as being full of spontaneous fun.   I would like to extend my condolences to Cameron Robinson's family  and friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of  Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
