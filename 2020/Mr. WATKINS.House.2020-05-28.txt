 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 3084, the  Competitive Pay for Leaders in Veterans Healthcare Act. This  legislation was introduced by my good friend and fellow Kansan, the  chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Jerry  Moran.   Our Nation's veterans deserve the best care possible. We must ensure  that the VA can recruit and retain high-quality talented leaders. The  Competitive Pay for Leaders in Veterans Healthcare Act is less about  the leaders, actually, it is more about the veterans as the quality of  their care is the direct result of the quality of the VA leadership.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I support the Competitive Pay for Leaders in  Veterans Healthcare Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same. No  one fights harder for our veterans than President Trump. He has always  made us a top priority, and I am glad that he and the VA Secretary will  support this measure, and I look forward to its passage.                            ____________________
