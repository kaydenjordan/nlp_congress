 Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my  colleagues who have come to the floor to express my opposition to the  nomination of Steven Menashi to U.S. circuit judge for the Second  Circuit.   I am disappointed that Mr. Menashi's nomination has moved forward  even though he lacks the support of his home State senators. In the  rush to confirm judges like Mr. Menashi, the Senate has chipped away at  the traditions that allow us to properly advise and consent on  nominations, which is our responsibility under the Constitution.   Today, we are considering a nominee whose record has raised several  concerning issues. While working as Principal Deputy General Counsel  and as Acting General Counsel at the Department of Education, Menashi  advised Secretary DeVos on the Department's efforts to withhold debt  relief for students who were defrauded by their colleges, reverse the  Obama administration's regulations on campus sexual assault, and delay  the enforcement of rules designed to ensure that students of color with  disabilities are treated fairly. And while at the White House Counsel's  Office, Mr. Menashi has advised on the administration's efforts to end  the deferred enforced departure program for Liberians and to restrict  access to asylum.   I am also concerned that, despite a request from all of the  Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Menashi has refused  to provide information about his knowledge or involvement in the events  related to the telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian  President Zelensky on July 25, 2019.   It is for these reasons that I am unable to support Mr. Menashi's  confirmation.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
