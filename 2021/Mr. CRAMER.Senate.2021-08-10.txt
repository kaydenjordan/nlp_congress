 Mr. President, I call up Cramer amendment No. 3105 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment would simply prohibit any  ban on hydraulic fracturing. Such a ban would raise Americans' cost of  living, weaken our national security, and, of course, actually enhance  greenhouse gas emissions.   Thanks to the technology of fracking, since 2007, U.S. oil production  [[Page S6213]]  has doubled, and natural gas production has increased by 60 percent.  That is helping States like Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania. And it  rids us of our reliance on nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia.   And, by the way, banning fracking would lead to triple-digit oil  prices and possible global economic shock as per the University of  Chicago.   Ironically, a ban on fracking would also increase global greenhouse  gas emissions. Energy Secretary Granholm just recently said that the  Russian gas is ``the dirtiest form of natural gas on Earth.'' And she  is right. Emissions from Russian natural gas are over 40 percent higher  than ours.   Democrats' fracking ban would be bad for North Dakota and our Nation  and the environment, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes.
