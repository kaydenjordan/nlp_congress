 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, President Trump recently signed an  Executive order requiring commonsense administrative steps to promote  police accountability. Democrats immediately criticized it as weak and  insufficient to combat racial injustice, citing the need for changing  laws. Of course, this is an Executive order. In itself, it does not and  cannot solve the whole problem.   This reminds me of when the President was criticized for not ordering  a nationwide lockdown, despite having no such power, and then was  accused of being a dictator for suggesting that he had a role in  reopening the economy.   The President deserves credit for taking steps within his authority  to improve police accountability, but he cannot change the law.   Congress must now work and do it in a bipartisan way to do what we  can within the scope of our constitutional authority to make things  better.   You cannot legislate away racial injustice overnight, but Federal,  State, and local laws must reflect our national creed that all people  are created equal.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a  letter printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of State,                                      Washington, DC, June 12, 2020.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley: Your May 18 letter to the President       concerning his removal of the Inspector General of the       Department of State has been referred to the Department.        In order to address your concerns as they relate to the       Department, the Department is prepared to provide you a       briefing with a senior official at your earliest convenience.       Additionally, the Department is enclosing its recent letter,       on which you were copied, which addresses the reasons for       Secretary Pompeo's recommendation to remove the State       Department Inspector General.            Sincerely,                                          Mary Elizabeth Taylor,                                       Assistant Secretary of State,                                     Bureau of Legislative Affairs.        Enclosure: As stated.                                   ____                                         U.S. Department of State,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2020.      Hon. Michael E. Horowitz,      Chair, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and           Efficiency, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Horowitz: In light of new information disclosed       to the State Department for the first time on June 2, 2020,       the Department is writing to formally request that the       Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency       (CIGIE) examine a series of questions related to the conduct       of former State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.       Specifically, the Department has become aware that Mr. Linick       may have hand-selected a potentially-conflicted investigator       to look into possible misconduct by his own office and then       withheld the resulting report, which noted his own apparent       non-compliance with State Department Office of Inspector       General (OIG) email policies, from State Department       leadership, despite repeated requests for a copy of the       report.        In short, the events described below suggest that there may       have been a significant breakdown in the typically-rigorous       standards of an IG investigation, warranting CIGIE review.        Mr. Linick had served as Inspector General of the State       Department since September 2013. On May 15, 2020, President       Trump decided to remove Mr. Linick from that position and       placed him on 30 days of administrative leave. As described       in the attached letter to the House Foreign Affairs Committee       dated June 1 (Tab 1), the President's decision to remove Mr.       Linick from this position was made upon the Secretary of       State's recommendation. This recommendation was based, in       part, on concerns related to Mr. Linick's failure to formally       refer to CIGIE--as agreed with senior Department leadership       in the fall of 2019--the investigation of a leak of a highly-      sensitive draft report to the media on September 13, 2019,       which was attributed to ``two government sources involved in       carrying out the investigation.'' State IG Set to Recommend       Discipline for Trump's Top Iran Hand, The Daily Beast, Sept.       13, 2019.        As described in the Department's attached letter, and       contrary to that fall 2019 agreement, Mr. Linick instead       referred the matter for review by the Department of Defense's       (DOD's) Acting Inspector General--without informing State       Department leadership that he was taking a different course.       Only after the DOD IG provided its initial findings directly       to Mr. Linick in late 2019 or early 2020 did Department       leadership become aware that Mr. Linick had hand-selected his       own investigator for the matter, outside of the CIGIE       process. Mr. Linick then refused multiple requests by       Department leadership for a copy of the resulting report.       Notwithstanding these repeated requests to Mr. Linick, who       reports by law to the Secretary of State, the Department was,       for the first time, provided a copy of the March 17, 2020 DOD       OIG report on June 2, 2020 (Tab 2) as a result of a request       by Congress, nearly two weeks after the President removed Mr.       Linick from his position.        Beyond the concerning process that led to the DOD IG       reviewing this matter, the DOD IG report itself raises a       number of new questions that, together with the Department's       original concerns, further substantiate the Department's       misgivings with Mr. Linick's performance as Inspector General       and merit a review by an independent investigatory body. As       we did originally with Mr. Linick, the Department renews its       request that CIGIE review these questions.        Breach of Agreed Steps for Investigating a Potential Leak       from OIG. Last fall, State Department leadership asked Mr.       Linick to refer for review by CIGIE the unauthorized       disclosure of a draft inspector general report, which the       media attributed to ``two government sources involved in       carrying out the investigation''. State IG Set to Recommend       Discipline for Trump's Top Iran Hand, The Daily Beast, Sept.       13, 2019. It was natural to assume that sources involved in       ``carrying out the investigation'' may refer to sources       within the State OIG, which--if true--would undermine       confidence in the professionalism and integrity of the OIG.       Mr. Linick agreed to the request, but the Department learned       months later that, instead of formally referring the matter       to CIGIE, Mr. Linick asked the DOD Acting Inspector General       to review the issue. In other words, Mr. Linick failed to       inform Department leadership that he had hand-picked another       IG to investigate potential misconduct by his office and that       he had deviated from the clear course agreed upon with       leadership.        Following the completion of a draft report by the DOD       Acting Inspector General in late 2019 or early 2020, Mr.       Linick briefed Department leadership on certain findings but       refused to provide the written report, or even a written       summary, to Department leadership for review, raising further       concerns about the fairness of the process followed. As of       the time of Mr. Linick's removal, the Department had still       not received any documented findings on the matter. By       contrast, an appropriate referral to CIGIE would have       produced a final report that Department leadership could       review and assess whether there may have been inappropriate       conduct in Mr. Linick's office.        Potential Conflict of Interest in Choice of Investigator.       The person whom Mr. Linick asked to review the matter,       outside of the CIGIE process, was then-DOD Principal Deputy       Inspector General Glenn Fine, who at the time was the DOD's       Acting Inspector General. This was an unusual choice because       Mr. Fine appears to have been a fact witness, potentially one       with knowledge of information relevant to the subject of the       investigation described in the report. Specifically, the DOD       OIG report notes that Mr. Linick said that he ``spoke about       the evaluation report'' with Mr. Fine before the media leak       occurred. If Mr. Fine himself had confidential information       about the draft report before it was leaked, it raises       serious questions as to whether it was appropriate for him to       lead the investigation into the subsequent leak. It is       unclear whether Mr. Fine was even interviewed in the       course of the investigation. Allowing a fact witness to an       investigation to shape the terms of the investigation--let       alone lead the investigation--seems inappropriate. At a       minimum, the choice of investigator in this case raises       material concerns about whether the report itself       represents a complete and adequate investigation of       potential misconduct within the State Department Office of       Inspector General.        Limited Investigation. As noted above, the Department       finally received a copy of the DOD Acting Inspector General's       report on June 2, 2020, and following the Department's       review, the Department has identified a number of concerns as       to its scope. For example, the report notes that Mr. Linick       himself ``asked the DoD OIG to conduct a limited inquiry into       whether any DOS OIG employee was the source of the       unauthorized disclosure.'' (emphasis added). The DOD OIG       conducted personal interviews, in which all interviewed       staffers ``said they did not release any information in the       report to the media.'' The DOD OIG also reviewed official       email accounts and found that no employee directly sent an       email from their State Department email address to the news       media, other than the communications director.        However, the scope of this review appears to have been       exceedingly cursory, and the report itself indicates that the       scope of the investigation was by design ``limited.'' It is       also unclear whether it was appropriate for Mr. Linick, as a       fact witness to the investigation, to dictate the ``limited''       scope (rather than a ``full'' scope) given the significance       of the leak. It is hard to imagine that an OIG or CIGIE       would, in the course of its normal investigations, allow       possible fact witnesses or interviewees to influence the       scope of the investigation. Moreover, merely asking an       interviewee if he/she directly transmitted the leaked       documents and asking only about emails from official accounts       would catch only the most blatant mishandling of information       and would fail to uncover any person who disclosed the draft       through an intermediary or sent the report from a personal       email address. Further, the DOD IG does not appear to have       questioned whether any interviewee had knowledge of who may       have improperly disclosed the report or engaged in other       questioning aimed at discovering the true source of the leak.        Use and Concealment of Improper Email Practice. The DOD OIG       report identifies a concerning email practice used by Mr.       Linick. The DOD OIG found: ``IG Linick sent a password-      protected, draft version of the evaluation report in question       to his Gmail account eight times over six days in August       2019. On one occasion, he emailed a password-protected draft       of the evaluation report from his Gmail email account to his       government email account.'' As the DOD OIG report notes, this       usage appeared to contravene the State Department OIG's own       policy: ``Use OIG provided equipment and systems/applications       at all times, including OIG email, to conduct official OIG       business. The use of corporate or personal equipment,       systems/applications, to include to email, or other file       storage sites to store, process, or transmit OIG or       Department data is prohibited.'' State OIG Information       Systems Rules of Behavior. Mr. Linick clearly should have       followed his own organization's specific information security       policies--particularly involving a draft report on a highly-      sensitive personnel issue.  [[Page S3122]]         We understand that Mr. Linick may have received the initial       report noting his improper usage of personal email as early       as late 2019 or early 2020, and it is the Department's       understanding that he never shared the written report with       any person at the State Department (including in his own       office), despite repeated requests by Department leadership       for a copy of the report. Likewise, he never informed State       Department leadership that the report found that he did not       comply with OIG email practices. Allowing the head of an       investigated office to determine the manner and scope of the       release of a report that addresses his own conduct is       inappropriate, which is presumably why CIGIE's own guidelines       would have required the results of a CIGIE review to be       shared with appropriate officials in his supervisory chain.        OIG Launches Questionable Parallel Investigation Under a       Possible Conflict of Interest. At the same time that the DOD       IG was conducting its review, Mr. Linick reportedly opened a       parallel investigation of other State Department employees       for the same potential misconduct for which his own office       was being investigated. See Kylie Atwood, Fired State       Department inspector general was cleared in leak inquiry       prior to his removal, sources say, CNN, May 28, 2020. This       decision, if accurately reported, seems unusual because the       September 2019 media leak was specifically attributed to       ``two government sources involved in carrying out the       investigation'' (emphasis added), not to Department employees       who may have been fact witnesses (and were clearly not       responsible for ``carrying out'' any investigation).        Mr. Linick's decision also raises the question of whether       this parallel investigation was intended to divert attention       from the DOD IG's own investigation into the State OIG.       Indeed, public reporting suggests that State OIG was       continuing its own investigations of other Department       employees before the DOD OIG report was even finalized. See       id. It should have been obvious to Mr. Linick that launching       a parallel investigation into the same misconduct for which       he and his own office were being investigated created both a       real and apparent conflict of interest and risked interfering       with the DOD OIG investigation into his own office. An       investigator who is still working to clear his or her own       name has a motive to shift the blame to another person.        Inappropriate Contacts with OIG Staff in an Apparent       Attempt to Obtain Department Records, Contrary to       Instruction. When Mr. Linick was removed from his position on       May 15 and placed on administrative leave, his physical       access was terminated, and he was clearly instructed by       Department officials not to contact OIG staff members about       official matters or return to his former office, without       authorization by Department officials, who would facilitate       any such contacts.        However, it has come to the Department's attention that he       has violated these instructions on multiple occasions while       he was on administrative leave. For example, we understand       that, in the days before his Congressional testimony, he sent       a text message to the Deputy Inspector General, Diana Shaw,       requesting a copy of the DOD IG report. Without informing her       own chain of command, we understand that Ms. Shaw then       contacted the DOD Office of Inspector General to request a       copy of the report on Mr. Linick's behalf. It is not clear       what Mr. Linick's motivation was, but it was not his decision       (nor his former Deputy's) to make this request for release       given that he was, at the time, on administrative leave       pursuant to the President's decision with a new Acting       Inspector General in place. We understand that Mr. Linick has       repeatedly returned to his former office without seeking       authorization from his Department superiors, also contrary to       the clear instructions he received. Mr. Linick should follow       the same rules that apply to other government officials who       are placed on administrative leave in such circumstances; he       is not entitled to a different set of rules.        A Pattern of Leaks Continues. Even though no one at the       State Department other than Mr. Linick appears to have had a       copy of the DOD Inspector General's report (not even his       Deputy) before June 2, 2020, CNN ran a story on May 28, 2020       that the DOD OIG report had exonerated Mr. Linick of leaking.       Kylie Atwood, Fired State Department inspector general was       cleared in leak inquiry prior to his removal, sources say,       CNN, May 28, 2020. These reports raise additional concerns as       to this disturbing pattern of leaks, further warranting CIGIE       review.        Last fall, the Department had serious concerns with the       leak of a draft State Department OIG report and recommended       that review by CIGIE was the appropriate step for an       independent review. Unfortunately, Mr. Linick's failure to       follow through on that course--or to seek agreement from his       reporting chain on any change in course--has only confirmed       the Department's recommendation and has raised even further       concerns about Mr. Linick's judgment and conduct.        Therefore, we ask CIGIE to investigate not only the       original unauthorized disclosure, but the conduct described       in this letter.            Sincerely,                                                  Brian Bulatao,                                     Under Secretary for Management,                                          U.S. Department of State.    Madam President, as Americans, our understanding of  history has a tremendous impact on our sense of who we are and where we  are headed. That is why it is so important for Americans to have a good  understanding of our history--all of our history.   Slavery is a great stain on our country's history, and its legacy  impacts us yet today. We must not flinch from recognizing the suffering  inflicted on so many Americans, contrary to our highest ideals as a  nation.   Still, our Nation is unique in human history in that it was founded  not on the basis of some sort of common ethnic identity but on certain  enduring principles that are the equal heritage of all Americans. Those  principles are best articulated in the simple but eloquent words of the  Declaration of Independence. I don't have to put quotes around these  because everybody knows these words: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by  their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are  Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.''   Our patriot forefathers concluded that these principles were worth  fighting for, and, indeed, they took up arms. The odds were stacked  against them, and they happened to know that, but they, nonetheless,  risked everything because they believed so deeply in those fundamental  truths that were stated in the Declaration of Independence.   Among those who risked life and limb for our Nation's founding  principles were between 5,000 and 10,000 Americans of African descent  who volunteered to serve as soldiers and sailors during the American  Revolution.   Their patriotic sacrifices at the very beginning of our Nation  contributed immeasurably toward laying the foundation of the freedoms  we enjoy today.   The civil rights movement was later able to build on that solid  foundation by calling on America to, as Dr. King said, ``live out the  true meaning of its creed.'' Dr. King was absolutely right in pointing  out that Black Americans have every right to fully claim our shared  heritage as Americans, having helped build and shape American  institutions and society from the beginning, as shown by the very  sacrifice they made in the Revolutionary War. This proud history is  part of who we are as Americans, but it is too little understood and,  hence, fully not appreciated.   That is why I was proud to colead legislation that authorized the  establishment of a National Liberty Memorial on the National Mall to  honor the underappreciated contributions of Black Revolutionary War  veterans and patriots, as they are.   I am proud to say that Iowa can claim at least one of those patriots,  Cato Mead, who was born in Connecticut and is listed in Revolutionary  War pension court records as a ``free person of color'' who lived out  his twilight years in Southeastern Iowa. He is buried in the Montrose  Cemetery in Montrose, IA.   The National Mall Liberty Fund is now in the process of raising money  for an environmental assessment to complete final site selection for  this very important memorial.   Now, more than ever, Americans need this monument as a tangible  reminder that despite the lingering legacy of slavery, the promise of  liberty and equality is a shared heritage of all Americans from the  founding generation to this very day.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
