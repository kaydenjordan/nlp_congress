 Madam Speaker, I have learned from Democrat press  conferences and Washington Post leaks that this body has an ongoing so- called impeachment inquiry.   But can I, as a Member of Congress, watch the testimony? No.   Can you watch the testimony at home so you can decide for yourself?  No.   Why are the hearings taking place in the basement behind guarded  doors? What do they want to keep from me? What do they want to keep  from you, Madam Speaker, either hearing or seeing?   I don't know, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows, and you can call her  and ask her why at 202-225-4965. Ask her what she has to hide, at 202- 225-4965. Ask her why you can't watch the hearing, at 202-225-4965.   The American people deserve the answers.   Call 202-225-4965.                            ____________________
