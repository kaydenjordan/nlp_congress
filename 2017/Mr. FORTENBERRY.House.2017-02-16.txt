 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa.  Perhaps this will embarrass you, my colleague, Steve King, but as I was  flying into Nebraska last week--and I do this on occasion--I am looking  out of the window and looking at the rolling hills of the western edge  of Iowa as it borders the Missouri River and all of that beautiful  terracing that has been done, all of that extraordinarily productive  farmland, in order to save the soil and increase yields, and I wonder  how much of that Steve King did himself in a former life. So I am  grateful not only for the opportunity but mostly for your friendship.    Mr. Speaker, as I was going through my mail last  week, I read a publication that I receive frequently at my house from  what is known as the Great Plains Trail Network. This is a dedicated  group of people who enjoy, promote, and foster the growing network of  hiking and biking trails in my hometown of Lincoln and the vicinity.  They provide an extraordinary service to our community. Most notably,  the trail systems provide an alternative means of transportation,  physically linking our community in creative ways along creek beds and  underpasses, through open plains and wooded areas, and beside the  wooden fences between residential neighborhoods. These trails also link  us in a more profound way. They link us to the values of healthy  exercise, neighborliness, and the beauty of nature--even in the setting  of the urban city environment.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I received an unusual media request recently. New  York Magazine wished to speak to me. I took the meeting because I  wanted to give a broader perspective on the issue of environmental  stewardship, particularly in light of policy debates about energy and  the environment. Since this topic can be so toxic, I thought it was  important to reframe the issues with some prairie perspective, if you  will. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, it is time to spike the football and focus  on solutions and activities that all of us can agree on and that all of  us see are beneficial.   Mr. Speaker, for the 21st century, we must harmonize environmental  and economic security. As a different public policy approach, I am  considering a new idea called the zero-emissions energy credit, or  ZEEC.                                time  1600    The more that we can do, I believe, to stop waste and pollution  through conservation and innovation gives us peace of mind in regards  to the proper use of our resources.   This ZEEC concept would reward reduced emissions through a tax credit  [[Page H1284]]  system. In this way, the government is not picking one technology over  another or fighting over one regulation versus another, but positively  valuing the diminishing externality cost of polluting emissions.   Mr. Speaker, environmental initiatives can also take many other  forms. I am very proud to be recently named the co-chair of the  International Conservation Caucus, called the ICC. It is one of the  largest bipartisan caucuses in the Congress.   The ICC works to ensure the sustainability of both persons and  wildlife, works to promote market innovation, as well as proper  stewardship of our precious natural resources.   As an example, not long ago, in the African country of Mozambique, in  the midst of a civil war, the Gorongosa National Park was completely  stripped of wildlife and devoid of people. A once lush microecosystem  is dead, primarily due to political disagreement.   Interestingly, fascinatingly, extraordinarily, a mere 10 years later,  thanks to the work of a major philanthropist and a receptive  government, a park system now teams with wildlife, with indigenous  people reintegrated back into their homeland, who are engaged in now  good and sustainable farming methodologies, engaged in park management,  as well as conservation, all creating an atmosphere in which the entire  ecosystem once again thrives.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know anyone in this body or anywhere else who  wants dirty air or dirty water. However, as another example, if you  live in Beijing, polluted air alone costs you 5\1/2\ years off your  life. Parts of India are perhaps worse.   By the way, the Chinese Government was infuriated with the United  States because we created at our embassy a pollution monitoring device,  and then publicly released that data to Chinese society. It had a major  effect. As one Chinese person once whispered to me: What is the point  of all this economic development if it kills you?   Economic development without a soul strips us of the capacity to  fully prosper. On the other hand, one of the prime contributors to  environmental desecration is economic underdevelopment. Persons who  have diminished economic options will use the resources at hand,  sometimes merely to survive.   The tragedy of the commons occurs when there are fractured social  linkages, a lack of access to technology and information to feed,  clothe, and house in a more sustainable way.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this: as new technologies emerge, we may see  exciting opportunities to build our own sustainably sourced microenergy  economy, one that harmonizes with the environment and creates new  economic opportunities and linkages.   This doesn't mean we all live on game preserves, but through proper  public policy and innovation, we may be on the trail to environmental,  economic, and community security, and perhaps create a new type of  Great Plains Energy Network.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman King, for the  various aspects of leadership he has provided, particularly today, on  an essential issue: a pro-life issue.
