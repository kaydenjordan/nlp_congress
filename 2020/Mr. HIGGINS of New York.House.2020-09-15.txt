 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Buffalo  Black Achievers, who will soon celebrate virtually its 48th annual  Black Achievers Awards ceremony.   I have been honored to speak at several past ceremonies, and I am  certain this year's event will be very memorable.   The Buffalo Black Achievers honor the character and accomplishments  of outstanding citizens of Buffalo and western New York and the  substantial contributions they make every day.   In 2020, 36 Black Achievers Awards will be bestowed upon recipients  in a variety of walks of life. A particular emphasis is placed upon  community service, a fact underscored by the existence of the Black  Achievers Scholarship, which has funded awards to local high school  students for more than 15 years.   My congratulations go out to all of those earning the Buffalo Black  Achievers Awards for 2020, and I offer my best wishes to my friend,  Chief Executive Officer Herb Bellamy, Jr., and in the memory of his  great father, Herb Bellamy, Sr., and to the other members of his board  of directors for a successful virtual ceremony in 2020.   We look forward to celebrating together once again in 2021.                            ____________________
