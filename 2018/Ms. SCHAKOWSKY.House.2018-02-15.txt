 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R.  620, which would violate the 28-year-old Americans with Disabilities  Act by allowing public places to bar access to people with  disabilities. H.R. 620 would actually allow barriers for the disabled  to stay in place as long as ``substantial progress'' is made to remove  them, whatever that means.   The ADA was a compromise, giving the disability community access and  helping businesses to comply by giving them tax credits and training.  H.R. 620 undoes that compromise, making it virtually impossible to  enforce the  [[Page H1189]]  ADA's goal of fairness and inclusion; and that is why the AARP, the  Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Council on Independent  Living, and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities oppose this  bill.   It is why the National Organization of Nurses with Disabilities  ``believes that H.R. 620 represents a downward spiral of the Americans  With Disabilities Act and will impact people with disabilities' freedom  of access . . . across the United States.''   And it is why 55 Illinois--where I am from--disability groups, led by  Access Living, whose president, Marca Bristo, my personal hero, helped  enact the Americans with Disabilities Act, she says and they say:  ``H.R. 620 . . . would fundamentally harm our Nation's progress toward  an accessible and integrated society. The bill telegraphs to  individuals with disabilities that . . . their inclusion is not  important.''   Let's show people with disabilities that they do matter, that they  shouldn't be locked out of restaurants or sporting events or job  opportunities, that they should not be treated as second-class citizens  in the American civil justice system. Show your commitment to the ADA  and to civil rights, and vote ``no.''
