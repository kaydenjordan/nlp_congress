 Madam Speaker, to come to the correct  conclusion, a law professor used to say, ``You've got to know the  facts.'' And that is what the American people need here: the facts, not  emotion.   This bill would comprehensively transfer the power to govern  elections in this country from the sovereign States to the Federal  Government permanently and everywhere.   So what is the factual premise for so fundamentally concentrating the  power here in Washington and diminishing the States? What has happened  to justify making pervasive and permanent what Chief Justice Roberts  explained was ``a drastic departure from basic principles of freedom''  when it was necessarily undertaken in the 1960s, temporarily and in  limited parts of the country?   Well, Democrats offer lurid claims, but the American people are  catching on. Like earlier this year, Stacey Abrams claimed that a  simple voter ID law would be Jim Crow 2.0, but once the absurdity of  that caught up to her, she looked so ridiculous that she tried to deny  ever having claimed it.   Nothing epitomizes this better than the slur repeated in the Rules  Committee yesterday by my law school classmate and colleague,  Congresswoman Ross. She quoted three ultraliberal judges in the Fourth  Circuit who said that when the North Carolina legislature enacted voter  ID and other reforms in 2013, it ``targeted African Americans with  almost surgical precision.''   Activists and media have quoted that phrase over 7,500 times,  according to Google. But few know that the three judges who stated that  finding of fact were appellate judges who were supposed to be bound by  the trial judge's finding of fact; or that the trial judge found in a  painstaking 400-page analysis that the legislature's bill was not  discriminatory. So the three appellate judges abused their power.   Few know how the three liberal appellate judges became the final  word, that a Democrat State Attorney General intentionally sabotaged  the State's appeal to prevent an upcoming review by the Supreme Court.  That AG abused his power.    Madam Speaker, when the details are  known, the absence of factual basis becomes plain. Nobody is getting  wet. A University of Oregon economist showed, just in February, that  the Shelby County decision to which this bill purports to respond, has  not impaired Black voter turnout at all. There is no Jim Crow 2.0. This  bill is about abuse of power.   Democrats wish to entrench themselves in power and to use the Federal  [[Page H4410]]  Government to obliterate the States in order to achieve it. You have to  know the facts.                                time  1730
