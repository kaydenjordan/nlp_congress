 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mrs. Agnes Doster, who passed away on Monday, December 4, at the age  of 79.   Originally from Forsyth, Georgia, Mrs. Doster worked for 40 years in  the Secretary of the Senate's office in the Georgia State Capitol. She  served in a number of different capacities there with dedication since  1968, always making the Georgia State Capitol run more efficiently,  while promoting good government.   Outside of her time working as a civil servant, Mrs. Doster was very  active in the First Baptist Church of Snellville for over 45 years.  There, she sang in the choir, played hand bells, directed weddings, and  taught the 2-year-old Sunday school class.   She is survived by family all over the State of Georgia, including  her husband, sister, children, grandchildren, and 30 nieces and  nephews.   Mrs. Doster's bright spirit will surely be missed by everyone around  the Georgia State Capitol.                            ____________________
