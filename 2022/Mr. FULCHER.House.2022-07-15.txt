 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the proposed  Federal authorization of what amounts to be abortion on demand.   There are reasons the life issue is so polarizing. How we prioritize  life, from before birth to the end of life, often defines our value  systems. I believe life is the very character of God, that, indeed, we  all have inalienable rights, the most important of which is the right  to live.   I will close my comments by pointing out three relevant position  statements my friends on the other side of the aisle struggle with.   All too often, they will support taking of life of the pre-born by  abortion, but not taking of life of convicted murderers by capital  punishment.   All too often, they will support the statement ``my body, my  choice,'' but not when it comes to vaccines.   And all too often, they will support so-called reproductive health,  but not if it is reproductive or healthy.   Debates and decisions like these belong to the people, not the  Federal Government.
