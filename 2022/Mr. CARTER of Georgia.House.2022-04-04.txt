 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  20th anniversary of 89.3 The Lighthouse on WECC-FM.   Founded in 2002 by husband-and-wife duo Paul and Vickie Hafer, The  Lighthouse has been spreading the Word of God 24 hours a day for 20  years.   Founding Lighthouse Ministry in 1998, Paul and Vickie selflessly  spread the holy Word of God to as many people as they can. Their radio  show on WECC-FM now reaches southeast Georgia, northeast Florida, and a  worldwide online audience.   Their ministry also provides other opportunities for their community,  such as a ladies' Bible study group and  [[Page H4131]]  an intercessory prayer group, and is home to Cub Scout Pack 893.   Vickie and Paul have dedicated their lives to spreading the Word of  the Lord and ministering to others, and our communities are better for  it. Their tireless work has reached the ears of thousands of listeners  and will continue to be heard around the world.   This 20th anniversary milestone is nothing short of remarkable. Thank  you for what you are doing, and keep shining His light.                                time  1215                      honoring the life of isaac laroche     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Isaac ``Ike'' LaRoche.   Ike was born in Darien, Georgia, in 1942 to the late Lawrence  ``Junior'' Edison LaRoche, Sr., and Ethel Ward LaRoche.   He would go on to serve his country in the United States Army.  Following his service, he owned and operated Ike LaRoche & Associates.   Ike selflessly served his community by being on the boards of  foundations such as the Camp Kicklighter Foundation, the YMCA, the Rape  Crisis Center, and the West Chatham Rotary Club.   His work led to the creation of the Pooler Fitness Center, as well as  the founding of several YMCAs across the State of Georgia. This work  and dedication to his community led him to receive the Robert H. Demere  Volunteer Award in 2013, the highest volunteer award given out by the  YMCA, having only been presented three times since 2004.   Ike's wife of 56 years, his three children, and the whole community  will miss his presence in their lives, but his legacy will live on in  the work he accomplished.                     honoring the service of bill fallon     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank a good  friend, Deputy Director Bill Fallon, of the Federal Law Enforcement  Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, for his great service to our  district.   Deputy Director Fallon received his bachelor of science degree from  Westfield State University and his master's degree in national security  and strategic studies from the U.S. Naval War College.   He joined the United States Marshals Service in 1988 as a deputy U.S.  marshal for the State of Massachusetts.   In the summer of 2008, Bill was assigned as the commander of  Operation FALCON 2008, which resulted in the arrest of over 19,300  dangerous felons and the seizure of 418 firearms. He was named The  Washington Post's Federal employee of the week for his efforts.   Bill has also served as the assistant director for the United States  Marshals Service Training Division. At FLETC, Bill has been integral in  overseeing all operations related to the development and delivery of  collaborative law enforcement training for more than 95 FLETC partner  organizations.   Bill has more than earned his retirement. After his retirement, he  will go on to be the new county manager for the Glynn County Board of  Commissioners, where I look forward to continuing to work with him.   Congratulations on your retirement, Bill, and thanks for all that you  have done and will continue to do.                 recognizing the service of coach jesse crews     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  service of Coach Jesse Crews at Charlton County High School.   Coach Crews has long been a titan in Georgia high school athletics.  Even before he was a coach, he was a Charlton County High School  athlete himself.   Jesse was born in Folkston, Georgia, in 1953. He attended Georgia  Southern University, receiving a bachelor of science in education, and  Valdosta State University, where he received his master's in education.   His life of service earned him a well-deserved induction into the  Georgia Athletic Directors Association Hall of Fame, class of 2022, and  the Dr. Lucia B. Norwood award for athletic director of the year for  all classifications in 2021.   Jesse has also been selected to receive the Georgia Athletic Coaches  Association Dwight Keith State Service Award this year.   When you dedicate your life to the betterment of others, it is hard  to avoid these amazing recognitions.   Jesse has served on the Charlton County Board of Commissioners, as  well as the Georgia High School Association Board of Trustees Executive  Committee and Reclassification Committee.   His passion for education, athletics, and his community has changed  the lives of many students that he has mentored over the years.   Jesse, we can't thank you enough for what you have done and what you  have accomplished, and I am proud to be a member of the J-Rock Express.                            ____________________
