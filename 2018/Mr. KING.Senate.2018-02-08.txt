 Mr. President, I came in the Chamber just in the middle of  a couple of these statements that have been made, and I was confused  because I thought we were talking about the tax bill, the bill that  went through the Senate in December with no hearings and no amendments.  It didn't even have a fig leaf of bipartisanship. I am  [[Page S838]]  puzzled regarding my two colleagues, who seem so worried about the  deficit, both of whom I believe voted for that bill, which, according  to the Congressional Budget Office, is going to add $1.5 trillion to  the deficit.   There are two issues; one is process, and one is results. I myself am  concerned about results. I am concerned about the deficit, and I think  it is a legitimate question, but it ill-behooves one who, less than 6  weeks ago, voted for a massive, unfunded tax cut that will increase our  deficit by well over $1 trillion. So it is OK as a matter of deficit  politics to be for that bill and against a bill that funds community  health centers in my State; that funds opioid treatment, which is  desperately needed across this country; that funds our military in a  way that they can operate and actually meet the needs of the national  security of this country. That is what the bill before us does.   So we can argue about those things, but it is touching, frankly, to  hear these very lugubrious comments about process when the process on  the tax bill was one of the worst processes in the history of this  body. When tax reform was passed in 1986, there were some 33 hearings  before the Finance Committee. It took 14 months, and the vote in the  Senate was something like 90 to 10. That was a process. The process on  the tax bill in December was atrocious. It was an embarrassment. The  city council in Bangor, ME, would not have amended the leash law using  that process.   Now, tonight, people are coming and complaining about process--the  people who voted for that bill. I am sorry, I am not very persuaded by  that. At least now there has been some process in the sense that it has  been bipartisan, that our leaders have been able to negotiate, that  there has been input from the Appropriations Committee, from Members of  the rank-and-file on both sides and in both Houses. I admit it is not a  great process, but it seems to me those who are raising that issue  tonight forfeited the right to raise that issue when they voted for the  tax bill, as far as I know, without a peep about process or about  deficits.   I agree that we ought to get back to regular order. We ought to get  back to working together. We ought to get back to committee hearings.  But let's not have this amnesia from 6 weeks ago when we made one of  the most significant decisions--a once-in-a-generation decision--about  permanent tax policy that is going to affect the budget and the debt of  this country for a whole generation.   Here, tonight, we are getting all of this strong emotional plea about  process, about what amounts to a 2-year budget, which, by the way, is  the way we should do it--not according to this process, but we ought to  be talking about 2-year budgets.   So I am sympathetic on both the deficit issue and the process issue,  but the lawyer in me says that you are estopped from raising that  argument if you voted for the tax bill. You can't have it both ways.   I listened to my esteemed colleague from Utah, and I understand his  concerns. I share his concerns. If only he had said that in December.  But, instead, he says it tonight when we are talking about funding our  military, opioid treatment, and children's healthcare.   I think you have to work it both ways. You can't just take one side  of the debate and say that it is OK to do a tax cut with no process but  it is not OK to take a bipartisan, negotiated arrangement on the budget  because all of a sudden we are concerned about process.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  town of Mexico, ME, as they will celebrate their 200th year since  incorporation on February 13, 2018. Located in Oxford County, Mexico is  bordered by the Androscoggin River, as well as Dixfield and the  historic mill town of Rumford. Recognized as the gateway to the Western  mountains, visitors and residents enjoy the town's colorful fall  foliage, quaint downtown, and proximity to the great Maine outdoors.   The town of Mexico's unique name stemmed from the local interest in  foreign politics. In the early 1700s, the territory was known as  ``Township Number One'' until the area was bought by Colonel John  Holman near the end of the 18th century. Just a few years after the  American Revolutionary War, Holmanstown was renamed to honor the  country of Mexico's fight for independence from Spain. Though the  Mexican War for independence was occurring almost 3,000 miles south of  the small town, locals were known to be sympathetic to supporting North  America's decolonization from European powers.   In the spirit of celebration, the town of Mexico has 13 bicentennial  events planned throughout the year. The multigenerational festivities  will include a parade, a carnival, a talent show, as well as  ``Mexicoploy,'' a familiar board game specifically designed to  recognize local businesses and organizations for their everyday  accomplishments. I would like to commend the community members of  Mexico for all that they have done during this time of celebration and  historical remembrance. Maine is proud to honor a community that has  successfully evolved and adapted with the changing times.                            ____________________
