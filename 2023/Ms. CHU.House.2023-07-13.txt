 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to these amendments  to the National Defense Authorization Act, which aren't designed to  protect our national security or support the men and women in uniform  who protect our freedoms.   These amendments are anti-diversity and anti-freedom. They hurt women  and restrict access to necessary abortion care. They are homophobic.  They censor servicemembers. They deny the existence of trans people.  They needlessly undermine our military's readiness and effectiveness.  They even attack our domestic film industry.   Further, these amendments seek to interfere with international  collaboration on research by targeting Asian researchers and scientists  and then peddle conspiracy theories about COVID-19.   As chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I have  to underscore how these amendments open the door to more hate,  violence, and profiling of Asian Americans, especially after 3 years of  increased anti-Asian hate.   Ultimately, what was a bipartisan bill in committee has become a  vehicle for MAGA Republican extremism.   Vote ``no.''
