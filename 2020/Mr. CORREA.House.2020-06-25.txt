 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I join Congresswoman Bass in support of H.R. 7120, the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.   The tragic death of George Floyd and countless others will not be in  vain. This bill is a comprehensive approach on policing that aims to  end decades of systemic racism, and I ask my colleagues to join us in  support of this measure.   I had hoped that arrest disparities, especially cannabis-related  arrests, would have been part of this measure. According to the ACLU,  Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession,  and in some States they are up to 10 times more likely to be arrested  for cannabis possession. We can't ask our police officers to enforce  flawed cannabis policy. Cannabis use is a social and medical issue and  not a criminal matter.   Let's not ask our police officers to do the impossible. I ask for  reform in cannabis policy immediately.
