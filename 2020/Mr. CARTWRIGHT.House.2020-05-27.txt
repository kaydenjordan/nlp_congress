 Madam Speaker, it is a horrible time our Nation is  going through right now. One hundred thousand souls perished in this  worldwide pandemic.   And through it all, every day, frontline workers are going to work;  frontline workers like truck drivers, garbage collectors, nurses, and  EMTs, and everybody getting our groceries to us, slugging it out, doing  their job day in and day out. And through it all they are not getting  anything extra but their regular pay.   That is why I introduced the Coronavirus Frontline Workers Fair Pay  Act, and I was thrilled to see that get incorporated in the HEROES Act.   I call upon Mitch McConnell and the Senate, get off the schneid and  get to work and pass this. The American economy needs this relief, and  we need you to stop delaying and pass this economic stimulus in the  HEROES Act.                            ____________________
