 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2166, the bipartisan  Global Health Security Act. This very important bill will greatly  bolster the United States' ability to prevent and respond to global  health threats like the coronavirus pandemic.   As we have seen during this tragedy, infectious diseases can spread  across borders and oceans with deadly speed. Improving nations'  abilities to address public health threats before they spin out of  control is, in fact, a matter of national security.   The United States must lead the way in strengthening international  health security measures. Investing in multilateral initiatives that  reduce the threat of global health catastrophes is a bipartisan  priority, and I am proud to colead this landmark bill with  Representatives Connolly, Chabot, Bera, Fitzpatrick, and Larsen.   The Global Health Security Act establishes a special adviser for  global health security at the National Security Council, ensuring that  U.S. efforts to respond to public health emergencies are efficient and  well-coordinated.   It also requires the United States to proactively strategize for  future crises and strengthens our ability to help our partners fight  and contain outbreaks within their own borders.   The Global Health Security Act will save lives by helping us prepare  for or prevent the next pandemic. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
