 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Nicholas Troianiello, a true American hero from Staten  Island, New York.   After graduating Port Richmond High School in 1944, Nicholas joined  the New York Guard where he served for 1 year before enlisting in the  Marine Corps during World War II.   On February 19, 1945, Nicholas was one of 30,000 brave marines to  land on the island of Iwo Jima for a battle that lasted 5 weeks and was  one of the bloodiest battles during World War II. Nicholas was awarded  the Purple Heart and the Conspicuous Service Award for his service to  our great Nation.   Following his service, Nicolas returned to Staten Island to serve  once again, this time as a member of the New York City Fire Department.  He served for four decades until he retired with the esteemed title of  lieutenant.   Sadly, Nicholas passed away last year at the age of 94. This weekend,  I was honored to join local colleagues and Nicholas' family at a street  naming ceremony last week to remember his life, legacy, and dedication  to our community.   Nicholas was a true American hero who loved our country and our city,  and I am proud to recognize his service today.                            ____________________
