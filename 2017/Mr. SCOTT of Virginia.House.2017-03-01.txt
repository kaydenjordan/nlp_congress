 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 83, the Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval that will undermine workplace  safety and health. It does so by overturning a clarifying rule issued  by OSHA on December 9, 2016, to ensure accurate occupational injury and  illness reporting.   Now, first of all, it is strange that we are reversing a rule through  the Congressional Review Act that creates no new compliance or  reporting obligation, imposes no new costs. It simply gives OSHA the  tools to enforce an employer's continuing obligation to record injuries  and illnesses.   Spurred by the court of appeals decision, which blocked OSHA from  citing continuing violations outside the 6-month statute of  limitations, OSHA updated its recordkeeping rule. This new rule makes  it clear that employers have a continuing obligation to record serious  injuries and illnesses on an OSHA Log if they failed to comply with the  requirement to record the injury at the time the injury or illness  occurred.   Since the enactment of OSHA in 1970, accurate data on workplace  injuries and illnesses has been recognized as an  [[Page H1422]]  important tool for protecting worker safety and health.   Since 1972, employers in higher hazard industries have been required  to record the occurrence of each serious occupational injury or illness  within 7 days on a ``Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.''                                time  1530    An annual summary of this law must be posted for 3 months starting in  February of each year in a conspicuous place where employees' frequent  records must be kept for 5 years.   While most employers faithfully comply with OSHA's rules, there are a  number of well-documented incentives for employers to underreport  workplace injuries. These incentives include lower workers'  compensation rates, more favorable treatment in public contracting, and  a lower chance of having a future OSHA inspection.   Underreporting means that workplace hazards are masked, making it  less likely that employers or employees become aware of patterns that  would indicate the need to take corrective actions to prevent future  injuries. If injuries and illnesses are not on the log, OSHA may  overlook hazards at a worksite during an inspection and consequently  leaving workers exposed to correctable dangers.   Mr. Speaker, because of underfunding, OSHA only has sufficient  resources to inspect a workplace once every 140 years on average. So  the likelihood that they might show up in the next 6 months is  obviously remote. To be effective, OSHA must have reliable injury and  illness data to target its scarce resources towards work sites where  employees are facing the greatest dangers. Understated injury rates may  mean that OSHA will bypass work sites that need to be inspected.   Without reliable recordable injury rates, private contractors and  public sector officials will not be able to make sufficiently informed  decisions when assessing the safety records of prospective contractors  and subcontractors.   Mr. Speaker, OSHA's practice for the last 40 years and the decisions  of the bipartisan and independent OSHA Review Commission have upheld  the principle that every day an employer fails to record an injury was  a continuing violation for the purpose of calculating time limits under  OSHA's statute of limitations. That is not totally open-ended but  limited to the 5-year requirement that employers are required to  maintain these injury records.   In spite of this 40-year precedent, a 2012 D.C. Court of Appeals  decision known as Volks Constructors upended the 40-year precedent when  it held that OSHA did not have the authority to issue a citation for an  occurrence of a violation that extended beyond the 6-month statute of  limitations as set forth in OSHA. The court noted that OSHA's previous  regulation provided for no specific articulated continuing obligation  to record injuries beyond 7 days.   There was a concurrent opinion in the Volks decision which made it  clear that a regulation, which expressly provides for an employer's  continuing obligation, would be lawful.   Now, when you talk about what the court decided and what Mr. Garland  wrote, that was on the previous regulation, not on this one.   Informed by the guidance of the court, OSHA has issued a new rule  which does make it clear that an employer's duty to maintain an  accurate record of workplace injuries and illnesses is, in fact, an  ongoing obligation.   So let's be clear, eliminating this rule means that employers who  want to underreport injuries will face no sanctions if the injuries go  back more than 6 months. Rolling back this rule essentially creates a  vast safe harbor for noncompliance and creates the perverse incentive  for underreporting.   The premise behind the resolution today is that it is unlawful. If  that is the case, Congress should repeal the regulation. But no court  has reviewed this new rule, only the predecessor. There has been no  appeal of the new rule that has been lodged since the new rule was  issued in December.   The proper course of action is to have the courts decide the legal  question since arguably they are in the best position to interpret the  laws and evaluate the precedents. This especially makes sense since one  of the concurring opinions in the Volks case identified abundant legal  precedent for tolling the statute of limitations when there are  continuing violations in other laws that are nearly identical to the  reporting requirements in OSHA. These include the Consumer Credit  Reporting Act and the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.   On the other hand, if the purpose of passing this resolution is just  to eliminate the possibility of OSHA's clarifying rule could ever be  found lawful, then it is obvious that H.J. Res. 83 is an ideological  attack without any regard for consequences to worker safety.   On the other hand, if there is a bona fide view that OSHA lacks the  adequate legal basis for the rule, then the constructive solution would  be to amend OSHA and provide for the clarifying statutory authority. We  should not be repealing the rule because we know what happens when this  deterrent is eliminated. After OSHA lost its authority to enforce the  violations outside the 6-month window under the Volks decision, there  was a 75 percent reduction in the number of citations issued for  underreporting, and that is according to OSHA data.   So, Mr. Speaker, there has been no hearing held on this final rule or  this resolution. There has been no assessment of the consequences of  underreporting of injuries which will occur if this resolution is  adopted, and there has been no evaluation of any alternative way to  ensure accountability for employers who flout the law. There has just  been a headlong rush to push this resolution to the floor just a few  days after its filing.   So given the complete lack of deliberation regarding this new rule,  this Congressional Review Act resolution is premature, at best, but it  will definitely have regrettable consequences to the health and safety  of the people that we are charged to protect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, prior to yielding, I just want to make a comment that  the court struck down the previous rule, not the rule which is the  subject of this resolution. The previous rule did not have a specific  citation about a continuing obligation. This rule does. The excerpts  from the Garland concurring decision says:         None of this is to say, as the petitioner suggests in its       opening brief, that a statute of limitations like OSHA's       statute of limitations can never admit to a continuing       violation for a failure to act. To the contrary, where a       regulation or statute imposes a continuing obligation to act,       a party can continue to violate it until that obligation is       satisfied.    This regulation specifically cites the obligation as a continuing  obligation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).                                time  1545    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman for his very astute  argument and his leadership on the committee.   I am going to narrow my argument to, I think, very realistic  questions about whether or not we are procedurally in the context of  overruling the OSHA decision out of the Federal courts or whether or  not this is really a question of do we want to protect the rights of  American workers and protect them from the years of injuries that  preceded the establishment of OSHA. I want to fall on the side of the  American worker.   Let me be very clear what we are talking about today. The ruling that  we are speaking about went against 40 years of precedence in reporting  workplace safety violations. Since 1972, every administration has  maintained that the 5-year retention period for recording work-related  injuries, illnesses, or death is standard practice. This DOL rule was  simply put in place to codify and create some consistency that will  benefit both employers and employees.   Thank you, President Obama, who recognized that it is not the Member  of Congress who may slip on a rug in their privileged manner of coming  to this august body and voting, but it is, in fact, the workers who  come every day and pick up your garbage, the sanitation workers, the  same workers that Dr. King went to Memphis to stand up for and the  individuals who, because of their work, are susceptible to injuries  more often than not.   Individuals who work in construction, who help build our houses and  hospitals and tall skyscrapers, what excuse can we give for not  maintaining the standards of keeping and reporting those injuries for a  period of 5 years and the retention of such? Or those who work, for  example, in the area of railroads, railroad beds and railroad sites-- hard labor. Or those who work at our ports--hard labor.   So I rise to oppose disapproving the rule submitted by the Department  of Labor regarding OSHA, and I do so for the men and women who do the  heavy lifting.   I include in the Record a letter from AFSCME, which represents  municipal and county workers across America, establishing why we should  vote ``no'' on this.           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I'm writing to urge you to oppose H.J.       Res. 83, which would abolish an Occupational Safety and       Health Administration (OSHA) rule that clarifies an       employer's responsibility to maintain accurate records of       serious work-related injuries and illnesses.        The new OSHA rule creates NO new compliance or reporting       obligations and imposes no new costs on employers.        The 1970 law creating OSHA explicitly directed the agency       to ``prescribe regulations requiring employers to maintain       accurate records of and to make periodic reports on, work-      related deaths, injuries and illnesses other than minor       injuries . . . .'' Since the first recordkeeping regulations       issued in 1972, OSHA has required employers to record       workplace injuries on an ``OSHA log'' within seven days of       the injury and to maintain the records of the log and annual       summary of the log for five years. Every Republican and       Democratic administration since 1972 has interpreted this       employer obligation to make and maintain accurate records to       be ongoing from the date of the injury or illness until the       five-year retention period expires. OSHA issued this       clarifying regulation in December 2016 in response to a court       decision that dramatically limited OSHA's enforcement of       injury recordkeeping regulation to a six-month period. OSHA's       clarifying rule simply restores the standard to one employers       have known and complied with for 45 years.        H.J. Res. 83 would strip OSHA of its enforcement authority       and harm workplace safety.        Passage of this Congressional Review Act Resolution of       Disapproval would enable employers who deliberately and       recklessly break the law to avoid any penalties for       systemically failing to report or underreporting  [[Page H1424]]       injuries over many years. They would be able to cover up or       mask longstanding workplace hazards that need correcting.       OSHA has limited resources and, on average, can inspect a       workplace once every 140 years. OSHA relies upon reliable       injury and illness data to prioritize its resources to those       workplaces that present the greatest hazards to workers. H.J.       Res. 83 would remove OSHA's enforcement ability to protect       workers from the most dangerous and significant hazards.        Workplace injuries are real. Last year, a GAO report found       workplace violence is a serious concern for the approximately       15 million health care workers in the United States, but the       full extent of injuries that are the result of workplace       violence is unknown because of underreporting. Accurate       reporting would help OSHA, employers, workers and their       representatives respond more effectively to this prevalent       workplace hazard. H.J. Res. 83 would jeopardize the progress       that could be made on workplace violence and other workplace       injuries by blocking this basic reporting and recordkeeping       rule or a similar rule in the future.        We oppose H.R. Res. 83 and urge you to stand with workers       by rejecting this resolution.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. H.J. Res. 83 is wrong. It is wrong because it goes  against the hardworking people.   I also include in the Record, Mr. Speaker, a letter from the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters disapproving of H.J. Res. 83.                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to       oppose H.J. Res. 83, disapproving the rule submitted by the       Department of Labor relating to ``Clarification of Employer's       Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record       of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.'' Disapproving this       rule would undermine safety in some of the nation's most       dangerous industries, many of which employ Teamsters.        The rule does not impose new costs on employers and simply       reaffirms OSHA's ability to enforce injury and illness       recordkeeping. This rule became necessary when a 2012 court       decision overturned policy that had been in place for 40       years by limiting enforcement of OSHA's injury recordkeeping       regulations to a six month period. OSHA publishes the data       that it collects from employers on worksite injury and       illness which is then utilized by employers, unions, and       workers to identify and fix workplace hazards. With limited       resources, OSHA also utilizes the data to target its       enforcement and compliance activities to the most dangerous       workplaces thus making it essential that OSHA have accurate       information. With under-reporting of injury and illness data       already a major issue, it makes no sense to effectively strip       OSHA of its ability to enforce reporting requirements as this       ultimately impacts workplace safety. Congress should be       working to improve work place safety not undermine it, and       voting for H.J. Res 83 will ultimately harm working men and       women.        I urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 83 to protect OSHA's ability       to enforce accurate injury and illness reporting and to       ensure workers have a safe and healthy workplace.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand with the workers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 83, a  resolution ``Disapproving Department of Labor Rule Relating to  Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make And Maintain  an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury And Illness.''   I oppose this bill because it will harm workers who depend on the  Occupation Health and Safety Administration to ensure that their  workplaces are safe. H.J. Res. 83 will undermine workplace health and  safety and make it impossible for OSHA to ensure that injury and  illness records are complete and accurate.   Accurate records are needed to ensure OSHA focuses its limited  resources on the nation's most dangerous workplaces, instead of wasting  time in workplaces with low risk.   The Department of Labor rule at issue here does not create any new  obligations.   OSHA has enforced injury recordkeeping requirements by reviewing the  last five years of an employer's records throughout its entire history,  under every administration.   In 2012, a court decision limited enforcement of OSHA's injury  recordkeeping regulations to a six month period--a dramatic departure  from the last OSHA's 40 year policy and practice.   The 2016 rule simply allows OSHA to continue this practice.   Mr. Speaker, complete and accurate information on work-related  injuries and illnesses is important.   The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 directs the Secretary  of Labor to ``prescribe regulations requiring employers to maintain  accurate records of, and make periodic reports on, work-related deaths,  injuries and illnesses other than minor injuries.''   Since the early 1970's, OSHA has required construction employers to  keep these records.   The records are used by employers, workers, and unions at the  workplace to identify hazardous conditions, and take corrective action  to prevent future injuries and exposures.   Both positive and negative injury trends are tracked on a national  scale, allowing limited prevention resources to be targeted  effectively.   Most importantly, OSHA relies on the records to target its  enforcement and compliance assistance activities to dangerous  workplaces.   No employer, union, or individual could possibly want OSHA inspecting  safe workplaces rather than hazardous ones, but without accurate  information, this will happen.   Disapproval of the new rule puts construction workers lives in  danger.   Without the new rule, it will be impossible for OSHA to effectively  enforce recordkeeping requirements and assure that injury and illness  records are complete and accurate.   Underreporting of injuries and illnesses is already a huge problem,  and without enforcement, this will get much worse.   It will undermine safety and health and put workers in danger.   I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 83 and urge all Members to vote against  this ill-conceived and unwise legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume before I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   The law requires the keeping the records for 5 years. If there are  bogus records, you ought to have an obligation to keep them correct.  That has been the interpretation for 40 years, up until this decision.   We need the money to do their job. If they do their job, if we  provide them with some funding, they can show up more than once every  140-some years.   We keep talking about a court decision that affected another  resolution, not this one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a hardworking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a hardworking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a hardworking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, there are 2,000 inspectors at OSHA. There are 8 million  work sites. We can't expect them to visit every 6 months when the  funding only allows them to visit each workplace once every 140-some  years. You would have to show up at each place every 6 months to catch  these violations within that timeframe.   Mr. Speaker, for 40 years, the obligation to record these injuries  has been considered a continuing obligation. If the purpose is to  overrule the regulation because it is inconsistent with the statute,  then we should fix the statute. But this resolution just gives relief  to those who fail to record injuries and illnesses in violation of  their legal obligation to do so.   As Americans discover the plan to repeal this OSHA rule through a  resolution of disapproval, there are a lot of professional  organizations, in addition to the ones that have already been  introduced, that have been alarmed by this resolution.   The American Public Health Association has written:         Injury and illness records are invaluable for employers,       workers and OSHA to monitor the cause and trends of illnesses       and injuries. Such data is essential for determining       appropriate interventions to prevent other workers from       experiencing the same harm. . . . For decades, the public       health community and government agencies have identified a       widespread undercount of work-related injuries and illnesses.       This includes investigations by the GAO, the Bureau of Labor       Statistics and academic researchers. H.J. Res. 83  [[Page H1428]]       will have dire consequences for injury prevention and       undermine 40 years of occupational injury surveillance in the       United States.    The AFL-CIO has written:         In the absence of enforcement, there is no question that       the underreporting of injuries, already a widespread problem,       will get much worse, undermining safety and health and       putting workers in danger.                                time  1600    A group of 66 professional workplace safety groups wrote:         The OSHA clarifying rule on maintaining accurate records       imposes no new costs to business, but is critical to assuring       that workplace fatalities and injuries are prevented.    Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                                             AFL-CIO                                               Legislative Alert,                                                  February 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose H.J.       Res 83, a Congressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval       that would repeal an Occupational Safety and Health       Administration (OSHA) rule that clarifies an employer's       responsibility to maintain accurate records of serious work-      related injuries and illnesses. This resolution will make it       impossible for OSHA to ensure that injury and illness records       are complete and accurate and undermine workplace health and       safety.        The rule, issued in December 2016, is in response to a       court decision that limited enforcement of OSHA's injury       recordkeeping regulations to a six month period--a dramatic       departure from OSHA's 40 year policy and practice. The six       month restriction makes it impossible for OSHA to enforce the       Act's injury recordkeeping requirements, since OSHA does not       have the resources to conduct regular inspections of even the       most hazardous workplaces. Indeed, currently federal OSHA is       only able to inspect workplaces on average, only once every       140 years. The new rule creates no new obligations on       employers. It simply makes clear that employers have a       responsibility to maintain accurate injury and illness       records for 5 years and during this time can be held       accountable for violations if records are not complete and       accurate.        The collection of complete and accurate information on       work-related injuries and illnesses is a cornerstone of the       Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Act directs       the Secretary of Labor to ``prescribe regulations requiring       employers to maintain accurate records of, and make periodic       reports on, work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses other       than minor injuries.'' Since the early 1970's, OSHA has       required employers in the more hazardous industries to keep       these records and make reports to the Department of Labor.       These records form the basis of the Bureau of Labor       Statistics' (BLS) work-related injury and illness statistics       which are used to identify high-risk industries and       occupations and emerging problems and to track progress. OSHA       relies on the records to target its enforcement and       compliance assistance activities to dangerous workplaces. And       the records are used by employers, workers and unions at the       workplace to identify hazardous conditions and take       corrective action to prevent future injuries and exposures.        To ensure the accuracy of this critical information,       throughout its entire history, under every administration,       OSHA enforced injury recordkeeping requirements by reviewing       the last five years of an employer's records. This       comprehensive assessment allowed the agency to identify       widespread underreporting by some employers, which was       masking serious injuries and hazards. OSHA was able to take       strong enforcement action which brought about changes in       injury recordkeeping practices, but also led to significant       safety and health improvements to address hazards and prevent       future injuries.        Without the new rule, it will be impossible for OSHA to       effectively enforce recordkeeping requirements and assure       that injury and illness records are complete and accurate. In       the absence of enforcement, there is no question that the       underreporting of injuries, already a widespread problem,       will get much worse, undermining safety and health and       putting workers in danger.        The AFL-CIO asks you to stand up for the safety and health       of American workers and to reject H.J. Res. 83.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                                                     American Public                                              Health Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       the American Public Health Association, a diverse community       of public health professionals who champion the health of all       people and communities, I write to oppose H.J. Res. 83, a       resolution that would use the Congressional Review Act to       void an important Department of Labor policy which clarifies       an employer's obligation to make and maintain accurate       records of work-related injuries and illnesses. The       Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued this       regulation in December 2016 in response to an opinion issued       by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.        Public health professionals understand the critical       importance of accurate information to help identify hazards       in order to develop and implement better health and safety       protections. One important source of that information is the       records some employers are required to keep on work-related       injuries and illnesses. These records are invaluable for       employers, workers and OSHA to monitor the cause and trends       of injuries and illnesses. Such data is essential for       determining appropriate interventions to prevent other       workers from experiencing the same harm.        The regulation clarified for employers their ongoing       obligation to maintain an accurate and complete record of       workplace injuries and illnesses. It reiterated a long-      standing policy that an employer's duty to record an injury       on an OSHA log does not expire. It explained to employers       that keeping a record of an injury is an ongoing requirement       even if an employer failed to record the injury or illness at       the time it occurred. OSHA requires employers to keep and       maintain accurate records of injuries until the five-year       records retention period expires.        For decades, the public health community and government       agencies have identified a widespread undercount of work-      related injuries and illnesses. This includes investigations       by the Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Labor       Statistics and academic researchers. H.J. Res. 83 will have       dire consequences for injury prevention and undermine 40       years of occupational injury surveillance in the U.S.        We urge you to stand up for workers and workplace safety       and oppose this resolution.            Sincerely,                                          Georges C. Benjamin, MD.,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  February 28, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Foxx,       and Ranking Member Scott: We the undersigned organizations       write in strong opposition to H.J. Res 83, a Congressional       Review Act Resolution of Disapproval that would repeal an       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule       that clarifies an employer's responsibility to maintain       accurate records of serious work related injuries and       illnesses. This resolution will undermine workplace health       and safety in the most dangerous industries.        This OSHA clarifying rule does not impose any new costs nor       any new obligations to covered employers, nor does it affect       small businesses. It simply clarifies OSHA's authority to       hold employers accountable for their longstanding obligation       to maintain accurate injury records, a requirement that has       been in effect since the Nixon Administration. Further, the       rule only covers larger employers in the most dangerous       industries.        For over 40 years, only larger employers in high hazard       industries have been required to maintain records of serious       work related injuries and illnesses. OSHA regulations, issued       in the 1970's, require employers to maintain records for five       years. Since then, the Department's longstanding position has       been that an employer had an ongoing duty to assure that       those records were accurate. The Department of Labor uses       these records as the basis for published statistics on       workplace injury and illness rates and OSHA uses them to       allocate scarce agency resources for compliance assistance       and enforcement. Employers use these records as a guide to       identify and fix job dangers that injure and maim workers.        This rule is needed because in 2012, a court decision       overturned 40 years of recordkeeping precedent and made it       impossible for OSHA to enforce against recordkeeping       violations in dangerous industries that are more than six       months old. One of the three judges indicated that OSHA could       enforce for continuing violations of its recordkeeping rule       if the agency clarified its regulation. The rule that is the       subject of H.J. Res 83 remedies the problem and clarifies       that OSHA may enforce for continuing violations for the       failure to record serious work related injuries and       illnesses.        Accurate injury and illness records are vitally important       to the protection of workers. They are the most important       tool that employers and government use to identify and       eliminate job hazards that kill over 4,800 workers a year and       seriously injure almost 3 million more. OSHA can only inspect       every workplace under its jurisdiction once every 140 years.       If employers have no obligation to maintain accurate records       during the five year retention period, worker health and       safety will be seriously jeopardized.        We are organizations that strongly support ensuring safer       workplaces and protecting workers from serious workplace       hazards. We ask you to stand with American workers and  [[Page H1429]]       oppose H.J. Res 83. The OSHA clarifying rule on maintaining       accurate records imposes no new costs to business, but is       critical to assuring that workplace fatalities and injuries       are prevented.
