 Mr. President, let me begin by reviewing the threats the  United States is facing around the world today. The campaign against  ISIS is far from over. We must build on the success of retaking Mosul  and ensure an enduring defeat of terrorist threats in Iraq and Syria  and throughout the region.   Every day we learn more about Russia's asymmetric capabilities--from  cyber attacks to disinformation campaigns--even as they modernize their  military, occupy Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, and threaten our NATO  allies. China continues to militarize the South China Sea and modernize  its own military at an alarming rate. North Korea gets ever closer to  developing the capability to strike the U.S. homeland with a nuclear- armed missile.   I could spend a lot of time going through all of the threats we face.  We are at war. We are at war. There are brave young men and women  serving in Afghanistan, as I speak. Some of them have been wounded and  killed. We must always ask ourselves: Are we really doing all we can to  support them?   Our military is facing a crisis. Years of budget cuts from this  Congress have failed our men and women in uniform. In order to rebuild  the military, the Pentagon needs to ramp up readiness programs and  embark on an ambitious plan for modernization to make sure our  servicemembers are given the training, resources, and capabilities they  need. To do that, the Department of Defense must have senior  leadership.   The position of Deputy Secretary of State is one of the most critical  positions in our government. It is essentially the chief operating  officer of the largest, most complex organization in the world--the  Department that is entrusted with ensuring our national security.   Patrick Shanahan is a well-qualified nominee who passed out of the  Armed Services Committee on a voice vote. This body voted  overwhelmingly, 98 to 1, to confirm General Mattis as Secretary of  Defense. He had our overwhelming support to lead the Department during  challenging times. Yet we have not given Secretary Mattis the senior  leadership he needs to help him do his job.   Tomorrow, I say to my colleagues, the current Deputy Secretary of  Defense, Bob Work, will leave his office. There simply is no more time  to delay moving the nomination of Patrick Shanahan. You can choose to  vote no, you can choose to vote yes, but let's just vote. The  obstruction has gone on long enough, and it has to stop.   I wish to say, I understand the frustration my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle feel with the process we have been through,  particularly on the issue of healthcare. The issue of healthcare should  have gone through  [[Page S3969]]  the relevant committees. It should have had amendments, it should have  had debate, it should have had discussion, and maybe we could have  passed something going through the regular order, and we didn't. I  understand the frustration my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are feeling. I felt the same thing in 2009 when we did ObamaCare,  basically on the same basis. Yet amnesia seems to have set in here or  new Members are not remembering or care.   What is going on in this body, unfortunately, these days is plagued  by partisanship and politics. This is a time to put aside all of that  for the sake of our national security and come together as Republicans  and Democrats to move this nomination. Our men and women in uniform  deserve no less.   Let me say again to my friend from New York, whom I have enjoyed  doing battle with for many years, he is a man of honesty and integrity  and a man of his word. I understand his frustration, and I understand  the frustration on the other side of the aisle because we felt the same  thing.   I would again ask the indulgence of the leader of the Democrat Party  on the other side to at least consider this unanimous consent request.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 157, the nomination of Patrick  Shanahan to be Deputy Secretary of Defense; that the nomination be  confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Before the Democratic leader leaves, may I ask one more?   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. on Monday, July  17, the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 157. I further ask that there be 30 minutes of  debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form and that  following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate,  and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.   Before I ask for a ruling on that, may I just say that the Senator  from New York has a legitimate comment. Why in the world we would be  wasting time on the Ambassador to Japan when we have the Department of  Defense nominees in line is something I can neither account for, nor  can I condone. So I understand the frustration of the Senator from New  York.   Maybe sometime after our 2 weeks in August, perhaps some of us ought  to sit down and talk and work out an agenda. We have a train wreck  coming, as the Senator from New York knows. We have the debt limit. We  have appropriations bills to pass. We have all these things piling up,  we have about 30 days to do it in, and so far, I have seen no plan to  address these challenges.   The only way we are going to address some of these challenges, I say  to my colleagues, with their partisanship and anger and dislike of  anybody who lives over there, the fact is that we need to work together  to work these things out, and we can do it without betraying principle,  but we can also do it by understanding the priorities and the  dedication and patriotism of those on the other side of the aisle.   So I understand the Senator from New York. I don't agree with the  Senator from New York, but I understand his frustration. So I renew my  consent request.    May I ask one more question of the Democratic leader?  When would Mr. Shanahan's nomination be in order?    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the  Open America's Waters Act of 2017. This bill would repeal the Merchant  Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, an archaic and  burdensome law that hinders free trade, stifles the economy and  ultimately hurts consumers, largely for the benefit of labor unions. If  this legislation becomes law, U.S. shippers will no longer be required  to patronize market inefficiency but rather, effectively leverage the  global shipping market.   As many of my colleagues know, the Jones Act is one of many of laws  passed over time that addresses port-to-port coastal shipping, drafted  in order to protect the U.S. domestic shipping industry. While the  Jones Act may have had some rationale back in the 1920s when it was  enacted, today it serves only to raise shipping costs, making U.S.  farmers and businesses less competitive in the global marketplace and  increasing costs for American consumers. This protectionist mentality  directly contradicts the lessons our nation has learned about the many  benefits of a free and open market. Repeatedly, it has been proven that  trade liberalization has created  [[Page S4001]]  jobs, expanded economic growth and provided consumers with access to  lower cost goods and services.   The forced purchase of American vessels combined with the immense  cost associated with U.S. shipbuilding has forced U.S. shippers to act  against their best interests to the detriment of their businesses.  While foreign-built coastal-sized ships typically cost between $25-30  million, a U.S.-made ship of the same size can cost anywhere between  $190-250 million. A repeal of the Jones Act, over time, would have  broad impact. According to a 2002 U.S. International Trade Commission  study, repealing the Jones Act would lower shipping costs by about 22  percent. The Commission also found that repealing the Jones Act would  have an annual positive effect of $656 million on the overall U.S.  economy. Though this decade-and-a-half-old study provides some of the  most recent statistics available, it is not hard to imagine the modern  affect that maritime deregulation would contribute to this industry.   Congress must take action to repeal laws that have outlived their  usefulness and are no longer relevant to modern commerce. It is  unacceptable that millions of dollars in the U.S. economy are lost  every year to an antiquated policy, and unacceptable that this body is  unable to disengage from special interests in order to participate in a  productive debate on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to reflect  on our responsibility as lawmakers and see the Jones Act for what it  really is: an outdated and protectionist policy that only serves to  harm the American economy and consumer.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the  Open America's Waters Act of 2017.
