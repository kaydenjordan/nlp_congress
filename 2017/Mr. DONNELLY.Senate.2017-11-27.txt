 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize James Whitcomb  Riley Elementary School of New Castle, IN, for being named a 2017  National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.   Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program  recognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational  excellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic  background. Since its inception, this program has offered the  opportunity for schools in every State to gain recognition for  educational accomplishments in closing the achievement gaps among  students.   Recognized as an ``A'' school 11 of the past 12 years, James Whitcomb  Riley Elementary has shown its outstanding commitment to high-quality  education. Through its core curriculum and extracurricular activities,  faculty at Riley work to ensure that each child is receiving the best  possible educational experience. As part of that effort, the school's  staff communicates regularly with families and partners with community  organizations to ensure that students are receiving the resources that  they need. In addition, extracurricular opportunities are offered  throughout the year and include Spell Bowl and Math Bowl competitions,  a science fair, student council, and the National Geographic Bee. Riley  students also regularly go out in the community for field trips to  learn outside the classroom. Sixth-grade students take an annual trip  to Washington, DC, to learn about the Federal Government in our  Nation's Capital.   Riley Elementary also puts an emphasis on service and giving back  through fundraisers and food drives, instilling in students the  importance of a community-focused mindset. Riley students participate  in the annual Westminster Food Drive each winter to donate gifts to  children at local shelters and abroad. The school also partners with  Riley Children's Hospital through ``Spirit Week'' to connect students  with young patients being treated at the hospital.   Riley's students, facility, and staff work together to ensure every  child succeeds, and the faculty partners with parents to encourage  family engagement and parent involvement in school-sponsored  activities, including a strong parent teacher organization.   I am proud to recognize James Whitcomb Riley Elementary School's  principal Nicholas John Middleton, the entire staff, the student body,  and their families. The effort, dedication, and value you put into  education has led not only to this prestigious recognition, but will  benefit you and the New Castle community well into the future.   On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate James Whitcomb  Riley Elementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued  success in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Pleasant View  Elementary School of Zionsville, IN, for being named a 2017 National  Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.
