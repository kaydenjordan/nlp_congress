 Madam Speaker, I rise today as the daughter of immigrants  to urge my colleagues to please vote ``no'' on an even more  dehumanizing bill. It dehumanizes our immigrant neighbors. H.R. 2,  which is known better as the child deportation act, is fueled with  hateful rhetoric that I think is very dangerous for our country.   I am honestly not sure if the goal with this bill is to worsen our  broken immigration system or to simply keep as many Black and Brown  immigrants out of our country as they can. I know bringing back family  and child deportation is immoral. Prohibiting funds to organizations  providing lifesaving humanitarian aid to migrants is simply cruel.   This bill dehumanizes and is incredibly painful to see our colleagues  pushing forward. Many have called it racist and inhumane, that it is  fear-mongering, and that it is failed policies that will continue to  worsen our broken immigration system.   We must in this Chamber protect all of our neighbors. We also must  work toward protecting those who are fleeing horrific violence. We need  to continue to be leaders in creating a safe haven for those who seek  asylum.  [[Page H2179]]    We cannot and should not embrace hate rhetoric and policies that only  seek to pit communities against each other, tear families apart, and  put our immigrant neighbors in harm's way here in the United States,  Madam Speaker, and also those from other countries.   No human being is illegal. I believe that in my heart. I will  continue to fight to make sure that we pass some sort of comprehensive  immigration reform that gives our immigrant neighbors the dignified,  legal pathway to citizenship they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting against this horrible, racist  bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                       Engaging With the Mamas' Caucus     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize mothers of the Michigan  12th Congressional District and across our country. I wish them all  Happy Mother's Day.   I am proud to be a mother of two incredible boys. That is why, last  year, I joined Mothering Justice, a national organization made up of  mothers to create the first-ever Congressional Mamas' Caucus.   We are fighting together for fair and equitable access to childcare,  paid leave, and benefits for our care workers, and real economic  justice for our families.   In the Mamas' Caucus, we are committed to advocating for all mamas.  We must not only pass important policies about mothers to help mothers  but with our mothers. That is why the Congressional Mamas' Caucus is so  incredibly important.   We all know the cost of raising a family in our country is among the  highest in the world and that our policies and social safety nets too  often leave our families behind, especially communities of color. We  also know that mamas are on the front lines of our fight for  reproductive justice and more.   Again, we cannot leave them behind, and we cannot continue to talk  about policies that directly impact them without them being there at  the table to shape those policies so it can be transformative and  meaningful.   If anything, Madam Speaker, the pandemic exposed just how broken our  safety nets were, and the Mamas' Caucus remains committed to ending  child poverty, to focus on those safety nets that continue to not serve  our families currently.   I read a quote during the pandemic that I think resonates why the  Mamas' Caucus is so important in this Chamber. It was a quote by a  wonderful poet, Sonya Renee Taylor. In the midst and height of the  pandemic, she said: ``We will not go back to normal. Normal never was.  Our pre-corona existence was not normal other than we normalized greed,  inequity, exhaustion, depletion, extraction, disconnection, confusion,  rage, hoarding, hate, and lack. We should not long to return, my  friends. We are being given the opportunity to stitch a new garment,  one that fits all of humanity and nature.''   Again, this was her expression, and it resonates for mothers like  myself and across the country an understanding that the pandemic gave  us an opportunity to recognize those broken systems and how we need to  create a new garment. The way we can do it is by bringing mothers in  the room as we develop these policies that directly impact all of our  families.   Madam Speaker, I welcome my colleagues to be engaged with the  Congressional Mamas' Caucus, to engage on the policies we are pushing  forward. I appreciate this opportunity to uplift them in this Chamber  every day--not only on Mother's Day, but every single day.                            ____________________
