 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by title for  the second time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 937) to facilitate the expedited review of       COVID-19 hate crimes, and for other purposes.     Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection has been heard.   The bill will be placed on the calendar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a week ago the Nation reeled in horror as  a deranged gunman shot and killed eight people at three different  locations across the Atlanta area. Six of them were Asian-American  women.   Just 6 days later, another shooting. Ten people were shot and killed  by a gunman who entered a grocery store in Boulder, CO. Some were  customers, some were employees. One was as young as 20, and one was as  old as 65.   One of the victims was merely walking through the parking lot after  fixing the coffee machines at the nearby Starbucks, the son of Serbian  refugees and the shining hope of his family.   One of the fallen was a local police officer, Eric Talley, an 11-year  veteran of Boulder Police and a father of seven. You look at each of  their faces--young, wise, older. You ache. Gone. You think of their  families whom you don't know. They never will see them again, taken so  cruelly and so quickly.   Today, flags around the Capitol will remain at half-staff in honor of  the victims, and we all grieve with their families. We also grieve with  the community of Boulder and the people of Colorado. And we grieve with  the people of Georgia and all people across the United States whose  lives have been  [[Page S1724]]  forever marred by the plague of gun violence.   COVID-19 is not the only epidemic claiming innocent lives in America.  Last year alone, 20,000 Americans were killed by gun violence, the  highest number in almost two decades. Most of these incidents never  reached the headlines, but we cannot allow ourselves to become numb to  their devastation. After one of the most difficult years in American  history, we all want our lives and our country to return to normal. But  not this normal--oh, no, not the normal that accepts everyday gun  violence as a matter of course, an incidental risk to living in these  United States of America. We cannot, we must not accept that as normal.  We must not shrink from our moral obligation to act.   Two years ago, the Republican leader, then in the majority, promised  that this Chamber would have a real debate on gun violence in this  country. It never happened. Even the former President made some noises  about supporting commonsense gun safety measures before quickly  retreating, the result, once again, of bitter, reflexive opposition by  the NRA to any progress and fear among so many Republicans of what the  NRA might do to them if they spoke truth to power.   Well, now we don't have a Republican majority. We have a Democratic  one. This time is going to be different. A Democratic majority in the  Senate is going to act. I have committed to put legislation to expand  background checks on the floor of the Senate. We will debate it. We  will vote on it.   Just yesterday, my colleague Senator Durbin led the Judiciary  Committee in hearing from scores of witnesses about proposals to reduce  gun violence that the Senate might take up.   I have started the process to make legislation to combat hate crimes  against Asian Americans, led by Senators Hirono and Representative Meng  in the House, available for action on the floor.   I have been told by so many Asians in New York that they are afraid  just to walk down the street, something they used to do easily. I have  seen the pain and fear in their faces as I have attended the rallies in  New York.   Make no mistake, under the Democratic majority the Senate will debate  and address the epidemic of gun violence in this country                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the Levine nomination, today, the  Senate will confirm the nomination of Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's top  health official, to be the next Assistant Secretary of Health and Human  Services.   The Biden administration has brought many historic firsts into its  ranks, including the first openly gay Cabinet Secretary of any Agency.  The confirmation of Rachel Levine represents another important  milestone for the American LGBTQ community. She will be the first  openly transgender official ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The arc  of history is long, but it keeps bending in the direction of justice.   As transgender Americans suffer higher rates of abuse, homelessness,  and depression than almost every other group, it is important to have  national figures like Dr. Levine, who, by virtue of being in the public  spotlight, will help break down barriers of ignorance and fear.   Pennsylvania's political leaders say Dr. Levine has forced people in  their State to better understand the transgender community. One State  legislator said:         She has robbed people of the false premise that they don't       know any trans people and therefore don't need to be       respectful of trans people.    The historic nature of her nomination should not be lost on anyone,  but Dr. Levine thoroughly deserves to be confirmed on the strength of  her qualifications.   Despite several attacks on her gender identity over the past year,  Dr. Levine has stayed laser-focused on helping the State of  Pennsylvania manage and respond to COVID. The quality of her public  service is reflected in the fact that she was confirmed not once, not  twice, but three times by the Republican-led State senate to serve  first as physician general and then as health secretary.   The U.S. Senate should follow suit today and make Dr. Levine the  Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one more issue, I was just over at the  Rules Committee hearing. It is the first hearing I attended as majority  leader because it was about S. 1, so important. And there, I showed--I  showed my anger and frustration at what Republican legislatures are  attempting to do throughout the country, take away people's right to  vote, particularly people of color.   You know, it has been more than 160 years since the 13th, 14th, and  15th Amendments abolished slavery, but Jim Crow is still with us. When  a State says you need a notary public to cast an absentee ballot, it is  no different than asking African Americans to guess the number of  jellybeans in the jar before they vote. It is certainly no different in  intent to deprive them of their right, their constitutional right to  vote.   And here we have Republican Senators making excuses for these vicious  and often bigoted deprivations of the right to vote. They say that this  is a State issue. No, Congress has passed numerous laws dealing with  Federal voting rights, and, in fact, the Constitution explicitly says  that the Congress has the ability and right to do it. And yet  Republicans who lost the election, instead of doing what we should be  doing in a democracy--when you lose, you are supposed to figure out why  you lost and win over the voters you didn't, but they would just  deprive the voters who voted against them of the right to vote. That is  eerily reminiscent of what dictators like Erdogan in Turkey or Orban in  Hungary would do.   Our Republican Party has sunk so low that they have a Republican  leader who is over in the Rules Committee defending these actions by  State legislatures.   I asked him and all the Republicans to give us a reason. Why did the  Georgia Legislature only pick Sundays to say there should be no early  voting on Sunday? We know why. It is because that is the day African  Americans vote in the ``souls to the polls'' operation, where they go  from church to vote. It is despicable.   Every time you think the country has moved a long way, you see steps  taken backward. Let's make no mistake about it, the shadow of Donald  Trump--his big lie, his incessant focus on doing anything that benefits  him, no matter if it is the truth or not, if it is constitutional or  not, if it is racist or not--has now fallen over this party, and they  are not even standing up to protect the sacred right to vote.   Shame, shame, shame on all of them. Shame. How can you defend these  actions throughout legislatures, which the Washington Post said would  amount to tens of millions of people losing their right to vote?   Are we a democracy? Are we? The shadow of Donald Trump falls dark and  large over this caucus when they act like that, and it happens far too  often. We will not let this stand. We will not let this stand. S. 1  will pass this body.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.
