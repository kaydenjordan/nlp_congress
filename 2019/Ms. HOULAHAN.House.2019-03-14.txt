 Mr. Speaker, I rise for my Molly.   I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives as a proud  mother of a gay daughter.   When I was in the Air Force, we were taught never to leave anyone  behind; and, after the 2016 election, I listened as my daughter, my  Molly, cried in my arms.   She was scared for her community, the LGBTQ community. She was scared  that America had left her and her community behind.   This is and was the country that I served. This was the daughter that  I have raised. I was scared too.   When we decided, as a family, to run for Congress, Molly and I spoke  about her story and whether she was comfortable with me sharing it with  our Nation. We agreed that it was important.   As a mother, an ally, and now a Member of Congress, I feel it my duty  and my privilege to champion the voices of those in the LGBTQ  community.   I am proud to cosponsor the Equality Act. I do so for my daughter--my  Molly--for my community, the Pennsylvania 6th, and for all of my fellow  LGBTQ Americans.   You will not be left behind.                            ____________________
