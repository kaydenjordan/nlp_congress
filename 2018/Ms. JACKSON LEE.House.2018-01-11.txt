 Mr. Speaker, let me repeat the refrain of those of  us who are members of the Judiciary Committee who have gone through  this process since 9/11, and that is that we support the integrity and  the importance of section 702 as a national security tool, and we want  it reauthorized, but we want it right.   Our job and our task is also to be the protectors of the Fourth  Amendment, and that is the protection of the American people against  unreasonable search and seizure.   No matter how much my friends on the other side of the aisle argue,  we know that the FBI can have the tools that it needs; but, in the  instance of this underlying bill, similar to the bill that was passed  in 2007 by the Bush administration, on which the Judiciary Committee  came back and amended it and made it a bill that provides the tools  that were needed by those who are on the front lines in the United  States military and the FBI, ultimately, it was changed to deny those  rights.   In this instance, the warrant that my friends are talking about is  revised only to fully predicated cases. It does not apply to the  searching of documents that will have information about Americans.   I ask my colleagues to postpone this. Let us work together on behalf  of the American people. Who are we if we cannot uphold the  Constitution? It is not protected in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in  strong opposition to S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of  2017.''   S. 139 reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, which is scheduled to expire on January 19, 2018.   Section 702 authorizes the Justice Department and NSA to collect non- U.S. persons' communications that are sent while abroad.   The collection programs have to be approved each year by the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court).   The FISA Court was set up by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act (FISA; Public Law 95-511) to oversee intelligence- gathering activities and ensure compliance with the U.S. Constitution.   Under FISA, the term ``U.S. person'' covers citizens, green card  holders, associations with a ``substantial number of members'' who are  U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and U.S.-incorporated companies.   Title VII also allows intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance  on a specific U.S. person reasonably believed to be outside of the  country, with the approval of the FISA Court.   The NSA's use of section 702 authority to collect Americans'  information from their communications with foreign surveillance targets  was revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.   Snowden also revealed that the NSA obtains communications from U.S.- based providers such as Google, Verizon, and Facebook.   Although Section 702 is a critical national security tool set to  expire on January 19, 2018, events of the recent past strongly suggest  that Section 702 should not be reauthorized without necessary and  significant reforms that are not included in the legislation before us.   So as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I oppose the bill for  several compelling reasons:   1. S. 139 fails to address the core concerns of Members of Congress  and the American public--the government's use of Section 702  information against United States citizens investigations that have  nothing to do with national security.   2. The warrant ``requirement'' contained in the bill is riddled with  loopholes and applies only to fully predicated, official FBI  investigations, not to the hundreds of thousands searches the FBI runs  every day to run down a lead or check out a tip.   3. S. 139 exacerbates existing problems with Section 702 by codifying  so-called ``about collection,'' a type of surveillance that was shut  down after it twice failed to meet Fourth Amendment scrutiny.   4. S. 139 is universally opposed by technology companies, privacy,  and civil liberties groups across the political spectrum from the ACLU  to FreedomWorks.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us comes from the Intelligence  Committee, where it was passed on a strict party-line vote.   This stands in stark contrast to H.R. 3989, the USA Liberty Act the  bipartisan bill reported by the Judiciary Committee after multiple  hearings, an open markup process, and a bipartisan vote of approval.   The USA Liberty Act enjoys much broader support, contains meaningful  reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and is far  superior to the bill before us.   Inexplicably, the House Republican leadership did choose the best  option, which was to bring the USA Liberty Act to the floor for debate  and vote; instead, they chose the worst option, which is S. 139, the  bill before us.   For this reason, I urge all members to join me in supporting the  Amash-Lofgren Amendment, the best option remaining before us.   The Amash-Lofgren strike the text of S. 139 in its entirety and  substitutes in its place the text of the ``Uniting and Strengthening  America by Reforming and Improving the Government's High-Tech  Surveillance Act'' (``USA RIGHTS Act'').   In contrast to S. 139, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' enacts necessary and  meaningful reforms to Section 702, which are necessary in light of the  past abuses of surveillance authorities, contemporary noncompliance  with this authority, and the danger posed by potential future abuses.   First, the USA RIGHTS Act creates a search warrant requirement that  closes the so-called ``backdoor search loophole'' through which the  government searches, without first obtaining a court-issued warrant  based on probable cause, for information about U.S. persons or persons  inside the U.S.   The ``USA RIGHTS Act'' provides an exception for emergencies, but  requires a court warrant afterward.   Second, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' prohibits the collection of domestic  communications and permanently ends ``about'' collection, an illegal  practice the National Security Agency recently stopped because of  persistent and significant compliance violations.   This is important because while ``reverse targeting'' is prohibited  under the Jackson Lee Amendment incorporated in the USA Freedom Act  enacted on June 2, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-23), this prohibition was often  skirted by collecting information from communications that merely  mention an intelligence target.   Under the ``USA RIGHTS Act'', collections would be limited to  communications that are ``to'' or ``from'' a target, and the  intentional collection of wholly domestic communications is prohibited.   Third, the ``USA RIGHTS Act'' requires the government give notice  when it uses information obtained or derived from Section 702  surveillance in proceedings against U.S. persons or people on U.S. soil  which will enable a defendant to assert his or her constitutional  rights and help ensure that foreign intelligence surveillance is not  being misused.   Fourth, under the ``USA RIGHTS Act'', Section 702 authority sunsets  in 4 years, which will obligate the Congress to exercise regular  oversight and provide the opportunity to make necessary reforms before  reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  was enacted to protect the liberty and security of Americans, not to  diminish their constitutional rights.   All Americans want to find the common ground where commonsense rules  and regulations relating to fighting terrorism at home and abroad can  exist while still protecting the cherished privacy and civil liberties  which Americans hold close to our collective hearts.   That is why Section 702 should not be reauthorized with reforms to  prevent the government from using information against its political  opponents or members of religious, ethnic, or other groups.   One way to do that without interfering with the national security  objectives of 702 surveillance is simply to reject S. 139 and support  the USA RIGHTS Act by voting for the Amash-Lofgren Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I noted in an op-ed published way back in October 2007,  that as Alexis de Tocqueville, the most astute student of American  democracy, observed nearly two centuries ago, the reason democracies  invariably prevail in any military conflict is because democracy is the  governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that  are indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, courage, and a  love of justice.   And the best way to keep America safe and strong is to remain true to  the valued embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  [[Page H147]]    S. 139 does not strike the proper balance between our cherished  liberties and smart security.   We can do better; we should reject S. 139 and support the Amash- Lofgren Amendment.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, this body cannot be afraid of the  Constitution. It has been our guiding moral force for this Nation for  all of our beginnings and our nows.   This amendment is truly an amendment that will protect and provide  for the FBI to do its work and to protect our men and women around the  world who are wearing the uniform unselfishly. But let me be very  clear: all this amendment does, frankly, is provide a roadmap for the  FBI to utilize when it is surveying and it is using the private data of  Americans. All the amendment does is ask the FBI and the Attorney  General, where there is probable cause, that such communication provide  evidence of a crime; and, as well, if there is a foreign power or  foreign agent, to be able to utilize a warrant, and that is the  protection of the Fourth Amendment.   Uphold the Constitution. Vote for the Amash-Lofgren amendment and  let's move forward on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I will join the AFL-CIO's  2018 MLK Conference dealing with civil and human rights. At that time,  we will discuss the GOP tax scam that stops the labor movement in its  tracks because 83 percent of the tax cuts goes to the wealthiest 1  percent and raises taxes on 86 million.   I invite my constituents to join me from 1 to 3 at the Hilton  Americas, where we will be talking about the labor movement and the  devastation of the GOP tax scam on the American people.   At the same time, I am glad that I live in a nation that welcomes  those who want to serve coming from other countries and live up to the  ideals of this country.   I want to pay tribute to Rose and Jose Escobar. Jose came to this  country under TPS from El Salvador. It is important that this family  not be broken up. Jose was unfairly deported and deserves humanitarian  parole to come back to be with his loving wife, a citizen who works for  the Texas Medical Center, and his two wonderful children.   TPS, again, is not violating or jeopardizing the American people's  security. It is a reflection of our compassion, our humanity, and our  respect for those who come to this Nation fleeing persecution and  devastation. To send back Haitians, to send back El Salvadorans will be  a terrible tragedy, and to send back our DREAMers will be worse. Let's  work as Americans to make this country what it is, our greatest country  in the world.                            ____________________
