 Madam President, first, let me thank all of my  colleagues for their kind words during my time isolating due to COVID  last week. As you can see, I have made a full recovery after  experiencing only mild symptoms, thank God. COVID has done incalculable  damage to scores of American families, but because I was fortunate  enough to be vaccinated and double boosted, my case was not as bad as  it could have been.   I urge all Americans who have not been vaccinated yet to talk to  their doctors and get the vaccine, if possible, and then get boosted  when the time is right. Speaking from personal experience, it makes all  the difference in the world.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 989.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Now, Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 971.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, July 18, be waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
