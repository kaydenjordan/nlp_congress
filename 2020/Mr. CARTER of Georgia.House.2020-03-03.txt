 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alfred  E. Beach High School Head Football Coach, Ulysses Hawthorne, who is  retiring from the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools system after  21 seasons.   Coach Hawthorne is a stalwart in the Savannah athletics scene. At the  time of his retirement he was the dean of all the coaches in the area,  but, most importantly, he has always been an exceptional role model to  his players. Players he coached remember that he pushed them to become  leaders on and off the field. Many of his players are now playing at  the next level in college.   As a unit, his teams were successful against schools from across the  State of Georgia. In 2011, Coach Hawthorne took Alfred E. Beach High  School to its first appearance in the State playoffs since 1993. During  his tenure at Beach, he accumulated 76 wins.   I am so proud to have someone like Coach Hawthorne in the First  Congressional District of Georgia shaping the lives of young people.                            ____________________
