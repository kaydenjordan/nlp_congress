 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.  [[Page H5477]]    This is such a huge problem. There are so many different paths we  could go down with this discussion. It is so big of a crisis that it is  almost impossible to get it all articulated well within one Special  Order series.   Madam Speaker, late last month, the CBO released its ``May 2022  Budget and Economic Outlook.'' This is the first time the CBO has  produced a baseline that properly incorporates the runaway, destructive  inflation that is ripping through our economy today.   According to the CBO report, inflation is not going anywhere anytime  soon except up. This is a dramatic change from the insistence of the  President, the Treasury Secretary, and my Democrat colleagues that  inflation is merely transitory and is nothing to worry about.   They are, in fact, so out of touch that they have begun to change  their narrative. They now claim that Americans are financially  prepared--get this--financially prepared to weather $5 a gallon  gasoline, skyrocketing energy costs, and grocery prices that would have  been unthinkable just 18 months ago.   Now, I am not sure what Americans they are talking to, but they are  not talking to Americans who live in Appalachia where I live--seniors  who live on fixed incomes and others who struggle to make ends meet in  this high inflationary period. But inflation is not just a sticker- shock sensation. It will have ripple effects throughout the economy.  Debt will continue to rise to 110 percent of GDP over the next decade.   Don't be fooled by President Biden's propaganda claiming victory on  debt reduction either. CBO projects that deficits will be $2.4 trillion  larger over the next 10 years. The more President Biden continues to  pour gasoline on the inflation fire with his failed policies, the more  that number is going to keep growing.   Madam Speaker, we must get our fiscal house in order. The American  people have to live by a budget, and the American government should  live by a budget, too. The United States does not have a revenue  problem, we have a spending problem. And the first step in fixing this  problem is to fix our broken budget process.   That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2575, the TRUST Act,  to establish special rescue committees to begin developing  recommendations and legislation to protect and ensure the longevity of  Social Security and Medicare. These are some of the country's main  drivers of our debt. They are mandatory spending programs that are  absolutely out of control. Doing nothing about it is not an option.   I am also, as was mentioned, the co-lead on a bipartisan debt and  deficit working group as a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, and I  am willing to work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to find real  solutions to ensure Medicare and Social Security are around for our  children and our grandchildren to benefit from in the years to come.   Madam Speaker, this is a big problem. I look forward to hearing what  my colleagues have to say tonight. We need bold ideas to address the  fiscal crisis that looms in front of us.                                time  2045
