 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  against the previous question so that the House can address more  serious matters like the future of seniors' hard-earned benefits.   Bringing forth H. Res. 178 gives this body the opportunity to finally  affirm our commitment to protect and strengthen Social Security and  Medicare.   This is what American families want us focused on. When I talk to  Vermont families, they are concerned with putting food on the table,  with keeping their families safe, with how to afford lifesaving  medications, not with propping up corporate polluters at the expense of  our future.   Americans need us, on the record, promising that families won't have  to choose between essentials like medication, food, and housing.  Cutting Social Security and Medicare hurts the poorest and most  vulnerable among us. These programs support seniors to age with  dignity. They support Americans with disabilities to receive the  security that they absolutely depend on.   We are not going to let Social Security benefits go away--we are not.  Over 65 million Americans rely on hard-  [[Page H1477]]  earned Social Security benefits--65 million. These programs are how we  preserve the American middle class, and it is how we support all of the  working families in each of our districts.   We need to expand the infrastructure and funding of these programs to  fully support seniors in their retirement. We owe them this.   Mr. Speaker, I want all Americans to know, Americans are not going to  stop fighting to protect your hard-earned benefits. Again, I urge my  colleagues to turn their attention to real issues that impact real  American families, and defeat the previous question.
