 Mr. Speaker, the workers of the United States of America  are tired of being pawns in this big corporate game.   President Trump came to my community and said: Don't sell your house.  Don't sell your house. We are going to get these house prices back up.   And, since that time, we lost the second shift at our General Motors  plant; and General Motors, on that same day that the workers were  walking out, announced they are building a new factory in Mexico.   President Trump said: Don't sell your house.   A few months later, General Motors lays off the first shift. They  tell the workers 2 days after Thanksgiving.   And, just a couple of days ago, a trucking company, Falcon Transport,  just outside of Youngstown, Ohio, their workers get a text message--600  workers get a text message at 8:00 on a Saturday night: You lost your  job.   We got bailout money for every bank that wants one. Every savings and  loan, every corporation gets a tax cut to the tune of $2.3 trillion,  and no one gives a damn about the workers.   If we can bail out the corporations that have done everything wrong,  we can start helping the workers who have done everything right.                            ____________________
