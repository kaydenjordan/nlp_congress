 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  conference report.   I have been honored to be able to serve on the Defense Appropriations  Committee and also to represent Fort Hood, the great place, the tip of  the spear of our United States Army land forces.   I am very proud of what we are doing for those men and women who  stand in  [[Page H9045]]  harm's way on our behalf. We are giving them a 2.6 percent pay raise  for all of our troops, wherever they may be. And they have earned this  money because they stand in harm's way on our behalf. We are taking  care of our military families that are just as important a part of the  fight as our warriors, and this is a long time coming. This is the  largest pay raise in 9 years.   This bill contains accelerated efforts to modernize our armored  brigade combat teams, including modernizing a significant number of  Abrams tanks and Strykers so they can meet the needs of future war.  They are the tip of the spear. This is good for us and good for those  who stand in harm's way on our behalf   We are particularly proud of the fact that we have stood up the Army  Futures Command in Austin, Texas, which is just south of my home, and  we are going to learn about how to fight the next generations of wars  through the Futures Command.   I am very proud that we have support for General Mattis' goal of  ensuring our military is ready to fight the next fight--and fight it  tonight, if necessary.   Critically, this bill provides this funding on time, ensuring money  can be spent in its most efficient, effective way and that we are able  to accomplish our goals accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone both in the majority and the  minority who were involved in this bill and this conference, and I  thank them on behalf of the men and women who stand in harm's way on  our behalf and who live in my district.
