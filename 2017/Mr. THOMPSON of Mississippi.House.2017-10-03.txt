 Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am privileged to  rise in support of recognizing a true hero in not only the State of  Mississippi, but this country as a whole. Her name is Fannie Lou Hamer.  Fannie Lou Hamer will be 100 years old this week. I am happy to say  that part of who I am can be attributed to my association with Ms.  Hamer.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into my message, I would like to yield to  the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I will tell the gentlewoman  from New Jersey that I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Hamer as a young  college student at Tougaloo College. Facts about it, one of the first  campaigns I worked on as a college student was Ms. Hamer's campaign for  Congress, even though, as the gentlewoman indicated, she lost. But I  now represent the Second District of Mississippi, and it was Ms.  Hamer's spirit that still lives on.    In Sunflower County, Mississippi, the majority of the population is  African American. At the time she registered to vote, we had no African  Americans elected officials in Sunflower County. I am happy to report  to you now that the sheriff is African American; the chancery clerk,  the circuit clerk, four of the five county supervisors are African  American; so Ms. Hamer's work has not been in vain.   As you also indicated, the Devil is busy creating tricks to  disenfranchise people--voter ID, closing voting polls, making it more  difficult for people in rural areas to get to the polls to vote,  especially in areas where you don't have public transportation.   So, Ms. Hamer's 100th birthday should be spent rededicating ourselves  [[Page H7743]]  to her legacy. One of the things that everyone loves to quote is Ms.  Hamer's words that she is ``sick and tired of being sick and tired.''  Well, that goes a long way, especially given the administration we are  being challenged with here in Washington now. Hopefully, Ms. Hamer's  spirit will live on.   Congresswoman Karen Bass and myself visited Ms. Hamer's grave this  past Saturday in Ruleville, Mississippi, and it was very touching. The  community, in her death, has really embraced not only she, but her  husband, Pat, and created a monument downtown Ruleville to her memory.   When I was a freshman Member of this body, I named the post office in  Ruleville, Mississippi, after Ms. Hamer, and I am happy to say that the  mayor of Ruleville, Mississippi, now is an African-American female.   So Ms. Hamer's legacy, her involvement with SNCC, her involvement  with the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, all those things have  made not just Mississippi, but this country a better place--affordable  housing, all those things that she wanted, access to not only  healthcare, but access to affordable healthcare, many of those items  she talked about.   As a Christian woman, she believed in nonviolence, but she also  believed in direct action. She was assaulted in the Winona,  Mississippi, jail for advocating the right to vote.                                time  2015    In spite of what she encountered, she served as a shining example of  what a truly committed individual can accomplish.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to say to  the gentlewoman that that 1964 Atlantic City Democratic National  Convention set the tone for opening up the Democratic Party to people  of all races and colors because Mrs. Hamer challenged the all-White  makeup of the Mississippi delegation by saying Black people couldn't  participate. They were systematically excluded from the selection  process, and she appealed to that convention to do better.   I am happy, as you know, to report that the convention heard Mrs.  Hamer and decided that an all-White delegation from the State with the  highest percentage of African Americans in the country could not be  justified. So the delegation was not only integrated at the convention,  but, for a time, we shared the chairmanships of the party. We had a co- chair that was White and a co-chair that was African American. So Mrs.  Hamer's spirit still lives on.   One of the real issues that really touches most of our hearts is that  she was a very humble person. She had the kind of spirit in her  delivery that you just had to pay attention to. She had the aura when  she walked in a room that whatever you were doing, you had to stop and  pay attention to this very simple person who came in. But every time  she opened her mouth, something very prophetic would come out.   So for a lot of individuals who think that Fannie Lou Hamer's time  has come and gone, I think it is fitting and proper that at this 100th  birthday celebration, we recommit ourselves to many of the things that  Mrs. Hamer stood for: inclusion; not leaving people out because they  don't live in the big house on the hill; to make sure that our children  receive the best education possible. All of those things Mrs. Hamer was  noted for.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  the very kind comments. But to talk about Mrs. Hamer and her work is  easy. It speaks for itself. I am very privileged, as I indicated, to  have known her, to have participated in a number of meetings.   One of the other things that I realized, she didn't--as we used to  say, there were no big Is and little yous. She saw everyone the same.  It didn't matter whether you belonged to the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, or the Black Panther Party, or the Deacons for  Defense and Justice. You still had room at the table under Mrs. Hamer's  tutelage. Many of us are privileged to have known her in that way, and  we try to pattern our lives after her.   The National Council of Negro Women really worked very hard with Mrs.  Hamer in producing affordable housing and to making sure that farmers  cooperatives could be developed in the Mississippi Delta. Because as  some would choose to forget, Mrs. Hamer was put off the plantation that  she lived on because she was encouraging people to register and vote.   But those were the times that we all lived in, and we saw it. When I  ran for Congress, there were people who worked on farms who were  required to work overtime so that they couldn't go to the polls before  they closed. So there are a lot of things that we saw during Mrs.  Hamer's time. The tricks are still being played.   So it is in the spirit of Fannie Lou that we pay tribute tonight to  her. It is in that spirit of Fannie Lou that we wish her a happy 100th  birthday. But it is also in her spirit that, as they say in South  Africa, ``the struggle continues,'' ``a luta continua.''   I know in the Congressional Black Caucus we call ourselves the  conscience of Congress. We have to be. If we don't speak up for many of  the people that Mrs. Hamer loved the most, who will? We were sent here  to care for the opposition on behalf of the people who can't afford to  hire lobbyists; on behalf of the people who can't get on a plane and  fly to Washington and talk to their congressperson; on behalf of the  little child who not only is struggling to get into the Head Start  program, but whose parents are having a hard time.    So our representation as members of the Congressional Black Caucus is  predicated on many of the things that Mrs. Hamer stood for in her  lifetime. We can't ever forget her spirit. We can't ever forget her  energy. And even though we have the opportunity as Members of Congress  to meet people from all over the world, one of the things that she used  to say is: ``You know, I walked among kings, but I have always kept the  common touch.''   It is in that spirit that I appreciate the gentlewoman helping me  carry forth this time for Mrs. Hamer as she celebrates here 100th  birthday. If the  [[Page H7744]]  gentlewoman has some closing comments or something she would like to  add, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Thank you very much Mrs. Watson Coleman  for your participation.   The last point I would like to make is, in Mrs. Hamer's day, it was  poll tax. It was: How many bubbles are in a bar of soap? How many  grains of sand are on the beach?   Now it is moving the polls in the interest of saving money, but you  are disenfranchising people who don't have the ability to go further.  It is the gerrymandering of districts so that you have the richest  people in an area in the same district as the poorest people in that  area. There are no real communities of interest.   If I am worried about paying the light bill or the rent, then there  is a great possibility that I won't go vote. But if I own a house and  own a car and know where my next meal is coming from, I will go vote.  So we have what we call communities of interest, and Mrs. Hamer talked  about that.   So, again, we wanted to make sure that this week did not go by  without giving Mrs. Hamer her due recognition for her 100th birthday.  There will be a lot of other activities after this Special Order hour  in memory of Mrs. Hamer.   We have a movie that will be produced talking about her life and  legacy and her contribution to this great country of ours. I look  forward to that as well as making sure that our children and  grandchildren understand who this great woman was and what she meant to  this country of ours and so many of us who pattern after her. So,  again, thank you very much.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to President Trump's lack of  concern for the thousands of Americans affected by the hurricanes  throughout the U.S. and most recently in the U.S. Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico, which has reminded us of the devastation Hurricane Katrina  caused. Instead of showing compassion to those suffering, the president  and his administration have condemned African-American athletes and a  Black, female sports commentator for exercising their constitutional  right to protest and voice their opinions.   Today, I stand with the athletes who choose to take a knee during the  national anthem and those who speak out fighting against racial  inequality that still persists throughout this country.   I suggest President Trump spends less time tweeting discriminatory  comments and more time focusing on the issues of our country.   Tonight, I recognize a civil rights hero whose work is no small part  of the reason I and many other African-American members of Congress are  able to stand before you today.   Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer was born in 1917 in Montgomery County,  Mississippi. During the civil rights era, Ms. Hamer, at the age of just  6-years-old joined her family picking cotton on the plantation of W.D.  Marlow in Sunflower County, Mississippi.   Though, she began to pick cotton at a young age, Ms. Hamer was able  to complete many years in school learning how to read and write, which  helped her serve hundreds of African-Americans throughout her life.   In the 1960s, Ms. Hamer joined the Student Non-Violent Coordinating  Committee, an organization providing African-Americans the opportunity  to register to vote. Ms. Hamer taught Black Mississippians how to read  and write in order for them to pass discriminatory literacy tests  designed to prevent Black Americans from registering to vote.   In 1962, Ms. Hamer along with 17 Black Mississippians traveled by bus  from Ruleville, Mississippi, to Indianola, Mississippi, to register to  vote. Upon arrival, the group was blocked from entry by local law  enforcement. But, Ms. Hamer and one of her fellow travelers were able  to fill out a voter application and take the literacy test, but due to  discrimination the two were unable to register. This did not deter Ms.  Hamer's passion and willingness to fight racism throughout Mississippi.   On the group's way back to Ruleville, the bus was stopped by local  police officers and the driver was arrested. In that very moment of  racism and trail, Ms. Hamer began to sing Negro spirituals leaving a  clear message to her oppressors that she would never give up.   Her leadership was a beacon of hope for so many Black Mississippians  that in 1964, Ms. Hamer ran for Congress to represent Mississippi's  Second Congressional District as a Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  candidate, a party which she founded to promote equal rights for  African-Americans in Mississippi.   During the 1960s, very few women especially women of color threw  their hat into the ring for a Congressional bid. Her willingness to run  in Mississippi at that time was and continues to be a powerful act in  itself. Though she was unsuccessful, her speeches, messages and visits  to African-Americans around the state resonated.   Ms. Hamer provided inspiration for me to work for the Student Non- Violent Coordinating Committee, while I attended Tougaloo College  continuing Ms. Hamer's work to get African-Americans across Mississippi  registered to vote. I remember volunteering for Ms. Hamer's  Congressional campaign and getting inspired to serve the people of  Mississippi. Today, I represent Mississippi's Second Congressional  District, and I cannot help but think that Ms. Hamer is smiling down on  me. Her courage and brilliance is one of the reasons I stand on this  floor today.   I am honored to be able to give time to honor a legend and civil  rights icon. Ms. Fannie Lou Hamer's legacy will forever live on, and I  stand here today along with my colleagues to pay homage to a true hero.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks on my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, October 4, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
