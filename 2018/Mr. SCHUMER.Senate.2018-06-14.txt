 Mr. President, it has now been 2 days since the  Singapore summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim concluded.  America remains troubled by the lack of detail in the joint statement  signed by both parties, as well as some of the remarkable concessions  made by President Trump, especially the freeze of joint military  exercises with South Korea.   In the wake of this first meeting, it has become clearer and clearer  that Chairman Kim secured far more concessions than President Trump.  Yet, despite all the evidence, President Trump is acting like he just  secured world peace. The President is conducting an alternative reality  Presidency, and the recent summit with North Korea reveals it better  than ever. President Trump says we are no longer on the brink of war  with North Korea, after President Trump himself was the one who brought  us there in the first place, through bellicose rhetoric and  brinkmanship on Twitter. Now the President takes a victory lap for  undoing a problem he created in the first place. He pats himself on the  back, saying that we are now at peace. We were on the brink of war. He  forgets that he brought us there. What kind of Presidency is this?    Again President Trump tweeted yesterday: ``There is no longer a  nuclear threat from North Korea.'' Saying it, Mr. President Trump, does  not make it so--once again, an alternative reality Presidency.   Despite what the President says, Chairman Kim has not agreed to  dismantle North Korea's nuclear infrastructure. He has not agreed to  stop enriching plutonium and uranium. He has not agreed to any sort of  inspections regime. When Chairman Kim went home to North Korea, he did  not even mention his vague commitment to completely denuclearize. To  say there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea after one  meeting, after signing one sheet of paper, is living in an alternative  reality, and that is where it seems President Trump lives these days,  more than ever before.   Finally, in place of serious, arduous negotiations, President Trump  preferred signing ceremonies and proclamations. It is a pattern in his  Presidency: flash over substance, sign documents in front of cameras,  but skip out on the hard work behind the scenes.   The idea is to make it look as if the President is getting stuff  done, but not actually doing the hard work and getting it done. We  can't have a President who is interested only in playing the role of  President. He has to do the job of President.   On a matter as serious as negotiations with North Korea, there is no  substitute for the hard work of real diplomacy. Only in President  Trump's alternative reality Presidency do photo ops and handshakes  suffice, especially when North Korea still presents such a great danger  to us. If tomorrow morning Kim Jong Un did a 180-degree reversal, after  having gotten what he wants--the handshake, the summit, the reduction  of sanctions--we would be in real danger, and President Trump acts like  it is all over--an alternative reality Presidency. But when it comes to  something as serious and dangerous as North Korea, it is not a joke; it  is serious stuff.   The hard details, the concrete concessions, the diplomatic gains for  the United States, and safety from a still dangerous North Korea simply  have to wait in President Trump's world, and it doesn't even seem to  matter if they never happen.   We hope sincerely that those hard details do come. We hope sincerely  that the Singapore summit was only the first step, rather than the  final result, because we all wish to see a diplomatic  [[Page S3931]]  resolution to the conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Ninety-nine percent  of all Americans don't just want a photo op. We are glad that President  Trump is actually trying, at least, to channel diplomacy, but he needs  to stop behaving like all the hard work is behind him and open his eyes  to the reality that bringing an end to a nuclear North Korea is not as  easy, as simple, or as quick as a few days of photo ops.                       Department of Justice IG Report    Now, Mr. President, on another subject, this afternoon we expect to  receive the report of the Department of Justice's inspector general,  who has been reviewing the conduct of the Department of Justice and the  FBI in the runup to the 2016 election.   Although we have not yet seen the inspector general's report, there  is no reason--no reason--to believe that it will provide any basis to  call the special counsel's work into question.   The IG report concerns an entirely separate investigation from the  Russia probe that Special Counsel Mueller is conducting. The IG report  concerns issues that started long before Special Counsel Mueller was  even appointed and concluded before he began his investigation.   Furthermore, the one thing we do know about what happened in late  2016 is that certain actions taken by the FBI, intentionally or not,  helped the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign. The release  that Candidate Clinton was under investigation and the release of  comments on what she had or had not done hurt her. It will take an  awful lot of spin, an awful lot of stretching for Republicans to twist  that around and portray the President as some kind of victim.   Regrettably, people like Chairman Nunes, like FOX News, and like some  of the Republican supporters of the President in Congress--and even  like the President himself--have been running a cynical campaign to  undermine the Russia investigation. It seems that the only limits to  the wild conspiracies they have cooked up are their imaginations. This  hurts America. We have heard new reports that Russia is looking to  meddle in our 2018 elections. If foreign powers can meddle in our  elections with impunity, this democracy is in trouble--in trouble--both  with what the foreign powers may do and in the lack of faith in  democracy it instills in people here in America and around the world.  Our Republican colleagues who use this and our President who uses this  as a political whipping boy are hurting our democracy.   So almost regardless of what the IG report says, we can probably  expect the President, Mr. Nunes, some of the FOX News commentators, and  others to invent new conspiracy theories and new calls for more special  counsels to investigate the investigators. Americans of all stripes are  beginning to see these theories for what they are--distortions meant to  undermine or distract from Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into  the very serious efforts of Russia to influence the outcome of our  elections. Well-meaning Members of both parties--both parties--should  call them out for what they are.   We are waiting to hear from some of our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle on this. There have been too few voices on something so  significant.                     National Defense Authorization Bill    Mr. President, on another matter--and this one of some  bipartisanship, I am happy to say--the Senate continues to process the  John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act in a bipartisan way  to give our military the support and certainty it needs and to make  crucial updates to our national security policy.   One strong bipartisan action in this bill is dealing with the Chinese  telecom giant ZTE. Let me remind this body that ZTE has violated U.S.  sanctions and lied about it, but, even more importantly, its technology  has been deemed a national security threat--a national security  threat--to these great United States by the FBI, the Pentagon, and the  FCC--all appointed by Republicans.   President Trump was flatout wrong when he decided to go easy on ZTE  and allow it to start selling its technology in the United States. If  you believe some reports, he did it, once again, on a whim--a phone  call from President Xi, our enemy on economic matters, who is robbing  American jobs and stealing our technology, and who calls him up and  says: Let's undo this. President Trump, seemingly without preparation,  without briefings by the military or intelligence agencies or our law  enforcement agencies, just does it, hurting America.   The good news is bipartisan efforts in this body and in the House to  undo what the President did and reimpose the penalties on ZTE that they  deserve.   President Trump was flatout wrong when he decided to go easy on ZTE  and allow it to start selling its technology in the U.S. again. That  puts America at severe risk--the risk of a China-backed company spying  on Americans' private information, spying on businesses, spying on our  military.   ZTE is allowed to come in here? Every American should be worried when  they talk on their iPhone that China is spying on them. Every American  business should be worried that China is spying on their businesses and  their intellectual property, and, most of all, our military leaders  should be worried that China is purloining secrets that help to keep us  safe.   That is why we have included a bipartisan amendment. I want to salute  Senators Cotton and Van Hollen for leading the charge. I want to salute  folks like Senator Rubio, who has been so strong on this issue, putting  country first. I want to salute the many on our side who have agreed  with that. It is the right thing to do--to not allow ZTE to be here,  for both national security interests as well as the economic importance  of being tough on China.   Yesterday it was reported, of course, that the White House will  oppose the amendment and may seek to strip it out of the bill. We hope  cooler heads in the administration, including Secretary Mattis, Chief  of Staff Kelly, and others who have had a military background, can  inform the President how ill-advised his actions are.   Both parties in Congress must be resolute in blocking the President's  bad, pro-China ZTE deal. Protecting America's national and economic  security is paramount and any deal that jeopardizes them should be  stopped in its tracks.   Senator Corker made a point this week. He is freed of political  constraints and can say what he thinks. He made a point--passionately-- that this body does not have to assent to every whim of the President.  It is not easy when you are of the same party as the President. I know  that. But as everyone in this Chamber knows, on some major issues I  opposed President Obama because I thought he was wrong, and I know how  difficult it is. I know how difficult it is, but sometimes duty and  country and patriotism require it. On a matter as vital as this one,  having to do with America's national and economic security, we cannot  back off. I urge my colleagues, particularly my friends Senators Cotton  and Rubio and Cornyn, who have been so strong and right on this issue,  to hang tough, especially when we get to conference.   I want to thank our Acting Chair of the Armed Services Committee for  understanding the security risks and for working in a bipartisan way.                        Happy Birthday to Abe Schumer    Finally, Mr. President, if my colleagues will indulge me a few more  words, they are personal, but they are meaningful.   Today is Flag Day. It is also my father's 95th birthday. This  upcoming weekend we will celebrate Father's Day.   My father was a World War II vet over in Burma, and when he came back  to Brooklyn after the war, he took over a small exterminating business  from his father, my grandpa. I often joke that we are the only family  who associates the smell of DDT with love, because my dad would come  home from the office smelling of all of those chemicals.   My father hated his job. He paced the floor Sunday nights at 2 a.m.,  unable to sleep, dreading going to work on Monday. But there was great  honor in what he did. He never complained. He was supporting the  family, even if it was in a job he was stuck with after getting back  from World War II. He labored for many years in a job that wasn't his  passion and passed on his idea of serving without complaining to give  his children, grandchildren, and, God willing, in November, his soon- to-be first great-grandchild--my daughter  [[Page S3932]]  is pregnant--the idea that we could follow our dreams, standing on his  strong and weary shoulders. Mine led me here. I will never stop being  grateful to my dad for that.   So allow me to wish my father a happy birthday today and to say that  I look forward to seeing him and my mom Selma, who turned 90 just on D- Day, as well as my wife and two daughters this weekend for Father's  Day, and I wish all Americans the same joy in celebrating Father's Day  this weekend.   I yield the floor.                          Reservation of Leader Time     Thank you. I thank the Senator.
