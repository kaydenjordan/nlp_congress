 Madam Speaker, this past week, I joined a  group of 12 of my colleagues to visit our southern border and to see  firsthand the crisis that President Biden's open border policies have  created.   What we saw were massive gaps in our border wall that allow for the  cartels to traffic money, drugs, and human beings across our southern  border. The Border Patrol agents whom we spoke with told us that in the  Rio Grande sector that they are encountering nearly 10,000 migrants  each month.   In the past year Border Patrol agents have apprehended people from  174 nations attempting to cross our border. And even more troubling,  they have encountered 42 individuals on the terrorist watch list.   According to Border Patrol data, over 1,200 pounds of fentanyl were  seized in the month of April alone, and at a time when we have just  seen over 100,000 Americans killed by drug overdoses, this spike in  fentanyl trafficking has made each and every State a border State.   It is time to address this crisis. It is time to finish our border  wall--a wall that President Biden has refused to complete while $350  million of unused border wall rust away underneath the Texas sun.   In his budget for this year, Joe Biden doesn't even mention the  crisis on the border. Instead of giving our Border Patrol agents the  tools that they need, President Biden has proposed to cut $800 million  from the Department of Homeland Security budget. If President Biden  were to visit the border, he would see this crisis firsthand. But,  instead, he has chosen to hide from the problem and continue to allow  deadly drugs to flow into our communities and kill our citizens.   The American people can't afford to wait any longer. It is time for  the  [[Page H5338]]  President to order the completion of the border wall and finally-- finally--keep all Americans safe.                            ____________________
