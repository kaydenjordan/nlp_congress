 Mr. President, we need tax reform that helps small  businesses close these tax loopholes that are taking jobs overseas.  Instead, we need to create those jobs at home. We need tax reform that  puts money in the pockets of middle-class families in Michigan and all  across the country, and we need an American budget that shows what we  value as Americans.   Too often, we think of budgets as sterile numbers on a spreadsheet.  In reality, budgets are about people. They are about the middle-class  Cass City parents who are sitting down to do their taxes and feeling as  if it is they, not the wealthiest 1 percent, who are carrying the  heaviest burden. They are about helping small business owners in  Pontiac, MI, family farmers in Cadillac, and Michigan companies that  are creating good-paying jobs. They are also about ensuring that the  most vulnerable among us--our children, senior citizens, people with  disabilities--are valued and protected.   We cannot consider a budget without considering people. Will it help  middle-class families thrive? Will it help small business owners grow?  Will it help protect people who cannot protect themselves?  Unfortunately, the Republican budget and tax plan suggest that we do  not value people, plain and simple.   There are 47 million Americans who depend on Medicare--seniors and  people with disabilities. Yet the budget resolution we will be  considering tomorrow in the Budget Committee will cut $473 billion from  Medicare. For the low-income children, parents, seniors in nursing  homes, and people with disabilities who depend on Medicaid, in that  budget resolution, Medicaid would be cut by $1 trillion.   We just went through this debate twice in efforts to gut healthcare,  to gut Medicaid, which would take away healthcare from tens of millions  of people. The American people said no, and the Senate said no--twice.  Yet we are right back again. Here they go again on the budget  resolution, putting forward huge--even bigger--cuts in Medicaid. This  time, it is not just Medicaid, it is Medicare, which was not in the  last two proposals that we rejected, because they hurt too many people  by taking away their healthcare.   Now we have a budget resolution that will be coming to the floor of  the Senate. I am assuming they will have enough votes. They certainly  will not have mine or those of my Democratic colleagues, but if every  Republican in committee votes for it, we will have on the floor a  budget resolution that will cut Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid  by $1 trillion.   Why is that being done? It is being done to pay for tax cuts for the  wealthiest among us. In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts would go to  the top 1 percent. It would be 80 percent who would receive a cut of  about $200,000 a year--a cut. The majority of people in Michigan do not  make $200,000 a year, but this would be a tax cut of $200,000 a year,  on average. This is not what I was talking about before in our helping  small businesses and middle-class families and closing tax loopholes  that are taking jobs overseas. This is a straight-up, trickle-down tax  cut that has not worked before in creating jobs. It creates a lot of  deficits but not jobs, and people in my State are still waiting for it  to trickle down to them.   Republicans are asking seniors, people with disabilities, children,  and families to give up healthcare in order to fund a huge tax cut for  the richest 1 percent, which will cost more than $2 trillion. To me,  that sounds like backwards budgeting for sure.   I do not often quote my friend from Kentucky, but Senator Paul was  absolutely right yesterday. He tweeted this:         This is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30 percent of middle-class       families get a tax hike? I hope the final details are better       than this.    I do too. I hope that the final details are a lot better than this if  it is going to be something that the people of Michigan will support  and benefit from.   Under the Republican plan, a senior citizen in Saginaw, MI, who is  making $20,000 a year would get a tax increase; a married couple with  two kids and an income of $70,000 in Gaylord, MI, would get a tax  increase; and a single mom with three kids in Battle Creek, MI, who  works really hard every day in juggling and caring for her kids and who  earns $50,000 a year, which never seems to stretch far enough, would  actually pay $1,000 more in taxes because, under the plan, if you have  more than one child, you will actually see your taxes go up because the  personal exemption for each child will be taken away.   Senator Paul is right. This is just plain wrong. I do have to give  Republicans credit, though. They keep upping the ante. It wasn't even a  week ago when they were trying to take healthcare away from people in  Michigan and across the country with a plan that would increase costs  and reduce healthcare. Now they are trying to take healthcare away from  people who need it most by raising taxes on middle-income families and  cutting Medicare, as well as Medicaid.   We do need tax reform. I would like very much to see the code  simplified, but any tax proposal needs to meet three basic requirements  to get my support. First, tax reform needs to be bipartisan, rather  than coming up with this proposal in the budget resolution which, once  again, just like healthcare, would be jamming something through on a  partisan vote. It needs to be bipartisan. It needs to be thoughtful.   Those of us on the Finance Committee are thoughtful people. We worked  for 2 years in bipartisan working groups on each section of the Tax  Code, getting ready to have a thoughtful discussion and negotiation on  real tax reform that would help small businesses grow--by the way, they  are creating a majority of the new jobs--as well as making sure  families in America who are struggling would be able to have a  simplified Tax Code and a tax cut. So I am all for doing a bipartisan  approach, but that is not what is happening here. That is not what will  be put into the budget resolution tomorrow, and, unfortunately, it  doesn't appear that it is what is going to happen in the Finance  Committee.   The other reason for wanting to do this in a bipartisan way is that  it is the only way to make sure it is permanent. If you use these  truncated processes of reconciliation to try to jam something through,  it is not permanent. I know from businesses in Michigan, large and  small, as well as families, that to be able to plan, they want to see  some permanent changes, and doing it this way is not permanent.   Second, tax reform needs to help businesses create jobs right here at  home. Over the last year, I visited more than 120 small businesses in  Michigan, and I have seen for myself how they are driving my State's  economy. I also know how challenging it can be for them to navigate the  complex Tax Code. The owner of a small business shouldn't have to spend  hours with an accountant instead of with her customers. We can fix  that. At the same time, tax reform needs to preserve important  incentives for manufacturers that are creating jobs here in Michigan  and in our country.   I don't believe we have an economy unless somebody makes something or  somebody grows something. We need to make sure that the tax policy that  supports capital intensive companies remains intact, and we need to  close the gigantic loopholes that incentivize our jobs going overseas.   I have one simple proposal. It is not everything, but it is a symbol  of how bad the situation is. I have been trying to get it passed now  for over 10 years here, and it keeps getting blocked and filibustered.  It is called the Bring Jobs Home Act. It is very simple. The Tax Code  right now allows a company moving overseas to write off all their  moving costs. So the workers losing their jobs help pay for the move  through their taxes. The community pays for the move through their  taxes. It makes no sense to do that. My Bring Jobs Home Act would stop  that and say that you don't get to write off the costs when you are  leaving our country. However, if you want to come back, if you want to  bring jobs home, we are happy to let you write off those costs, and we  will give you an extra 20 percent tax credit to bring those jobs home.  If you want to leave, you are on your own. That is what our Tax Code  should say to businesses that are moving our jobs overseas.   The third important measure in tax reform is that it needs to put  money in the pockets of hard-working families. Michigan families are  working hard every day to make ends meet. For too long, working-class  and middle-class  [[Page S6281]]  families have watched as all of the benefits seem to flow to the  wealthiest among us over and over and over. Middle-class families are  stretched to the breaking point, and it is time they get a break.   That is what the President originally said. This was going to be a  middle-class tax cut. Yet, when we run the numbers, it is just not  true. For too many, they are going to see a tax increase. As I said  before, 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent.  You can even break that down more with 0.1 percent, and it is shocking  that those individuals are going to get a million-dollar tax cut.   When you look at the majority of people in Michigan who work hard  every day and don't earn $200,000 or more, and you look at the fact  that there would be a tax plan brought forward that would actually give  a tax cut of $200,000 a year, and someone with three children or four  children would actually see their taxes go up--wait a minute--what is  wrong with that picture?   Unfortunately, this budget and tax proposal falls short in a number  of ways, beyond Medicare and Medicaid cuts and what is happening in  terms of families. As I said before, it is far from bipartisan. As with  healthcare, Democrats have been locked out of the process. Republicans  have been meeting in secret--no Democrats allowed.   The Republicans are having to use this reconciliation process to  force something that will not be permanent. There is little reason to  believe that this will help American workers. As I indicated before, it  will not close loopholes that are taking jobs overseas.   It doesn't benefit hard-working people and working families that are  working really hard to make it every year, every week. It does not  benefit them.   The Republican budget and tax proposal targets the most vulnerable.  It isn't bipartisan. It will not stop offshoring. It will not benefit  the middle class. There is one thing that it will do. There is one  thing that those who analyze this agree upon. It will explode the  deficit. The independent analysis shows that these proposals would  increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion. So there is $2.4 trillion in  lost revenues that would go to increasing the deficit.   Our friends across the aisle scoff at that. These tax cuts, they say,  will pay for themselves. Although in our Finance Committee hearing  today, when we asked both the Republican and Democratic experts who  were testifying, no one said it would pay for the tax cuts--no one.   President Trump said this huge tax cut will be rocket fuel for our  economy. But when you look at the 2001 tax cuts, there was no rocket  fuel there. In the 2003 tax cuts, there was no rocket fuel there. In  2012, the State of Kansas had tax cuts that almost caused them to have  to go to a 4-day school week for children because of the huge deficits.  There was no rocket fuel there.   There are two things to remember about rocket fuel. It is unstable,  and, if you are not careful, you will get badly burned.   Budgets aren't about numbers; they are about people. They are about  middle-class parents wondering why the wealthiest get all the breaks  and they get the bill. It is about a small business owner wondering why  she can't run a bakery without hiring an accountant. It is about  seniors on disability wondering if Medicare and Medicaid will be there  for them while they watch the 0.1 percent get tax breaks and there are  future generations being stuck with the bill for tax cuts that will not  pay for themselves.   Budgets are about people, and this budget fails them. It is time to  work together across the aisle to do what is right, to make sure that  the budget and tax proposals work for everybody, not just a privileged  few, and that they help companies create jobs here at home and focus on  policies to benefit our working families.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
