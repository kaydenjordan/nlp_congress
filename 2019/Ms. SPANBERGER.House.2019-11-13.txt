 Madam Speaker, across central Virginia, our Sikh  neighbors are celebrating the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru  Nanak, the first Sikh guru.   They are celebrating the man whose teachings have shaped the core  beliefs of their families throughout the centuries, and they are  remembering Guru Nanak's unwavering commitment to the plight of the  poor, his push for equality for all, and his fight against  discrimination.   Amid constant threats of invasion and disease, Guru Nanak encouraged  his followers to focus on what united their people, not what divided  them. In a world consumed by lies and deceit, he taught them to pursue  truth. While others sought to destroy and disregard the Earth's  resources, Guru Nanak taught his followers to be responsible stewards  of the land.   In central Virginia, we have a warm, vibrant, and strong Sikh  community. To them, I say happy Gurpurab.   I hope all of our district's Sikh community members will have the  opportunity to enjoy these special festivities alongside family and  friends, and I thank you for your rich contributions to our cultural,  business, and faith communities.   Together, we thank you for incorporating Guru Nanak's principles of  generosity, grace, and compassion into your daily lives. We are  stronger because of you.   Madam Speaker, ``Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguruji ki Fateh.'' Purity  belongs to the Creator, all victory belongs to Him.                            ____________________
