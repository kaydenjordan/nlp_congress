 Madam Speaker, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of  the vote to pass the 19th Amendment, I would like to recognize  Tennessee's crucial role in the Amendment's ratification.   State Representative Harry T. Burn was a slow learner. He was  originally antisuffragist, but he ultimately changed his ``nay'' vote  to ``yea'' just in time to heed his mother's advice to ``be a good  boy'' and vote for ratification.   His was the deciding vote in the Tennessee General Assembly, making  Tennessee the 36th State, and final State, needed for ratification.  Representative Burn explained his vote this way: ``I know that a  mother's advice is always safest for her boy to follow, and my mother  wanted me to vote for ratification.''   So thank you to Representative Burn and, above all, to his mother,  Ms. Phoebe Burn, for her crucial role in aiding women's right to vote.                            ____________________
