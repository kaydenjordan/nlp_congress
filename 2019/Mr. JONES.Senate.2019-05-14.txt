 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise because I am deeply concerned about  what is happening across the country to our farmers as a result of the  President's trade war with China.   Let me first say, I agree with the President 100 percent that we need  fair trade deals and that we have to make sure American workers and  consumers are not being taken for a ride by other countries, especially  rogue countries and bad actors like China. Yet, since this trade war  began last year, these tariffs are having the complete opposite effect  on the people they are supposed to help. That is because tariffs are  taxes, plain and simple. Tariffs are taxes, and they are being raised  every day by the administration.   The President insists that tariffs force China to pay money to the  U.S. Treasury, which is just not true. It is just not factually  accurate at all. It is also misleading to the American people. When a  tariff is placed on a Chinese good, it is the American company that is  importing that product, in addition to the American consumer who  ultimately buys it, that pays that additional price. It is just like  adding a sales tax to any consumer good or to any commodity on which a  tariff has been levied. From businesses to farmers, to consumers, these  taxes are being paid for by Americans. That is not politics; that is  economics.   The President thinks these tariffs will somehow punish China for its  bad behavior, but it is our people who are suffering right now. Last  week, we saw a report that showed that the cost of these tariffs had  fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and on U.S. households. Just  yesterday, China announced it is planning on retaliating, once again,  with increased tariffs on $60 billion worth of American-made goods,  which sent the stock market into a tailspin.   Unemployment is incredibly low today, and the economy is doing well  today, but across the country, there are so many people who don't  always feel the effects of that booming economy. Yes, they have jobs,  but they also have families, healthcare costs, and other costs, so they  don't always feel the economy is doing as well for them as it is for  others whom they see on the news, on TV, and in Washington, DC. Working  folks aren't going to feel the true benefits from this economic growth  and from the tax cuts of 2017 if they are paying higher taxes on the  products they are buying every single day.   Just yesterday, the President was talking about the tariffs and  feeling a little bit of pain but about how great a deal this is going  to be and how our government will be happy. The President said: ``[O]ur  government is happy because we're taking in tens of billions of  dollars.'' Yet that money is being brought into the Treasury on the  backs of working people--hard-working American taxpayers. It is not the  Chinese companies; it is not the Chinese people; it is not the Mexican  people; and it is not the Canadian people. It is the American public  that is paying that money into the U.S. Treasury.   Tariffs are taxes, and we are all going to pay because of this trade  war. Call them whatever you want, but that is the effect they are going  to have on the wallets of American taxpayers. Even the President's own  economic advisers admitted this week that it will be the Americans who  will suffer as a result of this trade war, with the increased taxes  being placed on them every day through the consumer goods they are  purchasing.   In Alabama, our farmers, in particular, are hurting, and that is an  understatement. Tariffs are affecting a cross-section of our  manufacturing workforce. It has our automobile dealers concerned  because of the threat of foreign automobile tariffs. Yet, even in the  best of times, it is the farmers who are at the most risk. Farming is a  risky business, and their margins are very tight. Many farmers in  Alabama have already suffered devastating losses from natural  disasters, like Hurricane Michael. Quite frankly, they are suffering  another congressional disaster right now--in the words of my colleague  and friend Senator Isakson from Georgia--because we can't put politics  aside quickly enough to get disaster aid to farmers in the South, to  folks who have suffered from flooding, or to folks who have suffered  from wildfires. We can't do this because of politics, so now they are  suffering. The farmers whom I visited back in South Alabama after  Hurricane Michael are suffering now from the congressional disaster.   The last thing in the world they need is another administration  disaster that is being manufactured because of the Chinese tariffs on  their crops. In particular, soybeans are being hit. Soybean farming  supports more than 11,000 jobs in Alabama, but soybean prices are at  the lowest they have been in a decade. You can see from this chart how  they started up. It was over $10 just in April of 2018--over $10. Now  it is just above $8, and it is continuing to slide. The longer this  goes on, the more it hurts.   Cotton farmers have been hit. Cotton has had an almost 25-percent  reduction in the market price since these tariffs took effect. We have  record low unemployment in the country right now; yet  [[Page S2832]]  we have a growing number of bankruptcies in farm country. I was looking  at reports just today that showed the rise in the number of  bankruptcies, the point being that these are hitting people now.   We all want a great deal. We all want to make sure the President gets  a good deal for the American public, for the American consumer, but  this is hurting people right now, and they will not be able to recover  if this does not end soon. Unless the President can reach a deal soon,  we can expect prices to continue to deteriorate and for the economic  conditions in farm country to get even worse, which will put in  jeopardy generations of farmers who may get run out of business.   This is a dire situation. I am not trying to just light fire  somewhere. This is really serious for these folks. You only have to  watch the news every day. These are people who have supported the  President of the United States and who voted for the President of the  United States. They want a good deal, and they want a fair deal, but  this has been going on for a long time, and there does not seem to be  any end in sight. Many of my State's farmers--probably most of my  State's farmers--support the President, as do others around the  country. They have had his back over the last 2 or 3 years, even during  the campaign. Yet, in return, these trade policies have taken money out  of their pockets.   When this first started over a year ago, they believed they would get  a good deal soon. They believed they could get crops in the field, that  they could get their loans paid, and that they could recover from the  disasters that had hit them, but it has just dragged on and on. Every  time we see a new round of tweets or a new press conference, we talk  about what a great deal this is going to be. Yet, when you look behind  the curtain, everything is different, and the trade war goes on and on  and on.   I fear he is not listening to these farmers or to the Members of  Congress on both sides of the aisle--like our Finance chairman--who are  telling him that these policies are hurting farmers, that they are  devastating farmers. I am not sure how much longer they can hang on in  this trade war. Many will. Many can hang on. Yet others cannot. Whether  the next generation of farmers will take up the mantle of farming  remains to be seen.   This is one reason I am introducing a bill today to update the Trade  Adjustment Assistance Program, which was originally created by my  colleague Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, to provide  help for farmers and producers who have been hurt by these retaliatory  tariffs. TAA was originally created to help provide assistance to  workers who were impacted by trade, but it was updated in 2002 to  include assistance to growers, producers, and fishermen. This bill that  I introduce today, as well as a companion bill that has been introduced  in the House, would, once again, update the program to help folks who  are hurting because of trade actions that have been carried out by our  government--not by another government but by ours.   Look, the fact is, no matter how many legislative stopgaps my  colleagues and I propose or bailouts the President offers, the massive  losses from which farmers and producers suffer are not going to end  until the President calls off this trade war.   We all want better trade deals, and farmers want access to global  markets. China has, without a doubt, been a bad actor on many trade  issues--a rogue country on trade issues. We should be working with our  allies in Europe and elsewhere to hold China accountable. Instead, the  administration has decided to go it alone. We are picking fights with  friends over our own trade issues with them rather than working through  diplomacy to try to work those deals. We are picking fights with them,  and we are going it alone against China when we so desperately need our  friends to help us. China is a growing concern around the world, and we  need global partners to help us with our trade issues to try to make  sure the global economy stays stable.   I will be absolutely thrilled if the President of the United States  negotiates a great deal. I hope he negotiates the best deal ever--the  one that he says he is going to negotiate. I hope and pray we get that  great deal and that we can do a trade deal with China that is fair and  better for America than it has ever been in the history of this  country. For all of our sakes, I hope it happens. I really do. This is  not a partisan issue. This is about where we are as a country. I hope  for the best for him, but, right now, these tariffs are having the  opposite effect, and it is hurting so many people.   What many of us fear is going to happen in the cynical world we live  in today--and we all get caught up in it, including Members of this  body--is that when the President finally wakes up and realizes he has  done irreparable harm and irreparable damage to so many of his own  supporters with these tariffs and when he wakes up and approaches 2020  and understands that his support may be eroding among those who form  the core backbone of his support, he will scramble to make a deal  regardless of whether it will be a good deal or not but a deal  nonetheless and regardless of whether America will come out on top.   When all is said and done, we can claim victory, but it may be a very  hollow victory because, in going forward, we may have a little bit  better deal or we may have a much better deal, but it will not change  what is happening today or what has happened over the last year. Even  if a deal is struck, we have already lost.   Farmers will still have to be digging themselves out of this  financial hole for a very long time. Many will have to declare  bankruptcy and lose their farms because they couldn't wait out the  President's trade gamble and his tough talk.   To mitigate the tariffs' harmful impacts, the administration is  providing some aid to help farmers who are struggling as a result of  the trade war. They did so last year, and they need it, but those  government bailouts--and that is what they are, they are bailouts--are  being paid by other American taxpayers in order to alleviate the pain  inflicted by the administration's policies.   That is right. Working families across the country are being asked to  step up. We do those things. We are charitable people. If somebody is  in pain, we want to do that and help, but when the pain is being caused  by the very person who is causing us to then step up, that makes no  sense.   Folks, these handouts will not come close to making up for the losses  these farmers have suffered, and it is sure not a long-term solution  for a healthy trade market.   The biggest problem for these farmers is that they don't want  handouts. They don't want government subsidies. They don't want  handouts to them for the problems they are facing because of these  trade policies. They want their markets. They want to go to China. They  want to go to places around the world and share their products. They  are proud of their products. We should be proud of those products.   We should not be just simply telling farmers: Do not worry because we  will pay for you to grow your product. We are not worried about your  markets because we will buy your soybeans. We will buy the cotton. We  will buy those things if China doesn't do it. That is not what these  farmers want. They don't want that charity. They want their markets.  They work hard for those markets.   So how much more can our farmers take? How much more? How long can  they go on like this? At what point will they be forced to cut their  losses and find another way to support their families while we  negotiate with China, while we tweet the fact that a good deal is  coming?   At what point will Members of this body and the House of  Representatives who ignore the math and the suffering of their  constituents--at what point will those in this body and the House of  Representatives who ignore the suffering of their constituents by  supporting these harmful trade policies, at what point do they stand  up?   There are so many people I have talked to who do not support these  trade policies, but yet they are silent, and they say: Give the  President time. He is going to get a good deal.   At what point does it come where they recognize the suffering of the  farmers of the United States and my State of Alabama? At what point do  they finally stand up and say enough is enough?  [[Page S2833]]    Over the years, the Congress of the United States has ceded a lot of  authority to the executive branch of government, and now it is coming  home to roost. We can't do much of anything except give speeches like  this. We can try to introduce bills that probably will never get to the  Senate floor. We can go home and listen to the pain, listen to the  suffering, listen to people who so badly want to support the President  and what he is doing, as all of us do for these new trade deals, but  the fact is, we have ceded so much power to the executive branch of  government. It is time for Congress to stand up. It is time for people  to speak out to help their farmers, to let the administration know that  this cannot go on much longer. We have to stand up and stop this pain  as quickly as we can.   We can do it. The President can do it. He has smart people  surrounding him. They need to explain to him again that these tariffs  are being paid by the American people, not another country. Let's get  this negotiated, and let's stop the bleeding for the American farmer as  soon as we possibly can.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Leahy, Mr.          Durbin, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Harris, and Mr.          Booker):   S. 1469. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit  interfering in elections with agents of a foreign government; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
