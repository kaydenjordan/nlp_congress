 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  resolution, which appears designed to launch a dangerous and  unprecedented attack on our law enforcement agencies.   Last week, Americans across the country watched the Republican Party  melt down the moment it encountered its first test. For days, the  extremist wing of the party held the rest of their caucus hostage as  they demanded a steep price for their support. Today, we have the first  of their many demands on display, an open-ended investigation into  whatever conspiracy theories may be headlining the rightwing echo  chamber at the moment, with unchecked authority to undermine ongoing  criminal and intelligence investigations.   For example, the select committee can use its expansive authorities  to protect Donald Trump, those who perpetrated fake elector schemes to  overturn the 2020 Presidential election, insurrectionists facing trials  for their crimes, and other domestic terrorists.   It aims to undermine the safeguards of our democracy and to embolden  MAGA extremists who would rather see our institutions fail than to see  Democrats and President Biden succeed.   Make no mistake, the destroy democracy subcommittee will enable the  House Republicans to interfere with the free operation of businesses  they do not like, to inhibit the fight against domestic terrorism, and  to settle political scores on behalf of Donald Trump.   The Judiciary Committee has serious work to do. But rather than  trying to solve the problems of the American people, this new  subcommittee will expend untold time and money undermining our Nation's  law enforcement agencies, our justice system and our intelligence  community, all for a political stunt catering to the extremist wing of  the Republican Party.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.
