 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment that would  prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from utilizing a title 42  special pay authority.   There is no rationale for this authority to exist. It is time that  the authorizers in Congress stand up for their prerogatives and act as  a check on the executive branch when it invents claims to new powers to  which it has no right.   Mr. Chair, this is not just my sentiment. In 2012, the Government  Accountability Office conducted a study on the EPA's use of title 42  special pay authority. In that study, multiple instances of  irregularities were found, entry-level scientists were hired at much  higher than what would be the expected GS pay level.   Why would we allow the EPA to continue to use a program when it has  clearly and repeatedly demonstrated that it is a poor steward of  American tax dollars?   Mr. Chair, not only has there been a report that highlights the abuse  of the program, but a subsequent study was undertaken by the EPA's  Office of Inspector General that found that the EPA did not demonstrate  a need to use this special pay authority. In fact, there was no  shortage of qualified applicants for those positions.   Even more alarming, the inspector general found that the EPA did not  provide any convincing justification for its continued use. Recent  college graduates with a chemistry degree have been hired on to the  staff of the EPA at rates higher, much higher than the GS level would  indicate. This is not for what the program was intended. It is time for  Congress to exercise the proper authority and not allow agencies to  ignore congressional intent.                                time  1515    It is time for Congress to exercise the proper authority and not  allow agencies to ignore congressional intent.   That is why this amendment should be adopted, Mr. Chair. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment and show the American people that  its Representatives here in the people's House will properly require  accountability of agencies, particularly when they overstep the bounds  of congressional intent.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will simply underscore the fact that entry- level chemists at the EPA are hired at much  [[Page H5297]]  higher than the GSA rate. These are not highly sought-after scientists.  These are entry-level applicants, and there is no shortage of  applicants for those positions.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment. It is  important, with $31 trillion in national debt, that we be good stewards  of taxpayer dollars. The gentleman is right. I have pursued this for a  number of years, but it is because it is a noble cause.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
