 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. Love, from Utah for  presenting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of H.R. 4771.   It is said that all politics are local, but might I also suggest that  all economic growth is local as well. Local in the sense of small  businesses. Small businesses, the moms and pops who put their ideas at  risk in order to create their American Dream of growing a business and  creating jobs.   Yet, what does it take?   It takes access to capital. Yet, since Dodd-Frank, we have not seen  that access to capital available to our small businesses, who so  desperately need it, in order to grow our economies, especially at the  community level.   In fact, might I even suggest that Dodd-Frank has only one attribute  in terms of job growth, and that is the creation of the one fastest  growing job out there: compliance officer--compliance officers that  banks and financial institutions now have to hire in order to meet  regulatory burdens that take away from the bottom line of consumers who  want to achieve the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act,  will allow that access to capital that is so desperately needed at the  local level, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1200    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Okay. So we have heard it again. We hate Dodd-Frank. We hate Dodd- Frank. We hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We don't  believe that Dodd-Frank should have created the reforms that they did.   Just forget about the fact that there was a subprime meltdown in  2008, that this country went into a recession, almost a depression.  Throw all of that out of the window. Forget about what was happening  when the big banks failed and we bailed them all out. Forget about  reforms.   Oh, how much we hate Dodd-Frank. We just blame Dodd-Frank for  everything.   Please. I think that, as credible legislators, we are beyond the  point of wrapping up everything that we don't like and accusing Dodd- Frank reforms for causing problems to everything and everybody,  including the community banks. The fact of the matter is, if we want to  strengthen, preserve, and make sure community banks are available to  our communities, we won't take on public policy that would put them at  risk with having more debt than they can take care of, and we won't put  them at risk of being bought up and these mergers taking place.   I reserve the balance of my time.
