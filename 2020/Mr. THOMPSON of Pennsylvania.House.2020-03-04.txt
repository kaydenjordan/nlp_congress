 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 6032, the Transportation Workforce Centers of Excellence Act.   I recently introduced this bill alongside my colleague, Congressman   Jim Langevin. As co-chairs of the bipartisan Career and Technical  Education  [[Page H1476]]  Caucus, we are constantly looking for new ways to support a skilled  workforce.   A skilled workforce is critically necessary to support a 21st century  economy, and the individuals who pursue a skills-based career, as well  as the institutions that train them, deserve to be rewarded for their  commitment to closing our Nation's skills gap.   The Transportation Workforce Centers of Excellence Act would  establish a competitive $50 million grant program to strengthen  education and training programs in critical industries.   A highly skilled workforce is necessary to revitalize our national  transportation system. The demand for qualified workers is greater than  ever. This bill will help us meet infrastructure demands, close our  Nation's skills gap, and reward schools that have gone above and beyond  by establishing centers of excellence.   Madam Speaker, I would like to encourage my colleagues to join our  efforts in supporting career and technical education centers of  excellence and increased transportation workforce training.                            ____________________
