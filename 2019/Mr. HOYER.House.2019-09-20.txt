 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate,  and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30  p.m.   I remind Members that is Tuesday, not Monday. We will not be in  session on Monday.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules,  including H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, as amended. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   The House will consider H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement  Act, and H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards  Act. These bills will improve how the Department of Homeland Security  oversees border issues in a humane and responsible manner, including  the care of children.   Members are of course advised that there is additional legislation  that may come forward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Clyburn and the Clyburn family very much  appreciate his condolences and his remarks.    Jim Clyburn and I have known each other for over half a century. His  wife, Emily, he met during the course of the civil rights struggle.  She, too, was a drum major for justice, as  Jim Clyburn has been.   She has, as the gentleman pointed out, been facing health challenges  for some period of time. And, yes, she is in a better place. But as one  who has lost his spouse, I know what a difficult time this is for  Jim  Clyburn.   I would let all the Members know that there will be a service in  Columbia, a wake, on Sunday at 5 o'clock, and the funeral will be in  Charleston at 11 a.m. I intend to be in attendance. Any Member, I know,  would be welcome to be there as well.    Jim Clyburn has been a giant in this body. He has been a leader on  our side of the aisle now for almost 20 years, and before that, a  leader of the Congressional Black Caucus and somebody who has been a  strong voice, particularly for rural communities and for people who are  challenged either because of the color of their skin or their economic  status.   I know that Emily was his partner in those efforts, as the gentleman  knows. She was a wonderful, warm woman and will be greatly missed. But  the gentleman's observation that she is in a better place is one with  which I agree, and I know that  Jim Clyburn agrees as well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I know that all  Members join us in sending  Jim Clyburn and the family our deepest  sympathy and condolences.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.   I don't have a timetable, but I share his view that we want to move  this along. As I told him, and the Speaker was on the floor, we were  trying to get to ``yes'' on this.   Again, we appreciate Ambassador Lighthizer's good faith. We think he  has been dealing in good faith on behalf of the administration and on  behalf of getting to an agreement, so we appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we are eager to update and  improve NAFTA so that it functions better for the American businesses  and workers. However, for House Democrats, as the gentleman knows,  getting NAFTA 2.0 done right means doing more than just changing its  name. We need to make sure it changes actually its work, and by that,  we mean enforcement.   Both the Speaker and I voted for NAFTA. We were concerned and  disappointed that the sidebars were not carried out, so we are pursuing  that.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as the gentleman knows, has said: ``The  commitments in the trade pact aren't worth the paper they are written  on if they can't be enforced.''   Not only do we agree with that, but that has been our experience, so  we are hoping that we get mechanisms to accomplish that objective.   In 25 years, we have only had one successful enforcement action under  NAFTA--dispute resolution procedures--and none in the past 20 years, so  that is why we believe enforcement is so very important.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell the gentleman--and I know he will find this  as a positive--there is a meeting today with the task force that was  set up by the Speaker, headed by Mr. Neal, with Mr. Lighthizer, so this  process is under active and vigorous consideration.   We hope we get to a place where the administration will be able to  submit, pursuant to the statute, the proper agreement so that we can  proceed on it, but we want to get this done.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let me first say, if the gentleman wants to pursue  bipartisanship--I know that they all want to use the word  ``socialist,'' which was egregiously misidentified in an ad that I  wrote to Mr. Scalise about, which was a hateful ad. My suggestion is  ``liberal,'' this, that, and the other.   The drug bill that we have is going to be dealing with private sector  producers, privately owned, of prescription drugs.   This is not anything about socialism, but I know the gentleman wants  to use that word. I know his advisers apparently have told him that is  going to be a catchword that politically will be great for the next  election. But if the gentleman wants to seek bipartisanship, let's just  not try to color everything we say in terms that clearly reek of  partisanship, not bipartisanship.   Now, as to the bill itself, very frankly, we introduced a bill  yesterday. The committee has been working on it. When I say ``the  committee,'' the Energy and Commerce, the Education and Labor, and the  Ways and Means Committees have all been working on this bill. There has  been no secret about it. We have been discussing it.   It has three components, essentially, as the gentleman knows. It has  a component of negotiation, which, of course, as the gentleman knows,  the Veterans Administration does so right now.   I don't know whether the gentleman thinks that is socialism in the  Veterans Administration--maybe he does--but in any event, it is not a  unique proposal. It puts inflation limits on drug prices so we can't  have drug prices that people need to maintain their health and their  lives increase 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 800 percent in a very  short period of time. We don't think that is really what ought to  happen.   Lastly, it restructures the medical part D benefit to cap out-of- pocket spending for seniors, somewhat as the Republicans did with their  part D under President Bush.   So this is a proposal that is doing what we said we would do in the  last election, and that is to try to look at bringing down the cost of  prescription drugs, lifesaving, life-enhancing, health-enhancing drugs,  so that people are not priced out of the market or have to make a  choice between food, mortgage, rent, and the prescription drugs which  they need to be healthy.   Now, I agree that we do need a bipartisan solution, but so does the  President of the United States. When the gentleman says ``done in  secret,'' let me give a quote that the President of the United States  says: ``I like Senator Grassley's drug pricing bill very much. . . . `'   I will say, I do not know the depths of Senator Grassley's bill, but  it is Senator Grassley's bill, the Republican chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee.   Now, continuing to quote the President: `` . . . and it's great to  see Speaker Pelosi's bill today.''   That is the ``socialist'' bill to which the gentleman referred just  now.   Let's get it done in a bipartisan way. In other words, what the  President of the United States is saying is the Republican chairman of  the Senate Finance Committee has introduced a bill;  [[Page H7855]]  Speaker Pelosi and others have introduced a bill. Let's try to work  together on those bills. That is what President Trump said just the  other day. That is what I expect we are going to do.   So I appreciate the gentleman's comments. We hope we can work in a  bipartisan way, because this is a very critical challenge that the  American people face. They know they need these prescription drugs to  stay alive, to stay well, to be able to continue to work. But if they  are priced out of the market, they suffer; and, therefore, our economy  suffers; and, therefore, we all suffer.   So I share the gentleman's view that I hope we can get this done in a  bipartisan way. Senator Grassley has a proposal; we have a proposal.  Let's see what we can do together to assist the American people in  having something that they absolutely must have.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield to me?    Mr. Speaker, I wrote the gentleman a letter. Did he  believe that that ad that I complained about and that I thought was so  egregious, so disgusting, does he agree with me that that ad totally  misrepresented what socialism is? It deluded the American people. It  was a big lie. Does the gentleman agree with me?                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, we brought a bill to the floor that the  gentleman spoke about that prohibited pay for delay, prohibited drug  companies from paying generics not to bring their drugs to the market  so that drug prices would be lower for consumers.   Mr. Speaker, of the 194 Republicans, maybe even 98 Republicans--I  don't know how many were elected at that point in time--5 of them voted  for it, 190 voted against it.   Mr. Scalise also said that we wanted to protect that no one with a  preexisting condition would be denied healthcare. Five Republicans  voted for  [[Page H7856]]  that bill. Six years, the Republicans, Mr. Speaker, were in charge,  totally. There was no effort to bring a bill to this floor to bring  drug prices down. And, in fact, Americans know drug prices didn't come  down. The President was a Republican, the House was Republican, the  Senate was Republican. They didn't bring a bill to the floor, Mr.  Speaker.   Two of the three proposals in our bill are also in the Grassley bill.   And, Mr. Speaker, we are going to have regular order. We have  introduced a bill, it is going to go to committee, it is going to be  subject to amendment, it is going to be subject to debate, it is going  to be subject to hearings.   Now, we will see whether it is a bipartisan process. Because, very  frankly, the record of bipartisanship when the Republicans were in  charge is pretty absent.   Of the 19 major bills that we passed, we got 618 Republican votes, so  they weren't too partisan. Now, admittedly, about 400 of those votes  were on four bills that went through this place in a very bipartisan  fashion.   So I would hope that we see bipartisanship when the committee marks  up this bill, and we will do what the President says he wants to do. We  will see whether he supports that.   They have the Grassley bill and now you have a Democratic bill in our  House. They are going to have hearings in the Senate, led by  Republicans, Mr. Speaker. We will have hearings here, led by Democrats.  But Republicans and Democrats will both participate in those hearings,  and it is going to be bipartisan, and we will see whether we can come  up with bipartisanship.   But the gentleman continues to want to make some political patina  with this, some partisan patina, Mr. Speaker. I asked him, but he  didn't respond. He says he hasn't seen the ad. I wish he would look at  the ad. It is an egregious piece of political diatribe. But I would  hope that he would also urge his Members to work together.   And this business we negotiate for drugs right now, Mr. Speaker,  through the Veterans Administration to ensure that our veterans get the  best cost they can get. Apparently, that is okay, but doing the same  thing, Mr. Speaker, for American consumers of prescription drugs who  are not veterans is somehow characterized by the gentleman as  government control.   I urge the gentleman to proceed, as he speaks, on a bipartisan basis  and see whether or not we can get to an agreement in this House. But we  are going to pass something to bring drug prices down for the American  consumer because that is what we promised to do, and we are going to do  it. We hope we can do it in cooperation with everybody in this House,  but we are going to do it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman didn't answer my question, of course.    Mr. Speaker, it has nothing to do with the standard of  care at the VA, managed by the administration, which, of course, has  had the Presidency for the last 3 years.   Whether you pay $5 for prescription drugs or $50 for prescription  drugs, that is not the standard of care. That is how much you are  paying for the drug that you think helps either a veteran or a  nonveteran.   But let me say this: The gentleman keeps talking about, Mr. Speaker,  these bipartisan bills. The reason they weren't bipartisan in passing  this House is because we added ACA protections.   We added preexisting condition provisions to those bills, and the  Republicans, therefore, voted against. Why? Because they have been  against the Affordable Care Act and its adoption, against it in the  campaigns.   When they had the opportunity to change it, they couldn't do it. They  came up with a goose egg, Mr. Speaker.   The President said, during the course of the campaign, that he was  going to present a bill that included coverage for every American at a  lower cost and a higher quality. I tell the press, as soon as he sends  that bill down, Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for it. He has been  President now for 3 years, a little short of that. No bill has come  down.   The bill that the Speaker and majority leader went down to the White  House and cheered about, look, we passed this bill, and they sent it to  the Senate. The President was there at the White House. It was a great  bill, and within 14 days, he called it a ``mean'' bill.   Let me tell you what the President further said, Mr. Speaker, and the  characterization differs from the characterization that my friend, the  Republican whip, exhibited. The President  [[Page H7857]]  endorsed Medicare drug price negotiations in his campaign and put  forward a proposal to use international prices as a guide to limit out- of-control U.S. prices. That is what the gentleman's President said.   The administration has endorsed the other two concepts of inflation  limits on drug prices and improving Medicare part D as part of the  legislation put forward by Senator Grassley.   I guess everybody has their own definition of bipartisanship.    Mr. Speaker, I have nothing more to say.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
