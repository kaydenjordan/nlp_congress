 Madam Speaker, I rise in celebration of  the inauguration of Oklahoma's Governor Kevin Stitt, Lieutenant  Governor Matt Pinnell, Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready, and State  Superintendent Joy Hofmeister. These leaders come from Oklahoma's First  Congressional District and will represent Tulsa well in our capital.   Governor Stitt, like our President and myself, is an entrepreneur and  a businessman. He has a vision for Oklahoma to be a top ten State,  shaking up the status quo in Oklahoma City and turning the State  around.   Lieutenant Governor Pinnell is, likewise, a business owner and has  been an advocate of the Republican Party and conservative agenda in our  State for many years.   Commissioner Mulready is a long-term insurance professional and  businessman, most recently serving in the Oklahoma House of  Representatives as the majority floor leader.   State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister, another business owner, is  beginning her second term in the role and will continue to work hard  for Oklahoma's students.   A new day is dawning in Oklahoma with the leadership of Governor  Stitt, Lieutenant Governor Pinnell, Commissioner Mulready, and  Superintendent Hofmeister. I congratulate them on this accomplishment  and wish celebration and joy this week.                            ____________________
