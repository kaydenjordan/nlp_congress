 Mr. Speaker, today, across the Philippines, Rodrigo  Duterte's brutal regime is using the pretext of a so-called anti- terrorism law to ramp up efforts targeting labor organizers, workers,  and political opponents. This law allows suspects to be detained by the  police or military without charges for as long as 24 days and placed  under surveillance for up to 90 days.   In response to these abuses, I introduced the Philippine Human Rights  Act, which would block U.S. funding for police or military assistance  to the Philippines--outlining a series of basic criteria which would  have to be met in order to resume such funding.   I am proud to stand alongside so many faith and civil society  organizations in advocating for this legislation. And I am especially  proud to stand with leaders of the U.S. labor movement: the AFL-CIO,  the SEIU, the Teamsters, the Communication Workers of America. They  understand that in fighting for their brothers and sisters in the labor  movement abroad, they are also helping safeguard their own rights and  dignity here at home.   Let us make clear that the United States will not participate in the  repression. Let us stand with the people of the Philippines.                            ____________________
