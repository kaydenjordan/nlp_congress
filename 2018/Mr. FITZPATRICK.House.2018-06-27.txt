 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Youth  Police Academy of the Falls Township Police Department, a 10-day  program beginning its 2018 session in mid-July. This program teaches  its students Pennsylvania State laws and gives them lessons on patrol  scenarios, crime scene investigations, and the use of force.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to share with you that this educational  experience for Bucks County youth has received over $6,000 in community  support. Much of this money was raised through a 5K run and walk event  in Fallsington, organized by Marty McLoughlin and Linda Stout, the co- owners of a local small business, Extreme Fitness Personal Training.   I commend the work of Police Chief Bill Wilcox and the entire Falls  Township Police Department for supporting our community's youth in  their personal and professional growth and respect for law enforcement.   I would like to recognize Marty and Linda for their hard work and  generosity, and I encourage all in our community to follow their lead.                        Recognizing Dr. Robert Fraser     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a public  servant in our community for his dedication to improving the lives and  educational experiences of Bucks County students.   Dr. Robert Fraser, the superintendent of the Council Rock School  District, recently became one of only 30 school superintendents in the  United States who have successfully completed the National  Superintendent Certification Program.   This elite program helps bring education professionals up to speed on  the various issues that have recently presented themselves in the  American school system. It covers such facets as instructional  leadership, budget management, and using cutting-edge technology to  ensure that Council Rock students and faculty are fully equipped to use  the most effective resources to assist in the learning process.   I commend Dr. Fraser for his commitment to our community's students,  and I would like to thank Jerold Grupp and the entire Council Rock  School Board for all of their work.                       Recognizing Kristian Falkenstein     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the heroic actions  of an individual from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for which he was  awarded the Carnegie Medal from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission,  which  [[Page H5755]]  seeks to recognize acts of civilian bravery. Kristian Falkenstein of  Newtown played a critical role in saving the life of a 32-year-old man  who was swept out to sea on the Jersey shore last year.   After seeing a man being swept out to sea, Kristian immediately  sprang into action, swimming out to save this man. When Kristian  reached him, he was barely above water. Despite the tall waves and  strong rip current, Kristian was able to keep him afloat for several  minutes until two lifeguards and a responding police officer were able  to swim out to them with flotation devices to assist until the Coast  Guard was able to respond.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to report that all individuals have recovered  from this ordeal. I commend Kristian for his tremendous act of bravery,  which undoubtedly saved a life that day.   Kristian, your community and your country are extremely proud of you.                            ____________________
