 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on an historic piece of legislation that will make its way  to the floor tomorrow, H.R. 8, which will require background checks on  all gun sales in the United States.   In 2017, almost 40,000 Americans died from gun violence--the highest  total on record since the Centers for Disease Control began tracking  the statistics 50 years ago. This is an epidemic that for far too long  has gone unaddressed at the Federal level. But that stops now.   Thoughts and prayers cannot stop the never-ending string of gun  violence that terrorizes communities across the Nation, but commonsense  legislation can. That is why I am so proud to cosponsor H.R. 8, which  marks a significant step forward in our efforts to keep guns out of the  wrong hands.  [[Page H2220]]    I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation tomorrow  and to continue our work to ensure safer neighborhoods across America.                            ____________________
