 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Scott La Rochelle, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder  of the day.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am rising to engage in the conversation  about getting the Dream Act passed. I thank my good friend and  colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, for his passion and for his  unrelenting commitment to protecting our American Dreamers. He has been  on this floor day after day, month after month, advocating that we have  to address this situation in which individuals came to the United  States as small children; they have grown up here, they speak English,  and they have been totally immersed in making our community stronger,  our States stronger, our Nation stronger. We need to make sure  [[Page S7857]]  that we treat them fairly, with respect, and that we ensure that we are  able to benefit from their presence here, just as they benefit from  being here in the United States. There are 800,000 Dreamers across our  country. I know they all very much appreciate his leadership.   The young men and women who came out of the shadows to be part of the  DACA Program--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--were made a  promise that they would be all right if they did so; that their  information would not be used then to deport them. So they took a  gamble that the United States would stand by the commitment it was  making to them, and now they are wondering what happened because their  futures are dangling by a thread. The program has been abandoned by the  President, and if it is not replaced by legislation done right here in  this room, they basically will be subject to being deported to places  where they don't speak the language, they don't understand the  culture--they are unfamiliar with it--and they don't have any network.  They are really kind of stateless individuals who are in a very tough  condition.   One person like this from Salem, OR, is Diana Banda Palacios. In  1993, Diana, who is shown here in this picture I have in the Chamber,  came to this country from Mexico as a 3-year-old toddler. She has lived  her entire life since then, here in America.   Growing up in America, Diana dreamed of becoming a first responder,  so much so that during her high school years, she volunteered for Red  Cross and for her community emergency response team, but that dream was  thrown into doubt during her senior year when she was diagnosed with  thyroid cancer. She has fought that cancer, and she has beat that  cancer. She graduated from high school more determined than ever to  pursue her vision of how she could contribute to the community, and she  has contributed. She enrolled and put herself through the firefighting  and paramedic program at her local community college, and now she has  made a career for herself as an emergency medical technician, an EMT.  Every day, she is working literally to save lives, and we are  threatening to kick her out of the country--the only country she has  ever known.   Diana said a few years back when the DACA Program was first being  discussed:         America is my home. This is the place I love, where       everyone and everything I know is. I know nothing outside the       United States. Whatever punishment I must pay I am willing to       do. All I ask is for a chance. Better yet I beg for a chance       to prove that I am not a criminal, that I have much to offer       this beautiful place.    That is, in her words, her vision, her desire to be able to fully  participate in our society.   Just recently, over Thanksgiving, I led a delegation to Burma. Burma  has had horrific circumstances occur because they have a population of  Muslims called the Rohingya, and the Rohingya have been in Burma for  generations. Many of them came 200 years ago, and they came because  they were imported for labor. They have farmed the rice paddies, they  have fished in their boats off the coast, but they have never really  been accepted by Burma. Burma recognized in their 1982 law 135  minorities, but they didn't recognize the Rohingya because the adjacent  Rakhine minority is in kind of a hostile relationship with them. They  have always been treated as second-class citizens, so much so that in  the middle of Rakhine State, there are about 120,000 people living in  camps. They are not allowed to leave the camps. They are not allowed to  fully participate in society. They are not given citizenship rights. In  northern Rakhine State, in that area, the military went in and burned  some 300 villages, engaged in systematic rape, proceeded to shoot  people as they fled their villages, and now 600,000 people have gone  into Bangladesh.   The reason I raise this is not a parallel situation, but there is, at  its core, a similar issue, and that issue is whether a nation thrives  by entertaining the situation of having a stateless population. Burma  had a stateless population that it did not recognize, did not allow to  be fully engaged. They weren't even second-class citizens because they  weren't allowed citizenship.   Well, we have now a tremendous population of young folks who have  grown up in America. They are culturally American. Many of them had no  idea they were born abroad, and they are ready to be full participants  if we will let them. Won't we be so much better off to enable them to  rise to their full potential, to make their full contribution, to have  a full measure of participation in our society?   We have Diana's story, but multiply that times 800,000 people. What a  fantastic reservoir of talent, ability, energy, and passion waiting to  be fully contributed to being part of the United States of America.   While we delay, these 800,000 young members of our communities are in  limbo. They are waiting for us to act. They know they took a gamble by  joining the DACA Program, and they now know the Federal Government has  all of their information to track them down and deport them. Wouldn't  that violate completely the spirit under which we established the DACA  Program to begin with? Let's get this DREAM Act done.   Earlier today, I was here on the floor, listening to a conversation  from some of my colleagues, and they were saying: Well, let's get it  done by March. I would say to my colleagues across the aisle: Let's not  wait until March. Let's not wait until February. Let's not wait until  January. Let's engage in this conversation now. Let's get it done by  the end of the year. These young folks have waited a long time. They  have waited too long. So let's address it, and let's maintain in our  hearts the spirit that has animated our Nation.   All of us, unless we are 100 percent Native Americans, either came  from foreign lands or our parents or our parents' parents, our  forefathers and foremothers came from other lands. We know what that is  like. It was difficult many times, but our families found their place.  Let's enable these young folks, these Dreamers to find their place. It  will be far better for them and far, far better for us.   Thank you.                            ____________________
