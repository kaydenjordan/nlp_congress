 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Michael Scherneck's selfless 18-year career with the Southeast Georgia  Health System.   After nearly two decades of dedicated service to residents of  Georgia's First District, Mike will retire early next year as CEO of  the Southeast Georgia Health System.   In 2003, Mike began his tenure as the executive vice president and  CFO. In 2015, he was named president and CEO due to his dedication and  hard work ethic.   Without Mike's tireless advocacy, the Southeast Georgia Health System  would not be the top-tier facility it is today.   In a tenure wrought with trials, including three hurricanes and a  global pandemic, Mike's extraordinary leadership allowed the health  system not just to survive but to thrive.   While we know that Mike is looking forward to retired life, we are  certainly sad to see him go.   Mike is leaving the Southeast Georgia Health System better than he  found it and decades of future CEOs will surely be inspired by his  lasting legacy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for doing this tonight. This is very, very special.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a political  giant, an American icon, and a World War II hero, Senator Bob Dole.   Senator Dole was a remarkable man and a driven public servant who I  personally strive to emulate. Why wouldn't we? What a great example he  set for all of us.   I had the pleasure of spending some time with Senator Dole, who even  in his old age would brave the cold D.C. winters to sit out front of  the World War II Memorial and thank those there to pay tribute to  fallen soldiers.   I remember being over there. It was cold, and they would set up a  stool for Senator Dole to sit on. He would sit there, draped in  blankets, and he would not leave until every veteran came by and he  spoke to them and he thanked them and he shook their hand. That had to  be so special to them.   There are not many people, let alone those as accomplished as Senator  Dole, who can set aside their ego to thank perfect strangers, but he  did just that.   He left an unforgettable impression, not only on those that knew him  or those he served, but on this entire country.   Senator Dole was a generational leader and voice that was heard by  all, even those across the aisle. His zest for life and making our  country better was infectious. Not everyone can curry favor with those  of a different political ideology, but Senator Dole was not like every  other Member of Congress.   When describing his time in the Senate, he quipped: If you are  hanging around with nothing to do and the zoo is closed, come over to  the Senate. You will get the same kind of feeling and you won't have to  pay.   Didn't we love his humor?   I imagine he felt the same about his 8 years in the House of  Representatives, and I can almost attest to that myself.   Senator Dole set an example of conservatism and of bravery. There is  no one more deserving of the honor of lying in state at the U.S.  Capitol than Senator Bob Dole.   An outstanding example of what a public servant should be, his loss  devastates us all.   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole,  his daughter, Robin, his family and friends, as well as this country,  as we all come together to mourn this tremendous loss.
