 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate D.C.'s own  Washington Nationals for winning the National League Championship to  advance to the World Series--sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in four  straight games, no less. The Nationals will now face the Houston Astros  to compete for the team's first World Series title.   The Nation's Capital has been on a roll lately. Last year, the  Washington Capitals won their first Stanley Cup, and earlier this  month, the Washington Mystics won their first WNBA championship.   But, Madam Speaker, I also rise today to issue a challenge to Houston  Representative and, yes, my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee. I challenge my  colleague that, if the Nats win the World Series--I should say, when  the Nats win the World Series--she and her staff will wear, for a full  day at least, and take a photo in D.C. statehood T-shirts to help us  further nationalize the fight for D.C. statehood in Texas.   Although the Nats are underdogs, who doesn't love an underdog story?   Go Nats.                            ____________________
