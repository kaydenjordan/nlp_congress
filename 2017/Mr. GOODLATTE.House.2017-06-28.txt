 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1215.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today is modeled on California's  highly successful litigation reforms that have lowered healthcare costs  and made healthcare much more accessible to the people of that State.   Because the evidence of the effects of those reforms on lowering  healthcare costs is so overwhelming, the Congressional Budget Office  has estimated that, if the same reforms were applied at the Federal  level, they would save over $50 billion over a 10-year period.   Because the evidence that those reforms increase access to healthcare  is so overwhelming, they are supported by a huge variety of public  safety and labor unions, community clinics and health centers, and  organizations dedicated to disease prevention, all of which have seen  the beneficial effects of these reforms in California.   So popular are these reforms among the citizens of California that a  ballot initiative to raise the damages cap, backed and funded by trial  lawyers, was defeated by an over 2-to-1 margin in 2014.   This bill's commonsense reforms include a $250,000 cap on inherently  unquantifiable noneconomic damages and limits on the contingency fees  lawyers can charge. They allow courts to require periodic payments for  future damages instead of lump sum awards so bankruptcies in which  plaintiffs would receive only pennies on the dollar can be prevented.  They include provisions creating a ``fair share'' rule by which damages  are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault.   This bill does all this without in any way limiting compensation for  100 percent of plaintiffs' economic losses, which include anything to  which a receipt can be attached, including all medical costs, lost  wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and any other economic  out-of-pocket loss suffered as the result of a healthcare injury. Far  from limiting deserved recoveries in California, these reforms have led  to medical damage awards in deserving cases in the $80 million and $90  million range.   Unlike past iterations, this bill only applies to claims concerning  the provision of goods or services for which coverage is provided in  whole or in part via a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit, giving  it a clear Federal nexus. Wherever Federal policy directly affects the  distribution of healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest in  reducing the costs of such Federal policies.   The legislation before us today also protects any State law that  otherwise caps damages--whether at a higher level or lower than the  caps in the bill--or provides greater protections that lower healthcare  costs.   When President Ronald Reagan established a special task force to  study the need for Federal tort reform, that task force concluded as  follows: ``In sum, tort law appears to be a major cause of the  insurance availability and affordability crisis which the Federal  Government can and should address in a variety of sensible and  appropriate ways.''   Indeed, the Reagan task force specifically recommended ``eliminate  joint and several liability,'' ``provide for periodic payments of  future economic damages,'' ``schedule''--that is, limit--``contingency  fees'' of attorneys, and ``limit noneconomic damages to a fair and  reasonable amount.'' All of these recommended reforms are part of the  bill before us today.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that would enact  much-needed commonsense and cost-saving litigation reforms that would  increase healthcare accessibility for all.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, March 21, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write in regard to H.R. 1215,       Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, which was referred in       addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to       notify you that the Committee will forgo action on the bill       so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Committee on Energy and Commerce takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of       H.R. 1215, the Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation       and will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or       similar legislation moves forward to address any remaining       issues within the Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee       also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and asks that you support any       such request.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 1215 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your       committee's report on the legislation or the Congressional       Record during its consideration on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 21, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1215, the ``Protecting Access       to Care Act,'' so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1215 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.
