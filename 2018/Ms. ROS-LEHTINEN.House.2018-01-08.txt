 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment  with the administration's decision to terminate temporary protected  status--TPS--for hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans. This decision  comes just after it terminated TPS for Haiti and Nicaragua.   In 2001, El Salvador was struck by a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that  left destruction and tragedy in its wake, resulting in 250,000  Salvadorans coming to the U.S. seeking safety. Since then, they have  been key parts of our communities and important contributors for our  economy. It is cruel and inhumane to tell them that they will no longer  be afforded temporary status here in the U.S. and that they have to go  back to unsafe and uncertain conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to reverse the decision to  terminate TPS for El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Haiti. I ask my  colleagues to join me in a letter to the administration asking it to  right this wrong and to also extend this status for Honduras.                            ____________________
