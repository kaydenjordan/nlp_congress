 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share the stories of hardworking  Granite Staters who are feeling the pain of this shutdown on its 26th  day.   Middle-class families in New Hampshire are suffering because  politicians in Washington can't complete the most basic task of  governing. They are fed up with the gridlock and endless delays. They  are exhausted by the partisan political excuses. They just want us to  do our jobs and reopen the Federal Government.   This weekend, I met with an air traffic controller from Derry. He  told me that his coworkers are not going to be able to pay their  mortgages and keep up with household bills if the shutdown goes on any  longer. He explained that they are intensely proud of the service they  provide to the American people and simply want to do their jobs and get  paid on time. Is that really too much to ask?   Mr. Speaker, let's reopen our government for the sake of every  Federal employee who works tirelessly to keep the traveling public  safe.   Two fire departments in my district, in Goffstown and Hampton, have  applied for SAFER grants through FEMA. They needed the process to begin  in December in order to get approval at town meetings in March. The  shutdown has blocked the review of these applications.   Mr. Speaker, let's reopen our government so local fire departments  and first responders can get the resources they need to protect our  communities.   The spiraling effects of this shutdown are becoming more apparent  each and every day. The Manchester Transit Authority is concerned about  whether they will be able to keep buses running, since they haven't  been able to draw on Federal funds since December.   In addition, crisis centers in New Hampshire haven't been able to  access the funding they typically receive from the Office of Violence  Against Women to assist survivors of sexual and domestic violence. That  is completely unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, let's reopen our government so people can get to work on  time and local organizations can continue to support victims of crime  and abuse.   The President says this shutdown is necessary to protect the American  people, yet every story I hear in my district demonstrates this  shutdown is making us less safe. The longer our government remains  closed, the less secure our country will be.   Mr. Speaker, this shutdown has shown us the worst of Washington, the  dysfunction and the political gamesmanship that has no regard for  people's lives. But it is also bringing out the very best of people in  my State, their sense of decency and patriotism, their willingness to  lend a helping hand to neighbors in need.   Granite Staters have been banding together to help Federal workers in  a variety of ways, from offering no-interest loans to offering food  donations. The Wood Island Life Saving Station Association is giving  gift cards to Coast Guard personnel in Portsmouth to help them make  ends meet while they work without pay.   People in our communities are coming together to support everyday  Americans who are the victims of this shutdown, so why can't our  leaders in Washington do the same?   To my colleagues from across the aisle, to our colleagues in the  Senate: End this shutdown now. Let's move forward with the people's  business. We need to reopen the government, and we need to do it before  this bad situation gets any worse.                            ____________________
