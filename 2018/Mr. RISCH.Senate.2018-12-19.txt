 Mr. President, I come here today to talk about an issue  that has been talked about quite a bit here on the floor today, and  that is the situation in Syria. I know there has been a lot of debate  today about what is happening there and what happened today in Syria.   But I bring to the floor today something that I think should get the  unanimous consent of everyone. The House passed this resolution some  time ago. It was by voice vote--no recorded ``no'' votes. It was  essentially a unanimous consent bill.   When I am through with this, I am hoping everyone here will agree  with me that this is the right thing to do and something that will  actually address the situation that is taking place in Syria.   This bill declares that it is U.S. policy to use all diplomatic and  economic means to compel the government of Bashar al-Assad to stop the  slaughter of the Syrian people and work toward a democratic government.  The use of sanctions are a critical tool of U.S. foreign policy, and  that is what we are talking about here today--the implementation of  additional sanctions. They often allow the United States to have a  strong impact on a country and serve the U.S. national security  interests without having to implement military measures and put U.S.  troops in harm's way.   I believe--and most of us believe--that H.R. 1677 helps meet those  interests. How does it work? Here is how it works. First of all, it  imposes fresh sanctions on entities conducting business with the Assad  regime and its military and intelligence agencies. A number of regime- controlled industries--including in the airline, telecommunications,  and energy sectors--will also be targeted.   It aims to encourage negotiations by allowing the President to waive  sanctions if the parties are engaged in meaningful negotiations and the  violence against civilians has ceased.   The bill also authorizes the Secretary of State to support entities  that are collecting and preserving evidence for the eventual  prosecution of those who committed war crimes and crimes against  humanity in Syria from March 2011 to the present and requires the  President to report to Congress on the identity of those who are  responsible for or complicit with gross violations of human rights of  the Syrian people.   There is no doubt that we are going to get to that point. It is not  going to happen tomorrow, and it is not going to happen the next day,  but no one on Earth can do the kinds of things that Assad has done to  his own people.   We all know that there have been poisonous substances used and  weapons of mass destruction used by Assad against his people.  Eventually, those who are responsible are going to have to face the  music for that, and they are going to have to be prosecuted for that.   This bill helps to preserve the evidence and the identity of those  who are involved in that. As I noted, the House passed this some time  ago, and virtually without resistance. On November 30, the  administration issued a White House statement supporting H.R. 1677. The  administration said:         The bill would add to a robust set of tools at the       Administration's disposal to help bring to an end the       heartbreaking ongoing tragedy in Syria and to hold Syrian       officials accountable for the slaughter of civilians and       other atrocities. This bill will help provide additional       leverage to achieve the United States government's objective       to de-escalate the military conflict and support the United       Nations-led peace process and a transition to a government in       Syria that honors the will of the Syrian people, respects the       rule of law and human rights, and peacefully co-exists with       its neighbors in the region.    The bill effectively targets the Assad regime and its supporters with  additional financial sanctions and some crippling economic tools. We  have all seen some very recent examples of how well our sanctions have  worked because of the United States' position in the banking industry  and, indeed, in the world economic structure.   In order for us to get the Iranians out of Syria and help bring a  permanent defeat of ISIS, we must pursue a politically negotiated  solution that will have a major change in the current Syrian regime  structure. The Syrian people are a noble people. Their culture has been  an organization that has existed since Biblical times. These are a  noble people, a good people as a population, and they do not deserve  this. From a humanitarian perspective, this legislation expresses the  long overdue outrage for the 500,000 Syrians killed by the Syrian  dictator, Iranian forces, and their allies.   Dictators are evil. Whether they are religious or secular, royals or  oligarchs, they are evil.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 620, H.R. 1677; that the  committee-reported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, to respond briefly, with all due respect to  my friend and colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, I respectfully urge  that this is exactly what is needed to encourage the diplomacy that he  wants, that I want, that all of us want.   As far as discouraging that, this resolution actually gives the  President the authority to grant waivers when and if they finally get  to the diplomatic track.   So with all due respect, I disagree with that. I understand he has  the right to object to this. It is unfortunate. We had the 435 members  of the House hotline this here. There are 99 Members here who signed  off on this legislation. It is very unfortunate.   The Syrian people do not deserve the treatment they are getting from  Assad, and this resolution is aimed directly at stopping it.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
