 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, I would like to take a minute to  explain why Medicare for All is a prescription for Medicare for None.  Some folks are pitching this wild, misguided idea that one-size-fits- all government insurance is a cure-all for what ails the patients and  the people of the United States of America. This conversation needs a  strong dose of reality medicine.   Let's look at what is really being proposed--Medicare for None. Here  is what it would do. It would dump 181 million Americans off their  private health insurance plans, double your income taxes, and put  patients with preexisting conditions and chronic diseases on long  waiting lists for medical care. It would unravel the current health  safety net for seniors and people with disabilities, make the  government the gatekeeper between Americans and their doctors, and,  finally, put every single American who works for private health  insurance out of business and out of a job.   The politics behind the proposal is simple: free healthcare. Let me  remind my fellow Americans that if it sounds too good to be true, it is  too good to be true.   Medicare for All is a catchy slogan. When you hear it on the campaign  trail, remember it really boils down to government-run healthcare.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I come to the floor today, on June 4,  to take a look back at a very historic vote by the U.S. Senate. This  vote changed the course of political history in America. It  strengthened the social fabric and constitutional framework of our  Republic.   One hundred years ago today, lawmakers in this body cast a vote for  liberty and equality under the law. The Senate approved Federal  suffrage legislation. At the time it was passed, it was known as the  Susan B. Anthony amendment. Today it is better known as the 19th  Amendment to our U.S. Constitution.   Section 1 of the 19th Amendment reads: ``The right of the citizens of  the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United  States or by any State on account of sex.''   By adopting the measure, the 66th U.S. Congress paved the way for  women's suffrage from sea to shining sea. At the time, more than a  dozen States and Territories allowed full suffrage, led by the Western  States of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho.   In 1919 both Chambers of Congress were led by Republican majorities.  The House of Representatives adopted this constitutional amendment 304  to 89 on May 21. Two weeks later the Republican Senate voted 56 to 25  in favor of women suffrage. That was two votes more than the necessary  two-thirds vote required under our Constitution.   Both U.S. Senators from my State of Iowa voted for passage. Senator  William Kenyon, then the junior Senator from Iowa, later went on to  serve as a Federal judge for the Eighth Circuit.   The other aye vote from Iowa was cast by my predecessor, meaning he  was the only other Senator from Iowa to serve in the position I now  serve in as President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate. That senior  Republican Senator from Iowa was a former Governor of Iowa, Albert  Baird Cummins.   To a full Gallery packed with suffragists, Senator Cummins, as  President pro tempore, announced final passage of the suffrage  amendment. It was reported on June 5 in the New York Times that Iowa  Senator Cummins, presiding over the U.S. Senate, allowed visitors in  the Gallery to celebrate with ``deafening applause,'' and he made no  effort to stop the celebration.   As President pro tempore, Senator Cummins from Iowa was present at  the enrollment ceremony, watching over the shoulder of Vice President  Thomas Marshall, who signed this historic bill.   After the Senate passed it, it was then sent to the States for  ratification. In a special session of the Iowa General Assembly, my  State became the tenth State to ratify the 19th amendment on July 2,  1919, less than a month after the U.S. Senate had approved it.   Suffragists and supporters continued the campaign they started in the  Hawkeye State prior to World War I. They mobilized support among  farmers to pave the way to the ballot box for women. The future  Secretary of Agriculture under President Harding championed women's  rights to vote in his widely circulated farm journal. Henry C. Wallace  of Des Moines wrote:         I do not know how we can have a government of the people,       for the people and by the people, until women have an equal       voice with men. They are fully as competent as men to use       that ballot wisely.    Now, others invoked the patriotism, service, and sacrifice of women  during  [[Page S3183]]  World War I. Another compelling argument reminded Americans that,  without the ballot, women suffered taxation without representation. All  Americans will recall that the battle cry of taxation without  representation also paved the way to America's road to independence  from Great Britain, declared in July of 1776.   Two days after Iowa ratified the 19th amendment, Americans celebrated  our Nation's 143rd year of independence on the Fourth of July. One  hundred years later, we are 1 month away from celebrating our Nation's  243rd year of independence. Wow, what a difference a century can make.   The historic passage of the 19th amendment pulled back the curtain to  the voting booth and cracked open the glass ceiling for women to serve  in public office. Today one-fourth of the U.S. Senate are women,  including my colleague from Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst. She is also the  first female combat veteran elected to serve in the U.S. Senate.   In the 116th Congress, 102 women are now serving in the House of  Representatives, including two women from Iowa, Representative Abby  Finkenauer and Cindy Axne.   In the last election, Iowans elected our first female Governor, Kim  Reynolds, one of nine women now serving as chief executive of their  respective States.   Today I pay tribute to all those who blazed the trail to the ballot  box and helped secure women's right to vote.   At long last, the sacred right of franchise became a reality for all  Americans. It had been sought by women since the American Revolution.  Through the decades, it gained momentum through relentless advocacy at  the grassroots.   A lot of credit is due to organizers of a convention called the  Seneca Falls Convention in New York State in the summer of 1848. Just  think how long that was before the 19th amendment was finally adopted.  In 1848 this convention lit a flame that became inextinguishable. They  launched a civic movement for the ages with enough oxygen to become a  grassroots prairie fire.   For more than half a century, this organization of mostly women  organized with petitions, parades, and protests, building momentum and  constituencies at the State and Federal level. These early suffragists  succeeded in laying a cornerstone of equality for generations to come.  One of the most fundamental rights of self-government is the right to  vote, and ratification of the 19th amendment enshrined their sacred  civic duty into our founding charter of freedom.   I often say that the ballot box holds elected Members of Congress to  account for the decisions we make on behalf of those we represent. Our  institutions of government, civic organizations, system of free  enterprise, places of work, schools, communities, and, most  importantly, families are stronger thanks to the suffragists of our  history.   The road to ratification came down to a tie-breaking vote in  Nashville, TN. A young member of the State legislature broke a  deadlocked vote that otherwise would have tabled the measure. His name  was Harry Burn, a 24-year-old Republican from East Tennessee.   The morning of the vote, he received a note from his mother. She  invoked the name of a famous suffragist with long ties to my home State  of Iowa. You hear it along with Susan B. Anthony, but not as often. The  name of that Iowa woman is Carrie Chapman Catt. If you want to visit  her historic farm home, you can go to Charles City, IA, and visit where  she grew up and lived.   Mrs. Burns, the mother of that young Tennessee State legislator,  implored her son to ``be a good boy and help Mrs. Catt put the `rat' in  ratification.''   Representative Burns credited his tie-breaking vote to the influence  of his mother, to justice, and for the legacy of the Republican Party.  In a statement explaining his vote, Representative Burn wrote:         I appreciated the fact that an opportunity such as seldom       comes to a mortal man to free seventeen million women from       political slavery was mine. . . . I desired that my party in       both State and nation might say that it was a republican from       the East mountains of Tennessee . . . who made national woman       suffrage possible. . . .    On August 18, 1920, the Volunteer State became the 36th State to  ratify the amendment, securing the three-fourths of the States required  under the U.S. Constitution.   When the U.S. Secretary of State certified the results 8 days later,  the 19th amendment became the law of the land. It ensured men and women  in America would share equal rights to this fundamental civic right.   Like Harry Burn, I have a personal story about my mother. My mother  influenced my interest in government. For as long as I can remember,  she sowed the seeds of my quest for public office and a commitment to  public service.   For years, she taught students in a one-room schoolhouse about the  three R's--reading, writing, and arithmetic--as well as lifelong  lessons of civic responsibility. At home, she taught the Grassley kids  around the kitchen table to stand up for our beliefs. Those teachings  were to choose right over wrong, to waste not, want not, and to value  hard work and the value of hard-earned money. She practiced what she  preached, putting honesty and integrity first and foremost.   This photo I have beside me today was published in the Des Moines  Register on August 30, 1920. Approximately 8 or 10 days after Tennessee  ratified it but only 1 day after the secretary of State of the State of  Iowa said women could now vote, we have this photo of my mother voting.  It sets the scene of a historic day near my family farm.   A local woman named Mrs. Jens G. Theusen, of Fairfield Township,  located in Grundy County, IA--I live just across the county line in  Butler County--submitted her ballot in a country school in what I think  was a school election.   She was one of the first women to vote after the newly ratified 19th  Amendment.   My own mother, Ruth Corwin Grassley--referred to here as
