 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk,  No. 16.    Mr. Chair, this bill is simply a Big Oil  bill that is a massive gift to fossil fuel interests.   We are facing a climate crisis. In my district, 10 years ago, a  little more, Hurricane Sandy decimated New York City, and it was  considered to be a 100-year storm. Now, as we are trying to make our  district and our city resilient, we are told that this storm may happen  in another 10 or 20 years. Climate change is real, and this bill just  continues to destroy our climate.   Consistent with our Nation's commitment to tackling climate change,  my green equity amendment would turn a planet-killing corporate  giveaway into a recommitment to energy independence and a comprehensive  and equitable green energy transition.   Rather than increase our production, we should be investing here at  home in green energy. This amendment would kill the GOP's attempted  giveaway to Big Oil and instead require that in order to release oil  from the SPR, the executive branch must first certify to Congress that,  first, the United States is meeting the Paris climate accord's targets  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and, second, the recommendations of  the Justice40 Initiative, requiring that 40 percent of Federal  investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized,  underserved, and overburdened by pollution, are met.   While tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve can be a critical  tool to protect American families from high gas prices, we have an  obligation to future generations to make dramatic and sustained  progress toward an equitable and sustainable future. That is why I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, I am not surprised that my  colleague across the aisle thinks this is not germane because I  understand that my colleagues on the other side don't believe that oil  production has an impact on climate change.   The sad reality is that fossil fuel production is what is causing our  climate to burn and is what is causing the climate crisis that we are  facing. Whether it is in California recently, after years and years of  drought that now has torrential downpours, or other extreme weather  events around the country, the reason for that is greenhouse gas  emissions, and that stems directly from fossil fuel production.  [[Page H405]]    So, yes, this is precisely germane to what the issue is in terms of  additional oil production and the----    Mr. Chair, I was getting to the point that  it is very germane to meet our climate change promises, pursuant to the  Paris accords, to meet the Justice40 Initiative, to make sure that  economic justice is also at the forefront of our energy production. It  is very germane.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
