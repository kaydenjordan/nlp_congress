 Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for the  CARES Act.   For years, my colleague and I from across the aisle, Anna Eshoo, have  worked to pass the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act that was  signed into law in June of 2019.   For years, we have said it was not a matter of if we would have a  pandemic, but when we would have a pandemic. That when is now. Now is  not the time to place blame. Now is not the time to look back. Now is  the time to act and to look forward.   Now is the time to restore confidence in this body. Now is the time  to pass this act for those healthcare workers who are staying at the  hospital while they are begging us to stay home.   Now is the time for all of those schoolchildren who are watching this  body, thinking about and learning about this body, to show them that we  can come together and govern.   Now is the time to pass the CARES Act.   May God bless America.
