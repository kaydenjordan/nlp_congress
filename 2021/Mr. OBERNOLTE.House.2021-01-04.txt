 Madam Speaker, although I share the concerns that have  been raised about the MTR, I would like to speak on an aspect of this  rules package that I find equally troubling, and that is the provision  that would upend nearly 30 years of House tradition in exempting any  legislation that can be tied in any way to either response to climate  change or response to the coronavirus crisis from the requirements of  paygo--in other words, the requirement that we consider how to pay for  solutions to these problems in addition to how we solve these problems.   Now, admittedly, climate change and coronavirus are serious issues,  but it would be irresponsible to, when debating these issues, not  consider their effects on the national debt and the budget deficit,  which are also very serious issues. In fact, the CBO says that for the  first time, last year, since World War II, our national debt exceeded  100 percent of our gross domestic product.   To fail to consider solutions that we debate in this Chamber, the  effects of those solutions on those also serious problems, would be an  abdication of our responsibility to our constituents. I urge a ``no''  vote.
