 Mr. President, we heard a whole lot about the tax bill  the Republicans passed, and it basically works like this: We borrow  $1.5 trillion from our children and we give that money to the richest  Americans. And then when there is a little bit of help for middle-class  workers--and I mean a little--we say: Well, that is really cool.   I like that we are doing a little for the middle class, but I don't  like the fact that for every dime to help a middle-class worker, we  gave away a dollar to the richest Americans. In other words, America  has been robbed in the biggest bank heist ever, and then it was  justified by distributing a modest amount to our workers. Even then,  they included a provision that will drive up the premiums for  healthcare by more than 10 percent next year, on top of whatever rises  are driven by the drug companies. So whatever modest gain there is for  the middle class is wiped out by more expensive healthcare in America.   So we hear these big, sophisticated arguments: Oh, well, a worker  here or there got a bonus. A worker here or there got their wages  increased. But they don't tell you that they gave $1 trillion to the  richest Americans. Why not? Why not be honest about the whole entire  scope of this tax rip-off, borrowing from our children to enrich the  richest Americans?   As one House Member said, here is what this is all about: This is  about the fact that my rich donors won't vote for me and won't support  me in the next election unless I vote to give them all this money.   That is what happened here, and it is not OK because we see the  consequences. We have a budget that attacks the foundations for  families to thrive. It takes a trillion dollars out of healthcare.  Well, that trillion dollars went to the richest Americans. Then the  President gets to the budget and takes a trillion dollars out of  healthcare, takes money out of affordable housing. Housing is a very  important foundation for families to thrive. So it attacks healthcare  and housing, and then it attacks public education.   Quite frankly, because all those resources were taken off the table  that could have been invested in infrastructure and jobs in America, it  also undermines the concept of a living-wage job, which is the  principle that nobody who works full time in America should live in  poverty in America.   The majority has conducted the biggest bank heist in history, and  they come to the floor and defend this time and time again without  sharing the honest facts with the American people, as I have just  shared them with you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let's turn to another attack on workers.  Our entire Constitution had a theme, had a mission statement, and that  mission statement was ``we the people,'' government of, by, and for the  people. My colleagues might be surprised to discover that the  Constitution didn't say ``we the privileged; we the wealthy; we the  well-connected; we the powerful'' because they bring bill after bill to  the floor of the Senate that is exactly government of, by, and for the  wealthy and the well-connected.   Now we see that the Supreme Court is getting in on the act in this  effort to undermine the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair  share of the wealth that they create.   Former President Jimmy Carter once said:         Every advance in this half-century--Social Security, civil       rights, Medicare, aid to education, one after another--came       with the support and leadership of American labor.    Well, he was absolutely right. I would also add a few more things to  the list, such as 8-hour workdays, the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay,  the minimum wage, family and sick leave, health and safety working  standards. When workers have organized, they have fought for better  conditions for every American--better pay, better safety, better and  fair working conditions--and America is a better nation because of it.  It is a much better nation because of the men and women of the labor  movement who have fought tirelessly to ensure that our country lives up  to that ``we the people'' vision statement. Thanks to their work, an  honest day's work means an honest day's pay for millions of Americans.  But that is exactly what the Supreme Court is poised to undo. All the  powerful and the privileged--they want even more squeezed out of the  workers, so they have spent decades really demonizing and attacking the  ability of workers to organize.   During the three decades after World War II, workers got a fair share  of the wealth they were creating. Their wages went up as productivity  went up, and it turned out that this is good for business as well  because workers who have paychecks are able to buy products, and then  the companies can sell more. The companies do well when people get paid  fairly, but that concept is about to be undermined in a massive way  with an attack on what are called fair share fees.   When workers organize and bargain for better benefits, there is a  cost of developing that organization and conducting those negotiations,  and every  [[Page S1263]]  worker who benefits chips in a share under fair share fees. Everyone  wins, so everyone contributes.   This is not about contributing to political activity. It is not about  contributing funds that are distributed to causes. This is simply the  cost of the negotiating process. For this foundation to be able to  negotiate successfully, people have to share in that effort.   The heart of the right to organize has been absolutely embodied in  law for well over half a century in a case called Abood v. Detroit  Board of Education. Collective bargaining among workers doesn't work if  you create a strategy for workers to freeload; that is, to get all the  benefits without putting in any of the effort.   I am reminded of a story that I read as a very young child just  learning to read. It was about the barnyard. It was about some member  of the community baking bread and asking for help from all the other  animals--would they help with this aspect or that aspect of making the  bread. They all said: No, we are not interested in helping. At the end,  when the bread was baked, all the animals in the barnyard wanted their  share. They wanted a share of it without having contributed a thing.   That system is what the Supreme Court is trying to foist on America,  undermining the fundamental right to organize and allowing freeloaders  to essentially create a situation where you can't afford to represent  the group. Well, that undermines the success of our workers to get a  fair share of the wealth they create. It undermines their ability to  negotiate for a safer workplace.   Again, this is not about political activity; this is simply about the  function of representing a group in negotiations with the owner.   That is the case in Illinois, where Mark Janus works as a specialist  for the Department of Healthcare and Family Services. He works under a  contract negotiated between the State of Illinois and the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME. He is  not a member of the union. He is not required to be a member of the  union. But Mark Janus says: I want all the benefits that are produced  by the union organizing and negotiating on my behalf, but I don't want  to have to share any of the costs.   Everyone knows that if people are given a permission slip to not  share in the cost of organizing, the ability to organize is undermined.  It is a fundamental part of it: You negotiate together; you benefit  together. He is challenging that portion of the contract.   The powerful and privileged titans of industry have been waging a  decades-long campaign against the workers of America. They are excited  about this. Don't worry, the Koch brothers are in control. Well, we  have certainly seen their control here in the Senate. This certainly  bears on the case right before us. They invested vast sums in 2014, and  they supported and pushed campaigns in Arkansas, Louisiana, North  Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, and Alaska, and they turned those seats in  favor of folks who supported the Koch brothers. They took a majority of  this body.   What happened in 2016? Well, there was a vacant Supreme Court seat.  We have all taken a pledge to support the Constitution. We have an  advice and consent responsibility. But the majority leader came down  here and said: We are not going to do our responsibility of advice and  consent on any nominee from President Obama--none. It doesn't matter  who the nominee is; we are not going to do this. Why? Because the Koch  brothers said: Don't allow a debate or a vote on a nominee from  President Obama.   The majority leader said that this was justified because it was an  election year. Let's look at American history. Fifteen times in an  election year, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court. All 15  times previous to 2016, the Senate debated and the Senate voted.   There were Members of my colleague's team across the aisle who  thought we should honor that responsibility of advice and consent. You  can vote somebody down or you can vote somebody up, but we should have  the debate and we should have the vote. As soon as they said one word  about how there should be a debate or there should be a vote, they got  their chain yanked. In one case, the Koch brothers said they would  immediately put in millions of dollars against their primary opponent.   That is why the Koch brothers are known as the puppet masters of this  body right here in which I stand right now. When they say ``jump,'' the  majority says ``how high?'' That certainly came to fruition in 2016  when they refused to exercise their constitutional responsibility to  debate and vote on a nominee for the Supreme Court. That was done so  that the empty seat would be passed on to the next President. That is  the first time in U.S. history a Supreme Court seat has been stolen and  passed on to the next President--the only time.   Well, what does that result in? That results in a Supreme Court that  now has been selected where we know four people stand on one side of  the issue and four stand on the other side. Then you have, essentially,  an illegitimate process for the ninth Justice--a Justice who by every  indication is willing to join the other four in attacking the  foundation of the right to organize in our Nation. That right to  organize was envisioned in the Constitution, in the ``we the people''  Constitution, not ``we the powerful,'' not ``we the privileged,'' not  ``we the wealthy,'' and not ``we the well-connected.''   Mr. Janus is being represented and funded by the National Right to  Work Foundation. Let's call it the right to freeload because that is  what it is. You don't contribute your share, but you get all the  benefits.   It reminds me a little bit of the conversation about citizenship in  America. People talk about the rights of citizenship and their  responsibilities of citizenship too. There are responsibilities of  being part of a group when you bargain for wages. That means paying  your fair share. So it is their share. It is the heart of the ability  to organize versus the position orchestrated by the Koch brothers to  assault the ability to organize in this country so that workers can get  a fair share of the wealth they work to create.   We have seen these right-to-freeload bills pass with the influence of  the titans across this country in State after State. Here is what we  know. In those States that protect the constitutional vision of the  right to organize, workers earn over $5,000 a year more than in other  States. In the right-to-freeload States, workers earn a lot less. And  that is apparently why the owners of the companies love that action so  much--because they can squeeze more out of the workers. The right-to- freeload States have higher poverty. They have higher infant mortality.  They have higher workplace deaths than other States. They support  public schools less than other States.   It is a mistake to have a Court assembled through an illegitimate  process of stealing a Supreme Court seat proceed to gut the  constitutional right to organize and assault the workers of this Nation  just to put more zeros on the bank account statements of the  millionaires and billionaires and titans and wealthy and powerful  Americans.   Let's have a remedial course in this Chamber about what our Nation  and our Constitution are all about. It is not about coming here and  getting elected by the wealthiest Americans to serve the wealthiest  Americans; it is about coming here to form laws that serve ``we the  people.'' Thomas Jefferson made this point again and again. He said  that if you concentrate power in the few, you will get power from the  powerful--you will get decisions from the powerful. You will never get  the will of the people if you concentrate power. He called on every  voter to have an equal voice--not just a vote but an equal voice.   So let's remember Jefferson. Let's remember that our Forefathers put  together this document so that we wouldn't have government by the few  and the powerful, such as they have in Europe, but this would be  different here in the United States of America, where we would try to  forge laws that gave all families the opportunity to thrive.   We can see the impact that the reversal of this principle has had. We  spent half of last year on a healthcare bill or versions of a  healthcare bill designed to rip healthcare from 22 to 30 million  Americans, depending on the version. Then we spent the other part of  the year on a tax bill designed to borrow  [[Page S1264]]  $1.5 trillion from our children and deliver the vast amount of the  benefits to the wealthiest of Americans. That is government for and by  the powerful. Let's return to government for and by the people.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern  Jonah Harris be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of  the day.
