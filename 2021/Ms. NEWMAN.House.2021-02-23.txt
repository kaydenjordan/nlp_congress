 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the millions of  Americans who continue to be denied housing, education, public  services, and much, much more because they identify as members of the  LGBTQ community; Americans like my own daughter who, years ago, bravely  came out to her parents as transgender.   I knew from that day on, my daughter would be living in a nation  where, in most of it States, she could be discriminated against merely  because of who she is. And yet, it was still the happiest day of my  life, because my daughter has found her authentic self.   And as any mother would, I swore that I would fight to ensure this  country changes for the better. Without the Equality Act, this Nation  will never live up to its principles of freedom and equality. The right  time to pass this act was decades ago. The second best time is right  now.   I am voting yes on the Equality Act for Evie Newman, my daughter, and  the strongest, bravest person I know.  [[Page H566]]                                ____________________
