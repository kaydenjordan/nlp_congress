 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 17, I missed three votes to  attend to constituent business in my district. Had I been present for  the day's vote series, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 379,  the passage of H.R. 2210, to designate the community living center of  the Department of Veterans Affairs in Butler Township, Butler County,  Pennsylvania, as the Sergeant Joseph George Kusick VA Community Living  Center, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 380, the passage of H.J. Res. 92,  granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of  Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to amend  the Washington Area Transit Regulation Compact; and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 381, the passage of H.J. Res. 76, granting the consent and approval  of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland,  and the District of Columbia to a enter into a compact relating to the  establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marshall). Without objection, the title  is amended by striking ``a enter'' and inserting ``enter''.   There was no objection.                            ____________________
