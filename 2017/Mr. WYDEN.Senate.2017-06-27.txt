 Mr. President, the last few days have proven, once again,  that political change in America doesn't start in Washington, DC, and  then trickle down. It is from the bottom up.   Because millions of Americans called and texted and tweeted their  opposition to an abomination of a health plan, that plan is not going  to be on the Senate floor this week, thanks to grassroots America. It  is so appropriate at this hour. I also want to make clear we have a  bottom line for the next 2 weeks. We have an incredible amount of heavy  lifting we have to do to make sure working families and seniors get a  fair shake from the American healthcare system.   I say that because, as we speak, Senate Republicans are at the White  House strategizing with the President. The horse-trading has already  begun, and the Senate Republicans have a slush fund paid for by working  families that contains hundreds of billions of dollars that can be used  for sweetheart deals that would get them the 51 votes needed to pass  this horrendous healthcare bill in the U.S. Senate.   Now I will turn to what we need to focus on in the next 2 weeks at  townhall meetings, civic group lunches, discussions with rural  healthcare providers. That focus has to be to highlight what this  flawed Republican bill really means and how it can't be fixed no matter  how much money the Republican leadership throws at these problems. This  bill is a healthcare smash-and-grab, designed to benefit the fortunate  few, and is paid for by hundreds of billions of dollars in reductions  from Medicaid--tax breaks for the wealthy that Senate Republicans are  so anxious to dole out, they are willing to make them retroactive.  Contrary to what Senate Republicans say, their tax changes don't create  jobs. They do create tax windfalls.   Exhibit A, under their bill, you have a $1 million capital gain in  February, and, if this bill passes, that lucky person would get a  $38,000 tax break. Many of these gains go directly into the pockets of  America's 400 most affluent families, while disabled kids, those with  opioid addictions, and families where a baby boomer has the misfortune  of having a stroke and needs nursing home care face the prospect that  the crucial health services they need--services that are life and death  for them--will not be there because of this flawed healthcare bill.   Next, I want to point out that over the next 2 weeks, we are going to  lay out how this legislation would send costs into the stratosphere for  millions and millions of Americans. Start with older people who are  about to get hit by what I call a double-age tax. If this bill goes  through, insurance companies will have a green light to charge older  Americans more than they charge younger people. As if that doesn't  raise their costs enough, older Americans are also going to be forced  to pay a higher share of their income on healthcare costs because the  Senate Republican bill shrinks their tax benefits as they age. Older  Americans need more healthcare. They can't afford to skimp out on bare- bones insurance. So many of our older people are going to see their  premiums nearly quadruple.   It is not just older Americans who are going to see their costs jump.  Right off the top, hundreds of thousands of middle-class families  across the country are going to lose tax cuts for healthcare because  the Republican bill snatches away their eligibility.   When it comes to the private insurance market, this bill is centered  on a plan to push Americans into bargain-basement healthcare coverage.  After all the talk about deductibles and out-of-pocket costs being  unaffordable, this  [[Page S3785]]  Republican proposal ties middle-class benefits to high-deductible, low- value insurance plans. It is a sleight of hand to make it look like  consumers are getting a better deal and lower premiums.   Here is the reality. Of course you can make premiums go down if you  force people into insurance that only covers bandaids and a bottle of  aspirin. When people get sick or suffer an injury, they are going to  read the fine print on their insurance. With this legislation, if it  were to pass, they would see sky-high deductibles and cut-rate  coverage. For working families, they would face the prospect they would  get buried under medical debt because their insurance doesn't cover the  care they actually need.   Finally, not even people who get their insurance at work--those folks  probably thought they were home free in this debate--not even folks who  get their insurance at work are safe from the Senate Republican  healthcare plan. Four million Americans are going to lose their  employer-sponsored insurance coverage just next year if this bill goes  through. Tens of millions of Americans could once again face some of  the worst insurance company abuses--annual and lifetime limits on  coverage. Those are limits the Affordable Care Act banned, but  Republicans are proposing to bring them back.   Let's be real clear. If you bring them back and don't protect people  from skyrocketing costs, it means that if they develop cancer, they  could bust through their coverage limit, and, once again, we would go  back to the days in America where those folks were forced into personal  bankruptcy because millions of people without coverage will be unable  to pay for the care they need. People with employer-based insurance are  going to get hit with a hidden tax in the form of higher premiums.   So if an American listening to this is considering early retirement,  think again. The cost could well be too high. If you were thinking of  leaving your job, becoming an entrepreneur, and starting your own  business, you can think again. Your costs could be higher under this  plan, especially if you have specific medical needs.   Then there is the generation of adults in the workforce today--people  who are middle class, who are doing everything they can to support  their families and save whenever possible. They may not be thinking  about the expense of long-term care, but the fact is, growing older in  America really costs a lot.   Because of this bill, millions of people will no longer be able to  count on Medicaid being there to cover their long-term care in a  nursing home or at home where they are most comfortable later in life.   I want to close by way of saying that what we have to do now is make  sure that--to beat this destructive Republican bill; this is the only  way to do it--Americans keep tweeting, keep sending letters, keep  finding rallies to attend, tell your stories about how you are going to  do worse with this bill. And then tell your friends' stories and your  family's stories. It is a virtual lock that this bill is going to come  back around.    I close today by way of saying that grassroots America, by speaking  out--the fact that they did that and did all that work I have described  is why this flawed bill is not going to be voted on in the Senate this  week. We need everybody over the next 2 weeks, seniors and working  families and people all across this country--my message is that we need  you to stay loud because that is the only way we will finally stop this  bill in its tracks.   I yield to our friend from Maryland, Senator Cardin.    Will my colleague yield for a question?    I know my friend from Maryland is a real expert on this  whole matter of private insurance, going back to his days in the State  legislature, and I was director of the Gray Panthers.   I think what you are saying is that it is critically important that  we get more predictability and more certainty in the private insurance  market. What I am struck by is, of course, this is the private sector.  This is not the government. This is the private sector. The President  has been basically pouring gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the  private insurance market because he is always in or out on this  question of cost sharing, and the private insurers then say: We can't  really predict what our rates are going to be, and maybe we have to  pull out or we have to raise rates.   Could the Senator again highlight his thoughts with respect to more  predictability and more certainty? It is such an important point.   After my good friend from Maryland has made that point, I know the  Senator from Delaware is interested in the same subject.    Will my friend yield?  [[Page S3787]]         The Senator, as a Governor, really has helped educate me  over the years on this whole question of the States being  ``laboratories of democracy'' and trying fresh approaches. Delaware has  done that and Oregon has done that.   I ask the Senator: As a former Governor, what would it mean to you if  you are staring at a 20- or 25-percent reduction in Medicaid? Because  as you know, that is what is contemplated with the Senate Republicans.    I thank my friend. Would my friend like to add anything  else or should we yield to Senator Cantwell?    Before Senator Cardin leaves the floor and we yield to our  friend from Washington, who is also so knowledgeable about healthcare,  on this point with the States being the laboratories of democracy,  during the debate with my colleagues over the Affordable Care Act, we  wrote a provision, 1332. It gives the States the authority to do  better, to come up with, as the distinguished Senator from Delaware,  Mr. Carper, said--it is a chance to do better and try out those fresh  ideas on my colleagues.   The problem is, with the Senate Republican bill, they are talking  about giving the States the right to do worse, to waive out some of  these essential protections. Again, I think this is natural for  something that could be bipartisan, where Democrats and Republicans  could work together to really encourage States to do better. Let's not  go the other way and abuse that provision in the Affordable Care Act so  States can work.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington State  who was for care coordination, moving away from fee-for-service, using  bargaining power, locally driven approaches long before it really  became a buzzword in American healthcare. I thank her very much for  this.    Mr. President, of course.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague.   Senator Warner.    I thank the Presiding Officer. At this point, we are just  going to hear from Senator Warner.    Mr. President, before he yields the floor, I just want to  thank Senator Warner for his insightful comments. As a Governor, he  really understands why a Medicaid cut of hundreds and hundreds of  millions of dollars is going to permanently damage the lives of so many  people in Virginia. I thank him for his comments.   Let me yield now to Senator Menendez.    Mr. President, I believe we are very close to consuming  the hour that the Finance Democrats have, so I ask unanimous consent  that at this time Senator Casey be recognized for his remarks and at  the conclusion of his remarks, I be recognized for some final comments.    To wrap this up, Mr. President, I was struck when Senator  Menendez talked about the Senate Republican health bill being more for  less. I think millions of Americans might say it is a classic bait-and- switch. After the horrible House bill was passed, Senate Republicans  and the Trump administration promised something new. It would have more  heart. It would be less mean. But essentially what they have done is  doubled down on exactly what the American people rejected in the House  bill--the secrecy, the fact that the breaks went to the fortunate few  and the pain went to millions of Americans who needed nursing home  care, who have youngsters with special needs, or who are disabled.   The fact is that the process Senate Republicans have used on this  health reconciliation bill hasn't gone well. That is why they can't go  forward with consideration of their healthcare bill this week. And it  looks as though--I heard remarks from one of our senior colleagues  early this afternoon--it looks as though the same darn thing is going  to be used for tax reform. Once again, a bill processed behind closed  doors, without any input from the other party--it looks as if that is  the route that is going to be taken on tax reform. I think that is  unfortunate.   I have made it very clear--very clear--to the Trump administration  that the history of successful tax reform is bringing both sides in  early and finding ways to secure principles that each side feels  strongly about that the other can live with. There has been no such  consultation--zero--with respect to this administration and Democrats  on the Finance Committee.   I am struck, because I wrote, over the last decade, what are the only  two bipartisan Federal comprehensive tax reform bills--first with our  former colleague, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator  Gregg, and most recently with the new head of the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence, Senator Coats, and we have had no  consultation on the substance of tax reform. That is a prescription for  trouble. It is, in effect, walking away from the history that the only  way to get a sustainable, bipartisan tax reform plan is to get both  sides together, not do what is being discussed now openly in the media:  that the Republican leadership and the Trump administration are going  to write a tax bill and then just pop it on the American people in the  fall. And I anticipate it will be more of the same in terms of stacking  the deck dramatically in favor of the fortunate few.   I say this because we heard again what appears to be the plan of the  Senate Republicans to kind of double down on the flawed strategy of  healthcare, which is just to do it in secret and then expect to see if  maybe they can get a couple of Democrats to go along. Then they can  say: Oh, that is a bipartisan bill.   That is not a bipartisan bill.   A bipartisan bill is the kind of work that was done in 1986 with my  predecessor, Senator Packwood, and Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who was  another tall Democrat on the Finance Committee. A big group got  together and worked out a bill that made sense, broadened the tax base,  and gave everybody in America the chance to get ahead.   My hope is that over the next 2 weeks, in terms of defeating a flawed  healthcare bill and showing that there needs to be a different path for  tax reform, the American people will keep making those calls, keep  tweeting, keep texting, keep going to rallies, keep going to meetings  where healthcare providers get together and say: Look, this healthcare  bill that Republicans are talking about does not work for us, and it  does not work for our parents and our grandparents and youngsters and  the disabled folks and those who need opioid services.   Again, I thank my colleagues from the Finance Committee. We have had  something like eight colleagues participate in this over the last hour.   I would just say to the American people that the reason we have been  able to hold off this horrendous Senate Republican healthcare bill is  that grassroots America showed again that political change does not  start at the top and trickle down but comes from the bottom-up. It was  all of that citizen involvement that caused the Republican leadership  to put this bill off, but it is a lock--an absolute lock--that it is  going to come up again in a couple of weeks.   As I wrap up my remarks this afternoon, I hope that over the next 2  weeks, the American people will be loud, will come out to their elected  officials' events, and will tell them what they are for and what they  are against.   On behalf of the Senate Finance Democrats, I yield the floor.
