 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 793) calling on Hamas to immediately release  hostages taken during October 2023 attack on Israel.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 793         Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a brutal       terrorist attack from Gaza into Israel and against the       Israeli people;        Whereas, on October 16, 2023, the Israeli military       confirmed that Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in the       attack;        Whereas, on October 15, 2023, the United States Department       of State confirmed that at least 30 Americans were killed in       the attack;        Whereas, on October 16, 2023, the Israeli military       confirmed that Hamas was holding 199 hostages in Gaza who       were abducted during the attack;        Whereas Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions       states that the taking of hostages is and shall remain       prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever;        Whereas, on October 10, 2023, President Joe Biden confirmed       that Americans are known to be among the hostages;        Whereas it is reported that children and senior citizens       are among the hostages; and        Whereas Hamas has threatened to execute hostages and       videotape the killings: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns Hamas for its brutal attack on Israel;        (2) condemns Hamas for the taking of hostages;        (3) condemns Hamas for threats made against hostages;        (4) demands that Hamas immediately release all hostages and       return them to safety;        (5) recognizes that the taking of hostages is a violation       of international humanitarian law; and        (6) expresses sympathy to the hostages, wounded, deceased,       and their families for this travesty to justice and personal       hardship.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on October 7, Israel suffered one of the worst days in  its history as it came under attack by the Hamas terror group. These  terrorists stormed across the border at Gaza and murdered 1,200 people  and took 240 innocent people hostage, dragging them against their will  into Gaza.   From elderly Holocaust survivors to young babies, Hamas did not  discriminate in its cruelty.   Mr. Speaker, American citizens are still among the hostages. Many of  us in this House have met with these hostage families. The pain and  suffering that these families are enduring is beyond what any human  should have to go through.   Young children forced to be witness to their parents' murder right in  front of them, babies ripped from their mothers arms, teenagers at a  music festival gunned down.   The atrocities that were committed that day and the glee with which  the terrorists acted is unimaginable, Mr. Speaker, and it is the height  of human depravity.   Hamas filmed and broadcast these atrocities. This savage, sick  terrorist group wanted to brag to the world about the massacre at their  hands.   These terrorists, Mr. Speaker, are monsters, and we have not seen  this type of violence and cruelty since ISIS was running rampant in the  Levant. The Jewish people have not witnessed this much diabolical death  in one day since the Holocaust.   After holding these hostages for 7 long weeks, Hamas has agreed to  release some of these innocent women and children in an exchange for  Israel temporarily pausing its military campaign and releasing  Palestinians in jail.   All of us on this House floor are grateful for those hostage  releases, and we are grateful for the leadership of the United States,  Qatar, and the Government of Israel to achieve that modicum of peace  and help for those families.   However, listen to the deal, Mr. Speaker. It was three jailed  criminals for each innocent person captured and drug across the Gaza  fence line on October 7. Despite the good news that we have witnessed  in the last few days, Hamas is still holding over 150 innocent people.   Hamas must release all the remaining hostages. The United States  continues to stand alongside our ally Israel in their fight to secure  that safe release of all the hostages unconditionally and safely.   It was an honor and privilege working together with Congresswoman  Haley Stevens, and I am so proud to be on the House floor tonight  alongside Congresswoman Haley Stevens to introduce this resolution.   With this resolution, the House of Representatives strongly condemns  Hamas' attack. It calls on Hamas to immediately and unconditionally  release all the hostages taken on October 7.   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has marked up this legislation  earlier in the month, and it received unanimous support. I expect it  will receive that today on this House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to stand with the hostages,  with their families, and support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Lawler), a very passionate supporter of our ally Israel and a  senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her passionate  words and her outstanding work in crafting this H. Res. 793, which  calls on Hamas to release everyone unconditionally to return to their  families.   Ms. Stevens has done a great thing. Between us, we come to this House  [[Page H5923]]  floor with some 236 cosponsors for this resolution, Mr. Speaker.   I would certainly hope that on both sides of this aisle that we have  a unanimous vote on this important statement of the American people,  representing the American people, calling out against the atrocities  that have been committed against the innocent people in Israel.   I thank my friend from Michigan, too, for our work together and  partnership and co-chairing the Congressional Task Force on American  Hostages and Americans Wrongly Detained Abroad.   This is important work. It has been truly tested in these past 7  weeks. Our congressional family is grieving with our Israeli families  and other nationalities who have someone as a murder victim of these  terrorists or someone who remains a hostage of these terrorists.   It is our goal to be a resource to our fellow Members through that  task force to try to help them work with our State Department and make  sure those families understand what information they can have and how  they can be helped through this challenge. We want to bring all these  Americans home.   Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I just would say we were all on the  front steps of the Capitol together, Democrats and Republicans, and we  stood as Americans that night with our new Speaker,   Mike Johnson; our  minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries; Ms. Stevens, myself, our colleagues;  our committee chairs, Mr. Meeks of New York as our ranking member of  Foreign Affairs; and our committee chairman, Mr. McCaul of Texas, in  solidarity against the atrocities in Gaza and in Israel.   That night, I had the opportunity to have the most wonderful visit  with the most hopeful mother, Adi Marciano--a beautiful woman.   We hugged and talked, and we had in the candlelight of that moment on  the House steps a moment of hope, but just a few hours later, she  learned that her daughter, Noa, 19 years old, Mr. Speaker, a soldier in  the Israel Defense Forces, was among the murdered, not among the  hostages.   We don't want to forget those who have been killed in this process as  we pray for the release of the hostages, and we call politically on  this House floor for the release of the hostages.   We lift up these families, and we lift up all those who are grieving  over the loss and tragedy on both sides of the fence in Gaza.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 793. I  reserve the balance of my time, and I have no additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for leading the discussion on our House floor today on the gentlewoman  from Michigan's excellent resolution, H. Res. 793.   I am proud to be a cosponsor, proud to stand with 236 Members on both  sides of the aisle to demand an unconditional release of those still  held hostage by the terrorists in Gaza and their coconspirators.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
