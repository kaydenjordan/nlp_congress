 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1189) to require the development of a strategy to eliminate the  availability to foreign adversaries of goods and technologies capable  of supporting undersea cables, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1189         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Undersea Cable Control       Act''.       SEC. 2. STRATEGY TO ELIMINATE THE AVAILABILITY TO FOREIGN                     ADVERSARIES OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGIES CAPABLE                     OF SUPPORTING UNDERSEA CABLES.         (a) In General.--The President, acting through the       Secretary of State and in consultation with the Secretary of       Commerce, shall develop a strategy to eliminate the       availability to foreign adversaries of goods and technologies       capable of supporting undersea cables consistent with United       States policy described in section 1752 of the Export Control       Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4811).        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The strategy required under       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) An identification of goods and technologies capable of       supporting the construction, maintenance, or operation of an       undersea cable project.        (2) An identification of United States and multilateral       export controls and licensing policies for goods and       technologies identified pursuant to paragraph (1) with       respect to foreign adversaries.        (3) An identification of United States allies and partners       that have a share of the global market with respect to the       goods and technologies so identified, including a detailed       description of the availability of such goods and       technologies without restriction in sufficient quantities and       comparable in quality to those produced in the United States.        (4) A description of ongoing negotiations with other       countries to achieve unified export controls and licensing       policies for goods and technologies so identified to       eliminate availability to foreign adversaries.        (5) An identification of all entities under the control,       ownership, or influence of a foreign adversary that support       the construction, operation, or maintenance of undersea       cables.        (6) A description of efforts taken to promote United States       leadership at international standards-setting bodies for       equipment, systems, software, and virtually defined networks       relevant to undersea cables, taking into account the       different processes followed by such bodies.        (7) A description of the presence and activities of foreign       adversaries at international standards-setting bodies       relevant to undersea cables, including information on the       differences in the scope and scale of the engagement of       foreign adversaries at such bodies compared to engagement at       such bodies by the United States and its allies and partners,       and the security risks raised by the proposals of foreign       adversaries at such bodies.        (c) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for 3       years, the President shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report that contains the strategy       required under subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1189, the Undersea Cable  Control Act.   What is this about at a higher level? It is about this: Don't enable  our adversaries. Don't allow them to become stronger than us, or to  make us reliant upon them, or to catch up to us in any way whatsoever,  especially China.   How does this relate to the bill? Undersea cables, if you are not  familiar, carry about 99 percent of transoceanic  [[Page H1452]]  digital communications--think things like voice communications, data,  internet, trillions of daily international financial transactions,  things that you don't want China getting ahold of. They serve as the  backbone--a framework, really--for the global internet.   These cables enable consumers, businesses, governments, and the  military to communicate securely with each other and to access the  internet. That is pretty dadgum important.   The United States derives significant benefits from its leading  position in global subsea cable networks, which carry the vast majority  of voice and internet traffic between continents. However, in recent  years, Chinese companies--heavily subsidized, of course, by the PRC,  the Communist government--have started investing heavily in owning and  supplying subsea cables.   I would say it in this way: Imagine if we allowed, during the Cold  War, the Soviet Union to buy up radio component companies in the United  States of America and other places. What would things have been like?  What kind of danger would that have been? That is the way that we  should look at this.   The U.S. has to look at the supply, the ownership, of these cables as  another front in our competition with the PRC, where their aim is to  supplant, like anything, the United States of America's position.   This is not just an economic issue. The Chinese will steal  information. They will make it unsecure. They want our transmissions.  They weaponize all forms of telecommunications that they can. They  weaponize every bit of social media that they can. They try to make  these capabilities fit their own nefarious ends.   Do we really think for a second that they would not do the same with  undersea cables?   I am not going to be fooled into thinking that. That is why I have  introduced the Undersea Cable Control Act. It is a bipartisan bill that  will direct the President to develop a strategy to eliminate American  technologies capable of supporting undersea cables from falling into  the hands of our adversaries, blocking our adversaries' abilities to  develop and perfect undersea cable capabilities. It is a critical step  for our security.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for listening to my opinions on this issue,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I encourage us to look at the  world in this way: Everything with China and everything with communists  is competition. It is competition against America. It is competition  against our democratic values, our way of life, the way that we  operate, the way that we pride ourselves on freedom. I don't kick well,  but I am prepared to kick their ass in anything.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
