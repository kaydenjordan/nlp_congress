 Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I  want to say about Louie Gohmert is that Louie is a hero to many, many  Americans, and he is a hero to me.   One of the pretty heady things about walking onto the floor of the  United States House of Representatives is that you meet these people  you have seen on your television screens across the country that you  have heard from who have spoken the words that you wish you could have  spoken.   Louie was one of the first heroes I met. You meet some people who are  not necessarily heroes, too, here. But Louie was a hero that I met  maybe my first day walking on the floor.   Another thing about this place is sometimes everything has been said,  not everybody said it, but there are moments when having the  opportunity to join the chorus is as important as anything I can think  of.   To Louie Gohmert, I say thank you for being a hero. Thank you for  always being a loyal fighter for freedom.   All of us seem to fail, and sometimes at the moment when most needed,  Louie, you have never failed. You have persisted.   While sometimes I am uncertain how to fill up the time, you will  stand on this floor and you will rely on your inner substance, and you  can lay it out as long as you need to go to communicate to the American  people, to communicate on their behalf, to say what matters. I don't  know what we will do without you.    God bless you, Louie Gohmert.
