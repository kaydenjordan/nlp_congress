 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support and gratitude for the members of law enforcement bravely  serving my home in western New York and around the Nation.   This National Police Week gives us all a chance to pause and  appreciate the dangerous, selfless, and, unfortunately, sometimes  thankless job our police officers do. But we should not only honor them  1 week every year, we must continually show our support by resisting  any and all attempts to defund our police.   Every day, our police officers wake up, put on a uniform, and go out  into the communities that they serve to protect us not knowing if they  will return home to their families that evening. They continually put  their lives on the line.   I recently was humbled to honor numerous officers in my home of  Orchard Park, New York, and Lancaster, New York, who rescued residents  from burning buildings and brush fires while they were off duty.   We need police, and we need more young people to seek out a career  serving their communities in law enforcement. Unfortunately, the recent  stereotyping of police over the last year has been a severe deterrent  to new members joining and also caused massive retirements of existing  law enforcement, making all our communities less safe.   The assault from the left on our police must come to an end. It is  imperative that we properly fund, equip, and support law enforcement on  the local, State, and Federal level.   To conclude, our police are heroes and deserve to be honored as such.  I join my colleagues in thanking them this week for their bravery and  their service.
