 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the urgent need to  address freight rail delays.   Across the Nation, manufacturers and farmers are finding it  impossible to get their goods to market via rail. Rail service delays  cause disruptions to flour and feed mills, livestock producers, power  companies, and many other industries.   To make freight rail a truly competitive and stable industry, we need  to make sure that shippers can address these service disruptions  without government intervention.   I have introduced the Freight Rail Shipping Fair Market Act to  establish a level playing field for freight rail. My subcommittee  solicited feedback from shippers, the freight rail industry, and  railway workers.   Mr. Speaker, I am committed to working with Members from both  parties, and I encourage all Members to work with us to pass this  bipartisan bill that will help freight railroads, their customers, and  the American consumers.                            ____________________
