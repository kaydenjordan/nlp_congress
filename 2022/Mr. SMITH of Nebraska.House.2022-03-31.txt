 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this issue is so important I don't think we should  automatically accept a partisan proposal that doesn't even get to the  heart of the problem.   Today we actually could be voting on H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More  Cures Act, a bipartisan bill that would not only address the root  causes of the high insulin prices, but lower costs for all patients.   Instead, and I might say, very sadly, we are voting on a partisan  messaging bill to give Washington a greater say in Americans' medical  decisions while raising premiums on seniors and the millions of  Americans with private health insurance.   This is nothing more than an attempt by my colleagues on the other  side to pass just piece by piece their cures-killing Socialist takeover  of the entire innovation sector. And worse, despite the misleading  title of this current bill, it does nothing to lower the actual price  of insulin. Instead, it uses budget games and regulations to disguise  the actual cost of insulin for all consumers.   This is just another instance of misguided health and economic  policies coming at a time when more than half of Americans are worried  about rising prices and the economy. And, of course, like the  President's budget released this week, this bill, too, is only ``paid  for'' with gimmicks, adding to our deficit and the core causes of  inflation.   We can and should do more for the American people who are struggling.  The American people expect us to work together. We could be doing that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters  from numerous groups representing and reflecting the views of millions  of Americans.                                                     AMAC Action,                                       Leesburg, FL, March 30, 2022.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      House Republican Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Whip Scalise: On behalf of the 2.3 million members of       AMAC--Association of Mature American Citizens, I write to       express our concern with H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin       Now Act.        Not too long ago, former President Trump made significant       gains in lowering insulin costs for Americans. He initiated       the Part D Senior Savings Model a voluntary program which       allows beneficiaries to choose enhanced Part D plan options       that offer lower out-of-pocket costs for insulin. He also       signed an Executive Order that delivered inexpensive insulin       and epinephrine to lower income patients. Unfortunately,       President Biden delayed this Executive Order the day after he       took office in 2021 before rescinding it later that year.        Now, the Democrats are considering H.R. 6833 which is an       unserious attempt to lower the price of insulin. This bill       would exert price controls on private market insulin to cap       the costs paid by patients. H.R. 6833 takes us closer to       further pharmaceutical price-fixing, a policy contained the       Build Back Better plan. Price-fixing drugs leads to rationing       and shortages as evidenced in other countries who have       employed this policy. The Democrats' bill is estimated to       increase spending by about $11 billion, and the bill is paid       for by delaying the rebate rule for one year. This Trump-era       rule compels pharmacy benefit managers to share the rebates       they receive from drug manufacturers with Part D       beneficiaries to lower their out-of-pocket expenses.        The Affordable Insulin Now Act is an election year       messaging act on the part of Democrats. If they were serious       about lowering the cost of insulin, they would work with       Republicans on innovative programs like the Part D Senior       Savings Model, a program that is expanding with robust       participation by plan sponsors and offers predictable insulin       costs that do not exceed $35/month.        As an organization comprised of Americans who are age 55-      plus, controlling drug costs, especially insulin costs, is       paramount to maintaining a good quality of life for AMAC       members. H.R. 6833 is a step in the wrong direction for       lowering insulin prices and opens the door for further       government price-fixing and regulation.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Carlstrom,      President, AMAC Action,                                   ____                                                Council for Citizens                                        Against Government Waste,                                                     March 30, 2022,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: You will soon be considering H.R.       6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act. On behalf of the more       than one million members and supporters of the Council for       Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to       oppose H.R. 6833 and any other measure to institute price       controls in the medical marketplace.        In addition to imposing price controls, H.R. 6833 also       increases funding for the Medicare Improvement Fund by $9       billion and adds $1.5 million to the budget for the Centers       for Medicare and Medicaid Services to carry out the       provisions of the bill.        Historically, price controls like those contained in the       Affordable Insulin Now Act increase costs and lead to       shortages and rationing. H.R. 6833 will lead to increased       premiums for seniors and the 217 million Americans who rely       on private health insurance. The government has no business       setting prices on any good or service, especially not       healthcare. Price controls inherently distort the medical       marketplace and leave Americans worse off by significantly       decreasing future research and development.        Americans are already suffering under the highest inflation       in 40 years, and H.R. 6833 will increase this financial       hardship. The cost of medicines should be address without       instituting price controls or threatening future innovation.       I again urge you to oppose this legislation. All votes on       H.R. 6833 may be among those considered in CCAGW's 2022       Congressional Ratings.            Sincerely,      Tom Schatz.                                   ____                                                             NFIB,                                     Washington, DC, March 30, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of NFIB,       the nation's leading small business advocacy organization, I       write to express concern regarding H.R. 6833, the Affordable       Insulin Now Act.        This legislation has a laudable goal of attempting to make       insulin more affordable and accessible to Americans on       private and public health plans. Unfortunately, it will have       unintended consequences for small businesses and employees by       necessitating increased premiums while failing to address the       underlying issues that make insulin unaffordable in the first       place.        As studies have shown, a limited number of manufacturers,       patent evergreening, practices of pharmacy benefit managers       (PBMs), and other issues contribute to the high price of       insulin. H.R. 6833 does not address any of these problems and       instead seeks to solve consumer affordability by pushing       significant, additional costs onto employers and health plans       by limiting participant cost sharing.        For over 30 years, NFIB members have identified the cost of       health insurance as the number one small business problem       with 50 percent ranking it as a critical problem. Rising       health insurance premiums result in fewer small businesses       offering health insurance benefits. Since 2000, the average       costs of an employer-sponsored single coverage plan and an       employer-sponsored family plan have increased 149 percent and       18 percent, respectively. Unsurprisingly, facing these cost       pressures, the number of small businesses with fewer than 50       employees offering coverage has declined from 47.2 percent in       2000 to 31 percent in 2020. Many small employers that are       providing insurance have been forced to increase participant       cost-sharing and deductibles as the only means to counter       unsustainable premium increases and continue to offer       coverage. To that end, solutions to affordability that limit       cost-sharing without corresponding reforms will only serve to       increase premiums and further exacerbate the small business       affordability problem.        NFIB continues to advocate for affordable health insurance       for small businesses and all Americans. However, if the       system of employer sponsored health insurance is to endure in       the long-term, Congress must work together to address the       underlying cost drivers of the American healthcare system,       rather than shift additional cost burdens onto employers       seeking to offer health insurance to their employees.            Sincerely,                                                  Kevin Kuhlman,                                                     Vice President,      Federal Government Relations.                                   ____                                                     Partnership for                                     Employer-Sponsored Coverage,                                                     March 30, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The Partnership       for Employer-Sponsored coverage (P4ESC) writes to share our       strong concerns regarding H.R. 6833 the ``Affordable Insulin       Now Act.'' Although P4ESC shares the goal of lowering the       cost of insulin, we believe this bill will simply shift costs       back to employers and employees, including those who are       insulin dependent. A better and more direct solution that       addresses excessive profit taking by pharmaceutical       manufacturers and others, including pharmacy benefit       managers, in the pharmaceutical supply chain would be       preferable.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently found that       H.R. 6833 would increase the federal deficit by as much as       $11 billion over ten years and increase health insurance  [[Page H4040]]       premiums for all Americans. Indeed, there will not be any       curb on future insulin price increases paid by employers and       insurers. Every dollar of cost increase will be reflected in       ever higher health insurance premiums paid by all Americans,       whether privately insured or covered through Medicare. Better       approaches that increase competition among insulin       manufacturers, address regulatory problems and streamline the       supply chain will help reduce the cost of all prescription       drugs, including insulin.        The Partnership for Employer-Sponsored Coverage is an       advocacy alliance of employment-based organizations and trade       associations representing businesses of all sizes and the       more than 181 million American employees and their families       who rely on employer-sponsored coverage every day. We are       committed to working to ensure that employer-sponsored       coverage is strengthened and remains a viable, affordable       option for decades to come. We look forward to working with       you to ensure employer-sponsored coverage continues to       thrive.        We would welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues       with you or your staffs.            Sincerely,                                 Partnership for Employer-Sponsored      Coverage (P4ESC).                                   ____                                     The ERISA Industry Committee,                                     Washington, DC, March 29, 2022.        Dear Member of Congress: As the House prepares to vote on       the ``Affordable Insulin Now Act'' (H.R. 6833), The ERISA       Industry Committee (ERIC) writes to share opposition to this       legislation and urges members to vote ``NO'' when the bill is       called for a vote.        ERIC is a national nonprofit organization exclusively       representing the largest employers in the United States in       their capacity as sponsors of employee benefit plans for       their nationwide workforces. With member companies that are       leaders in every economic sector, ERIC is the voice of large       employer plan sponsors on federal, state, and local public       policies impacting their ability to sponsor benefit plans and       to lawfully operate under ERISA's protection from a patchwork       of different and conflicting state and local laws, in       addition to federal law.        ERIC member companies voluntarily offer comprehensive       health benefits to millions of active and retired workers and       their families across the country. Our members offer great       health benefits to attract and retain employees, be       competitive for human capital, and improve health and provide       peace of mind. On average, large employers pay around 75       percent of health care costs on behalf of 181 million       beneficiaries. As such, ERIC member companies have a       significant stake in, and deep commitment to, efforts to curb       unsustainable rising costs in the health care system.        Employers oppose H.R. 6833 because the bill imposes       government-mandated prices, shifts costs to patients, and       will not lower drug costs. The bill may in fact increase the       costs of insulin by creating a perverse incentive wherein       insulin manufacturers know that no matter how much they       increase prices, their customers will pay government-set       prices. This action will cause employers, insurers, and other       health insurance enrollees to pay more to offset these high       costs. This view is supported by the Congressional Budget       Office (CBO), which recently found that this policy would       increase the federal deficit by around $11 billion and       increase health insurance premiums for all Americans.        ERIC and our member companies support legislation that       would actually lower prescription drug costs, including for       insulin, rather than shift costs to employers and other       patients. Congress could achieve this by enacting policies       to:        Increase competition among insulin manufacturers;        Fix the regulatory problems that misclassify insulin and       fail to properly align market exclusivity and patent       protections to the drug; and        Address supply chain issues like rebates and bona fide       service fees that lead to formularies that do not reflect       value for patients.        Many of these proposals are already included in bipartisan       legislation that could be quickly passed and sent to the       President for his signature. They have been scored by CBO to       lower drug costs and health insurance premiums for all       Americans.        Because the ``Affordable Insulin Now Act'' fails to reduce       drug prices and raises health insurance costs for all, ERIC       urges members to vote NO, and oppose the passage of H.R.       6833. We look forward to working with Congress on productive,       effective, value-driven solutions to make prescription       drugs--including insulin--affordable for all Americans.            Sincerely,      James P. Gelfand.                                   ____                                                     FreedomWorks,                                                     March 30, 2022.          Key Vote NO on the Affordable Insulin Now Act, H.R. 6833         On behalf of FreedomWorks' activist community, I urge you       to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote NO       on the Affordable Insulin Now Act, H.R. 6833, introduced by       Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.). This legislation would impose       socialist price controls to cap the price of insulin at $35.        Currently, Americans are grappling with the harsh reality       of increased prices on everything from gas to groceries. We       see firsthand the consequences of modem monetary theory and       the devastation it brings. Unfortunately, the many Americans       that struggle with diabetes are no stranger to increased       prices. The cost of insulin has been steadily rising for       decades.        While progressives are all too eager to blame high prices       on ``corporate greed,'' the reality is that this is an issue       created by the federal government. Heavy-handed price       controls are a deeply flawed solution that misses the mark       when identifying the problem.        Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play a significant role in       the dramatic rise in the cost of prescription drugs. PBMs are       third-party administrators determining which drugs go on       formularies (a list of approved prescription drugs that       hospitals can prescribe and are covered under an insurance       policy). Ostensibly, PBMs negotiate to obtain the best price.       However, these ``savings'' are often pocketed by PBMs       themselves and aren't passed onto patients. Since they are       reimbursed based on the markdown from the original list       price, PBMs are incentivized to prioritize drugs with higher       list prices, so they can receive a larger markdown.        There are free-market alternatives to lower the cost of       insulin and healthcare in general. For example, it was       reported in an article in The Federalist, ``A consortium of       hospitals recently announced plans to build a factory that       can manufacture insulin within two years. Once their plant       gets up and running, the non-profit consortium said it would       sell the insulin at a cost of $30 a vial--a fraction of what       pharmaceutical companies currently charge.''        This legislation is a simplistic proposal to address a       highly complex problem. We cannot afford half-hearted       proposals based on unsound economics like this one for an       issue that impacts so many.        FreedomWorks will count the vote for H.R. 6833 on our 2022       Congressional Scorecard and reserves the right to score any       amendments, motions, or other related votes. The scorecard is       used to determine eligibility for the FreedomFighter Award,       which recognizes Members of the House and Senate who       consistently vote to support economic freedom and individual       liberty.            Sincerely,                                                      Adam Brandon,      President, FreedomWorks.                                   ____                           National Taxpayers Union         As the calendar turns to April, the U.S. House of       Representatives is planning to vote on legislation that would       cap insulin costs for all Americans who are privately insured       or on Medicare Part D at no more than $35 per month in out-      of-pocket payments. While the bill's sponsors may have good       intentions, and while Congress can certainly act to provide       support for Americans facing high prescription drug costs,       NTU has several concerns about the impact the ``Affordable       Insulin Now Act'' will have on America's taxpayers and       broader health care system.        The legislation would impose new cost-sharing limits on       insulin for almost all privately insured Americans, and would       extend these limitations to the tens of millions of Americans       on Medicare Part D. According to a Congressional Budget       Office (CBO) cost estimate, the bill's requirements would       cost federal taxpayers around $11 billion ($6.6 billion in       higher spending and $4.8 billion in reduced revenues). It is       likely this cost estimate is due to anticipated higher       premiums in both Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act       individual marketplace. In these programs, higher premiums       usually mean higher federal subsidies for health coverage       that are paid for by taxpayers.        Indeed, proponents of the legislation have not properly       addressed the impact this legislation would have on premiums       in both Part D and the private marketplace. The Affordable       Insulin Now Act puts a cap on the out-of-pocket costs owed by       insured enrollees for insulin products, but it does not       ultimately change the price of insulin paid for by health       insurers. If insurers face higher costs for covering these       drugs, they will likely be forced to pass those costs on to       customers in the form of higher premiums or higher cost-      sharing on other health products and services. And, as noted       above, some higher premiums will result in higher costs for       taxpayers, who bear some of the burden for covering seniors       under Part D and low- and middle-income Americans on the ACA       marketplace.        Perhaps the most troubling part of the legislation, though,       is the proposed offset for the cost of the legislation. House       Democratic leadership is proposing to `pay for' the       legislation's $11 billion cost with a shameless budget       gimmick that NTU and NTU Foundation have called out before:       delaying a Trump administration ``rebate'' regulation that       was projected to raise federal government costs but was never       likely to be implemented in the first place.        As NTU wrote in July of last year, when a bipartisan group       of lawmakers proposed using rebate rule delay as a pay-for in       the major infrastructure bill:        ``This phantom $49 billion ``pay for'' was called       ``Washington at its worst'' by one health industry lobbyist       speaking to The Washington Post. In short, the Biden       administration has delayed until 2023 a Trump administration       regulation that would change how prescription drug discounts       are handled by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).       Because the Congressional Budget Office projected that the       so-called rebate rule would increase federal spending in       Medicare and Medicaid by about $177 billion over  [[Page H4041]]       a decade, due to a rise in Medicare premiums (and therefore,       taxpayer-funded subsidies for Medicare premiums), lawmakers       get to count a further delay in the rule (beyond the Biden       administration's one-year delay) as ``savings'' for the       federal government. Reports indicate Congressional Democrats       may use additional phantom ``savings'' from the rebate rule       in their larger reconciliation bill by repealing the rebate       rule entirely.        . . . This rule has never been implemented, and there's no       clear indication that the Biden administration would have       followed through on implementing the regulation even after       their one-year delay. And even if the Biden administration       had implemented the rule, there's little clarity as to       whether the rebate rule would have actually cost federal       taxpayers over $177 billion over the decade. In short,       delaying the rebate rule does not present real, tangible       savings to taxpayers, like a reduction in federal spending       would.''        Unfortunately, it seems like the rebate rule is becoming       yet another tried-and-true budget gimmick that Congress dips       into again and again, in order to appear as if they are       paying for new spending. And according to the CBO estimate       cited above, because the rebate rule is projected to offer       $20 billion in phantom savings--not just the $11 billion       needed to cover the insulin bill's costs--the revised insulin       legislation proposes spending another $9 billion on a broad-      based Medicare Improvement Fund. That means $9 billion more       will ultimately be spent without real offsets and, in our       view, be paid for by taxpayers in the long run with higher       debt and deficits.        To be clear, high out-of-pocket costs for insulin are a       real issue for many Americans. NTU continues to support       several bipartisan and meaningful proposals that would       provide relief for many Americans, including:        An out-of-pocket cap in Medicare Part D, along with Part D       benefit redesign that would actually save taxpayers money in       the long run;        An ongoing Medicare insulin model that represents a public-      private partnership between the federal government, insurers,       and drug manufacturers that has the potential to meaningfully       reduce out-of-pocket insulin costs for up to millions of       seniors on Part D; and        Allowing Part D enrollees to spread their out-of-pocket       burdens over the 12 months of a plan year, rather than having       to owe major bills in the first or second months of a new       plan year.        This legislation could undermine the ongoing Medicare       insulin model, Part D redesign efforts, and reported       bipartisan work in the Senate to provide insulin cost relief       for American patients who are struggling. The House should go       back to the drawing board and focus on more bipartisan       opportunities.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), who is an  expert in health policy.    Madam Speaker, it is interesting listening to  the debate here. Certainly my colleague, Mr. Doggett, I think very  appropriately pointed out:         This bill does not lower the price of insulin by one penny.       It just simply shifts around who pays for what.    We have seen that pattern in healthcare across America for some time  now, and I would hope that we could learn from that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   Madam Speaker, I think that this discussion that we are having here  today is important. I also believe that we need to work together on  solutions to actually reduce the cost of insulin, again, not just  shifting around who pays for what. But certainly I am willing to give  my colleague on the other side more information about the information  Mr. Schweikert was sharing. He is very knowledgeable on the subject. He  certainly works with his constituents a lot, constituents in need. And  we know that literally millions of people across America are in need  for lower-cost insulin. We owe them, I think, a much better approach  than just simple government intrusion and more government involvement  shifting around the cost.                                time  1515    I was a bit alarmed earlier when I heard that we should maybe make  Medicare prescription coverage more like the VA. We need to remember  that the VA offers roughly 50 percent of the options for participants  compared to Medicare. I don't think we want to reduce the choices that  seniors would have with their formularies within Medicare part D. If  anything, we should make sure they have more choices. We know that more  choices in the marketplace bring down the price, and we need to focus  in that direction.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. We owe the American  people a diligent effort, working together to truly reduce the cost of  insulin.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the motion  to instruct conferees. I welcome this opportunity to reconcile the  differences between the House and the Senate bills. This is an  opportunity to finally hold China accountable, and I hope we get to  a strong work product that we can be proud of.    The House version of this bill, the COMPETES Act, truly is a  nonstarter for House Republicans--no surprise--for both sides of the  Senate as well, and actually for the American people--and that is my  concern.   While it was messaged as legislation to combat the Chinese Communist  Party's predatory practices, the trade provisions in the House bill did  little to level the playing field with China, adding hurdles that would  hurt American consumers and small businesses.   Instead, that bill actually discourages work during a workforce  shortage by expanding and delinking the trade adjustment assistance  from new trade opportunities. It adds red tape and narrows eligibility  of trade programs like GSP and MTB. These are relief measures that we  know help small businesses and manufacturers in the marketplace. The  bill also exacerbates our supply chain crisis by making unvetted  changes to de minimus; and it also fails to address the  administration's lackluster effort to compete with China in the Indo- Pacific and around the world.   The Senate's bipartisan approach, while imperfect, addresses China,  promotes small businesses of all sizes across our country, and more  than anything, it empowers American consumers right here at home.                                time  1645    It offers a clean renewal of MTB, retroactively extends GSP, mandates  a section 301 exclusion process with retroactivity, and does not  include the Green New Deal wish list.   Let's work together on a final product that actually holds China  accountable.   Madam Speaker, I reiterate my support and certainly urge my  colleagues to do the same.
