 Mr. Speaker, in the immediate aftermath of the  horrific October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, I co- sponsored H. Res. 771 in solidarity with the people of Israel. The  resolution was intended to send an immediate message of bipartisan  support. Unfortunately, Republican dysfunction (inability to elect a  speaker of the House) prevented the resolution from moving to the floor  for nearly three weeks.   In the interim, as the conflict deepened, my Republican colleagues  refused to update the text of the resolution to reference the  humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the civilian casualties in both Israel  and Gaza. While I support many of the goals of this resolution,  Congress must recognize that the suffering from this war is not one- sided.   As I will vote present on this resolution, I hope that Congress can  put partisanship aside, helping Israel and pushing Hamas to work toward  an immediate ceasefire--or, at minimum, a temporary cessation of  hostilities to protect civilians, transport humanitarian aid, and  secure the safe return of all hostages.
