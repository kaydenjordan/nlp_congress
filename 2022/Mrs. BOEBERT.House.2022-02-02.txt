 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of my friend,  Tom Kilduff.   Tom was a man of grit and glory, whose great sense of humor and love  for America will be greatly missed. Tom gave so much to his country,  most notably his service in the Marine Corps. Tom once told me that the  Army told him to be all that he could be, so he became a marine.   Tom completed three tours in Vietnam where he distinguished himself  as a man of valor, sacrifice, and also a really great shot, earning the  USMC Rifle Expert Shooter's Badge and Pistol Sharpshooter Badge, the  Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. Upon returning home, he married his  wife, Jeannie, and raised three beautiful daughters and had seven  grandchildren.   Meeker, Colorado, is a better place because of Tom. We will surely  miss his love of country, passion for the great outdoors, hanging out  at Meeker's coffee shop--or the Shell gas station, as others may call  it--and, of course, seeing him along with his precious dog, Sarge,  following close behind.   Semper fi, Tom.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. I thank him for leading on this  issue and thank him for putting together a hearing yesterday so we  could hear from people who are on the ground at the southern border.   It was so difficult to look these Border Patrol agents in the eye and  hear their frustration, to hear their hearts cry, to say that they feel  useless in their capacity, in their jobs. They said that they used to  work all day and go home feeling like they had accomplished something.  But since Biden took office, that is no longer the case. Since January  20, when the so-called President of the United States canceled  construction of the border wall, since then these men and women have  felt like they are not providing a service to the American people.   When I was talking with these agents, one thing that they said was,  This isn't a resource issue. We aren't here to ask for more money. We  aren't here to ask for more personnel or more infrastructure. We just  need policy. Policy solves this. Returning to the Trump-era policies  solves this. Canceling construction of a border wall and still  continuing to pay out Federal contracts, $5 million each day, is not  solving this problem.   Nearly 2 million illegal aliens coming into our country, and that is  not even counting the hundreds of thousands of got-aways that are not  included in that number.   Madam Speaker, I understand that this is a Special Order, but I think  it would do you and your party a service if you would lift your head  and pay attention to what is being said on the House floor of the  United States of Representatives. Maybe that is too much trouble to ask  of you, Madam Speaker, but we are here talking about real issues that  are impacting America and you still continue to sit and ignore what I  am saying.   I think that is very reflective of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle who have ignored what is going on at the southern border, who  have ignored the children who are being trafficked by cartels, who have  enriched the cartels, who have smuggled enough fentanyl to kill every  American at least seven times over.   Madam Speaker, this should concern you. As a mother of four boys,  this certainly concerns me, and all we need to do is implement policy  to secure the southern border, allow our Border Patrol agents to do  their jobs, have someone in the White House who will faithfully execute  the law and uphold it. We are here to hold people accountable who are  not doing those things.   Madam Speaker, let the Record show that you still have not glanced up  one time to acknowledge this humanitarian crisis that is taking place  in our country.   Chairman Perry, I thank you so much for yielding on this issue.
