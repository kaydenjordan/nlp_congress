 Mr. Speaker, as we enter the hurricane season, I would  like to recognize those within the building and code enforcement  community for the work they do to maintain the resilience of our homes  and commercial buildings.   The International Code Council has established a building safety  campaign that is recognized annually by jurisdictions across the  Nation. Its purpose is to reinforce the need for the adoption of modern  building codes; a strong system of code compliance; and a well-trained,  professional workforce to provide public safety.   In the 10 years since Florida adopted the statewide building code  under Governor Bush--I was in the legislature at the time; he showed  great leadership--the code's adoption and application reduced windstorm  actual losses by as much as 72 percent.   Year after year, we see the type of devastation that Mother Nature  can bring, and it is important we are doing all that we can to minimize  its damage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Vice Chairman.   Mr. Speaker, we have all heard the upsetting statistic of 21 veterans  committing suicide each and every day. It is unacceptable. This is a  crisis for our veterans, their families, the future of our current  servicemembers, and our country.   As vice chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have worked to  make it a better and healthier life for our true American heroes. That  is why I am proud to support H.R. 2345, the National Suicide Hotline  Improvement Act.   When a veteran is in crisis, they need immediate assistance from the  Veterans Crisis Hotline. Unfortunately, the current suicide hotline  number can be difficult to remember during a time of need and can add  minutes to getting help or, even worse, discourage veterans from  accessing this important service.   H.R. 2345 would study the feasibility and need of a three-digit  dialing code, similar to 911, for the suicide hotline. The bill also  studies the effectiveness of the hotline for our Nation's veterans.   This study is an important step in recognizing suicidal thoughts as  an emergency, providing those in need the most reliable tools to get  help, and continuing to improve a hotline that has already saved  countless lives, including many veterans.   For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2345 and support its  passage.    Mr. Speaker, as members of the Communications and  Technology Subcommittee, we have heard of the impact pirate radio  operators have had on the authorized radio community.   There have also been instances in which emergency service  communications have been hindered because of their illegal operators,  including off the Gulf Coast of Florida. In Florida, we have worked  closely with local law enforcement to identify and shut down pirate  radio operators, as well as confiscate their equipment.   However, I have heard from the Federal Communications Commission  countless times that, on a Federal level, there is limited authority to  crack down on these operators and prevent their reestablishment. The  PIRATE Act will help give teeth to FCC enforcement of illegal radio  operators.   By hitting them in their pocketbook, the FCC can better stop these  illegal actors for good. The recent success we have had in Florida  proves the need for stronger penalties on these bad actors.   The PIRATE Act will help give teeth to the FCC enforcement of illegal  radio operators. For this reason, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 5709,  and I support its passage.
