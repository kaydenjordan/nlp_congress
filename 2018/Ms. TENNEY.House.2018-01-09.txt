 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day.   Law enforcement officers courageously put their lives on the line to  protect our homes, our businesses, and our schools. They are truly the  unsung heroes of our communities. We are grateful to the men and women  in blue who service the front line of defense here at home.   Today and every day, we must stand with our members of law  enforcement and their families to honor the sacrifices and the  contributions they make to ensure that our families remain safe.   I also especially thank the United States Capitol Police force, who  work each day to ensure that Members, staff, and visitors to the  Nation's Capital are safe and secure.   Let us not forget to honor the service and sacrifice of all who serve  in law enforcement, especially in New York State: our New York State  Police, the New York State Park Police, county, city, and village  police forces, and, of course, corrections officers throughout the  great State of New York.                            ____________________
