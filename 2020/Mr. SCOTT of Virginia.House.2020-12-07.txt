 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise in support of S. 461, as amended, the HBCU PARTNERS Act.   Since their inception, HBCUs have been engines of social mobility and  a cornerstone of secondary education for underserved students,  particularly Black students from low-income backgrounds.   Today, HBCUs account for no more than 3 percent of all colleges and  universities in the country, yet these institutions, as we have heard,  produce nearly 20 percent of all Black undergraduates, half of all  Black professionals, and one-third of all Black STEM degree earners.   Despite this outsized role in expanding access to higher education,  HBCUs continue to be underresourced compared to other institutions of  higher learning.   This historic lack of support is being further exacerbated by the  COVID-19 pandemic, as HBCUs disproportionately suffer from dramatically  lower enrollment and State funding.   Mr. Speaker, there is simply no better time to support these critical  institutions than by passing this legislation before us today.   The HBCUs PARTNERS Act would ensure that our Federal agencies  actively work with HBCUs to advance their critical mission of opening  the door to higher education for students across the country.   This bipartisan bill demonstrates that regardless of political  affiliation, we can all agree that during this dark hour in our higher  education system, our Nation's HBCUs are an investment worth making.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams),  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), and the entire bipartisan HBCU Caucus for  their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
