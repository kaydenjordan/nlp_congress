 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an  urgent issue in upstate New York. Lyme and tick-borne diseases are  deeply prevalent in my district, New York 19, and across the country.   From 2007 to 2017, Lyme disease cases rose by 78 percent in my  district. Approximately half of adult deer ticks in the State carry the  bacteria that causes Lyme disease. We should be doing all we can to  address this and invest in more effective ways to both diagnose and  treat this disease.   That is why this week, I, along with fellow members of the bipartisan  Lyme Disease Caucus, introduced legislation to supplement  congressionally appropriated funding for research with the Stamp Out  Lyme Disease Act. Our bill would create a postage stamp to raise  awareness about the disease and directly support medical research to  treat and cure tick-borne illnesses.   I urge the House to take up this legislation and move us closer to a  cure.                            ____________________
