 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Retaining Educators Takes       Added Investment Now Act'' or the ``RETAIN Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to create a refundable tax       credit for early childhood educators, teachers, early       childhood education program directors, school leaders, and       school-based mental health services providers in early       childhood, elementary, and secondary education settings that       rewards retention based on the time spent serving high-need       students.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The shortage of experienced, qualified early childhood       educators and elementary school and secondary school teachers       is a national problem that compromises the academic outcomes       and long-term success of students.        (2) The shortage is the result of many factors including       low pay, frequent turnover in school leadership, poor       teaching conditions, and inadequate teacher supports.        (3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty areas where the       factors contributing to the shortage are particularly acute       and have an increased negative impact on teachers of color       remaining in the field.        (4) A child's access to high-quality early childhood       education is critical to supporting positive outcomes, and       early childhood educators--        (A) play an important role in setting the foundation for       future learning, and        (B) promote the development of vital skills, habits, and       mindsets that children need to be successful in school and in       life.        (5) In 2021, the national median pay of early childhood       educators was a mere $30,210, with many early childhood       educators relying on government assistance programs such as       Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assistance program       established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7       U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy       families program established under part A of title IV of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and struggling       to provide for their own families.        (6) Studies have demonstrated that well-qualified,       experienced teachers are the single most important school-      based element contributing to a child's academic achievement       and success.        (7) In the 2021-2022 academic year, the average teacher       salary in public elementary schools and secondary schools was       only $66,397, a 2 percent increase from the previous academic       year. When adjusted for inflation, the average teacher salary       has declined by 6.4 percent over the past decade.        (8) On average, public elementary school and secondary       school teachers were paid 23.5 percent less than other       college graduates working in non-teaching fields, and many       teachers struggle with large amounts of student loan debt.        (9) In 2021, the average teacher salary for a first-year       teacher in a public elementary school or secondary school was       $41,770.        (10) An experienced, well-qualified education workforce       must also be reflective of the diversity of the student body       across race, ethnicity, and disability.        (11) Higher pay for teachers can result in a more diverse       teacher workforce, and minority students often perform better       on standardized tests, have improved attendance, and are       suspended less frequently when they have at least one same-      race teacher.        (12) Experienced, well-qualified school leaders and school-      based mental health service providers are essential for       providing strong educational opportunities and services for       students and promoting teacher retention through improved       professional supports and teaching conditions.        (13) Between February 2020 and May 2022, at least 300,000       teachers at public elementary schools and secondary schools       left the field, a nearly 3 percent decline in the teacher       workforce.

A bill to provide for advancements in carbon removal  research, quantification, and commercialization, including by  harnessing natural processes, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Retaining Educators Takes       Added Investment Now Act'' or the ``RETAIN Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to create a refundable tax       credit for early childhood educators, teachers, early       childhood education program directors, school leaders, and       school-based mental health services providers in early       childhood, elementary, and secondary education settings that       rewards retention based on the time spent serving high-need       students.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The shortage of experienced, qualified early childhood       educators and elementary school and secondary school teachers       is a national problem that compromises the academic outcomes       and long-term success of students.        (2) The shortage is the result of many factors including       low pay, frequent turnover in school leadership, poor       teaching conditions, and inadequate teacher supports.        (3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty areas where the       factors contributing to the shortage are particularly acute       and have an increased negative impact on teachers of color       remaining in the field.        (4) A child's access to high-quality early childhood       education is critical to supporting positive outcomes, and       early childhood educators--        (A) play an important role in setting the foundation for       future learning, and        (B) promote the development of vital skills, habits, and       mindsets that children need to be successful in school and in       life.        (5) In 2021, the national median pay of early childhood       educators was a mere $30,210, with many early childhood       educators relying on government assistance programs such as       Medicaid, the supplemental nutrition assistance program       established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7       U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy       families program established under part A of title IV of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and struggling       to provide for their own families.        (6) Studies have demonstrated that well-qualified,       experienced teachers are the single most important school-      based element contributing to a child's academic achievement       and success.        (7) In the 2021-2022 academic year, the average teacher       salary in public elementary schools and secondary schools was       only $66,397, a 2 percent increase from the previous academic       year. When adjusted for inflation, the average teacher salary       has declined by 6.4 percent over the past decade.        (8) On average, public elementary school and secondary       school teachers were paid 23.5 percent less than other       college graduates working in non-teaching fields, and many       teachers struggle with large amounts of student loan debt.        (9) In 2021, the average teacher salary for a first-year       teacher in a public elementary school or secondary school was       $41,770.        (10) An experienced, well-qualified education workforce       must also be reflective of the diversity of the student body       across race, ethnicity, and disability.        (11) Higher pay for teachers can result in a more diverse       teacher workforce, and minority students often perform better       on standardized tests, have improved attendance, and are       suspended less frequently when they have at least one same-      race teacher.        (12) Experienced, well-qualified school leaders and school-      based mental health service providers are essential for       providing strong educational opportunities and services for       students and promoting teacher retention through improved       professional supports and teaching conditions.        (13) Between February 2020 and May 2022, at least 300,000       teachers at public elementary schools and secondary schools       left the field, a nearly 3 percent decline in the teacher       workforce.
