 Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day, a tragic day, as we  witness the horrific images that are coming out of Ukraine.   I was there just 4\1/2\ short weeks ago. I met with President  Zelensky. I listened to the people on the streets of Kyiv. President  Zelensky is a lion of a leader. He has displayed courage to the West.  When he said, ``I don't need a ride, I need ammunition,'' I think that  all of us should look at that, we should listen to that. The time to  act is now. We don't have time to wait. Now is the time to act to help  our Ukrainian partners. He didn't ask for troops inside Ukraine. He is  asking for help.   I hope that we will put Midland over Moscow, as the President last  night in this Chamber said that it is time to buy American product.  Energy security is national security, and that is absolutely what this  body should be doing is putting our own energy security into the hands  of our partners and allies so that they can defend and deter against  the malign influence of Vladimir Putin.   Our heart and our prayers go out to the people of Ukraine, and our  thanks to President Zelensky for his leadership.
