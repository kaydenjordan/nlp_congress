 Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the  time in opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I have  supported it in the past. And as Mr. Emmer just mentioned, the House  has supported it in the past in each of the last 2 years.   I admire the persistence of the gentleman from Massachusetts in  pursuing this issue. I think it is the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to convince our colleagues  across the Capitol or the Pentagon to do this. I know of no opposition  to the amendment.   I think the House should continue to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Roskam).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, neither do I have other speakers on  this en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I inform my friend from Washington I  have no speakers on this en bloc package, and I reserve the balance of  my time.  [[Page H5855]]         Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I fully agree with the gentleman from Washington when  he expresses his appreciation to the members of our committee. Each one  of the 62 members of our committee has contributed to the bill that is  here before us today and, as the Chair knows, we have had more  amendments considered over the last 3 days than ever before for a  National Defense Authorization bill. So Members of the whole body have  contributed in many ways.  [[Page H5860]]    I also agree with the gentleman that our staff on both sides of the  aisle, led by Jenness Simler and Paul Arcangeli, have done a terrific  job in helping to manage this process and to shape and guide what has  been historic levels of interest by Members on particular provisions.   Mr. Chairman, I think that you would find among our committee  virtually, if not unanimous, agreement on two points. One is we live in  an increasingly dangerous world. The second one is we have done deep  damage to our military because of the budgets cuts, the continuing  resolutions, the erratic nature of funding over the last few years.   Certainly, the members of our committee who go out and actually talk  to the people who serve have heard, seen, witnessed firsthand airplanes  that can't fly, ships that can't sail, training that has not gone on,  movers--we are trying to save money for the military, so we are hiring  cut-rate movers, and members of the military are experiencing  incredible damage to their household goods as they are shuffled about  from place to place involuntarily. Sometimes there are movers with  criminal records who can't actually get on the military base they are  supposed to be delivering to. I mean, just example after example of how  these cuts have affected the men and women who serve.   And as Secretary Mattis says, the only reason we are doing so well  around the world is because they have sucked it up and borne the  burden. Deep damage that this bill starts to reverse.   I appreciate all the Members who support fixing our planes, getting  the training, having ships that sail, better missile defense, all the  things that are in this bill.   I am not going to engage in a detailed discussion about the budget.  The gentleman and I discuss this frequently.   I would just say, Mr. Chairman, I believe the first obligation of the  Federal Government is to defend the country. Article I, section 8 says  that Congress has the power and the responsibility to raise and support  armies, provide and maintain navies, provide the rules and regulations  for the military forces of the United States. That is our job, and I  think that is our first job.   So I agree that some of the cuts that have been proposed in other  domestic programs, discretionary programs, are inappropriate, and we  ought to evaluate each of them on their merits. And that continues to  be my point when it comes to defense.   We evaluate our obligations to the country and to the men and women  who serve, based on the merits of this argument. We don't tie it to  other domestic programs. We do not say we are only going to increase  defense to fix our planes if we can increase the EPA an equal amount.  We don't tie it to other things.   The obligations to the men and women who risk their lives stand on  their own, and that, at least in my view, is our first obligation.   Now, when we start talking about budgets, we get into all sorts of  conversations about how mandatory spending is really where more than  two-thirds of the budget is; how that is what has been growing; how  defense is down to about 16 percent of the budget, and as it has been  shrinking, the deficit has been going up. Obviously, defense is not the  cause when it comes to deficits.   We can also, when we talk about tax, start talking about economic  growth and this lackluster growth that the economy has suffered, at  least over the last 8 years, and the need to get things going to help  with the deficit.   Lots of issues to discuss, but the issue before us today is how we  fulfill our responsibilities to the men and women who serve and to the  country that is relying on us to protect them from missiles, to help  protect them from terrorist attacks, to support the men and women who  are actually performing those missions.   I think this bill advances that cause. A number of Members on both  sides of the aisle have contributed to it. I think and hope it deserves  the support of most all Members of the House, and I urge support for  this en bloc package.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the  gentlewoman from New York and her efforts to represent her district,  her people, and try to make life better. It kind of relates to some of  the conversations Mr. Smith and I were just having about tax policy,  about industrial policy, about regulations, about how we have, in this  country, become less competitive internationally than we should.   However, I must oppose this amendment because the bottom line is that  it is not a matter of national security where the DOD buys its knives,  forks, and spoons.                                time  1030    If Members needed further evidence of the wide range of issues which  we deal with in the National Defense Authorization Act, this bill is a  key example.   I think the gentlewoman accurately described the history. The Berry  amendment was passed in 1940 to make sure that food and textiles were  procured from the United States to support our military efforts.   In the 1970s, they put in a specialty metals provision, and attached  to that was a comma that said ``including flatware.'' So then it turned  out there wasn't anybody here at home that made flatware because of  these international competitive issues, and DOD came to us more than a  decade ago and said, ``Would you please get rid of that portion of the  Berry amendment?'' and we did.   Now the question is: Are we going to start adding back specific sorts  of items which DOD may buy and say you can only buy it from one place,  whether or not it is critical to our country's national security?   Now, the gentlewoman mentioned that GSA is buying some spoons and  knives and so forth from this manufacturer, and that is great. If we  do, I hope that happens, and I hope more jobs come to her district. But  to put into Federal law that the only place the Department of Defense  can buy its knives and forks and spoons is from this one company, I  think, starts to get us into micromanagement of industries and takes us  away from the focus of this bill, which should be the troops, what is  the best thing for them.   So with all my admiration for the gentlewoman, I oppose this  amendment. We cannot go down the road of adding category after category  after category of items to help our districts at the expense of our  troops and the best use of dollars when it is not a matter of vital  national security. I just don't think that the knives and forks we use  qualify as vital national security.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this is a procedural motion that, in my  view, should be rejected.   We could spend all day and night arguing provisions that prohibit  what is not in the bill. There is nothing in this bill that authorizes  a border wall. The focus of the bill is the men and women who serve our  Nation in the military and the national security of the United States.  And that is what I want to take a moment to talk about.   I would suggest that all of us think back just to the events of the  last 10 days. On July 4, North Korea launched what most observers  believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching  parts of the United States. And we know they already have nuclear  weapons.   On July 9, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi went into Mosul to celebrate  the ousting of ISIS with U.S. advisers, U.S. airpower, and U.S.  intelligence.   Also, this week, the Chinese navy conducted drills in the  Mediterranean on their way to conduct joint exercises with the Russians  in the Balkans.   This is just a taste of the world we live in, and there are  provisions in this bill that address every one of these incidents, from  more missile defense to getting more ships in the water faster and  cheaper, to supporting our efforts against ISIS, al-Qaida, and  terrorist groups.    But there is another event this week that I hope we all keep in mind.  On Monday, July 10, a KC-130 crashed on its way across the country,  resulting in the death of 15 marines and one sailor. We do not know  what caused this crash, but the early evidence indicates that there was  a catastrophic failure when it was cruising at altitude.   It will be fully investigated. But in the meantime, I think we always  have to remember that, even on routine training missions, even on  routine deployments, the men and women who serve are risking their  lives for us. We owe them the best equipment, in the best shape, with  the best training that our Nation can provide. Unfortunately, that is  not what they have been getting.   This year, our committee has heard testimony that, under the budget  caps, the Army is outranged, outgunned, and outdated. More than half  the Navy aircraft cannot fly. More than half the planes in the Air  Force qualify for an antique license in the State of Virginia. More  than half the planes the Navy has can't fly. Unfortunately, accident  rates are going up.   Sometimes I have heard the argument that: Well, we are not going to  give them any more money until they can pass an audit or they can do  this and that or the other thing.   But as everybody rushes out to get on their airplanes, just think  about this: What if the board of directors of your airline decided that  they are not going to spend any more money repairing planes until there  is a bookkeeping problem solved in headquarters?   Yet that is exactly what we have been doing to our military. We have  not been giving them the planes and other equipment in good repair.   Every year for 55 straight years, Congresses and Presidents of both  parties have passed into law a National Defense Authorization Act.  There is a lot of credit to go around, including the Members on both  sides of this aisle who have contributed to this product. I am very  grateful for what they have done. But what I am really grateful for are  the men and women who serve and inspire us, the men and women who are  counting on us.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say, whatever our differences on other  issues, which we will have time to debate in another time and place,  whatever our differences about what is in or not in this bill, we need  to put those differences aside and continue to support the men and  women who serve and defend us. Let's not let them down.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the  engrossment of H.R. 2810, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, and cross-references, and to make such other  technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect the  actions of the House in amending the bill, and that the instruction in  amendment No. 35 printed in House Report 115-217 be changed from page  125 to page 121, and that the instruction in amendment No. 1 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212 be changed from page 569, line 12, to  page 569, line 14.
