 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind Congress that small  businesses and consumers all over the country are feeling the  repercussions of President Biden's spending spree.   It is very simple: President Biden's so-called rescue plan has  directly caused a crisis we are seeing on the farm and on Main Street.  Injecting $1.9 trillion of government spending into the economy without  a clear plan for execution has increased costs and disrupted the supply  chain.   All government spending must be paid for somehow, and Americans are  paying for it with inflation. Since February 2020, the amount of money  in the economy has grown by over 26 percent, so it should come as no  surprise that Americans are experiencing the highest price increases  since the Great Recession. Consumer prices for used cars and trucks  have risen by more than 24 percent, and costs have increased 11.2  percent for furniture, 9.6 percent for household appliances, 6 percent  for utilities, and 5.6 percent for clothing.   President Biden promised to raise taxes only on wealthy Americans,  but these price increases happening under his direction are a tax on  every American. Inflation-adjusted wages are down nearly 2 percent  since President Biden took office, and with the Democrats planning to  continue their reckless tax-and-spend habits, American families can  expect the cost of living to keep going up.   As if rising costs weren't enough, this administration's so-called  rescue plan has created a labor shortage that is weakening our supply  chain and leaving manufacturers and business owners high and dry.   Earlier this month, I hosted a manufacturing tour across my district  in Kansas, where I visited small businesses that produce and sell  products like highway signs, car accessories, and industrial valves.  These businesses are the driving forces in their communities, but the  leaders who run them all painted the same bleak picture: Vendor costs  are rising; labor is hard to come by; and a weakened supply chain is  slowing everything down.   The Grasshopper Company in Moundridge, Kansas, builds and sells  mowers and landscaping tools, the same ones used by the White House  groundskeepers. Grasshopper is facing longer lead times on vendor items  than they have ever seen, and the prices on raw materials like steel  seem to be rising daily. To meet their customer demand on time,  Grasshopper had to pay an extra $28,000 air freight fee. Back in July,  Grasshopper's disrupted supply chain and increased cost of doing  business forced them to raise the price of their goods midseason,  something they have not had to do since the Carter administration.   Another manufacturing company in my district told me that the supply  chain backlog has made it impossible to plan for their future. Their  suppliers are telling them that essential inputs like electronic  components will now take at least 5 to 6 months before they even ship.  Before this year, they never had to wait longer than 4 weeks.   Sadly, these are just two examples from Kansas' Big First District.  Small businesses all over the country are being forced to raise their  costs due to supply chain issues, inflation impacting their own inputs,  labor shortages, or all the above.   To get inflation under control, strengthen the supply chain, and stop  consumer costs from rising even further, we need to get Americans back  to work, stop the vaccine mandate, quit recklessly printing money, and  end the spending addiction here in Washington.        Securing Release and Return of American Missionaries in Haiti     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express the urgent need for  the Biden administration to secure the release and return of the 17  American missionaries taken captive in Haiti by a street gang known for  mass kidnapping of religious groups.   I cannot imagine the terror they are experiencing in this very moment  as we speak. We cannot sit idly by while they fear for their lives.   For decades, the United States has invested in developing Haiti  through  [[Page H5686]]  government aid and nongovernment organizations like Christian Aid  Ministries. I urge President Biden and this administration to leverage  our relationship with the Haitian Government to secure the safe return  of every member of this group.   The captivity of Americans, whether in Port-au-Prince, Kabul, or  anywhere else, is an international crisis. President Biden's actions in  this moment are assuredly being watched by those who would not hesitate  to do our country harm and could have longstanding repercussions for  Americans practicing their faith across the globe.   The United States must be clear: If you capture our citizens, our  government will respond swiftly and decisively.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman  from Kansas, for this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Father Emil Kapaun,  a man of God who served the Lord and his country in both World War II  and the Korean war.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2044 to designate the facility  of the United States Postal Service located at 17 East Main Street in  Herington, Kansas, as the Captain Emil J. Kapaun Post Office Building.   In March of this year, Father Kapaun's remains were finally  identified in Hawaii, and just last month, they were brought back to  his hometown of Pilsen, Kansas, which lies in my district, the Big  First District of Kansas.   Father Kapaun grew up on a farm, became a priest in 1940 at 24 years  old, and became a U.S. military chaplain 4 years later. Father Kapaun  received a Bronze Star for valor during the Korean war in 1950 when, in  the heat of battle, he rushed to the front lines to retrieve a wounded  soldier under heavy machine-gun fire, saving that soldier's life with  complete disregard for his own safety.   He also received the Distinguished Service Cross, which was upgraded  to the Medal of Honor in 2013 for another heroic effort in battle that  same year. Father Kapaun rescued nearly 40 wounded comrades from no- man's-land; disregarded an order to evacuate, choosing to stay with the  wounded even though it meant his own capture; and pushed aside an enemy  soldier who was about to execute a member of his own battalion.   He was put in a POW camp, where he gave away his own food and dug  latrines before dying a year later. He was a great man, a servant of  all who followed Jesus who said: ``Greater love hath no man than this,  that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   Father Kapaun is on his way to sainthood in the Roman Catholic  Church. I have introduced a resolution in his honor and today urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my bill, which would rename the postal  facility in Herington, Kansas, after him.   My prayers are with his family members as they celebrate his life of  service, and it is an honor to praise his faithfulness and bravery in  this Chamber today.
