 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4566) to accelerate  [[Page H9365]]  the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the  relief of the families of victims of the mass shooting in Virginia  Beach, Virginia, on May 31, 2019.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4566         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Virginia Beach Strong Act''.       SEC. 2. SPECIAL RULES FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FOR RELIEF OF THE                     FAMILIES OF THE MASS SHOOTING IN VIRGINIA                     BEACH.         (a) Clarification That Contribution Will Not Fail To       Qualify as a Charitable Contribution.--A cash contribution       made for the relief of the families of the dead or wounded       victims of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia, on       May 31, 2019, shall not fail to be treated as a charitable       contribution for purposes of section 170 of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 merely because such contribution is for       the exclusive benefit of such families. The preceding       sentence shall apply to contributions made on or after May       31, 2019.        (b) Clarification That Payments by Charitable Organizations       to Families Treated as Exempt Payments.--For purposes of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986, payments made on or after May       31, 2019, and on or before June 1, 2021, to the spouse or any       dependent (as defined in section 152 of such Code) of the       dead or wounded victims of the mass shooting in Virginia       Beach, Virginia, on May 31, 2019, by an organization which       (determined without regard to any such payments) would be an       organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such       Code shall--        (1) be treated as related to the purpose or function       constituting the basis for such organization's exemption       under such section; and        (2) shall not be treated as inuring to the benefit of any       private individual,       if such payments are made in good faith using a reasonable       and objective formula which is consistently applied with       respect to such victims.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Virginia Beach  Strong Act, a bill authored by my friend and colleague from Virginia,  Congresswoman Elaine Luria, to ensure that donations to the victims of  the Virginia Beach shooting are tax deductible.   Mr. Speaker, the Virginia Beach community experienced unspeakable  tragedy earlier this year when a mass shooting at the Virginia Beach  Municipal Center resulted in the deaths of 12 people.   In the face of this terrible tragedy, leaders throughout the city  came together and quickly established a fund to support victims,  survivors, and their families. The outpouring of support from the  community was profound, with over $4 million in donations to the fund.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, these donations are arguably not  considered tax deductible charitable contributions because they are  divided among specified individuals rather than an organization. A  technical fix in the Tax Code would address this issue. This  legislation before us today would fix this issue for the Virginia Beach  Tragedy Fund and ensure that these donations are tax deductible.   While nothing can reverse the pain of this terrible tragedy, the  bipartisan, commonsense bill before us today is an important step  toward helping the victims and their families and incentivizing further  contributions to the fund. I am proud to stand with the Virginia Beach  community in support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, we must take action  to fix the tax deductibility of these donations to the Virginia Beach  Tragedy Fund, which has done so much to help the community recover from  this unspeakable tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my profound condolences and also  congratulate Mrs. Luria on this wonderful piece of legislation that  will truly benefit those who were tragically lost and their families,  as well as first responders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this important  legislation. It is truly bicameral and bipartisan and deserves to pass.  I support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
