 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to finish my comments before the vote. I expect it to take not  more than about 3 or 4 minutes.    Madam President, I come to the floor to thank my  colleagues who voted and who will be voting to move forward the  nomination of Allison Joan Rushing to be the U.S. Circuit Court judge  for the Fourth Circuit.   Ms. Rushing has a great history in North Carolina. She is actually  from East Flat Rock, NC. Both of her parents were educators who taught  in the North Carolina public school system. She received her degree  with honors from Wake Forest, and she received her law degree from Duke  University. She now has over 11 years of experience practicing law and  is really considered one of the fast-rising stars of the legal  profession.   I have had the opportunity to get to know Ms. Rushing through the  nomination process, and I know she is going to do a great job as a  circuit court judge on the Fourth Circuit.   From the ABA, she has received from a substantial majority a  ``qualified'' rating and from a minority a ``well qualified'' rating.  She is clearly qualified to do this job. She is young. She is bright.  She is a topnotch litigator, and I look forward to casting my vote here  in a couple of minutes. Again, I think my colleagues will also be  casting a vote in support of confirming this nomination.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
