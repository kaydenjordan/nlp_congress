 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, the State Department has announced  that it is adding Pakistan to a special watch list for severe  violations of religious freedom. The long overdue decision recognizes  that Pakistan's shameful policies target and encourage violence against  religious minorities, primarily Christians. Pakistan's blasphemy laws  declare open season for attacks on these already persecuted  communities.   Pakistan also lets radical Islamic terrorist groups like the  Afghanistan Taliban Network, Haqqani Network, and al-Qaida go  unchallenged in Pakistan. This makes Pakistan one of the most dangerous  places in the world for Christians. Just last month, ISIS suicide  bombers struck a densely packed church in Pakistan, killing nine and  wounding dozens.   I applaud the President's decision to reexamine our relationship with  Pakistan and freeze military aid. Pakistan has played the United States  for too long. We cannot continue to provide billions of dollars to a  country that fosters terrorism and hate.   And that is just the way it is.
