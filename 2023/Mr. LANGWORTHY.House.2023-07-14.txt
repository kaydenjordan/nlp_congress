 Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of debate on this  year's NDAA. Our goal is simple: To strengthen and modernize our  military so they can be prepared to meet any national security  challenge that this great Nation might face.   Our House majority authored and passed a strong NDAA that prevents  the radical Green New Deal policies from weakening our fighting forces.  It blocks burdensome requirements on defense contractors, allowing them  to focus on delivering critical capabilities to our military.   This legislation also ensures that military ranges in the Gulf of  Mexico remain open for necessary training programs, enhancing our  troops' readiness. Additionally, it cuts funding for questionable  combat vehicle electrification research programs and prohibits funds  for DOD advisory committees dealing with environmental justice.   I am proud that we put forward a bill that focuses on the right  priorities, safeguarding our national security and guaranteeing the  continued defense of our great Nation instead of woke politics.                            ____________________
