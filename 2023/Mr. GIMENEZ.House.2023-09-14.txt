 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate  State Representative Danny Perez on being formally selected as the next  Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.   Most importantly to me and all of my fellow explorers, Danny Perez  will be the first Christopher Columbus High School graduate to serve as  Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.   Senator Marco Rubio paved the way as the very first Cuban-American  Speaker of the Florida House, and now Speaker-Designate Perez will be  just the third Cuban American to ever serve in that role.   Speaker-Designate Perez is happily married to his wife, Stephanie,  and has two beautiful children, Camila Lucia and Matias Daniel. He is  an attorney by trade and a passionate advocate for children. He also  serves as national chair of the American Legislative Exchange Council.   I look forward to continuing to work with Speaker-Designate Perez. I  am confident that he will continue to be a champion for Miami-Dade  County and  [[Page H4329]]  for the State of Florida and a responsible steward of our taxpayer  dollars.   ``Adelante,'' ``onwards,'' Danny, ``adelante,'' ``onwards.'' We are  all so very proud of you.                            ____________________
