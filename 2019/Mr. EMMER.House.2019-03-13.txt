 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart as another  individual has lost her life on U.S. Highway 12 in my home State of  Minnesota, in fact, right in my neighborhood.   U.S. Highway 12 is the road we drive to get to and from our hometown  of Delano, Minnesota. This is one of the most dangerous stretches of  road in our State. The highway has actually been called the ``Corridor  of Death.''   On March 2, 2019, Marleena Anna Dieterich, an 18-year-old from  Delano, Minnesota, lost her life in another crash on this highway.   Marleena was a student at Delano High School, a member of our  hometown, and a young life with so much promise. We lost her far too  soon.   Today I rise to remember the life of Marleena, to remember that she  was an honor student, a black belt in Taekwondo, and was planning to  major in biomedical sciences and minor in premed. Her life held endless  promise.   This accident, like so many on U.S. Highway 12, was tragic and  senseless.   Over the years, some improvements have been made to portions of U.S.  Highway 12, but until massive improvements are made to the most  dangerous stretch of this highway, tragic accidents will continue to  occur.   Since the beginning of 2019, just 2 months, 14 crashes have already  occurred on that stretch of the highway leading into Delano in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. More must be done, and  quickly.   While we are committed to working with the Minnesota Department of  Transportation and the Highway 12 Safety Coalition to ensure that  Minnesotans can travel safely and securely on this road, I am inviting  our Transportation Secretary Chao to visit us and see firsthand some of  our most desperate transportation needs in Minnesota.   At the Federal level, Congress must start to exercise its obligation  under Article I of the Constitution to dedicate and direct Federal  funds to build,  [[Page H2686]]  maintain, and improve our Federal highways, especially lifesaving  safety improvements.   Together, we can find a solution to the safety hazard that U.S.  Highway 12 poses, and together, we will.                  Congratulations to the Minnesota Whitecaps     Mr. Speaker, this March, during the National Hockey  League's Gender Equality Month, I want to congratulate the Minnesota  Whitecaps for making it to the National Women's Hockey League playoffs.   Not everyone can play professional sports, but everyone can  participate at some level. Sports are a great training ground for life.  Lessons in sportsmanship, teamwork, how to handle adversity are all  important to the development of productive, contributing citizens in a  civil society.   Professional women athletes play a large role in the development of  girls hockey in communities across the country, but especially the  Minnesota hockey community.   We are lucky to have inspiring players turn coaches that mentor the  next generation of female hockey players and great Americans.   I know the entire Minnesota hockey world is proud of the Whitecaps.   Congratulations on your success, and good luck in the playoffs.            HealthPartners Recognized for Serving the Underserved     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize HealthPartners for  receiving the 2019 CMS Health Equity Award from the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services.   This award recognizes organizations that demonstrate an exceptional  commitment to serving the most underserved individuals among us.   HealthPartners has locations throughout Minnesota's Sixth  Congressional District, which I am honored to represent in this  Congress.   HealthPartners is committed to eliminating healthcare disparities for  those with language, cultural, and other barriers.   I am pleased to congratulate this outstanding company for receiving  this well-deserved award.   I hope other healthcare providers will take note of the small changes  that can make a big difference in eliminating bias in the distribution  of healthcare services.                            ____________________
