 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman  Bobby Scott of  the Education and Labor Committee and staff, and my colleagues that  have joined me on this policy and lifesaving legislation for the  diligence and the commitment towards keeping Americans safe and saving  lives.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act, a long overdue reauthorization  of the Nation's oldest law providing Federal support to survivors of  intimate partner violence. Known as FVPSA, this law is the primary  source of Federal funding for intimate partner violence prevention and  services and provides vital services for victims all over the United  States.   This bill funds shelters, State domestic violence coalitions, a  national domestic violence hotline, and national resource centers that  offer technical assistance to service providers. Despite its pivotal  role in combatting domestic violence, FVPSA has not been reauthorized  since 2015. It is far past time that Congress acts to pass a  comprehensive reauthorization of this vital law.   During this pandemic, we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of  cases of family and domestic violence. While attempting to stay safe  from the COVID-19 virus that has swept this country, many children and  families were forced to face the violence that awaited them inside  their own homes and further isolated them from their support systems.   Violence in the home can have a tragic and drastic effect on  children, stunting their emotional and cognitive growth and affecting  their performance in school and their social development. This early  trauma can cause long-lasting effects in a person's life and impact  their success as adults. We must make sure that our children and their  families have the resources they need to prevent domestic violence and  abuse.   I have seen too many families in my home State of Georgia suffer at  the hands of domestic and family violence. We must protect these  families and families all across the Nation.    This legislation has broad bipartisan support within both Chambers of  Congress and from stakeholders on the front lines of combatting  domestic violence in America. Our community partners recognize that  this legislation is critical to protecting and supporting our families  and our children.   The reauthorization makes key changes to current law, most  importantly, by ensuring equitable access to resources for Native  Tribes and Tribal coalitions, authorizing a Tribal domestic violence  hotline, authorizing resource centers for Alaska Native and LGBTQ  populations, expanding funding for prevention so that every State and  coalition receives prevention resources, and authorizing grants for  underserved populations and culturally specific services for racial and  ethnic minority groups. It helps provide survivors a way up, a way out,  and a way forward.   Some of my colleagues have argued that the LGBTQ anti-discrimination  clause in this legislation will result in discrimination against  religious organizations who provide services to victims of domestic  violence. This could not be further from the truth.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of this  legislation from the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago.                                             The Catholic Charities,                                          Archdiocese of Chicago,                                      Chicago, IL, October 15, 2021.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives Washington,           DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Chairman Scott,       and Republican Leader McCarthy: Catholic Charities is one of       the largest social services providers in the Midwest, and I       am honored to serve as its Chief Program Officer.        For 104 years, Catholic Charities has served and       accompanied anyone in need in Greater Chicago. Every year,       Charities' helps nearly 200 survivors of domestic violence       and those at high risk through emergency shelter, safety       planning, counseling, legal services, and transitional       housing. Our wrap-around services and partnerships help       survivors and in many cases their children improve stability       and restore security.        Pre-pandemic, we knew that people experiencing domestic       violence in Illinois were 95% women, 55% Black, and 13%       Latinx. Forty-three percent resided in Chicago and 40% were       low-income.        The survivors we serve at Catholic Charities Chicago face       staggering challenges. One hundred percent live below the       federal poverty line. They come to us as survivors of       intergenerational trauma. They fear losing their children.       They often have prolonged exposure to substance use and are       experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Almost       universally, they are in poor physical and emotional health.        Survivors are often isolated due to cultural factors,       language barriers, lack of familial support, and lack of       awareness of their lawful protections. Moreover, they have       inadequate support once they leave the abusive situation.        It is often the church, and Catholic Charities, to which       survivors turn. The role of trusted, faith-based providers in       this service arena is profound.        COVID-19 has only compounded the struggles faced by       survivors. Since the pandemic began, the Illinois Domestic       Violence Hotline reports a 15% increase in calls and a 2,000%       increase in text messages requesting help. Additional burdens       include financial stress, unemployment, isolation, increased       family conflict, and deepening mental health issues. For       persons experiencing domestic abuse, lockdowns and other       COVID restrictions have forced them to spend more time with       their abuser and less time with their support networks,       increasing survivors' difficulty trying to flee.        A grim reality is that flight from an abusive situation       often leaves survivors without a place to call home. In       response, Catholic Charities operates two transitional       housing programs for domestic violence survivors. While       families are in a safe environment, Charities supports them       on their journey toward healing and recovery with a long-term       goal of securing permanent housing and stable employment. We       offer free legal services including facilitating orders of       protection and court representation in matters of child       support and custody.        Although survivors may reside with us for up to two years,       families typically transition after 12 to 14 months. Once a       one-year housing agreement is secured, Charities arranges  [[Page H5897]]       for the family to move into its new home. With Charities       support, survivors arrive with a truckload of furniture,       household supplies and clothing, and often with savings       between $2,000 and $3,000.        Most important is their increased self-sufficiency and       their deep connection to a supportive, faith-based community.       Our presence continues in many survivors' lives through after       care programming. For instance, past residents attend support       groups, in English and Spanish. Survivors continue coming to       us for food, clothing, school supplies, and other       necessities.        Even through COVID, 100% of the survivors we have served       remained in stable permanent housing. Prior to COVID, 68%       sustained full-time employment; today employment is an       ongoing struggle. Moreover, since the pandemic, Charities has       seen a 25% increase in survivors coming back to us for basic       necessities. Some may not have worked with our team in       years--but our doors remain open.        This past winter, we began offering new services for       survivors of domestic violence on the Westside of Chicago,       where African American and Latinx communities have been       hardest hit by COVID. Our staff offer trauma-informed       counseling and intensive case management. We are       collaborating with churches, hospitals, and others to expand       access to free, confidential services for survivors. Together       we are helping people regain control of their lives and begin       their healing process.        Catholic Charities fulfills the Church's role in the       mission of charity to anyone in need by providing       compassionate, competent and professional services that       strengthen and support individuals, families and communities       based on the value and dignity of human life.        That's why the FVPSA Re-Authorization Act of 2021 (H.R.       2119) is so important to Catholic Charities and to survivors       in faith communities all across the country. Our shelters and       healing recovery programs help survivors rebuild their lives       with hope and dignity.        Thank you for your leadership and the Committee's work to       eradicate gender-based violence through the bipartisan Family       Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119.       Catholic Charities endorses H.R. 2119 which will provide core       supports and enhance comprehensive responses to domestic       violence and urges Members to vote YES on final passage.       FVPSA provides critical support for shelters, coalitions,       training and technical assistance centers, children's       services, emergency response hotlines, supportive services,       and prevention initiatives.        We must continue to consider the ripple effect violence       imposes on the health and well-being of IPV survivors. Access       to resources and continuous supports can be a turning point       in a survivor's journey towards healing and living free from       violence. Your continued leadership in the passage of this       bill is an action of service that responds to those needs in       trauma informed and culturally responsive ways.        Thank you again for your leadership on behalf of survivors,       their families, and their communities around the country.            Sincerely,      Ami Novoryta,        Chief Program Officer, Catholic Charities of the       Archdiocese of Chicago.     Since coming to Congress, I have focused on protecting  the children and families of Georgia and everyone all across this  Nation, along with children and families throughout this great Nation  that we all serve here today.   Working in close partnership with local, State, and Tribal  leadership, this bipartisan legislation would reauthorize and expand  funding for programs focused on preventing family and domestic  violence, while also protecting its survivors.   I am so proud of this legislation and I am hopeful that it is one  that we can all support. We must come together to support this law,  recognizing that family and domestic violence can affect all Americans,  no matter where they come from. Domestic violence and family violence  is not a partisan issue.    Madam Speaker, domestic violence is not a partisan  issue. Family violence is not a partisan issue; it is a public health  crisis.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues everywhere, Republicans and  Democrats, to support the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 2119.
