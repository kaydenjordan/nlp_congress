 Mr. Speaker, recently, I have heard many of my Democratic  colleagues, and even more in the media, saying that our President has  manufactured a crisis at the southern border and that there is no need  for funding to secure it properly.   Tell Ingrid Lake there is no crisis. Her 6-year-old boy, Lennox,  sustained a life-altering injury as a result of an illegal alien's  criminal behavior, and that individual had previously been deported 15  times.   Tell Officer Ronil Singh's family there is no crisis. Officer Singh  was recently shot in cold blood by an illegal alien after a traffic  stop.   Last year alone, border security intercepted about 17,000 people with  no criminal convictions at our border.   Members, those who oppose our President at any cost, refuse to see  the truth. But, to me, and I believe to all who objectively consider  the circumstances, there is clearly a full-blown legitimate crisis. It  is one we have been ignoring for far too long. An overwhelming majority  of constituents calling my office in the last few days agree.   Mr. Speaker, let's get this government open now, and let's authorize  the money necessary to ensure the security of our people.                            ____________________
