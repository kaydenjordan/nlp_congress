 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  me the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in favor of my amendment, which is included in  the en bloc package.   My amendment builds upon the successes of the East Med Act, signed  into law last year, by taking steps to increase the United States  rotational deployments to Greece and diplomatic ties with Greece,  Cyprus, and Israel--the trilateral agreement.   In an increasingly unstable region, and with Turkey making a decisive  turn from the West, the United States needs to focus on strengthening  our bonds with our reliable allies in the region. This amendment sends  a strong message of deterrence to Turkey as it attempts to undermine  the sovereignty of our friends in the Eastern Mediterranean.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this amendment.
