 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I call  up the bill (S. 2155) to promote economic growth, provide tailored  regulatory relief, and enhance consumer protections, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, for far too long, far too many people in our country  have struggled to make ends meet. They have struggled to buy a car.  They have struggled to buy a home. They have struggled--they have  struggled for their version of the American Dream.   I hear from these people frequently, Mr. Speaker. I hear from Colton  in Terrell, Texas, who said that he and his wife have been unable to  get a mortgage due to credit and that they were 25, 30 years old and  they had good credit but they were getting denied. They needed a home  to provide a sense of stability, but they couldn't get it due to  Washington's bureaucratic regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I heard from Dirk in Dallas. He said he used to have a  $100,000 line of credit from his bank. He had an unsecured signature  line of credit that he used for working capital for his small business.  He often paid it down to zero, and cash flow was ample, but then the  bank canceled it because of the bureaucratic government burden on the  banking system.   I heard from Sherry in Eustace, who said:         After a divorce 4 years ago, I needed to buy a car because       my car was over 10 years old. I had a checking account in my       name at my credit union, but they didn't loan me money for       the car.                                time  1400    Mr. Speaker, we hear these stories far too often. The Main Street  banks and credit unions that these people depend on have been suffering  for years under the weight, the load, the volume, the complexity, and  the cost of heavy Washington bureaucratic red tape. They haven't been  able to serve these people to help get them into homes and to help get  them into cars.   As one west Texas banker told me, Mr. Speaker: ``My major risks are  not credit risks, risk of theft, or risk of some robber coming in with  a gun in my office, my number one risk is regulatory risk.''   We have been losing a community bank or credit union every other day  in America and, with it, the hopes and dreams of millions. But today,  that changes. Help is on the way with the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, this is the most pro-growth banking bill in a  generation. You would have to go back to 1999 to Gramm-Leach-Bliley.  Although we didn't have a formal conference with the Senate, I am proud  that over half of the bills in this package, including three-quarters  of the regulatory relief provisions, came from the House. These are the  provisions to help hardworking, struggling taxpayers get into home  mortgages, get into car loans, and get into their small businesses.  This is what will help drive 3 percent economic growth, which is the  birthright of all Americans.   Today is an important day in the history of economic opportunity in  America, and I encourage all of us to support the Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the leading voice in  Congress on trying to bring rationality to the SIFI designation and  accountability to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the  chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the lead voice in the House for  capital formation for our start-ups and small businesses, the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and  Insurance and the author of the Family Self-Sufficiency provision in S.  2155.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the vice chairman of the committee  and the Chief Deputy Whip of the majority and author of two provisions  of S. 2155 to promote capital formation and hold credit bureaus fully  accountable.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the former chairman of the House Agriculture  Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is the chair of our  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade and the author of two provisions on access to  manufactured housing and portfolio lending in S. 2155.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the committee's majority whip and the author  of the amendment dealing with the Volcker rule.    Mr. Speaker, I now am very pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the author of  two different provisions in S. 2155 to give more flexibility to private  companies and small banks with respect to their call reports.    Mr. Speaker, I am now very pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of  two different provisions in S. 2155 to bring clarity to the complex  capital rules and flexibility to our savings associations.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the author of the MOBILE Act,  Making Online Banking Initiation Legal and Easy.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the author of the key regulatory relief  provision for small banks and credit unions in S. 2155.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is the author of two provisions in S.  2155, the Senior Safe Act and supporting capital formation for small  companies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), a fellow Texan who is an incredibly strong  advocate on our committee for small business to obtain credit for their  customers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Utah (Mrs. Love), who is the author of a key regulatory relief  provision to provide small banks the opportunity to grow.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), who is the author of two key  regulatory relief provisions for our community banks and credit unions  in S. 2155.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this side.   I believe I have the right to close.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, since Dodd-Frank was passed, the big banks have become  bigger and the small banks have become fewer. Free checking at banks  has been cut in half. Credit cards: 200 basis points more, 15 percent  fewer. Many creditworthy borrowers are having to pay almost $600 more  for their auto loans.   Mr. Speaker, the American Dream is shrinking. We have 1.6 percent  economic growth, stagnant paychecks, decimated savings, and a  diminished American Dream. That is the legacy of Dodd-Frank.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could believe 10 percent of what I heard from  the other side of the aisle. I wish it did gut Dodd-Frank. It didn't.  You can't find something in here. It is hard, challenging, to find  anything in this bill that helps what the ranking member calls the so- called Wall Street megabanks.   Mr. Speaker, listening very carefully to this debate, it is clear  that there are some voices that appear to be driven by their loathing  of banks and credit unions, and there are other voices that are driven  for our love and respect of our fellow citizens, hardworking taxpayers  like Dirk in Colton and Sherry, who I mentioned in my opening  statement, who are trying to capitalize a small business, who are  trying to buy a car that is 10 years old, who are trying to buy that  home. It is their American Dream, and they are being challenged due to  this law.   I have heard so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle  say: Oh, I believe in taking away bureaucracy and red tape from  community financial institutions, and I believe in bipartisanship.   Well, they may believe in it, but they are not voting for it. The  opportunity is right here in front of us with S. 2155, a strong,  bipartisan bill that has come over from the United States Senate. So,  again, they claim they believe it in theory; they just don't believe it  in practice.   Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, 3 percent economic growth counts.  If you look at the history of our Republic, 3 percent growth is where  all the job creation takes place. It is where the paycheck increases  take place. It is where the poverty reductions take place. It is the  birthright of the American people.   Thankfully, due to the leadership of our President and this Congress,  we now have a 3 percent tax policy. We need a 3 percent regulatory  policy, especially for our community banks and our credit unions, who  help finance the American Dream for all of our citizens.   We should join in unison on this historic day to pass S. 2155, the  Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, for  the help of all our citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
