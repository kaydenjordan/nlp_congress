 Mr. Speaker, at the young age of 23, Nick Castle  knew he had a higher calling. So directly following his graduation, he  headed overseas to China to teach English, volunteering in the Peace  Corps.   Sadly, Nick became seriously ill after becoming an ambassador abroad.  He was the victim of an inefficient, underequipped, and unresponsive  Peace Corps-led medical team in China.   After he reported that he was ill, he was prescribed a broad  antibiotic. Nick quickly began to experience drastic weight loss, but  he was reassured he was okay. As the weeks progressed, he was confined  to his bed, too ill to even stand up. But his doctor never recommended  that he go to the hospital.   After experiencing dangerously low blood pressure, Nick was finally  sent to a hospital. As the ambulance made its way to him, it got lost  on the winding roads in the remote area of China. Before the ambulance  could get Nick to the hospital, he stopped breathing. Nick died a few  weeks later in early 2013.   A 2014 Peace Corps Inspector General report found that Nick was the  victim of medical negligence. ``Failures and delays in treatment'' were  exposed, ultimately leading to Nick's death. Investigations revealed  that the Peace Corps medical team misdiagnosed his illness.   This heartbreaking death of a young man serving our country and the  world could have been avoided had the Peace Corps staff been properly  trained, equipped, and had a responsive team.   Unfortunately, Nick's case is representative of a broader problem:  Peace Corps volunteers struggle to access quality medical treatment  when they are abroad in remote areas of the world. And when they return  to America, then they face a red-taped, bureaucratic nightmare.   They are covered by the Peace Corps for 3 months while they wait on  the Department of Labor to determine that their illnesses or injuries  are service-related. But the Department often takes much longer than 3  months to make that determination, forcing those Peace Corps volunteers  to pay out of pocket for costly medical expenses. When attempting to  get medical coverage through the Department of Labor, many are faced  with costly personal expenses.   So, Mr. Speaker, Congressman Kennedy and I have sponsored H.R. 2259,  the Sam Farr Peace Corps Enhancement Act. Sam Farr was a Peace Corps  volunteer and a Member of Congress. This act seeks to improve and  strengthen the health, safety, and well-being of current and returning  Peace Corps volunteers. It requires that Peace Corps volunteers have  access to a qualified Peace Corps medical officer and medical  facilities while they are at posts overseas. And when those volunteers  return home, it extends their Peace Corps coverage for up to 6 months  while they wait on the Department of Labor to determine coverage. It  enhances access to health care for returning Peace Corps volunteers as  well, and it expands and improves provisions of the Kate Puzey Peace  Corps Volunteer Protection Act, enhancing the ability to assist and  protect volunteers that have experienced sexual assault, among other  issues, while in lands across the seas.   Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers are America's angels abroad. They  are some of the best that we have. They are the spirit of humanitarian  assistance. They work in remote areas of the world helping others-- areas of the world that many Americans can't find on a map.   So America must make sure to take care of these amazing people when  they serve in lands far away so that there are no more deaths like Nick  Castle's.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, according to Kuauhtemoc Rodriguez,  [[Page H3010]]  called K-Rod, a VA employee at the medical center in Phoenix, Arizona-- yes, that famous VA hospital--he has been threatened and harassed by  the VA for speaking up about excessive wait times for vets to see  doctors.   In October of 2016, the VA's inspector general released a report of  misconduct on the Phoenix hospital based on information provided by Mr.  Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez alleged that more than 90 veterans had been  waiting over 400 days to see a doctor, 5 of whom died before they could  see the doctor. These accusations are very disturbing.   But Mr. Rodriguez' discovery did not earn him a medal or a plaque,  just threats and harassment by the VA. They even moved his desk to a  closet.   There are many folks at the VA who genuinely care about our veterans  in this country, like K-Rod, but there seems to be a culture problem at  the VA that must be addressed from the top down.   Fix the problem rather than attack whistleblowers. No veteran should  ever wait to see a doctor for over a year. That is shameful.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking  member for sponsoring this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, a few years ago, North Korea ordered its missile units  on standby to strike the United States. Little Kim, as I call him, and  his generals convened a press conference and displayed a chart of what  they called U.S. mainland strike plan.   The attack plan targeted several major United States population  centers, including Austin, Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am personally offended  by that. At the time of this plan, it was ridiculed by international  media. After all, the administration was pursuing a passive strategic  patience plan.   But now experts say that, in less than 4 years, North Korea will have  intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of raining down nuclear  weapons on the entire United States. North Korea is making steady  progress on its nuclear program. It conducted two nuclear tests in 2016  alone.   So the time has come to tighten the noose on little Kim. We need to  choke off the sources of his ill-gotten gain, and these sanctions will  help do that. This bill expands sanctions to target some of the  regime's most lucrative sources of revenue. It also requires the State  Department to reassess whether North Korea should be placed back on the  State Sponsors of Terrorism list. I think that is long overdue.   Little Kim has earned the distinction of being a worldwide terrorist.  So little Kim means it when he says he wants to destroy the United  States. He even wants to put ICBMs in submarines and send them off the  coast of California. He cannot be allowed to do this mischief. He needs  to know the United States means it when we say that we will protect the  American people.   And that is just the way it is.
