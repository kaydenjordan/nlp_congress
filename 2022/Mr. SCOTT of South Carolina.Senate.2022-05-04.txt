 I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, this should be simple.  The last 20 years, China's emissions have gone from 13 percent globally  to 28 percent. At the same time, our emissions have gone from 25  percent down to 14 percent.   I will start over.   The last 20 years, China's emissions have doubled--13 percent to 28  percent. At the exact same time, ours has gone from 25 percent to 14  percent.   Why would we cripple our economy to make it easier for China to  prosper? This should be a simple one. Gas in DC is $5 a gallon. We are  destroying America's economy, and we are crippling our Nation's energy  security. This should be simple.   I yield back the rest of my time.    I have great respect for Senator Carper.  I think he is a man of integrity. I will simply say that China can't  hear the music he is talking about. Our emissions have been going down  while theirs is going up.   Clean energy in this footprint is produced cleaner in America than it  is in China. So if you care about the environment, produce it here at  home. If you care about national security, produce it here at home.   (Applause.)   That is all I am suggesting.   I will reclaim the last 10 seconds of my time.                                Vote on Motion
