 Mr. Speaker, during the coronavirus pandemic, community  organizations in east Tennessee stepped up to help our neighbors in  need. I rise today to highlight the efforts of Random Acts of Flowers,  which recently delivered its 500,000th bouquet; and to recognize the  retirement of its founder, my good friend, Larsen Jay.   In 2007, Larsen Jay was in the hospital recovering from an accident,  and he noticed many patients weren't receiving visitors or flowers. He  reflected on the amount of support he received and wanted others to  have that encouragement, too. Larsen founded Random Acts of Flowers in  2008 to deliver repurposed flowers to local hospital patients and  seniors in nursing homes.   The nonprofit recycles arrangements donated from events like weddings  and makes them into beautiful floral bouquets. Since opening its doors  in Knoxville, the nonprofit has grown to serve folks in Indianapolis  and Tampa Bay, Florida.   Random Acts of Flowers has safely resumed operations after a pause  during the coronavirus pandemic. Isolation continues to be a serious  problem for seniors and those in poor health during this crisis, but  outstanding organizations like Random Acts of Flowers are here to let  our neighbors know they are loved and supported.   Mr. Speaker, after reaching the milestone of delivering half a  million bouquets, Larsen Jay announced his retirement from Random Acts  of Flowers. He has long been active in community service, currently  serving as chairman of the Knox County Commission.   I know he will continue to find ways to make an impact in our  community. I thank him for his efforts to make Random Acts of Flowers a  successful and meaningful organization in east Tennessee and I  congratulate the nonprofit on its 500,000th delivery.                            ____________________
