 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, too often, our laws passed with the best of intentions  fail to keep pace with technology, and that is what we are seeing today  with the Communications Decency Act.   The bill was passed in 1996 as Congress' first attempt to regulate  inappropriate material online. This law prevented hosts and visitors of  a website from being treated as a publisher for legal purposes. It is  what allowed classified websites like eBay to flourish while being  legally protected from third-party content posted on their sites.   But 20 years is an eternity in the digital age, and bad actor  websites have created platforms designed to facilitate illegalities  like child prostitution and sex trafficking, and they use provisions in  this law to shield them from any liability.   One of the most notorious examples is online advertiser Backpage.com.  Since 2011, more than 20 civil action lawsuits have been brought  against this site for willingly facilitating sex trafficking and the  prostitution of minors. However, each time a legal action was brought  against Backpage, Federal law shielded them from liability.   Last year, The Washington Post reported that a contractor for this  site was soliciting and creating sex-related ads, despite Backpage's  repeated insistence that they had no role in the content of their ads.  Backpage used longstanding Federal protections under the Communications  Decency Act to shield itself from all liability.   In the Doe v. Backpage ruling by the first circuit, the judges held  that, even if Backpage had facilitated the crime of sex trafficking,  this law shielded the company from the claims that were filed by the  child victims. The first circuit recently reiterated that when it threw  out yet another lawsuit against Backpage. The courts weren't able to  help these victims, instead, encouraging them to pursue legislative  changes, and that brings us here today.   H.R. 1865 finally creates a legislative solution to hold these bad  actors accountable and allow the victims to seek the damages that they  deserve. It creates a new offense in the Federal code for websites that  facilitate this criminal activity and gives, to prosecutors, the tools  they need to hold the wrongdoers accountable.   The bill is a product of a lot of great work, and I want to thank  Congresswoman Wagner for introducing it. The Rules Committee, last  night, made in order an amendment from Congresswoman Walters that  substantially strengthens the legislation and has Congresswoman  Wagner's full support. Its inclusion attached the text of bipartisan  Senate language to drastically improve its implementation. This is  language that has the support of both the tech industry and the victims  advocacy groups.   Mr. Speaker, it is so nice to see Members of both parties from both  sides of the Capitol come together on this. Through collaboration, we  have crafted a bill that does more than just update a 20-year-old law.  It fulfills our moral responsibility to protect the children that we  represent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump tweeted over the weekend: ``Dems are no  longer talking DACA.''   Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ. Democrats are still urging our  colleagues yet again to act by helping us bring up the Dream Act for a  vote on the House floor.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral  legislation would help hundreds of thousands of young people who are  American in every way except on paper. President Trump set the official  deadline for DACA to expire on March 5, so we can't afford to waste any  more time, and Dreamers should not be forced to live in fear any  longer.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of my colleague if he has  further speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, many of my colleagues today, as well as I,  discussed the need to protect America's children. This bill is a great  piece of that, and I am very grateful to have it on the floor today.  But there is more that we can do. It must include acting to curb the  Nation's gun violence epidemic.   Every day in America, 91 people are killed by a gun. Since Sandy  Hook, there have been close to 1,000 mass shootings. A mass shooting is  one where three or more people have lost their lives. Imagine that,  thousands of them. Our Nation is still mourning the loss of 17 lives  just last week when a gunman using an AR-15-style rifle opened fire at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. That gun is  a weapon of war and should only be in the hands of the military and  never on the streets of the United States.  [[Page H1280]]    Assault weapons were the weapon of choice not just in the Florida  shooting but also in the mass shootings at the concert in Las Vegas;  the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado; and the elementary school in  Sandy Hook, Connecticut.   They were prohibited under the assault weapons ban that Congress let  expire in 2004. I was here when we established that ban, and we saw a  great decrease in gun deaths from that. So they should be prohibited  today and not in the hands of people who simply want to kill the most  people they can in the shortest time.   Why would we allow an insanity like that?   So I was pleased to cosponsor legislation this week to re-implement  the assault weapons ban.                                time  1145    The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are inspiring  the entire Nation to push Congress to do our job and to act on gun  violence.   I will tell you that I understand the pain that everybody feels from  all of this, but we can't maintain it. We go from one to the other, as  though nothing had ever happened before.   But we have to also do what the NRA has forbidden us from doing,  which is to have gun research at the Communicable Disease Center. That  certainly should be lifted, as well.   We certainly should expand and strengthen the background check  system. Keeping people on the terrorist watch list and the no-fly list  from being able to purchase firearms and explosives seems to me to be a  no-brainer, but we won't even do that. And, yes, reinstating that  weapons ban again, I think, is critically important.   Perhaps the voices of those injured and grieving children can break  the gun lobby's stranglehold on Congress. I hope so. The majority  should heed their call because we, as Members of Congress, are in a  unique position. Unlike the clergy or grief counselors or elected  officials, we can actually do something to combat this violence. It  certainly is, Mr. Speaker, past time that we do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
