 Mr. Speaker, sadly, I rise again today to speak about  the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women.  [[Page H5982]]    After 300 days of searching, the body of Rosenda Strong was finally  found on the Yakima Nation reservation in central Washington.   The life of this young mother of four was not lost, but taken, as are  the lives of many other Native American women across the Nation.   Rosenda is a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla, and  her case is one of 71 unsolved cases involving missing and murdered  indigenous women in Washington State.   Since she went missing last October, her loved ones have rallied to  bring national attention to the alarming high number of murder and  violence rate facing Native American women across the country. Children  are left without mothers, parents are left without daughters, and  communities are left questioning their safety and their future.   This crisis can no longer be ignored. Congress must act to deliver  justice to victims like Rosenda and so many others like her.                            ____________________
