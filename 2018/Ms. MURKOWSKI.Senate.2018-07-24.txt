 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number:  Schatz amendment No. 3407; Kennedy amendment No. 3430. I further ask  consent that following the remarks of Senators Baldwin, Durbin, Schatz,  and Kennedy, the Senate vote in relation to the Schatz and Kennedy  amendments in the order listed and that there be no second-degree  amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we  expect these votes to occur shortly after 6 p.m.    Mr. President, the Ted Stevens Anchorage  International Airport is buzzing with activity all year long. It  connects our military posted in Alaska with their families in the Lower  48, welcomes business visitors from around the world, and takes  Alaskans to the Lower 48 for a weekend of cheering the Seahawks in  Seattle, a shopping trip, or simply a break from the Alaskan winter.   The Anchorage airport is the truly a crossroads for our friends in  rural Alaska coming and going from meetings and medical appointments in  Anchorage. Its gates are places where Alaskans congregate--catching up  with old friends or connecting with State legislators and an occasional  U.S. Senator.   Look to the left as your plane pulls into the gate, and you see cargo  planes from around the world. The Ted Stevens Anchorage International  Airport is our State's premier transportation hub, a cargo hub of  global renown.   For most of my adult life, the Anchorage airport was a pretty  utilitarian place. The walls were tan, the gate and baggage claim signs  had white lettering on a blue background. If you were picking up a  rental car, you rolled your bag through the snow because most were  parked outside. The return lot was outside too. But it worked. It was a  place to come and go, not a place to linger.   Mort Plumb had another vision. He foresaw the boom in tourism that  would come to Alaska and believed that our State needed a gateway  airport as beautiful and inspiring as the State itself. Mort was the  father of today's Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. A  showplace for Native arts and crafts with huge picture windows and  vistas of the Chugach mountain range that cause our visitors to wonder  whether they really want to leave this unique place, a portal to the  Great Land.   Mort's vision has paid off; 2018 could be a record year for tourism  in Alaska, and seat capacity on out-of-state flights this year is up  5.6 percent. That translates into the opportunity for an additional  43,000 visitors to enjoy what Alaska has to offer.   Sadly, in February, Mort passed away at the age of 74. Born in  Pennsylvania, he came to Alaska like many of our finest do: in the  service of our country. He served 27 years in the Air Force, and we are  indeed grateful that the Air Force chose to send Mort and his family to  Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage. As a colonel, Mort served as  director of operations for the Alaskan Command, chief of staff for the  11th Air Force, and vice commander for the 11th Air Force. He retired  from the Air Force in 1994.   Mort's retirement didn't last long, as he was quickly recruited by  Governor Tony Knowles to direct the Ted Stevens Anchorage International  Airport. He took that job in 1995 and remained until 2008. All told, he  served under three Governors: Democrat Knowles and Republicans Frank  Murkowski and Sarah Palin. Mort Plumb served with great distinction.   After retiring from the airport, Mort was hardly done with his  career. He took on new responsibilities as chief operating officer of  the First National Bank of Alaska and continued to serve on a host of  nonprofit boards. One of his favorites was the Fisher House of Alaska,  which cares for military family caregivers and veterans in town for  medical appointments. Mort was active in the civilian and military  community and was also an avid runner, golfer, and skier. He was a  devoted husband, attending most every community event with his wife,  Ann, by his side. He was also a loving father and doting grandfather.   To his family and friends, know that the legacy and service of Mort  Plumb will long be remembered. We appreciate our friend Mort, and we  miss him.                            ____________________
