 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for yielding, and I  thank him for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, in just 2 years, over 5 million illegal migrants have  crossed our southern border, in addition to over 1 million known got- aways. That is equal to the entire population of my home State of  Missouri.    Among other malfeasance, it is undeniable that the Biden  administration has created an appalling humanitarian crisis in the  United States. I want to talk about what often goes unspoken and  unseen: the trafficking and exploitation of children.   In February, The New York Times exposed that the Biden administration  had lost 85,000 unaccompanied children released into the U.S. by the  Department of Health and Human Services. These children were forced to  work in dangerous conditions to pay off debts to their smugglers and  cartels and, even more horrifically, their HHS-designated sponsors.   Despite child welfare agencies sounding the alarms on trafficking and  labor exploitation, the Biden administration continued to facilitate  this abuse. In fact, HHS Secretary Becerra reportedly threatened to  fire his subordinates if they refused to accelerate these cruel and  dangerous releases, showing no regard for the children's safety.   H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, addresses this catastrophe head- on, and it ensures that this can never happen again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
