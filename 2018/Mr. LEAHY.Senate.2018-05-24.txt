 Mr. President, right now, in a small town in West Virginia  90 miles outside of our Nation's capital, dedicated employees of the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) are  diligently searching through millions of firearms sales records at the  National Tracing Center. They are busily responding to urgent requests  from detectives and agents to trace firearms found at crime scenes  throughout the country. By the end of the day, they will likely have  completed more than 1,000 requests, providing law enforcement with  information that can lead to arrests, prosecutions, and ultimately  justice for victims of violent crime.   The tracing center plays a critical and unique role in keeping our  communities safe. It is the only crime gun tracing facility in the  country. Its sole purpose is to help track down and hold criminals  accountable.   One would expect Congress to fully and unequivocally support this  mission. Yet, inexplicably, Congress has done the opposite. Relenting  to pressure from the gun lobby, Congress placed archaic hurdles on  crime gun traces, prohibiting the ATF from digitizing or electronically  searching through firearms records.   These restrictions were born out of an unfounded fear that can only  be described as a conspiracy theory: that allowing records to be  electronically searched would lead to firearms--presumably to include  my own--being seized by the government en masse, in clear violation of  both the Second and Fourth Amendments.   This unworldly fear is having a very real-world impact. In an era  when an electronic trace could be completed in an instant, the ATF is  instead forced to locate individual records by visiting Federal  firearms licensees or searching by hand through the records housed at  the National Tracing Center; these National Tracing Center records  currently number 800 million, and are  [[Page S2936]]  growing by an additional 2 million each month.   Some of these records have been damaged by flooding and mold.  Countless more have been relegated to rented shipping containers in the  parking lot, as the floor of the tracing center is structurally unable  to support the weight of so many thousands of boxes. Other records are  stored as images on microfilm, forcing ATF employees to reel through up  to 10,000 records on a single roll to find the one desired firearm.   Tracing requests are processed every single day, 24 hours a day, so  that when a homicide detective finds a firearm believed to have been  used in a murder, the detective can determine the chain of custody for  that firearm, which may lead to a suspect.   I asked the ATF about the impact of these restrictions on crime gun  traces at a recent hearing of the Judiciary Committee Acting Director  Thomas Brandon stated that in these criminal investigations, ``time  matters, [and] getting accurate information can develop the critical  lead.'' He testified that if the ATF were able to electroncially search  through records it would be ``beneficial for public safety.''   I agree. That is why today I am introducing the Crime Gun Tracing  Modernization Act, which will bring our nation's tracing capabilities  into the 21st century. This legislation would empower the ATF to  digitize and electronically search through its firearms records, so  that it can quickly and accurately connect crime guns with purchasers.  Yet this legislation is also narrowly tailored; it only permits the ATF  to search through firearms sale and disposition records that it already  has access to, and only for the purposes of criminal and national  security investigations, and it strictly prohibits searches using an  individual's name or other personally identifiable information.   This legislation represents only a modest step, but an important  step. There are few signs more revealing of Congress's inability to  responsibly legislate gun policy than its insistence that law  enforcement not be allowed to effectively search through records  already in its possession. The gun lobby cannot be permitted to tie the  hands of agents and detectives investigating violent gun crime. We  cannot let a baseless conspiracy theory drive our public safety  policies.   It is time for Congress to fix our mistakes. It is time to bring one  of our Nation's premier law enforcement agencies, which in turn serves  every Federal, State, and local agency in the country, out of the Stone  Age. It is no surprise that this legisation is supported by important  voices within the law enforcement community, including the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association, Major Cities Chiefs Association, and  Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.   I am also proud that March For Our Lives, led by the students of  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, strongly  supports this legislation. We in Congress owe it to those who have been  victimized by gun violence to do something. There are many commonsense  steps we can and should take right now. That includes removing  indefensible restrictions on law enforcement that waste public safety  resources and delay critical investigations of violent gun crime. I  urge my fellow senators to join me and Senator Nelson in supporting  this important legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN:   S. 2984. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide  greater access to higher education for America's students, to eliminate  educational barriers for participation in a public service career, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
