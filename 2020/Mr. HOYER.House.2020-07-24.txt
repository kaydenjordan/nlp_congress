 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 30th anniversary on  Sunday of the Americans with Disabilities Act being signed into law by  George H.W. Bush, President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to be the lead sponsor of that legislation  in the House; a task that was assigned to me by our former whip, Tony  Cuello of California.   The ADA is an example of what we can do together, in a bipartisan  way, to protect equal rights and help Americans access opportunities to  get ahead, to be included, to be a part of one Nation indivisible.   It was a landmark piece of civil rights legislation which passed the  House and Senate with strong, bipartisan support, and was signed into  law, as I said, by President George H.W. Bush.   And when the Supreme Court ruled a narrow interpretation of the law  that was overly limiting, Democrats and Republicans came together to  pass the ADA Amendments Act in 2008, to restore the original intent and  expand on its protections.   The ADA hasn't just led to the construction of accessible spaces, it  has also helped change America's perception of those with disabilities.  And it brought dignity and recognition to millions who previously were  excluded and thought to be lesser-than because of their disabilities.   I have often said that the bill was misnamed. It should have been  called the Americans with Abilities Act. Drop the ``dis.'' Drop dissing  people. Understand what they can do, which is what is important.   Over the past 30 years, the ADA has made it possible for so many of  our fellow citizens to participate in the workforce, in government, and  in every area of our society in ways they were previously unable to do  without great difficulty.   The law, Mr. Speaker, breathed new life into the words of our  Declaration, that all are ``created equal, that they are endowed by  their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   Indeed, the ADA was, in so many ways, a declaration of independence  for the millions of Americans living with disabilities, yearning not  only to be seen and accepted, but to be treated equally as they pursue  happiness and the American Dream.   And it set a global standard, with its provisions adopted by  literally scores of other countries throughout the world, so that the  actions of this body and the United States Senate, and President George  H.W. Bush were a signal to the world to include your citizens as well.   As we celebrate this anniversary, Mr. Speaker, let us remember that  Americans with disabilities still face many hurdles in employment,  education, access to healthcare, accessible technology, and the ability  to live independently.   Mr. Speaker, I hope our country will use this moment, not only to  reflect on the enormous differences we have made for people with  disabilities, but also to rededicate ourselves to the task of  continuing that work.   I want to take a moment to thank a number of my colleagues and former  colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were instrumental in getting  the ADA passed and signed into law.   But before I mention them, let me mention the literally unnamed,  unknown thousands of people with disabilities who had the courage and  the conviction to come to this body and say to us, I have great  ability, but I am being shut out. Hear me. See me. Help me. And we  responded, as a country, as a Congress.    Among them, of course, I have mentioned Tony Cuello, but then there  was Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Bob Dole, Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator  David Durenberger, Steve Bartlett, as well as Ham Fish, Teddy Kennedy,  Major Owens, and Silvio Conte, who are no longer with us.   And, of course, the late President George H.W. Bush.   I want to thank the many advocates who were instrumental in building  grassroots support for the ADA, as well as the Congressional and White  House staff.   I would mention my own staff, Melissa Shulman, who did such an  extraordinary job in shepherding the ADA through multiple committees,  through hundreds of hours of discussion and debate as to how to make  this a viable document, a workable document for inclusion and honoring  the dignity of those with disabilities.   We worked late nights and we produced a text and built consensus.   I want to mention, in particular, Chai Feldblum, former lead attorney  for the ACLU at the time and, later, an Equal Employment Opportunity  Commissioner, as well as former White House Counsel Boyden Gray, under  President Bush.   I also, again, want to thank Melissa Shulman, who served on my staff  and was critical to getting this law enacted.   I want to thank Representatives Jim Langevin and Don Young, who today  serve as co-chairs of the Congressional Disability Caucus.  Representative Young, of course, was also involved in the passage of  the law.   There are too many others--including the former chairman of the House  Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin, Jim Sensenbrenner-- to name here, individuals who gave their time, energy, and talents to  making the ADA possible.   I want to mention Senator Orrin Hatch, who worked so diligently in  the Senate, not only on the passage of the bill, but on the amendments  as well, passed years later, after the Supreme Court tried to narrow  the protections afforded by the Americans with Disabilities Act.   And I am proud to join my friend from Rhode Island, Representative  Langevin, in introducing a resolution today to recognize the importance  of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a celebration of the  advancement of inclusion, and recognize the barriers that still remain  for people with disabilities.  [[Page H3844]]    Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join in supporting that  resolution, and in celebrating this anniversary as well, in our shared  commitment to further progress in the march for the rights, dignity,  and full equality of those with disabilities.           Recognizing and Honoring the Service of Michael Collins     Mr. Speaker, we will honor next week, as we have honored  this week, an extraordinary American, John Robert Lewis. He will lie in  state just a few yards from here. He will be honored by thousands who  will walk by the Capitol and his casket, and that will be right.   In the Gospel of Matthew, Christians read, and others read, the  parable of the talents, in which a returning master praises his  servants for being good stewards of his house.   ``Well done, good and faithful servant,'' he says.   Last Friday, I believe that God welcomed John Lewis into His embrace  with those very same words: ``Well done, thou good and faithful  servant.''   Faithful to his God, faithful to our people, and faithful to his  country. For such he was, God's faithful servant on Earth, spending his  life in service to all of God's children, to their equal dignity and  equal rights, to their safety and success.   That is how he approached his service as a Congressman as well.   Those of us who served with John in this House and who were his  friends know that he did not perform that work alone.   And, therefore, I rise to honor, to thank, and to revere another good  and faithful servant. His name, Michael Collins. We all know him. He  was, arguably, John's closest friend, closest confidant, and greatest  supporter. His Chief of Staff deserves great praise for not only all he  did for John Lewis, but for all of us.   Michael Collins was at John's side for more than two decades as his  chief adviser, confidant, and manager of his Washington office. Michael  did not just work for John. They were family. Not ``like'' family; they  were family.   Michael was like a second son to John Lewis, and all of us who are  grieving with John Lewis' family this week have been grieving with  Michael as well. A void will exist in his life that we should all help  fill. Thank him.   Michael was an example, Mr. Speaker, of the best of those who work  for this institution, the House of Representatives. Those who sit at  the desk, those who appear on the floor with us, those who work in our  offices, those who work back in our districts, they do it because they  love their country.   And I know, Mr. Speaker, for myself, I love those who work with me.  And my great benefit in life is they love me. We Baptists would call it  an agape love; not a physical love, but a love of spirit, a love of  soul, a love of vision.   Michael Collins and John Robert Lewis were of one mind, of one  spirit, and Michael reflected the best that was in John Lewis. Let us  all do the same. Michael Collins can be an example for all of us.   When I called John for the last time--actually, Michael Collins  called me. It was Saturday, before the Friday of John's passing. And he  put John on the phone with me. He said, Mr. Hoyer, John would like to  talk to you.   His was a weak voice, but a strong conviction, evidencing the courage  he displayed throughout his life.   And, of course, Mr. Speaker, I cried because I knew that it was  probably the last time that I would talk to John. And I am so thankful  to Michael Collins that he got me on the phone so that I could say  goodbye to my dear, dear friend.                                time  0930    It was a dear, dear friend, Michael Collins, who got him on the phone  from Atlanta with me.   As we mourn John this week, I have heard from countless people,  telling me how much Michael made sure John never missed an opportunity  to do good, to do right, and to do justice.   So on behalf of us all, I want to thank Michael.   Michael Collins enriched John's life as John enriched his. He took  good care of our friend, and he was at John's side with such loyalty  and good counsel for all those years.   To him, let us all say: Well done, good and faithful servant.   God blessed John Lewis with Michael Collins, and God blessed us all  with John Lewis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I will say that on Monday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business, with  votes expected to occur, Madam Speaker, approximately 12 p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will not be in session as we pay respect to  Congressman John Lewis while he lies in state.   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate  and 10 a.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate  and 10 a.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that votes on  Thursday will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.   I know that all Members would like to attend the funeral on Thursday  of our brother and great Member and great American John Lewis, however,  COVID-19 makes a small-group-only possible. And we will be returning,  which is why votes will be delayed until the 6:30 hour.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Members are advised that last votes could occur later than 3 p.m.   We got out earlier today, and I want to congratulate our floor  director, Shuwanza Goff, who got us a schedule that is working very,  very well.   The suspension bills will be announced by the close of business  today.   The House will consider two childcare bills. H.R. 7027 would create a  $50 billion Child Care Stabilization Fund within the existing Child  Care and Development Block Grant. This would immediately address the  problems childcare providers are having in staying open and covering  their increased operating costs with limited revenue during this  pandemic.   The House will also consider H.R. 7327, Child Care for Economic  Recovery Act. This bill would expand the availability of childcare by  providing tax relief to families, providers, and employees,  significantly increasing funds for the Child Care Entitlement to States  programs, providing funds to improve childcare safety and  infrastructure and ensure dependent care for essential workers during  the pandemic and recognizing all childcare workers are essential.   These two bills are obviously a response to the extraordinary  challenge to childcare providers and those who need childcare services.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 7617, the  Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development,  Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2021 appropriations bill.   With that, we will have passed most--almost 97 percent, maybe 98  percent, of the spending requirements of the Nation for the year to  come.   Members are advised that additional legislative items are possible,  which we  [[Page H3850]]  will be discussing with the minority as well.   Lastly, Members are further advised that conversations are ongoing  regarding additional coronavirus relief legislation.   Members should keep their schedules flexible for the week of August  3. Let me remind Members that are listening, and on the floor, the week  of August 3 was scheduled to be a week where we would begin the August  work period. However, the Senate is not beginning its August work  period until August 8. It is very likely, therefore, that we may not  reach an agreement on COVID-19 until that week.   I want to tell all Members that it is the intention of the Speaker  and myself not to go on a work period until such time as we have passed  legislation, hopefully, in a bipartisan way, and sent it to the  President and the President signs it, which will help the American  people, American businesses, and our country meet the ever-growing,  quickly metastasizing crisis that we are confronting.   Further information regarding the timing of a coronavirus relief bill  will be announced as soon as possible.   I would simply add that I will make a determination, along with  discussions with others, including the minority, next week at some  point in time as to exactly how we should schedule. I think it will  depend upon where we are in the negotiations and how quickly we can  reach an agreement on COVID-19 legislation.    I have spoken a lot about John. I spoke this morning about  John and about his extraordinary chief of staff, Michael Collins, who  was such a positive part of his life and who exhibits so many of the  traits that made John Lewis a wonderful, good, decent person who loved  all of his brothers and sisters, whoever they were, whatever color they  had, whatever religion they pursued. John Lewis was the best of us, and  we will honor him appropriately.   He will be one of the few Americans who is laid in state in the  rotunda, in the center of our democracy, in the symbol of a free  people. John Lewis deserves that honor. He enhances that honor by being  so honored.   And I thank the gentleman for his comments.    Will the gentleman yield?    I thank the gentleman for his comments.   As the gentleman knows, we passed a bill on May 15th that included  within that bill $100 billion for specific assistance--not from the  State's excess funds, but specifically for educational institutions to  accommodate the expenditures necessary to provide for safe schooling.   I will tell you, I represent five counties. We only have 23 counties  in Maryland. We have relatively few political jurisdictions in our  State, unlike some, who have many, many and are smaller. All five of  the counties that I represent, including one of the largest school  districts in the country, Prince George's County, have decided through  their elected school boards to open up virtually. And they are  following the medical advice and the advice of scientists as to how  that can be done.   I think all of us hope that our children can go back to school as  quickly as possible. I will tell the gentleman, I have three great- grandchildren, all of them in school. My granddaughter is  extraordinarily happy with how the teachers of those three students-- one is in pre-K, one is in third grade, and one is in seventh grade-- how well the teachers have responded to the parents and to the  children. But everybody wants to go back to school.   I will tell you, I received a text from my granddaughter shortly  after the President spoke about, well, you have to go back to school,  and she said: ``He-pop,'' which is what she calls me--``He-pop, I am  terrified about sending our kids back to school.''                                time  1345    We need to get an agreement. We passed a bill over 2 months ago  through this House, and unfortunately, our friends in the United States  Senate have not passed a bill, so we don't have anything to go to  conference with.   Unfortunately, yesterday, we learned that the Senate can't agree with  itself on the Republican side of the aisle and has not got an agreement  with the administration. So at this point in time, as the gentleman  knows, we have no alternative, frankly, to discuss. But we are hopeful  that that will happen soon. We are hopeful that at least the Senate  Republicans will come to an agreement on an alternative they want to  suggest, and then we can discuss that.   Frankly, in order for the Senate to pass something, it has to be  bipartisan, and there has been no bipartisan agreement reached at this  point either. So, we will wait. Hopefully, there will be an  alternative, and hopefully, we can move forward quickly.    Madam Speaker, let me respond to my friend.   Obviously, if there is money that we have already appropriated that  is not needed and not disbursed, I think the gentleman is right that we  can reallocate that and repurpose that money. So, that can be part of  it. But we sort of need to get to some parameters that the other side,  meaning the Senate, can put forward.   Secondly, let me say, I did, in fact, say when we were out for some  period of time that I would give 72 hours' notice. I can't promise that  today. The reason I can't promise it today is because we are going to  have literally millions of people who are without help after the 31st  of this month.   As you know, the unemployment insurance goes out. In the HEROES bill,  of course, we extended that unemployment insurance until January 31 of  next year, as you know.   What I can say and what I have told my Members is that if in fact we  can't get an agreement, and it doesn't appear that we can come to the  floor Monday or Tuesday, I think that is the 3rd or the 4th of August-- I think the 1st and 2nd of August are Saturday and Sunday. So, the 3rd  and 4th or 5th, if we can't get an agreement before then, there is no  point in having Members sitting in their offices, twiddling their  thumbs. I agree with that.   I will have discussions with you and with Leader McCarthy. We will  certainly not want to keep your Members here just waiting while  negotiations are going on.   I certainly will assure every Member that they will have 24 hours'  notice. But the need for action is so great and the consequences of  inaction so harmful, that I think we need to act as soon as we possibly  can. And that 48 hours difference may make a difference to a lot of  people. So, I will give an assurance that there will be 24 hours'  notice, but I cannot give a 72-hour notice assurance.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question and  his comments. Let me say this. I think we have a different perspective  on where we are in this country. In point of fact, I think there is  reason for great, great, grave concern about what we see as an  explosion, not just of testing. If it were just testing--but it is of  hospitalizations and of deaths.   We have seen a geometric increase in the number of sick people, not  just because they were tested, but because of a very heightened number  of sick people. There are some areas of the country which, frankly,  leadership was very vigorous in imposing what some felt were draconian  requirements, but which did, in fact, apparently make a significant  difference in the transmittal of the disease one to another.   So we see the situation as more dire. We certainly agree with you  that we are hopeful to accelerate--we have made big investments in not  only a vaccine but therapeutics. There are some therapeutics that seem  to be working in some respects. The sooner we can get there, the more  confidence there will be in the American people that they can reengage,  that we can restart and not only see one another, but do business with  one another, and commerce can be pursued vigorously.   We are not heartened by the figures. I know our President talks about  things getting better, but we don't see it that way. We don't think the  figures confirm that, which is sad for our country. Therefore, we need  to continue to take the precautions we need. But having said that, let  me speak to the proxy voting.   I know your side has been very concerned about the proxy voting. A, I  don't think the proxy voting has made any difference in the outcomes of  the decisions we have made in this House. B, a relatively small  number--I know the last time we met, there were some 30. I am not sure  this time, I think it is less this time.   Let me say, I agree with the gentleman. I have talked to some  Members. It is not for when you have another thing to do. It is not for  doing something you would rather do. I can name a number of Members--I  won't--on your side and my side who have significant health problems  and challenges, either themselves or in their families, and, therefore,  they are concerned about not so much getting together on this floor,  but we don't live on this floor. We have places that we live and eat,  and we go to the cleaners.   So, it is not just on this floor where we have wipes and sanitizer  and a way to keep us healthy, and we do wear masks, most people wear  masks. Unfortunately, all of us don't wear masks, and I think that is  not good judgment.   But the proxy voting has really not made any difference in whether  this House has been able to act.   How long will it go on? Right now, we are seeing an explosion of  cases, an explosion of infections. Certainly, during that explosion, it  is no time to say to people--and, again, I almost want to mention names  because you will know the folks. They are not feigning it. Most of them  are somewhere around my age who are very concerned about their health,  the health of their families, and the health of those to whom they will  go home from here if they come here.    I think the gentleman is absolutely right. Speaker Pelosi, myself,  Leader McCarthy, Leader McConnell, and I think Senator Schumer, have  all said, as you have just said, it is better for us to be here  together, to interchange with one another, discuss with one another, to  make suggestions to one another, to have that personal engagement that  I think makes for a healthier legislative environment.   But until we can do that with safety and ensure Members that if they  come here that they will not be a danger for themselves or for others-- and the doctors advise us that the pandemic is still a danger to us-- then we will continue to follow this rule.   But I want to assure you that I make it very clear to Members: The  rule contemplates a danger to health to individuals or others, and that  is why the proxy is available to them.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, what I said to him was I agree with him on  that point. But if Mr. Scalise wants to make it again, he can make it.   But I made it to my Members. I agree. It is for illness. It is for  the threat of illness. It is not for convenience.    I thank the gentleman.
