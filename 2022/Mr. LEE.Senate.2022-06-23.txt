 Mr. President, for months, American moms and dads have  endured an unprecedented baby formula shortage.   All of us know someone that this crisis has personally affected. In  May alone, reports showed that the out-of-stock rate jumped from 43  percent to 74 percent nationally. In my home State of Utah, that out- of-stock rate is much higher.   And while the Biden administration made ambitious attempts to invoke  the Defense Production Act and fly in formula from other countries,  these efforts ultimately provided less than 2 days' worth of formula  for our country's hungry babies--less than 2 days.   So yesterday, I took to the floor asking that this body take  immediate action to address our Nation's massive  [[Page S3109]]  formula shortage by unanimously passing my FORMULA Act, something that  I have come repeatedly to the Senate floor in an effort to pass and it  has been met with objections so far.   My bill included three measures to accomplish this goal. The first  was a regulatory component, one that would remove certain FDA  requirements for imported formula, mostly dealing with labeling. And I  will explain more about that one in a moment. The second removed the  restrictions that limited the availability of formula brands available  to WIC recipients. And, finally, the bill temporarily suspended import  tariffs on formula, increasing supply and decreasing consumer costs.   These three components would provide immediate relief to anxiety- ridden parents who were forced to scour supermarkets, make dangerous  homemade formula, or, even worse, hospitalize their infants.   I need not explain why a problem of this magnitude is so deserving of  our immediate attention.   After addressing the Senate on each of these topics, I engaged in a  lengthy and substantive debate with my friend and distinguished  colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Bob Casey. I listened intently to  his objections regarding his concern for the safety and quality of  formula crossing over our borders.   And while I appreciate my colleague's concerns, I still believe that  this body can and must fix this problem, a problem that is, no doubt,  the sole creation of the Federal Government. It is no accident, for  example, that we are the only country facing this particular shortage.   No other country is dealing with this because our country and our own  Federal laws in this area and the way they have been enforced and  implemented have caused it.   So I am determined to provide relief to families dealing with this  inexplicably, unnecessarily prolonged crisis.   For far too long, the people enduring this mess have gone without  answers. And so in the spirit of comity and compromise, I have modified  my request by removing the FDA regulatory component of the bill. I  hoped that this would resolve any reservations that my colleague from  Pennsylvania may have had regarding the safety of these products.   And I should add here, those concerns are not concerns that I agree  with for the simple reason that the countries that, under my bill, we  would have allowed to produce formula, to have that formula introduced  into the United States, they are countries that we have already  identified as having safe regulatory systems.   They are countries with regulatory systems that are strong enough, in  fact, that we allow imports of their pharmaceutical products produced  in those countries because their standards are as rigorous as those  imposed by our own FDA.   Nonetheless, I offered to remove that and made that a request for  passage by unanimous consent. Still, my friend objected to expanding  the range of products available to WIC recipients. Remember, this  component to the bill would have simply allowed American moms and dads  who were beneficiaries under the WIC program to use their vouchers to  purchase any form of formula they would prefer, or more commonly these  days, any form of formula that is available. Whereas, right now, the  WIC vouchers require you to stick to the brand specified on the  vouchers in question.   My distinguished colleague objected also to that version of what I  offered, despite the retention of FDA regulatory authority and the fact  that wealthy Americans are personally importing these products already  from Europe.   And while I find this unfortunate, I was still determined to make an  argument and to, ultimately, formulate an agreement consistent with  that argument to fix a problem that our Federal Government has made and  has created and in which it has made no discernible progress in its  attempts to resolve it.   So, again, in the spirit of comity and compromise and a willingness  to do absolutely whatever it takes to provide whatever relief we can  provide to hungry babies throughout America suffering from  malnutrition, I modified my request yet again. This time to include  only the provisions related to the tariff suspension.    And while I am hopeful that we will be able to come together to  address the concerns of my colleagues and pass the first two provisions  of my bill as well, I hope to report today to families across the  country that my legislation has achieved unanimous support and passed  the Senate.   This would be an incredible win for families and for hungry babies  nationwide. My bill would make meaningful headway in dealing with an  issue that some doctors call ``the worst crisis of their careers.''   By suspending the import tariff on formula imports or providing  cheaper access to formulas to individual consumers and to retailers  alike, no longer will access to these safe formulas be limited to a  select group of wealthy individuals because, again, wealthy individuals  have been able to pay the higher prices and suffer the inconvenience of  going online or otherwise making a special order on their own of these  European formulas.   Again, these European formulas from the countries that we are talking  about--countries covered by the bill--are countries that produce safe,  effective formula and that are regulated by regulatory bodies that are  every bit as stringent as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And on  that basis, in fact, we import pharmaceutical products from those same  countries.   Currently, formula is produced in those countries, countries like  France and Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Babies there do just  fine on those formulas. In fact, they do great. And some American  families have been able to benefit from those formulas as they have  ordered it online, but they pay higher prices, and they have to deal  with restrictions that make it more difficult to access those things.  So this bill will open that up.   This is relief that really is long overdue, particularly for Utahns  who have the largest families, the most children per capita, and, also,  the highest birthrate.   Not coincidentally, those are some of the same reasons why the baby  formula shortage is felt so acutely in Utah, but it is being felt  acutely throughout the United States.   I hope that we can come together and pass even more meaningful  reforms that will help solve the problem completely and once and for  all.   I am grateful, however, that the countless hours of behind-the-scenes  work and successful negotiations with my colleagues on a bipartisan  basis have resulted in a win for the most vulnerable Americans. Passing  my FORMULA Act is a victory for families and for babies in Utah and  everywhere else in the United States.   And so, to that end, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 372, S. 4261.    I ask unanimous consent that the Lee substitute amendment at  the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the bill  before us.   All too often, we very often applaud instinctively the concept of  ``bipartisanship'' but fail to actually evaluate the policies  underlying bipartisan legislation and the effect that our policies may  have on law-abiding Americans.   Bipartisanship is a good thing. In fact, bipartisanship is an  inevitability in any legislative body that contains multiple parties  with significant representation. It certainly is an indispensable  feature of this legislative body, as it is virtually impossible to pass  any legislation--with only the rarest of exceptions arising at most  once or twice in a year--except through bipartisanship.   The question isn't whether to achieve bipartisanship or whether it is  good but what policies are produced through the bipartisanship in  question.   Don't get me wrong--in this polarized climate, it is good when people  of different political affiliations and different backgrounds,  representing different parts of our great country, are able to come  together and have productive conversations. These conversations occur  with some regularity. In fact, they occur far more often than most  people would assume based on depictions in the news and entertainment  media in this country.   It is also good when those conversations lead to legislation that is  further refined on the Senate floor through robust debate and an  amendment process, one that refines the legislation in question to make  sure that all viewpoints have been taken into account. But that is,  tragically, not what happened with this legislation. No one--no one  except a small ``gang'' of Senators and a few favored members of the  news media--no one was allowed to view the legislation until Tuesday  evening. Less than an hour later, less than an hour after it had been  released to the public, released to us, the Senate was forced to vote  on whether we should proceed to the legislation in question.   Immediately after that vote, the majority leader filled the amendment  tree and filed the cloture motion to end debate on the bill without a  single hearing held or a single amendment having been debated or  considered or even offered. In fact, it couldn't be offered because  prior to that time, there was nothing to amend.   Now, less than 48 hours after we received the text of this  legislation for the very first time, the Senate has voted to end  debate--a debate that never really started; a debate that involved not  a single amendment passed--no, not one single one; a debate in which  there was not a single opportunity for Members to offer improvements to  the legislation. No. This small gang came together, materialized, and  put together a bill. It released the bill, and all of a sudden, we were  expected to vote on it up or down, yes or no, no changes, no questions  asked.   Those of us who are not members of this particular gang were told,  essentially: Too bad. We don't want your input. Your only option is to  support this entire bill, warts and all, ambiguities and all, vagueness  and all, without any changes; or, on the other hand, you can oppose it,  and you would be accused of savagely not wanting to protect children  from school shootings.   That is not what our Founding Fathers envisioned for the U.S. Senate.  It is not how they imagined it working. It is also not how it worked  for hundreds of years.   For more than two centuries, the U.S. Senate functioned in a way that  has had as its distinguishing characteristic those procedures that  earned it the title of being the world's greatest deliberative body.  Chief among those features was the willingness and the ability of each  Member to offer up improvements in the form of amendments and have  those amendments considered, debated, discussed, and ultimately voted  upon.   But, unfortunately, this is how the Senate has been run over the last  few Congresses. Sadly, we have seen some of this under Democratic and  Republican leadership alike. This isn't just bad news for the Senate;  it is especially bad news for the American people, who deserve better  from an entity that still calls itself the world's greatest  deliberative body.    It is not without notice that this has become a problem. It is not  without notice that we have deviated from this. The thing is, when we  deviate from our own procedure and our own processes, the substance  shows. The inadequacies of the substance are the natural, foreseeable  result. They are the inevitable product of a defiant refusal to abide  by our most time-honored procedures: rules and customs.   In this case, the substantive problems with this bill are pretty  significant. The restrictions that it imposes on the Second Amendment  rights of law-abiding Americans are significant, and those impositions  come about in such a way that burdens the American people, while doing  little or nothing to address actual gun violence committed by  prohibited persons in many of our largest cities.   You would think that a bill that purports to be able to keep kids  safe in schools would at least have some funding for school security  measures or school resource officers, but if you felt that, you would  be wrong.   I am very skeptical of Federal intervention in education. If Congress  is going to provide billions of dollars of mental health funding to  schools and claim to keep kids safe, we should at least allow States to  use some of their funding for security measures, like reinforced doors,  school resource officers, or training programs for teachers who are  allowed to conceal and carry if they choose.   This bill provides Federal grant funding for State red flag laws  without sufficient due process protections. This is a trick--a trick-- often used by Congress, increasingly so of late. Congress does this  sometimes when it has no constitutional authority and sometimes when it  lacks political will.   Instead of passing the Federal law at issue--the Federal law that it  wishes it could pass--Congress bribes the States with money to pass the  laws that Congress wants, that Congress wishes Congress could pass but  for whatever reason can't or won't. This allows Members of Congress to  go to their home States and take credit for doing ``something,'' even  if that ``something'' does nothing to address the problem.   That impulse to do something has been noticed. It has been noticed by  Professor Robert Leider of George Mason University and the Antonin  Scalia Law School. He penned an op-ed in today's copy of the Wall  Street Journal. In that op-ed, he begins with the following words:         When mass shootings such as Uvalde happen, a rallying cry       emerges for Congress to do something--anything--to prevent       such tragedies in the future. On Tuesday, senators introduced       the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act--their effort to do       something. But when your sole rallying cry is to do       something, the thing you do may be worse than the status quo.       The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a terrible bill, and       in its current form, it ought to be defeated by a bipartisan       coalition of Congress.    Professor Leider then goes on to explain why opposition to this  legislation ought to be coming from the left and from the right. He  explains in great detail why Democrats and Republicans, liberals and  conservatives alike, sometimes for similar reasons, sometimes for  different reasons, should be outraged, should be upset by this  legislation. It offends people at every end of the political spectrum.  I will go more into some of those details in a moment from Professor  Leider.   But, look, when the government seeks to deprive an American citizen-- a law-abiding American citizen--of a constitutional right, we have  protections in place, and those protections can be found among other  provisions in the Constitution. They can be found in the 5th and 14th  Amendments to the Constitution. In both provisions, you have a due  process clause. In both the 5th and the 14th Amendments, it says that a  person can't be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due  process of law.   What does ``due process'' mean? Well, ``due process'' means the right  to be heard. You can't have a deprivation of life, liberty, or property  without due process. The word ``without'' has been interpreted and  fairly does mean ``before.'' You have to have due process before they  take it away from you. It  [[Page S3129]]  means meaningful review at a meaningful time. It doesn't--it can't mean  they can take away life, liberty, or property and then ask questions  later. It doesn't mean they can take away life, liberty, and property  and thereafter demand that the person from whom they took it return to  litigate his or her right to exercise that thing that was taken.   Red flag laws enacted in States thus far get this exactly backward-- confiscation first; due process later. That is not how due process  works. That is not what due process is. You can call that process, but  it is not due process, not for these purposes. It doesn't work.   The confiscation before notice and a hearing, this model--this  confiscation before notice and hearing model of red flag laws raises  concerns of civil asset forfeiture, when a person is forced to forfeit  her firearm pursuant to a civil order without a hearing.   This legislation places overly broad and undefined restrictions on  Second Amendment rights--the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding  citizens--creating the risk that false allegations could and inevitably  would lead to the deprivation of a constitutional right with no  recourse afforded to address the harm suffered.   Now, when you look at the legislation, there are pieces of the  legislation that pay lipservice to due process. While the legislation,  you might say, draws near unto due process with its lips, its heart is  far from it. When you read the fine print, the due process of which it  refers is not due process at all; it is post-depravation due process.   The very specific procedural protections that we associate with due  process--an opportunity to be heard before a fair, impartial tribunal;  the opportunity to offer up evidence; the opportunity to cross-examine  adverse witnesses, for example--things that we associate as  inextricably intertwined with due process because they are, those  things are all articulated at the back end of this due process  paragraph of the bill.   And it makes reference to the fact that that is the type of due  process that, in the view of the bill, can, according to State law, be  made either before or after the constitutional depravation in question,  depending on the dictates of the State law at issue. That is not due  process; that is something else, and that creates a lot of problems.   There are other problems with the legislation dealing with juveniles,  problems arising out of uncertainties that the legislation itself  creates.   Now, I want to be clear about something: I could certainly consider  supporting a measure prohibiting certain older juveniles who have been  convicted of crimes as adults, crimes that if they had been committed  by an adult would have been deemed felonies, and, on that basis, deem  them prohibited persons. I could consider that. There are a lot of  public policy questions surrounding that.   And I think there are a lot of people on the left and on the right  who would have concerns with opening that up, with saying: We are going  to allow--in fact, require--juvenile records to be entered into the  NICS system. Remember, the NICS system is a database, a database that  is used to identify prohibited persons, persons who are prohibited from  buying or otherwise acquiring or even possessing firearms and  ammunition, as defined by 18 U.S.C. section 922(g) or, alternatively,  persons to whom one may not lawfully sell or otherwise transfer  firearms or ammunition, as defined by 18 U.S.C. section 922(d). Both  922(d) that talks about those to whom you may not transfer a weapon and  922(g), those who may not acquire or possess a weapon--both provisions  have nine paragraphs attached to them. In each instance, the nine  paragraphs are virtually identical. In other words, the universe of  those who may not buy or possess weapons is essentially the same as  those to whom you may not sell them.   It is almost essential--in fact, the only distinction I can think of  under existing law is that while under 922(g) you may not possess a  firearm if you are a convicted felon, that same prohibition extends in  922(d) in such a way that you may not sell or otherwise transfer a  firearm to a person who is either a convicted felon or has been  indicted for a felony and is standing under indictment, under currently  pending criminal charges. Other than that, as far as I can tell, 922(d)  and 922(g) are coextensive.   This legislation changes that a little bit, and it prohibits the  transfer of a weapon, under 922(d), to a person who, as a juvenile,  stood convicted of a crime that would be a felony. Now, this creates  all sorts of uncertainties in the law because, in many if not most  States, juvenile proceedings--what we would consider juvenile criminal  proceedings--are, in fact, not criminal proceedings. The defendant  isn't entitled to a jury trial. And in the Federal criminal system, a  juvenile criminal defendant may not have a jury trial; that even if  they want one, even if all the parties were to agree, they can't allow  them.   In many State systems, including the State system in my State, the  State of Utah, juvenile criminal proceedings are not even criminal  proceedings; they are civil proceedings, very often conducted under  civil law procedures rather than criminal law procedures. So the same  protections aren't in place.   Again, I am open to the idea of opening this up because I think there  are some juveniles who commit some offenses, particularly in their  later teenage years, that perhaps ought to be taken into account for  purposes of 922(d) such that you can't give them a gun or under 922(g)  such that they may not possess a gun without committing a felony.   I think we could have that debate and discussion. We should have that  debate and discussion. That hasn't occurred here. Instead, what we have  done is muddied the waters by creating a very significant difference  between 922(d) and 922(g), between those prohibited from being given a  gun and those who are prohibited from possessing a gun. But we haven't  defined it well, and it is not really clear what it is that we are  doing or what it is that makes it fair; nor is it clear, as I read the  legislation--and, again, it has been less than 48 hours since we have  had access to it. It is about 80 pages long. It doesn't read like a  fast-paced novel. It is full of cross-references.   And even someone such as a former Federal prosecutor who is very  familiar with these laws and prosecuted cases under them--even with  that level of familiarity, it has taken me some time to get through it  and understand what it means. In fact, to this moment, it is difficult  for me to ascertain exactly how far these changes go.   It is not clear to me, for instance, which kinds of criminal records  for juveniles will be added onto the NICS system. Remember, the NICS  system is this database that identifies those prohibited from  possessing firearms or being given firearms under 922(g) and 922(d),  respectively. It is a database that keeps track of those prohibited  persons. It is not clear to me which types of juvenile records can be  taken into account in those proceedings.    This also allows for a prohibited--one can be a prohibited person  under 922(d) and 922(g) if they have been adjudicated--and this is  terribly awkward language--if they have been adjudicated as a ``mental  defective'' or if they have been ordered institutionalized. No one  really knows what that term means. It is a sloppy term. It is an  offensive term to many, and it is full of uncertainty.   We have compounded the uncertainty by now saying that mental health  records of older teenagers, those between 16 and 18, will now be  uploaded onto the NICS system such that certain mental health crises  one experiences as an older teenager could result in an older teenager  later in life being unable to possess a firearm without committing a  felony.   That raises some concerns--or at least those drafting the bill would  probably interpret it differently, to say they may possess one in some  cases but not necessarily be someone to whom a gun can lawfully be sold  or otherwise transferred. That also raises additional questions.  Sections 922(d) and 922(g) are currently nearly identical, except in  the rare exception that I noted just a moment ago.   Yet we have had no conversations about these. We have had no  conversations about what this does for juvenile criminal justice, about  what this does to the rights of individuals who, as juveniles, may not  fully understand the ramifications of the criminal proceedings against  them or of decisions regarding their mental health at the  [[Page S3130]]  time those decisions are made and that might affect them later in life,  including after they have become adults.   My point is not to say these things don't matter. They do. And I  think there are a lot of these people who probably shouldn't have guns  and should be prohibited persons, but we need to know what we are  doing. We need to agree on what is actually happening because right now  we take some areas of the law that are already fraught with some  uncertainty, and we are magnifying that uncertainty manyfold.   I think that is dangerous, and I think it is dangerous in a way that  both Democrats and Republicans ought to find offensive--sometimes for  the same reasons, sometimes for entirely different reasons. My point is  this. There is no reason why legislation like this--it does--it has got  some good provisions in it. There is no reason why this couldn't be  amended in such a way that would allow more Members of this body to  vote for it or vote against it, depending on what it looked like at the  end of the day.   But the way it is written, it has got a lot of problems with it. We  have got the due process problem that I mentioned with the red flag  laws. That is their distinguishing characteristic is due process  problem. You have got the juvenile records problem that I mentioned  just a moment ago. It is not fair to people to leave them in that state  of uncertainty, especially juveniles. So that ought to be a concern to  all of us.   Perhaps we might get to the place where these provisions do just what  the proponents of the bill say that it does. But in this instance, as  in so many other areas, the best way to get there is to go through the  normal deliberative process, the process that long defined this  institution as the world's greatest deliberative body, which includes a  full opportunity to present and vote on amendments and to hear concerns  and objections raised by Members of this body, Members of this body  some of whom have experience with the statutory framework in question  and can offer insights as to what might have been overlooked.   Now, look, I speak here of my colleagues who were part of this  effort. I speak with great respect toward them and admiration for the  fact that I think they are motivated, by and large, by a desire to help  people. I don't think any Member of this body wakes up every day and  says, ``I want to make America less safe'' or ``I want to make America  less fair.'' I don't think that is what is going on.   But I do think we delude ourselves, we sell ourselves short, and we  harm our constituents when we pretend that it is OK to pull the  functional equivalent, the legislative equivalent, of running through a  congested intersection with our eyes closed and think that that is not  going to cause problems. That is exactly what we are doing here. This  is the legislative equivalent of driving with your eyes closed through  a busy intersection, and we are making some really big mistakes here.  And a lot of these are mistakes that could be fixed with relative ease.   Now we will never know. We will never know what might have happened.  It may be that this could have been something that, had we gone through  the whole amendment process, could have been supported by nearly all or  even all Members of this body, but we will never know of that now. We  will never have that opportunity. Instead, we are going to push through  this rushed piece of legislation that I am convinced no one had read in  its entirety prior to its release and, essentially, no one was familiar  with by the time we started voting on it.   And then we were told: No opportunity to make it better. If you  notice a problem with it--and I have noticed several--we really don't  care to hear about it. Expediency demands that we somehow just rush  this through.   But the American people deserve better. There are, moreover, other  provisions of the legislation that have raised some eyebrows in some  corners. They are provisions of this bill that provide funding to  encourage States to provide Medicaid and CHIP services in schools under  the auspices of an effort to increase access to mental health, to  mental health services in the schools.   While Federal Medicaid funding is, of course, something that cannot  lawfully be used to perform abortions except in the case of rape,  incest, or to preserve the life of the mother, some have pointed out  that schools under this legislation easily could use the clinics  established under the bill as a means of accomplishing the provision of  abortions and also prescribe abortifacient drugs using State rather  than Federal Medicaid funds. There has been some discussion even today  about this. The fact that we still don't know this is troubling to  many. I certainly would like to know what the definitive answer to it  is. As far as I can tell, it does open the door to that, and we ought  to at least have that discussion.   Now, there are some legislative options before us that address things  that can be done practically to improve safety. One is the Luke and  Alex School Safety Act, which is included in this bill. Like I said,  there are plenty of things in this bill that are unobjectionable. And  this is, certainly, first among them. And it codifies into law the  Federal clearinghouse on school safety. I spoke in favor of this bill  at a Judiciary Committee hearing just last week.   Additionally, I support the bill's provisions increasing penalties  for straw purchasers who know or have reason to know that the gun they  are purchasing for someone might be used in a crime. And I am open to  other proposals that tackle safety in schools head-on.   Senator Marshall, from Kansas, has an interesting amendment that  would use unspent COVID funds to improve school safety and school  security.   Look, there are a lot of things in this legislation that really ought  to be discussed in greater detail. And we haven't been able to discuss  them. We haven't been able to debate them. We haven't been able to  amend them because of the rushed process. It begs the question: Why are  we in such a rush? Don't America's schoolchildren and America's  teachers and America's moms and dads deserve better consideration than  this?   Schools are out for the summer at the moment. It would actually be a  good thing for us to take a few more weeks to debate and discuss these  things and get to a better solution. Why are we rushing it?   I want to get back to the juvenile provisions for a minute. This is  something that Professor Leider speaks about at some length. And he  raised some observations that I hadn't entirely considered. And I would  like to share some portions of that. At the end of this, I will be  offering this.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this op-ed submitted by Professor Leider.   Professor Leider describes one feature of the bill as particularly  discouraging, particular troubling. I spoke of the juvenile provisions  a moment ago. I identified some troubling features of them. Professor  Leider gives additional commentary on this and provides additional  observations, not all of which had been noticed by me. Here is how he  puts it:         The most significant provision in the bill is the       prohibition against firearm possession by those convicted of       a misdemeanor violent crime against a dating partner--closing       the ``boyfriend loophole.''    He goes through this after he has discussed the problems with the  juvenile provisions, noting that this will create disparities. It will  cause uncertainties with juvenile offenders of one sort or another. And  then he does go through a fuller explanation of how those operating  under the boyfriend loophole provisions might be affected.   He continues:         But the senators who negotiated this bill evidently       couldn't agree on the definition of a dating partner. They       define ``dating relationship'' as a ``relationship between       individuals who have or have recently had a continuing       serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.'' But       relationships come in all forms, and this definition provides       little guidance.    He continues:         The senators provided three criteria for consideration: (1)       the length of the relationship, (2) the nature of the       relationship and (3) the frequency and type of interaction       between the people involved in the relationship.    Professor Leider continues:         This means that a ``continuing serious relationship'' will       be some function of quantity of dates, length of time and       physical intimacy. But these vague factors don't provide fair       notice and are susceptible to inconsistent application.    We pause there to just note what he is referring to. The so-called  boyfriend  [[Page S3131]]  loophole exists because two of the provisions in 18 USC 922(g),  defining the prohibitive persons, paragraphs 8 and 9 respectively,  apply to those individuals who have either been in receipt of a  restraining order arising out of a domestic relationship, under  paragraph 8, or those who have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of  domestic violence under paragraph 9 of 922(g).   In both cases, there has to be a relationship that makes it about a  domestic situation, has to be an intimate partner of one sort or  another. Current law tends to define that as a spouse--when you are  dealing with a spouse or a live-in partner, for example. But this  provision seeks to address what the sponsors of the bill referred to as  the ``boyfriend loophole,'' meaning what about someone who is not  married and who doesn't reside with or hasn't resided in the past,  didn't reside at the time with the person but was nonetheless in a type  of romantic relationship.   Now, here again, it is not a bad impulse to want to close some  ambiguities in the law, but you have got to do it with language that  makes sense. You have to do it with language that puts people on fair  notice of what the consequences of a guilty plea might be or what the  consequences of not litigating more aggressively in the context of a  restraining order or something like that might be. Particularly in the  context of 922(g)9, where we are dealing with a domestic violence  misdemeanor, the person needs to know when that person is being asked  to plead guilty what consequences that might have on the person later  in life. And those questions aren't answered here.   Professor Leider continues:         By failing to define ``dating relationship''--    The term ``dating relationship''--       [A]dequately--    That is the term of art that they introduced into this legislation--       Congress is effectively delegating the critical question of       who falls within this ban. To whom it is delegating the hard       details remains to be determined. Perhaps it will be to the       Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which       has regulatory authorities over firearms or the courts may       decide as they resolve cases. Either way, Congress has yet       again handed off its responsibility for defining crimes to       unelected bureaucrats and judges.    Then he continues:         Until a specific definition exists, it is unclear how the       federal government will implement this prohibition. Suppose a       criminal-records check indicates that a potential purchaser       has committed assault or battery. What next? Maybe the trial       record will show that the defendant was in a relationship       with the complaining witness. Or maybe it won't.        If such information is available, how is the examiner       supposed to gauge the relationship? The available records       likely won't provide the precise details of the relationship.       Even if they do, the examiner still has to decide whether the       relationship was serious enough to trigger the gun       disability. The Senate compromise feeds many prospective gun       owners to the bureaucratic wolves.    Professor Leider's point is an excellent one. When people are going  through criminal proceedings, if they have been charged with a  misdemeanor and they are deciding how aggressively to fight it--whether  to take it to trial, whether to plead guilty, under what terms to plead  guilty--it is nearly always going to be in State court. After all, very  few criminal convictions are in criminal court, a tiny percentage of  them. And the prohibited persons, as defined under sections 922(d) and  922(g), the underlying convictions can be either State or Federal.   These proceedings, nearly always taking place in State court rather  than Federal court, are not going to be in a position, it is not  knowing to be within their jurisdiction to decide whether, or to what  extent, this will put them in that status, in that boyfriend status, in  that status of a ``dating relationship.''   The fact that the term is so vague, the structure is so broad and  undefined that it is not reasonably possible to know what consequences  the law might attach to a guilty plea in that circumstance or to a  conviction following a jury trial in that circumstance.   You know, James Madison said, in ``Federalist No. 62''--and I am  paraphrasing here--something to the effect that it will be of little  avail to the American people that their laws may be written by  individuals of their own choosing. If those laws are so voluminous,  complex, or ever changing that they can't reasonably know from one day  to the next what the law requires of them, this is one of those  moments. We are imposing a pretty significant restriction--a  restriction on a constitutionally protected right, one that may well  apply for the rest of their life in some cases without them even  knowing what is happening.   This is the kind of rain that will fall on the criminal defendant of  all backgrounds, of all political views. Every demographic could be  harmed by this in one way or another. So it really would be better if  we were taking the time to draft this legislation carefully. And that  is my No. 1 complaint. That is why I can't vote for it.   There are some things in here I wish I could vote for, but they have  lumped it all together. They said: Here you go. Take it or leave it.   But, look, you put red flag laws in here, knowing the red flag laws,  the way we have now outsourced them to States and that we have now  started paying the States, giving them money to adopt red flag laws  whose distinguishing characteristic is to take away someone's  constitutionally protected right without due process of law--that is a  problem. And when you add to that complexity by adding uncertainty  about the juvenile records problem that I identified, which ought to be  concerning to many liberals as well as many conservatives, and when you  add to that by coming up with this vague, broad definition of ``dating  relationship,'' it has huge consequences with no reasonable ability to  understand and ascertain how certain court proceedings might affect  someone's rights, perhaps for the rest of their life, that is a  problem.   It doesn't have to be this way. I look forward to the day when the  Senate will operate the way that it was designed to, the way that it  once did, the way that, in fact, it has operated in the not-too-distant  past. But we have to demand it. As long as people continue to tolerate,  continue to accept and condone and reward and encourage this type of  sham process, we will be left with subpar legislation, sloppily  written.   I will conclude with the words, once again, of Professor Leider, who  says it well.         The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will likely pass       because members of Congress feel enormous pressure to do       something. But it is not a good bill, and it deserves further       deliberation and refinement. The Senate's job is to help       draft good laws by cooling the passions of the moment. Right       now, it is failing.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             (By Robert Leider)         ``When mass shootings such as Uvalde happen, a rallying cry       emerges for Congress to do something--anything--to prevent       such tragedies in the future. On Tuesday senators introduced       the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act--their effort to do       something. But when your sole rallying cry is to do       something, the thing you do may be worse than the status quo.       The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a terrible bill, and       in its current form, it ought to be defeated by a bipartisan       political coalition of Congress.        Liberals should hate the bill because most of its gun-      control provisions are antithetical to their criminal-justice       reform agenda. The law expands the categories of those to       whom it is unlawful to sell a gun or ammunition to include       anyone convicted of a felony as a juvenile. This will ensnare       many because the modern definition of a ``felony'' is       exceptionally broad and includes offenses that aren't       particularly serious. The bill also changes the federal       prohibition on selling firearms to those who have been       involuntarily committed to a mental institution. While it       excludes involuntary commitments before age 16, the bill       significantly strengthens the enforcement of the prohibition       against those involuntarily committed between 16 and 18.        We should be cautious before we make it impossible for       children to live normal adult lives. As liberals often point       out (particularly when the death penalty is involved),       children and teenagers lack maturity and impulse control. If       this bill becomes law, a 12-year-old who joyrides in a car       may find that he may never be allowed to purchase a gun or       ammunition. Although liberals may not cry at the thought of       fewer people being able to own guns, they should be       concerned. A gun ban for youthful indiscretions means that       these juveniles will become unemployable as adults in many       security, law-enforcement and military positions that require       firearm possession. And this ban will affect them no matter       how much time has passed since their juvenile convictions.        The gun ban would have significant racial and socioeconomic       disparities. Wealthy communities will find ways around the       gun ban for their children: having robust pretrial diversion       programs that don't result in technical convictions,       accessing pardons through the political process, and hiring       lawyers to  [[Page S3132]]       expunge convictions. In poorer communities, children will       simply be forced to take pleas that will forever alter their       futures. The same goes on the mental-health side: Wealthy       parents can seek voluntary treatment for their children in       circumstances that may cause poorer families to seek       involuntary commitment. The bill also raises the maximum       prison term for unlawful firearm possession from 10 years to       15, and these regulatory offenses--as liberals often       complain--disproportionately affect poor and minority       communities.        Conservatives and gun owners should hate the bill, too. Gun       owners who have committed juvenile indiscretions will find       that they are no longer able to purchase firearms or       ammunition. The bill also has strange technical defects. It       prohibits the sale of guns and ammunition to those convicted       of juvenile offenses, but it doesn't explicitly ban       possession--a loophole that someone will clamor to close       later. For adults who had involuntary commitments before they       were 16, the reverse is true:        The bill allows firearms to be sold to them, but it doesn't       decriminalize their possession of a firearm.        The most significant provision in the bill is the       prohibition against firearm possession by those convicted of       a misdemeanor violent crime against a dating partner--closing       the ``boyfriend loophole.'' But the senators who negotiated       this bill evidently couldn't agree on the definition of a       dating partner. They define ``dating relationship'' as a       ``relationship between individuals who have or have recently       had a continuing serious relationship of a romantic or       intimate nature.'' But relationships come in all forms, and       this definition provides little guidance. The senators       provided three criteria for consideration: (1) the length of       the relationship, (2) the nature of the relationship and (3)       the frequency and type of interaction between the people       involved in the relationship. This means that a ``continuing       serious relationship'' will be some function of quantity of       dates, length of time and physical intimacy. But these vague       factors don't provide fair notice and are susceptible to       inconsistent application.        By failing to define ``dating relationship'' adequately,       Congress is effectively delegating the critical question of       who falls within this ban. To whom it is delegating the hard       details remains to be determined. Perhaps it will be the       Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which       has regulatory authority over firearms. Or the courts may       decide as they resolve cases. Either way, Congress has yet       again handed off its responsibility for defining crimes to       unelected bureaucrats and judges.        Until a specific definition exists, it is unclear how the       federal government will implement this prohibition. Suppose a       criminal-records check indicates that a potential purchaser       has committed assault or battery. What next? Maybe the trial       record will show that the defendant was in a relationship       with the complaining witness. Or maybe it won't. If such       information is available, how is the examiner supposed to       gauge the relationship? The available records likely won't       provide the precise details of the relationship. Even if they       do, the examiner still has to decide whether the relationship       was serious enough to trigger the gun disability. The Senate       compromise feeds many prospective gun owners to the       bureaucratic wolves.        The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will likely pass       because members of Congress feel enormous pressure to do       something. But it is not a good bill, and it deserves further       deliberation and refinement. The Senate's job is to help       draft good laws by cooling the passions of the moment. Right       now, it is failing.''     I yield the floor.
