 Mr. President, earlier this year, I heard from an  elementary school principal in Washington State about how the opioid  crisis was hurting the kids in his school. Students at his school were  having trouble focusing in class as they dealt with the trauma of a  family member's substance use at home. Some of his teachers were having  trouble understanding how best to help those students with their  trauma.   I also heard from the staff at a hospital about how they deliver many  babies to mothers struggling with opioid addiction. Many are born with  neonatal abstinence syndrome, battling with symptoms of withdrawal.   I have heard from countless other families across my home State of  Washington about how the opioid crisis has impacted their loved ones.   Our communities have been crying out for action to address the root  causes and ripple effects of the opioid crisis that have caused so much  heartbreak for so many people. Today, we are making an important step  to answer that call.   The legislation we are passing today includes a wide set of policy  solutions from both sides of the aisle to help tackle this problem from  many different angles. Many people helped craft this legislation and  offered their own valuable insights, ideas, and solutions, and I am  grateful to all of them.   I especially want to thank the committee leaders in both Chambers who  did so much to bring this together: Senators Wyden, Feinstein,  Alexander, Hatch, and Grassley in the Senate, and Congressmen Pallone,  Neal, Nadler, Walden, Brady, and Goodlatte in the House.   I am grateful to Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell and several  others who were particularly helpful in this process.   I thank Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, Markey, Hassan, Casey, Manchin,  McCaskill, Baldwin, Nelson, Kaine, and so many more. And of course I  thank my staff and the many other members of the staff who worked on  this as well.   The bill we all crafted together is a meaningful, bipartisan  compromise. It is not what I would have written on my own, and it is  not what other colleagues would have written on their own, but it is a  collection of impactful, commonsense solutions where we were able to  find common ground--ideas that respond to the root causes and the  ripple effects our communities are facing.   It includes support for State efforts to improve plans for safe care  for children born to mothers battling substance use disorders, like  those at the hospital I visited. It ensures that the Health Department  is implementing strategies already identified to protect moms and  babies from the effects of opioid substance abuse.   It includes provisions to develop a task force and grants to help  support trauma-informed care programs and increase access to mental  health care for children and families in their communities, including  at schools like the one the principal told me about, and provisions to  build on critical public health activities to prevent opioid misuse  from occurring in the first place.   It includes provisions to address the economic and workforce impacts  of the opioid crisis, such as support for training to help the nearly 1  million people out of work due to opioid use disorder to gain and  retain employment, as well as provisions to strengthen our behavioral  workforce so patients and families can access the treatment they need.   It continues meaningful grants that help States address the most  pressing problems associated with substance use disorders in their  communities and makes those grants more flexible and available to our  Tribal communities who are suffering deeply with the impact of  substance use disorders.   It expands access to treatment services by making more providers  eligible to prescribe medication-assisted treatment.   It includes provisions to help the Food and Drug Administration  address the crisis as well, such as giving it new authority over  packaging and disposal of opioids, as well as many other steps to help  those on the frontlines of this epidemic.   I am glad we can include so many voices in this discussion and that  it led to a bill that offers so many ideas to address the different  angles of this crisis. I look forward to seeing this bill become law so  it can start helping our families and communities as we work to reach  everyone impacted by this nationwide fight against opioid use disorder.   This is an important bill, and it is an impactful step forward. It is  not a final step by any means. The opioid crisis is ongoing, and our  efforts to address it must be as well. I am going to keep listening to  people in Washington State about what they need to respond to this  question and working with my colleagues in Washington, DC, to provide  the resources and solutions that will help make a difference.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, across the country, women and survivors  are angry; they are energized; and they are making their voices heard.  They are inspired by Dr. Ford, and they are sharing stories of their  own, often of the worst moments of their lives--some for the first time  ever with their families, with their friends, and their Senators. There  are too many to share in one speech on the Senate floor, but I want to  touch on just a few.   I heard from a woman in Sequim, in Washington State, who wrote to me.   She writes:         There have been rare moments in my life when I have felt       compelled to speak out. This is one.    She told me, when she was in junior high school, she dated a boy she  thought was ``one of the nicest guys ever.'' Then, one day, she went to  his house while his parents were at church, and he assaulted her--he  tried to rape her. She only barely managed to escape and run from his  house. She said she never told anyone about this because she didn't  know who would believe her. She was worried that people would think it  was her fault. She told me that after Dr. Ford found the courage to  come forward with her experience, she found the courage to share her  own.    Another woman from Everett, WA, reached out to me to share that she  was sexually assaulted in a hotel elevator in the early 1970s. She  didn't tell a soul for 40 years--until just a few days ago. She said  that since that day all those years ago, she has avoided getting into  an elevator alone with another man if she possibly could, taking the  stairs instead. She told me: ``It happened a long time ago, but it  still matters,'' that she was inspired by the women who had so bravely  spoken out about Judge Kavanaugh, and that she shared her story with me  in the hopes that I could make sure her voice and the other voices of  so many women were heard.   I heard from another woman who lives on the Olympic Peninsula in my  home State of Washington. She told me that when she was in college, she  was raped by a man with whom she was out on a date. She remembered his  name, but because she believes she was drugged, there were a whole lot  of details she didn't remember. She didn't tell anyone about her  experience for years. She reached out to tell me that she understood  why Dr. Ford didn't come forward and to express her anger that people  continue to attack survivors, doubt them, and say they are ``just mixed  up.''   There are so many more. I have received tens of thousands of letters  and calls on this nomination with hundreds and hundreds of personal  stories that my staff and I are still working to get through. They are  heartbreaking, they are real, and they are just one small slice of the  experiences being shared, the stories that are being told, and the  voices that are bravely speaking up.   While these women and survivors are so bravely sharing experiences  and while so many of us in the Senate are making it clear we do believe  them and support them, others are going in a very different direction.   Last night, the President of the United States stood on a stage and  openly mocked Dr. Ford for not remembering some details of what she has  described as the most traumatic moment of her life. It was disgusting.  Some of my colleagues in the Senate are doing everything they can to  undermine the women sharing their experiences, saying they are ``mixed  up.'' They say that the Senate is going to ``plow right through this.''   The word coming out from the White House is that they are doing  everything they can to limit and rush the FBI investigation that they  assured Democrats and Republicans would be full and thorough.   I come to the floor today to ask three questions.   When this is all said and done, will the Senate--the U.S. Senate--be  a place where women are heard, where their voices are respected, or  still a place where women are ignored, undermined, and attacked?   Will the Senate do its job--truly do its job--to properly vet and  investigate the President's nominee for a lifetime position on our  Nation's highest Court, including pushing for a full FBI investigation  where at least Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are interviewed, making  sure all relevant witnesses are heard and all relevant information is  brought forward, or will we allow politics and partisanship to take  over and rush this through before our job is complete?   Finally, will the Senate make sure we don't put someone on the Bench  who has repeatedly had problems with the truth under oath, who has  displayed truly serious temperament issues, who has not demonstrated  the judicial independence that we expect for a nominee to the Supreme  Court, and who has displayed a shocking lack of fitness for that role?   Those are the questions I believe we need to be asking today, and  there is a lot of work that needs to be done before we can answer them.   There have been a whole lot of distractions in the past few weeks-- from yelling and screaming and outrage, real and feigned, to the  finger-pointing, to the partisanship, to the spin and the kicking up of  mud--but if you cut through all of that and focus on what is real and  what is important, there are some things we do know.   First and foremost, we all saw Dr. Ford testify under oath. I can't  imagine anyone watching her and not being moved by her honesty, how  real she was, her pain, and her commitment to what she described as her  ``civic duty.'' I believe her, and I know so many others watching that  day here in the Senate and across the country did as well.   Then we had Judge Kavanaugh. He came into that hearing angry,  defensive, and aggrieved. He clearly acted as if he is owed a seat on  the Supreme Court and didn't understand why the U.S. Senators had the  audacity to question him.   Even worse than his rage, even worse than his condescension and  arrogant entitlement, and even worse than the raw partisan bitterness  from someone who would be entrusted to make impartial decisions  regarding the biggest issues facing our Nation were the serious  challenges he had with the truth under oath, in public, to the U.S.  Senate, from his small, seemingly unnecessary mistruths about what  words used in his yearbook meant--words I will not repeat on the Senate  floor, but the people who went to school with him don't understand why  he would say what he said; to those about his connections to Dr. Ford,  such as claiming he and Dr. Ford didn't ``travel in the same social  circles,'' when we know that is just not true; to claiming that he  never attended a gathering like the one Dr. Ford described, when there  is one very similar to that on the calendar that he himself released;  to those my colleagues have talked through before, such as those  involving his level of involvement in the confirmation of President  Bush's judges, which we learned about as emails to and from him were  uncovered and released; to  [[Page S6485]]  those involving emails stolen from my Senate colleagues that he denied  knowing he had received, when, again, his emails show that wasn't the  case; to another we just recently learned about--his claim that the  first time he heard about Ms. Ramirez's allegations against him was  when he read about them in the press, although we have now heard from  people who have seen text messages showing Judge Kavanaugh personally  working to coordinate a defense against the allegations before that  story was ever published; to his denials over and over in different  ways that he drank to extreme excess in high school and college, that  he never ``blacked out'' or had memory lapses from drinking, when we  know from so many people who have now come forward to share stories of  his high school and college days that his version simply doesn't align  with reality.    The Washington Post laid this out yesterday. I will read a few of the  quotes from their reporting.   One friend of his from college said that Judge Kavanaugh was ``a  frequent drinker and a heavy drinker.''   Another classmate of his in college said, ``Brett was a sloppy drunk,  and I know because I drank with him'' and ``It's not credible for him  to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to  excess.''   Another classmate said: ``There is no doubt in my mind that while at  Yale, he was a big partyer, often drank to excess. And there had to be  a number of nights where he does not remember.''   I could go on and on. I have other, numerous stories from classmates  that you can find yourself in the Washington Post.   It is not disqualifying to drink in college. It is not disqualifying  to drink too much in college. But it is absolutely disqualifying to not  tell Senators the truth under oath about doing those things. It speaks  to the kind of person Judge Kavanaugh is, and it speaks to the kind of  Supreme Court Justice he would be if he were to be confirmed--someone  who thinks they are above the law, above the truth, and above the oath  they have raised their hand and sworn by. That should absolutely be  disqualifying.   Those are just a few of the honesty and credibility issues that we  know about. There are many more I am sure my colleagues will discuss,  and I am sure there are others that can be uncovered in a full  investigation. That is the most important point. As I said before, we  don't know everything just yet, but we do know some things, and  everyone should agree that what we know is enough to want to dig deeper  and get more information. That is why it is so telling that Judge  Kavanaugh and his Republican defenders and protectors so clearly did  not want any further investigation.   We had Dr. Ford willing to share her story, take a polygraph, and  open herself up to any questions and further investigations to help to  get to the truth. Then we had Judge Kavanaugh doing everything possible  to sweep this under the rug, move through it as quickly as possible,  and prevent any information from coming out. That tells us a lot.   I am so glad a few of my Republican colleagues have done the right  thing and slowed down this nomination to allow further investigation.  There should have been more of them speaking up, and doing our jobs  shouldn't be such a brave act. But in this moment in the Republican  Party, it is, and I do commend them.   Here is the bottom line: Any of my colleagues can yell and scream  until they are blue in the face about how aggrieved they are about this  process. They can point fingers, push conspiracy theories, call it a  sham, and say that this has gone on for longer than anyone wanted it  to. They can do all that. I think they are wrong, and a lot of what  they are complaining about is the ranking member of the committee  respecting the wishes of Dr. Ford herself. Sure, they can do that, but  at the end of the day, we are talking about a lifetime seat on the  highest Court in the land, the Court making final decisions about our  laws, our rights, and our freedoms. Surely we should take the time to  do this right. Surely we should all want to make sure we don't put  someone on the Court who sexually assaulted someone. Surely we should  want to take the full amount of time promised to fully investigate  credible allegations and determine whether Judge Kavanaugh told us the  truth under oath. That is common sense, and it happens to be our job.   My Republican colleagues held a seat open on the Supreme Court for  more than a year for no reason at all other than to prevent President  Obama's nominee from getting on the Court--more than a year. Now, all  of a sudden, these same colleagues are in a rush? It is absurd.   We need to do this right. What does that mean? What is doing it  right? First of all, it means making sure the FBI thoroughly  investigates right now, that it is not limited in scope or pressured to  not follow leads wherever they go.   As my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, said, ``We certainly want  the FBI to do a real investigation. It does no good to have an  investigation that just gives us cover.   Even President Trump said, ``I think the FBI should do what they have  to do to get to the answer. I want them to do a very comprehensive  investigation.''   I completely agree.   I am very concerned by some of the reporting coming out of the FBI  investigation--especially hearing about the witnesses who have not yet  been contacted. I am hoping they are allowed to do their jobs, and I am  hoping the White House fulfills its commitment to the Democrats and  Republicans focused on getting this done right.   Secondly, as we learn more, we should take that information into  account. We should make sure all relevant witnesses are heard from,  that all relevant information comes out--nothing swept under the rug-- because there is one other thing we can be pretty sure of: Whether the  information comes out now or comes out later, it will come out. We can  either make sure we stop someone from getting on the Court who  shouldn't be on the Court, or we can find out later that we--the  Senate--didn't do our job.   This started as a look into whether Judge Kavanaugh assaulted women  and whether the U.S. Senate would listen to women sharing their  experiences. It is still about that--very much so--but now it is about  even more than that. It is about Judge Kavanaugh's temperament, his  anger, his rage, and his entitlement. It is about his telling the truth  or not to the public and to us here in the Senate.   So I say to my colleagues, as we learn more from this investigation  and as more and more people come out to share their stories, even if  you don't think you can determine conclusively that Judge Kavanaugh  committed sexual assault, do we want someone on the highest Court in  the land with this kind of relationship with the truth, and do we want  someone with that much rage and bitterness and entitlement? I think the  answer is clear right now, and I think there is a reason Judge  Kavanaugh was so desperate to stop the full investigation.   I hope we don't allow corners to be cut and a nominee jammed onto the  Supreme Court without truly doing our jobs. I hope we take seriously  the anger, the pain, the voices, and the experiences of women across  the country today. I hope we do this right.    Thank you.   I yield the floor.
