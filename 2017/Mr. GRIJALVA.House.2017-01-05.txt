 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, for years my Republican friends have been  trying to convince everyone that Federal agencies are scary and  unpopular. In reality, Americans support Federal rules that protect  them from injuries, diseases, and death. They always have and they  always will. The people we represent don't want those rules to go away.  They want stronger rules to protect their jobs, their pay, their  health, and their fair treatment in the workplace.   Let's remember that it takes years to finalize most rules. Before an  agency makes a rule, it considers science, costs, benefits, public  stakeholder input, and public comments. Republicans have invented  stories about surprise regulations that appear out of nowhere. These  stories sound interesting until you realize they were invented to help  their corporate friends get where they want. We know where this will  lead us. Big banks got away with robbing us and creating a major  recession because they weren't regulated strongly enough. Republicans  think the answer is making it harder to regulate them.   If this bill passes, it won't be the nameless, faceless, unelected  corporate CEOs who feel the pain. It will be the Americans from big  cities and small towns who need Federal standards to keep their  environment clean, to keep their workplace safe, and to make sure the  products they buy won't hurt their families.   My Democratic colleagues are offering amendments today that exempt  certain kinds of rules from the unrealistic burdens this bill creates.  I support these amendments.   My amendment is a little different. It is not nearly enough to save  this terrible bill, but it takes a big step in the right direction. It  acknowledges that doing nothing carries a major cost.                                time  1600    It acknowledges human-caused climate change and requires agencies  that propose regulations to report on how a rule impacts greenhouse gas  emissions. If we require reporting a rule's costs, we should also  report its impacts to our planet and to our way of life.   It also requires an analysis of a rule's impacts on low-income and  rural communities. My Republican friends are deeply concerned about  whether new regulations make big business and Wall Street investors  happy. I think it is time we assess the impacts of regulations on the  urban poor, the rural poor, or on coastal Native American tribes  already fleeing the impacts of climate change, or the farmers in the  West and South struggling to cope with drought, flooding, and extreme  weather.  [[Page H137]]    Finally, my amendment requires congressional approval of any  regulation that would increase carbon pollution by 25,000 metric tons  or more, or could increase cancer, birth defects, kidney disease, or  cardiovascular or respiratory illness.   If House Republicans are so eager to rewrite the regulatory process,  they should be willing to cast recorded votes allowing the release of  tens of thousands of metric tons of pollution into our air. They should  publicly vote to increase the rates of these terrible diseases among  their constituents.   Passing this amendment is the very least we can do to make sure the  bill doesn't put Americans at risk of injury and death.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it should be noted that the REINS Act is  one sweeping piece of legislation that does not take into account  public health, does not take into account clean air, clean water, and  the effects of constituents and the American people, the environment,  or the cost attended with increased illnesses. With that sweeping  deregulation process that is being proposed by the majority, we have an  exposure on issues of public health, clean air, clean water, and the  regulations that are in place to protect the public health and the  well-being of the American people.   My amendment just requires that, if these sweeping changes are to  occur, Members of this body take the votes that would release  additional metric tons into the atmosphere that would promote and  increase the levels of disease in this country that is harmful to the  American people. It is one of disclosure and accountability if the  Members, indeed, are the ones that want to make the final decision.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
