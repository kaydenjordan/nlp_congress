 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in defense of our Constitution today, in defense of law- abiding American citizens, and against this Senate gun control bill.   This legislation takes the wrong approach in attempting to curb  violent crimes. It turns our system of due process on its head. You  will now be found guilty and your guns taken away until you can prove  your innocence.   It has vague language containing insufficient guardrails to keep guns  out of the hands of criminals or prevent mass violence.   It creates a de facto waiting period for up to 10 business days for  legal, law-abiding citizens' firearm purchases and the consideration of  whether an adult purchaser's juvenile record should prohibit an  individual from buying a firearm.   We are committed to identifying and solving the causes of violent  crimes and mental health crises, putting officers in our schools, and  reinforcing our school buildings, but we must not infringe upon the  Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens while doing so.   I cannot support this misguided legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
