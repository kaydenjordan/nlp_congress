 Madam President, in the early hours of Tuesday morning,       we were given the text to the omnibus appropriations bill. With the end       of the year fast approaching, everyone is trying to get this bill       signed into law quickly. That is true even if it has not been fully       reviewed and every consequence thought out.        We saw this 2 years ago, when the omnibus was included with COVID-      relief funding, within the 2020 omnibus was the Horseracing Integrity       and Safety Act.        Prior to this 2020 act becoming law, with no process and no       opportunity to debate the merits of the act, horseracing was regulated       by States, and Congress had no role on how the industry was regulated.        What this 2020 bill did was impose a one-size-fits-all Federal       regulatory approach on all States, from Iowa to Kentucky, to West       Virginia, to New York. This is a bill that had never gone through the       committee process, but it managed to end up in the omnibus.        As a result of this hasty lawmaking, last month, we saw the Fifth       Circuit Court of Appeals strike down the law on the grounds that the       act is unconstitutional. Regular order in the Senate, especially       through committee process, would have prevented this unconstitutional       language.        This did not come as a surprise. It was clear that the private       nonprofit Horseracing Authority created in the 2020 omni wielded nearly       unlimited Federal rulemaking authority and answered to no one, not even       the President of the United States.        The court ruled that the power of the Federal Government can be       wielded only by the Federal Government, not private entities like the       ``Authority.''        For months I have worked with horsemen in Iowa and my colleagues in       the Senate to address the obvious failures with implementation of this       law since it went into effect earlier this year.        I specifically asked the FTC about the extent of its oversight of the       FTC, a key factor for the Fifth Circuit's ruling.        The FTC response was simple. It said it did not have any oversight       over the ``Authority.'' This is clearly unconstitutional and is       inconsistent with conservative principles of small government and       reigning in the Federal bureaucracy.        Now that the courts have found HISA unconstitutional, Congress should       work a fix through the regular committee process to avoid the pitfalls       of the previous legislation.        But that is not what is happening today. In the 2022 omni once again,       the special interests that invented the unconstitutional ``Authority''       in the first place have convinced their supporters a quick fix is       needed in this omnibus. The same people who pushed the unconstitutional       ``Authority'' through in an end of year omnibus are once again forcing       legislation without any input from Senators like me.        This fix to the unconstitutional Federal rulemaking power wielded by       the ``Authority'' is included on page 1,930. How many members of       Congress even know that this is included? Probably very few.        I have since introduced an amendment that would strike this text with       Senator Manchin. Since then numerous offices reached out to find out       what this is--and once they do--have expressed the same opposition to       this becoming law that I have.        This is just one example of which there are many, of legislating on       an omnibus. It lets a select few Members, or in this case just one       Member, of leadership create new Federal regulatory frameworks for       entire industries.        I support ensuring safe, humane horseracing. But I also support small       tracks, like Prairie Meadows in Iowa, which don't have the billionaires       backing like those in States that host Triple Crown races.        And I am not alone because most other States have tracks like Prairie       Meadows.        Instead of governing this way, Congress should work with State racing       commissions to regulate horseracing in a responsible way to ensure       racetrack safety and the economic viability of small tracks across the       country.        I will work with any Senator who is willing to stand up for small       tracks in the next Congress and fix this broken way of governing.                                      ____________________
