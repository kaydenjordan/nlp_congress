 Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute and pay tribute to a  member of the Greatest Generation in celebration of his 100th birthday.  Donald Keller is a World War II veteran who has lived in Strasburg,  Virginia, for almost his whole life.   At 21, Keller joined the Army as a radio operator, and he served in  the military for almost 2 years from 1943 to 1945. During his  deployment, he was awarded two Purple Hearts, one after being wounded  in Normandy and the other when he was injured in Luxembourg during the  Battle of the Bulge. Keller later received the French Legion of Honor  for carrying two injured soldiers to safety while he himself was  injured.   After Keller fought in the war, he returned to Strasburg where he  served the city by opening his own radio repair company.  [[Page H7263]]    The Sixth District thanks Donald Keller for his service and  contributions to the city of Strasburg.   His commitment to the city is clearly shown by the community's  commitment to celebrate his 100th birthday.   So, again, I thank him for his service, and I wish Donald Keller a  very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
