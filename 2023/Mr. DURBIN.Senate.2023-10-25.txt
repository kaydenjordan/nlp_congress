 I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman) and the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr. Padilla)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss an urgent need: the  confirmation of two pending U.S. attorney nominees.   U.S. attorneys across the United States represent the Department of  Justice. They are the leaders we turn to locally to deal with problems  beyond local law enforcement's control--problems and challenges from  Federal law. Whether we are fighting fentanyl epidemics or we are  fighting those who would undermine this country--many who would cheat  and steal at the expense of others--we count on professional  prosecutors to make those decisions.   We go through a process here where a President will name a potential  U.S. attorney. That is not the end of the story. The attorney's name is  then submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, and  then it goes through a rigorous bipartisan process and investigation of  each one of these nominees. Until they clear both sides of the table-- Democrats and Republicans--the nominees don't move. Once having been  cleared, they are then put up for approval before the Senate Judiciary  Committee.   Traditionally, that was virtually the end of the story. The name  would hit the calendar. The calendar name would be called and approved,  and the person would move into action.   Under the previous President, Donald Trump, there was a lot of  controversy--political controversy associated with all sorts of issues.  So you have to wonder: Out of the 85 U.S. attorney nominees proposed by  President Donald Trump, how many of them ran into an obstacle or were  stopped on the Senate floor by Democrats for political reasons? The  answer: none, not one.   Despite all the controversy of the Trump administration, the feeling  was that it was only fair to these men and women, asking to serve our  Nation as representatives in the Department of Justice, to give them  that chance if they cleared the bipartisan background process. They  did. We gave our approval. They served across the Nation.  [[Page S5170]]    But, unfortunately, we have come into a new era. U.S. attorneys--law  enforcement officers who lead our Nation to prosecute violent criminals  and protect our communities from gun traffickers, gun violence,  terrorism, and so many other things--are still central to our system of  justice.   I have emphasized that the U.S. Attorneys Offices in the Northern  District of Ohio--that would be Cleveland--and the Northern District of  Illinois--that would be Chicago--undertake important investigations and  prosecutions that keep our communities safe.   The State of Ohio, like many others, suffers from the scourge of  fentanyl trafficking. We know about this deadly narcotic. It is a  killer. It is fourth in the Nation for drug overdose deaths. The U.S.  attorney for the Northern District of Ohio oversees the area's response  to fatal overdoses from fentanyl through the U.S. Attorney's Heroin and  Opioid Task Force. I would guess many Ohioans would want to know why  that task force is waiting for Senate-confirmed leadership.   In my home State of Illinois, over the last 2 years, the Chicago  Police Department has recovered more than 10,000 firearms--10,000 a  year--from various criminal investigations. The U.S. attorney for the  Northern District of Illinois is responsible for coordinating the  efforts with all the law enforcement agencies in the Chicago Firearms  Trafficking Strike Force.   My constituents can't understand why one Senator from another State  is blocking the confirmation of one U.S. attorney candidate in  Illinois, April Perry, who has been found to be highly qualified, not  only by the White House but by a bipartisan investigative committee of  the Senate Judiciary Committee.   April Perry is well-qualified for this job. She would like to be on  the job and should have been weeks ago, making it safer to live in my  State.   Another point I made before is the irony that the Senator who is  blocking these two nominees is considering this a ``tough on crime''  position. Tough on crime when you refuse to put a person in the role of  prosecutor who is supposed to put these criminals behind bars?   When he ran for the Senate, my colleague from Ohio pledged to ``fight  the criminals--not the cops.'' That is his quote. He argued that  Americans will not be safe if ``politicians keep attacking police  officers instead of violent criminals.''   I just have to tell him his strategy of stopping two leading U.S.  attorneys, one in his State and in the State of Illinois, is the best  news the criminals have had in a long time.   The same man who pledged to fight the cops now proudly brags that he  wants to ``grind the Department of Justice to a halt.'' I am not making  that up, and he has not denied it. He said his goal is to ``grind the  U.S. Department of Justice to a halt.''    Listen to this headline from a recent article in Newsmax:         Sen. Vance to Newsmax: Blocking DOJ Nominees Makes AG's Job       Harder.    We want to make the Attorney General's job harder when it comes to  prosecuting drug criminals? Is that what this is all about?   I said it before, and I will say it again: Senator Vance needs to  read a resolution he proposed in this body earlier this year and take  his own advice. He should give law enforcement officers the support and  resources they need, rather than trying to score political points by  making their jobs harder.   Unlike me, Senator Vance doesn't need to worry about sounding like a  broken record. Each time I come to the floor to ask for unanimous  consent, he offers a different explanation for why he is blocking the  confirmation of these highly qualified nominees. First, he claimed he  was punishing the Justice Department for what he falsely called  ``unprecedented political prosecution'' of former President Trump. As I  have pointed out, this is a weak excuse for hamstringing law  enforcement, considering the former President has now been indicted 4  separate times on 91 different counts and continues to threaten judges,  prosecutors, jurors, and witnesses.   Senator Vance also previously stated here on the Senate floor--and I  quote; it is in the Congressional Record:         My objection is not specific to the qualifications or the       particular individuals that have been nominated.    He said he wanted to make it clear that it is in reference to both  Ms. Lutzko in Ohio and Ms. Perry in Illinois.   In response, I offered the junior Senator from Ohio the opportunity  to keep his promise to support law enforcement by allowing us to  schedule confirmation votes on these pending U.S. attorneys--exactly  what he said he wanted on the Record in the Senate. He looked me in the  eye and agreed with me. He released his objection to Ms. Lutzko and Ms.  Perry under the condition that we hold rollcall votes on them, which I  agreed to.   Seemingly overnight, he decided that he does object to even holding  confirmation votes on these nominees. He then claimed that ``expecting  us to vote on cloture . . . is not too much to ask.'' I was surprised  to hear that. It was a new wrinkle in his argument, considering that,  just last month, the junior Senator from Ohio was on the Senate floor  attempting to force the Senate to skip a cloture vote on one of his  bills.   I look forward to hearing what his new argument may be today. If he  is trying to punish those who are in the process of prosecuting the  former President of the United States, what is his retribution when it  comes to the State of Georgia? We now have so many counts naming the  former President for wrongdoing, and we have four people who have been  accused who have pled guilty so far in this process. Does he have a  special agenda now when it comes to the State of Georgia to determine  whether or not there is going to be some retribution to grind to halt  the system of justice in that State?   We have reached the point where it is hard to explain why Senator  Tuberville of Alabama is stopping military promotions of deserving  women and men who have risked their lives in service to America, and  another Republican Senator is stopping ambassadorial positions being  filled, and now this Senator has decided we have enough criminal  prosecutors in America to take care of crime; we don't need more.   We certainly need these two--and many more--doing a professional job.   So I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations:  Calendar Nos. 314 and 315; that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally  divided in usual form, on each nomination; that upon the use or  yielding back time, the Senate proceed to vote, without intervening  action or debate, on the nominations in the order listed; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and  the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, last week in my home area of Chicago, a 6- year-old Palestinian boy answered the door and was stabbed over and  over again until he died and then the assailant went into another room  and tried to kill his mother. The question is, Is this a hate crime  because of his Palestinian origin? Does it deserve an investigation?  Does it sound, in America, like this is the sort of thing we want an  answer to? Whom would we turn to for that investigation? The U.S.  Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Illinois.   But the Senator from Ohio--because of his hurt feelings over the  indictment of former President Trump by many others--has decided to  say, in my region of the country, we will have no U.S. attorney; we  will leave the position vacant, not because the person isn't qualified  to take it over but because he is hurt and believes he wants to protest  over the idea of holding a former President accountable.   Obviously, in his mind, former Presidents are above the law--not in  my mind and not in any democracy. I don't know if former President  Trump is guilty of any charges. We have a system of laws and law  enforcement to reach that conclusion. But in the meantime, whether it  is a hate crime in a suburb of Chicago or drug crimes that are claiming  lives every single night in every single neighborhood in our Nation,  how can we stand here in good conscience and say we want to grind the  Department of Justice to a halt?   That is exactly what he said over and over again: grind the  Department of Justice to a halt. To prove what? To prove what about  this Nation? We deserve the opportunity to be protected by the Agencies  of government we have appointed, and the men and women who are willing  to sacrifice their time, their skills to serve that purpose and keep us  safe deserve better treatment than what is happening on the Senate  floor.   I wish I could say this is a unique experience. It has become a  pattern: a House of Representatives which goes for 21, 22 days trying  to find a leader on the Republican side of the aisle; military  appointments, hundreds of them, men and women, qualified, serving in  the military, risking their lives, whose nominations are being held up  on the Senate floor by one Republican Senator; the idea that we are  holding back the possibility of appointing Ambassadors in parts of the  world where war is imminent and underway and could drag the United  States into conflict if we are not careful.   To take that position that we want to stop government, whether it is  in the Department of Defense and their promotion policy, whether it is  in the Department of State and the representatives around the world, or  whether it is in the Department of Justice, is shameful.   This is not public service. This is a political errand. I wish it  would come to an end soon, and I wish the Senator, who is new to this  body, would think twice about whether this is how he wants to write his  record in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mr.  Padilla), is necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3128         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
