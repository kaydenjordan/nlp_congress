 On November 3, the American people voted overwhelmingly  for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to serve as President and Vice  President of the United States.   The country was about to enter a new era, with great hope for change.  Yet, with a decisive mandate and majority, the President used  untruthful claims to end the completion of a constitutional process of  collecting the electoral votes making Joe Biden President of the United  States.   Not accepting the will of the American people, the President  unleashed the most horrific violence that overwhelmed the security  forces at this Capitol, which was overrun for the first time since  1812, putting the lives of so many at risk--indeed, a day of infamy.   This impeachment will be viewed as a transcendent vote, where all  will be judged. Vote to impeach the President of the United States,  Donald J. Trump.
