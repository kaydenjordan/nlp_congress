 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1261, the National  Landslide Preparedness Act. This straightforward piece of legislation  will help prepare and protect us from landslides.   Landslides are a dangerous and expensive national hazard. According  to the U.S. Geological Survey, landslides cause as much as $2 billion  in damages each year and around 25 fatalities.   Wildfires, earthquakes, and severe weather all make landslides more  likely. As cities and towns across our country continue to develop, the  chances of being affected by these events, likewise, increases.   Since the 1970s, one of the core missions of the U.S. Geological  Survey has been to use scientific data to minimize the loss of life and  property damage from hazards like landslides. H.R. 1261 supports that  goal by establishing the National Landslide Hazards Reduction Program,  which will help identify and understand landslide risk; and when those  hazards eventually occur, this bill will help prepare us by improving  communication and emergency preparedness.   H.R. 1261 also establishes a national 3D Elevation Program to create  and maintain standardized, publicly available 3D elevation data for the  United States. Not only will this program assess landslide hazards, but  could also help identify energy, mineral, and water resources,  geological hazards such as active faults, and other potential dangers,  including swelling soils, floodplains, and abandoned mine lands.    In Oklahoma, we have had lots of floods, so if there are other things  we can do that will help get us some understanding of what is going on,  people will be better for it. I am confident that this bill will help  prepare for and prevent against damage from landslides and, most  importantly, save American lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as has been documented, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands' workforce has historically been comprised of U.S.  citizens as well as a nonimmigrant, temporary foreign population.   Until 2009, the CNMI controlled its own immigration policy for the  foreign workforce. Today, the Department of Homeland Security manages  the applications and eventual permits for any foreign people entering  the Commonwealth for work. Since 2009, the transitional worker program  was forward-looking, which left a certain portion of the existing  foreign workforce that has resided and worked in the Commonwealth for  many years in a gray area.   H.R. 559 is an approach to resolve any uncertainty for these long- term foreign workers. I thank the Governor of the Commonwealth, Ralph  Torres, for his help and Mr. Sablan.   While the policy contained in this measure is fair for long-term  foreign workers in the Mariana Islands, I am deeply disappointed that  the majority did not consider this bill through regular order. Neither  the Natural Resources Committee nor the Judiciary Committee, which  received an additional referral of this bill, have acted on this  measure--no hearings, no markups. It is my hope that the majority truly  believes in following their rules that are supposed to provide for an  open and transparent process because this bill did not meet that test.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of  this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, the last 2 weeks have been  brutal for much of America. Storms, tornadoes, and floodwaters have  attacked our homes and our people.   I spent last week across the First District of Oklahoma, watching the  waters rise and the homes and livelihoods of my community be destroyed.  It was heart-wrenching.   Every day, I saw more families forced to evacuate, more homes take on  water, more sinkholes open up, and roadways disappear under the flood.  This disaster has reached every corner of my district and has  permanently affected countless families.   For some, a lifetime of building a home was washed away in a matter  of days. There are priceless photos that will never be recovered,  neighborhoods that will never be the same, families who have lost  everything.   We may have caught the attention of the Nation for a few days while  tornadoes tore up our country and storms battered our homes, but now  the water subsides, and the cameras turn off, but the damage remains.  Our communities will be forever changed.   In times of war, there is an enemy. There is a target for our  retribution. When foreign armies attacked Pearl Harbor, we had a swift  response. There was somewhere to go, someone to fight.   When your people are attacked by nature, when it is flood waters  destroying your home instead of armies, where do you turn?   In times of disaster, it is easy to shake your fist at God. It is  natural to be angry and to turn that anger on the only being you think  you can blame.   Instead, what I have seen in my community this week is faith,  generosity, and the genuine love and care for our fellow man.   It is these moments of devastation when true character shines  through. This is when heroes are made.   When everyone is running away from a problem or dangerous situation,  who runs toward it?   Tonight, we are here to honor the selfless heroes of the storms, the  men and women of our communities who showed true leadership and courage  these last few weeks to keep our people safe and protect our families.   I am proud of Oklahomans and how they came together. I am humbled to  have personally heard their stories.   Along with my colleagues, we will shine a light on the brave people  whose sacrifices will forever have an impact on our districts.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).  [[Page H4210]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Ohio.    Madam Speaker, anyone can run for office. Anyone can have a title,  but it takes true leadership and true selflessness to stand up in the  heart of a disaster and lead your community.   Oklahomans are blessed to have incredible leaders at every level of  government.   Local officials in all of my districts, cities, and counties worked  sleepless nights, through torrential rains, and devastating tornadoes  to keep our people safe and informed.   Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum has been an around-the-clock warrior for his  city. Truly, I don't think he slept in the last 2 weeks. Along with  Tulsa's city councilors, Phil Lakin, Kara Joy McKee, Vanessa Hall- Harper, and TAEMA Director Joe Kralicek, they have had a constant  presence with our people, helping where they can, but most importantly,  keeping the Tulsa community informed of where the water was headed,  when to evacuate, and where to go.   Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado, Undersheriff George Brown, and  Commissioners Stan Sallee, Karen Keith, and Ron Peters have been  vigilant in monitoring the movement of the flood waters and have had an  active presence in the hardest hit areas of the city.   Wagoner Mayor Albert Jones, Coweta Police Chief Mike Bell, City  Manager Roger Kolman, Mayor Evette Morris, EMS Director Heath  Underwood, and Sheriff Chris Elliott have likewise been a constant  source of strength for Wagoner County.   Sand Springs was especially hard hit this past week, and Mayor Jim  Spoon has shown true leadership for his community.   Vice Mayor Patty Dixon, Councilors Phil Nollan, Mike Burdge,  Christine Hammer, Beau Wilson, Brian Jackson, and Police Chief Mike  Carter have proven to be an asset to their town and their people  throughout this disaster.   In Bixby, Mayor Brian Guthrie, City Manager Jared Cottle, Vice Mayor  John Easton, Councilors Paul Blair, Brad Girard, and Robin Decatur have  gone above and beyond to protect their people.   Jenks Police Chief Cameron Arthur, City Manager Christopher Shrout,  Mayor Robert Lee, Vice Mayor Kaye Lynn, and Councilors Gary Isbell,  Craig Murray, Dr. Josh Wedmen, Donna Ogez, and Cory Box.   Bartlesville Mayor Dale Copeland, Vice Mayor Alan Gentges, Councilors  Paul Stuart, Jim Curd, Jr., Trevor Dorsey, and Police Chief Tracy  Roles.   Washington County Commissioners Mitch Antle, Mike Bouvier, and Mike  Dunlap, Emergency Management Director Kary Cox, and Sheriff Scott Owen.   Collinsville Mayor Bud York.   Skiatook Fire Chief Jim Annas, City Manager Dan Yancey, Mayor Roger  Upton, and Vice Mayor Herb Forbes.   Owasso Mayor Dr. Chris Kelley, City Manager Warren Lehr, and Police  Chief Scott Chambless.   Catoosa City Manager John Blish and Mayor Brenda Conley.   Okay Mayor Brad Matthews, and Johnny Walker.   All of these local leaders have been a godsend to their communities  during one of Oklahoma's worst widespread natural disasters in memory.   Thanks to all of these incredible people that have shown leadership  during our time of crisis. Your service does not go unnoticed.   During this storm, members of the community decided to stand up and  lead, not because they worked for local government, not because they  were a first responder, but because they knew there was a need for  leadership in their neighborhood.   Today, I would like to tell the story of one of those men.   Jeremy Herrington is from the Town and Country neighborhood of Sand  Springs--one of the communities hardest hit by the floodwaters.   After doing his own study of the floodplain maps, Jeremy realized the  danger to his neighborhood long before the Army Corps of Engineers or  local officials. He took to social media to warn his neighbors to  evacuate, and many of them did.   Through the Town and Country Facebook page that Jeremy manages, his  neighborhood has been transformed into a loving community working  together to overcome the disaster.   Instead of turning on each other, Jeremy's neighbors have come  together to share with each other, support each other, cry together,  and give advice on how to recover from the floods.                                time  2000    Most of the Facebook group have never met in real life, but the  community Jeremy helped create online has bound them together like a  family. Now that the Town and County neighborhood is returning home,  they are mourning together and beginning their recovery process  together.   Without the attentive work of Jeremy, his community wouldn't have  been notified of the danger in time. I am thankful for Jeremy's work to  keep his neighbors informed. I am sure his community is grateful for  his dedication as well.   The most important thing we can do to prepare for disaster is to  communicate. In that regard, Oklahoma's First Congressional District  was in the most capable hands. The meteorologists and storm chasers in  our media market have been working around the clock to keep people  informed of the weather, telling them where to go and what to do in  case of disaster.   Some of the hardworking team includes: Mike Collier, Brandon Wholey,  Kirsten Lang, Clint Boone, Dan Threlkeld, Chris Nestman, Caroline  Brown, Katy Kramer, James Aydelott, Michael Seger, Laura Mock, Brad  Carl,  [[Page H4211]]  Megan McClellan, Stacia Knight, Michael Grogan, Alan Crone, Stephen  Nehrenz, and of course, Travis Meyer.   Without the thorough preparedness of these teams, the Tulsa area  would have faced unimaginable devastation. When the skies are clear and  it is smooth sailing, it is easy to overlook the work that these people  put in day and night. But after the past 2 weeks, it is undeniable the  essential role they have in our community.   My deepest thanks to our hardworking meteorologists and brave storm- chasing teams that have kept us informed and safe. The work is not  over. The floodwaters have not disappeared yet, and they are all still  working hard to keep our community informed.   We had the worst floods in history and lost no lives, which is a  testament to their communication.   Our law enforcement officers, like many in our community, have worked  tirelessly to protect our people through the storms. Some, like Captain  Jason Morrison and Sheriff Corporal Mike Heisten, are volunteering  their time on dive teams to rescue missing persons and people stranded  in the floods.   Dealing with the quick-moving, murky floodwaters is challenging, to  say the least. It is a scary task, but these men answered the call to  action because they knew their community needed them.   In a flood situation as dire as we had in Oklahoma last week, whole  towns were being evacuated. Entire cities were underwater. There were  places completely shut off from the rest of the State because all the  surrounding roads were underwater.   In this kind of danger, who goes back for those left behind? Who goes  in to find the victims of the storms? Captain Morrison and Sheriff  Corporal Heisten did.   We can never fully comprehend the danger that these disasters bring  to our homes until they are here. Captain Morrison and Sheriff Corporal  Heisten did not hesitate to step into the path of danger to keep their  community safe, and for that, I am eternally grateful.   The devastation of these floods extends well beyond the homes and  lives of the people of Oklahoma's First Congressional District.  Countless businesses took on disastrous amounts of water over the last  few weeks. Many businesses had to shutter completely, and many will  need extensive repairs before they can reopen.   The River Spirit Casino Resort along the Arkansas River is one of  those businesses. The resort has become a key destination in Tulsa, and  it was forced to shut down during one of the most profitable travel  holidays of the year, Memorial Day weekend.   Instead of leaving hundreds of employees out to dry, River Spirit  continued to pay these employees during the flood and will continue to  pay these employees until the resort is able to open and resume  operations, well into July.   Likewise, HollyFrontier Tulsa Refinery, located on the Arkansas  River, has chosen to continue paying employees for the duration of  their building's closure. HollyFrontier is even helping displaced  employees pay for hotel rooms.   These companies are going above and beyond to help their employees  during a time of crisis, and it deserves recognition.   I would be remiss to speak tonight on all local heroes of the last  few weeks and not talk about a woman who has worked tirelessly to keep  Tulsa County safe. County Commissioner Karen Keith has been a perennial  source of strength not only for the people impacted by the floods but  also for the local leaders and responders who have been working to  combat the flooding as well.   Commissioner Keith is not one to stay safe inside the emergency  operations room and direct from inside. She has been out on boats in  the floodwaters in the most devastated parts of town every day. She has  been out in the community, rain or shine, working across party lines to  make sure everyone was safe and accounted for.   She has been helping business owners deal with the aftermath of  flooded storefronts and helping families navigate disaster aid and  evacuation protocols.   When water released from the dam was increasing and posing a further  threat to Tulsa County, she made sure people in the impacted areas were  evacuated and cared for.   Disasters like this make or break a person as a leader, and  Commissioner Keith has proven her ironclad dedication to the people of  Tulsa County. Even now, as the floodwaters begin to subside,  Commissioner Keith is still working at all hours to help those who have  been forever affected by these storms.   I am so thankful for Commissioner Keith and the work she has done to  keep Tulsa County safe these last few weeks.   Wagoner County is the largest county in the First Congressional  District. There was a lot of ground to cover there and a lot of  coordination needed for emergency response during the last 2 weeks.   Heath Underwood, the Wagoner County director of emergency management,  was the man to coordinate it all. When floodwaters came for his  community, he kept all the moving pieces of disaster relief functioning  and running smoothly.    It has been a never-ending cycle of rainfall, water release at the  dam, and extending floodwaters across Wagoner County, but Heath  weathered it all. He coordinated rescue efforts for people stranded in  their homes and on highways across the county. I am sure those who were  stranded are thankful for his dedication.   Our local leaders have proven absolutely dependable and honorable  throughout this entire disaster, and Heath Underwood is right up there  with the best of them.   There are so many people who have proven absolutely vital to our  community throughout this time of disaster. I could not be more  thankful for our leaders or proud of our people than I am after  experiencing the trauma of the last 2 weeks in my district.   In times of disaster, true colors will show. While these tornadoes,  storms, and floods could have brought out the worst in Oklahoma, it  brought out the very best and bound us together as a community. The  friendships forged in the fire of absolute devastation will outlast  these floodwaters. They will be stronger than the damage to our homes.   Heroes were made in Oklahoma this week, and I am glad to have this  chance to share their stories.   I thank my colleagues who joined me tonight. It means a lot that my  colleagues would join me in shedding a light on the people who have  been truly remarkable in our districts back home.   The message to take away from all of this is simple: Together, we are  stronger. Together, we will get through this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
