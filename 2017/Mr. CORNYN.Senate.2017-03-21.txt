The Senator from Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I came to speak on the nomination of Neil  Gorsuch as Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court, but  in listening to my colleague from Florida, I feel like I am missing  something because he has described the Affordable Care Act in a way  that I do not recognize, and he has talked about a bill that has not  even passed the House of Representatives as a fait accompli.   ObamaCare was sold under false pretenses. The President himself said:  If you like what you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor,  you can keep your doctor. Oh, yes, by the way, a family of four will  see a reduction of its premiums by $2,500. None of those have proven to  be true. So we are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   I have to tell my friend from Florida to please join us. If he does  not like the product that is working its way through Congress, please  join us and help us make it better because, right now, all I see from  our Democratic friends is sort of like a Pontius Pilate moment--a  washing of their hands and letting the Republicans alone do the heavy  lifting. We invite them to work with us in a bipartisan way, which is  something that did not happen, by the way, in ObamaCare, which was  passed on a purely party-line vote, and I think it has proven to be a  terrible mistake.    Mr. President, I will yield for a question, but I will  not yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will yield for a question but not for a  speech.    Mr. President, I say to my friend from Florida that I  think there has been a lot of false advertising and scaremongering  taking place around the country in trying to convince people that,  somehow, they are going to lose their coverage, which is not the case.   We believe we can do better than ObamaCare, which has created a one- size-fits-all healthcare package and has basically denied people the  right to choose the kind of coverage that suits them best at a price  they can afford.   In Texas alone, a person making about $25,000 a year could spend up  to 30 percent of his gross income under ObamaCare. That is a young  person, and it is no surprise that many of them have opted out of  ObamaCare and simply decided either to pay the penalty or to just  become noncompliant because it is unaffordable.   I am sympathetic, certainly, to the genuine concerns of anybody in  one's getting appropriate healthcare coverage, but I sure hope people  do not succumb to the scaremongering taking place in parts of the  country that tells people they are going to be left high and dry.   For example, my friend and colleague said that Medicare was going to  be gutted under the House bill. That is not true. Right now, Medicaid  is an uncapped entitlement. It is one of the fastest growing sources of  Federal Government spending. The bill in the House proposes not to cut  it but to restrain its rate of growth. Right now, it is the third  largest budget item in the Texas budget. My friends in the Texas  Legislature tell me that it crowds out all other spending, including  education, law enforcement, and other things--that it just eats up so  much money because it is uncapped. What we would propose to do is to  leave Medicaid at the current levels but then make sure that it grows  according to the Consumer Price Index--and a rather generous one--in  medical inflation.   I will say what I said earlier, which is that I do not recognize the  bill that my friend from Florida has described. If the House did not  pass a bill and if the Senate did not pass a bill, we would still be  here, talking about the meltdown of the Affordable Care Act because  many insurance companies have simply pulled out of the marketplace.  Many people do not have choices. They are forced to deal with, perhaps,  the one remaining health insurance company, and in some places they are  going to have all insurance companies pull out of the individual  market.   I yield for one more question, and then I really need to get to my  speech.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I would welcome that any day and every  day. The only way we get things done around here in any sort of durable  fashion is on a bipartisan basis. But so far, I have seen zero  indication from our friends across the aisle that they are interested  in working with us. I hope that is a misunderstanding on my part, and I  hope going forward we will be able to come up with some bipartisan  bills.  [[Page S1875]]    The truth is that, given the constraints of the budget process, we  are not going to be able to do everything we want to do in this bill  that is going to pass the House on Thursday and which we will take up  here in the Senate next week. So there is going to be a necessity to do  some more, and I hope we can do that on a bipartisan basis.   We also know that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom  Price, is working from a regulatory standpoint to try to do everything  he can to stabilize the insurance market and to make sure that people  continue to have some choices.   I think this is fundamentally a test of our principles regarding  whether we actually believe in more choices and competition, and my  firm conviction is choices and competition improve the quality of a  service and the quality of a product. That is really one of the  foundational principles upon which our economy is based. I think it  also works in healthcare, but we haven't had that since ObamaCare  passed.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit about the important  hearing on the judicial nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme  Court that is taking place in the Senate Judiciary Committee even as we  speak.   We know that President Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch at the end of  January to a seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.  Justice Scalia was a lion of American law. He was bigger than life. His  intellect, his writing, and his wit inspired a lot of young lawyers and  not-so-young lawyers and judges and law students over the past decades,  and reminded us that judges have a distinct and special and important  role in our system of government, but it is decidedly not to be a  legislator or a policymaker because they are ill-suited for doing that.   First of all, Federal judges are appointed for life. Judges are not  supposed to take public opinion polls to figure out how to rule in a  case.   I asked Judge Gorsuch today: Is it proper for a judge to decide in a  case in front of him or her who he or she thinks should win and then  try to work backward to justify it in a judge's decision?   He said: Well, it is actually just the opposite. What you try to do  is to take the facts and the law and you apply them and you respect the  outcome, even if sometimes it is not an outcome you would prefer if it  were a matter of your personal preference.   What he described, really, is called the rule of law, which has  distinguished the United States of America from most of the rest of the  world and which has given us our competitive advantage. When people  know that we are going to have a legal system that doesn't depend on  personalities, doesn't depend on politics, but rather on a written law  or Constitution, then people can take confidence in their investments,  in their plans, and our economy has been the winner.   There is a Peruvian economist who wrote a book called ``The Mystery  of Capital.'' I will just summarize, briefly. I was intrigued by the  book and by his thesis. Basically, his argument is the United States is  no more entrepreneurial than other parts of the world, but what  distinguishes us from much of the rest of the world is what I just said  a moment ago: It is the rule of law. For example, if you buy a house  and get a title to that house, then you have a legal right to it, and  you can defend it against all other claimants or people who might try  to say: No, that is really my house. I know that sounds so basic, and  we take it for granted, but it really does distinguish our country from  others, where the law is really not about law, but it is about  politics. It is about who is in power. Well, our laws are designed to  protect people who are not in power, including people in political  minorities.   I think the greatest legacy of Justice Scalia was a strong belief  that the words in the Constitution and laws passed by the Congress  matter. He believed judges should apply those texts and not just  pronounce their policy preferences in deciding cases. He understood, as  I do, that a careful adherence to text ultimately protects our  democracy, which is the intention of our Founding Fathers.   I have spent time, like many of my colleagues, talking about the type  of judge we need to fill this vacancy--someone who understands the  lessons that Justice Scalia taught us--and will apply them faithfully,  without regard to persons or personalities or politics. I believe there  is no question that Judge Gorsuch is the man for the task. I am  confident that the hearings this week will make that clear to the rest  of America.   It is interesting to listen to some of my colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee who want to talk about everything other than Judge Gorsuch  and his qualifications. They want to talk about President Trump. They  want to talk about abortion. They want to talk about same-sex marriage.  They want to try to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge some future case that  may come before the U.S. Supreme Court. Well, no judge worthy of that  title will tell anybody: Well, if you confirm me as a judge, I promise  you this outcome. That is a violation of the most fundamental ethics of  a judge, because a judge is not, again, a policymaker, a judge is not a  politician; judges aren't about outcomes, but rather a commitment to  the rule of law and due process of law in reaching their decisions.   So far, in almost two days in the Judiciary Committee, I think Judge  Gorsuch has performed admirably and demonstrated no reason why our  colleagues across the aisle can't support him. As a matter of fact, my  view is that if you can't vote for somebody like Judge Gorsuch, there  is probably nobody that would be nominated by this President that you  would vote to confirm. It is hard for me to imagine the nomination  getting much better.   We have already learned a lot about the judge. We know of his  intellect. We know of his sterling qualifications and his extensive  experience. I particularly appreciated his testimony today about access  to justice and his concern that people of modest means--low income, the  so-called little guy that our friends across the aisle keep talking  about. The little guy in America is essentially denied access to our  courts because it costs so much and it takes too long, and there have  to be mechanisms in place for us to resolve our differences that  everybody has access to or else the statement carved in the marble over  the U.S. Supreme Court that says ``equal justice under law'' is just a  pathetic joke.   So we have a lot to do in terms of providing access to justice. I  think somebody with Judge Gorsuch's background--someone who actually  has practiced the law and who has represented clients in court and who  has been thoughtful about this and so many other topics--is just the  type of person that can help us get our legal system back on track, so  that saying, that model, ``equal justice under law,'' is a reality.   We know that Judge Gorsuch has spent a decade on the bench and about  10 years in private practice, and he has also worked at the Department  of Justice. Like Justice Scalia, he is a steadfast believer in the  Constitution laws and that they should be interpreted based on their  text; that is, what they actually say.    I asked Judge Gorsuch today: If you don't believe that you ought to  interpret the law based on what the law actually says, what would you  use as your guide? If you are not going to interpret the Constitution  based on what the Constitution says, what are you going to use as your  guide?   Well, some of our friends would talk about a living Constitution or  judges knowing better than perhaps the elected representatives of the  people. To me, that is just misguided. Judges are not philosopher kings  or queens. Judges, as I said at the outset, hold a very important but  finite role in our system of government. It is our job as the  legislature to make the policy. It is the executive--the President's  job--to execute the policy. And if we don't like the law, then it is  our job to change it, not to look to the Court to say: I am going to  let the Congress off the hook, and we are just going to write an  opinion and render a judgment that changes the law under the guise of  actually judging, actually engaging in more policymaking.   Well, the great thing about somebody like Judge Gorsuch is that the  people who admire him also include people who differ from him  politically but have seen him in action--people like the former  Solicitor General under  [[Page S1876]]  President Obama, who said he is ``one of the most thoughtful and  brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century,'' and  someone who ``has always put aside his personal views to serve the rule  of law.''   In other words, Judge Gorsuch is the type of judge that we should all  be able to get behind, and he is exactly the kind of nominee we would  hope to see from any administration. That is why he was previously  confirmed by the U.S. Senate 10 years ago when he was nominated to the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. He was confirmed by voice  vote. For people who may not be familiar with the practices of the  Senate, that essentially is by unanimous consent, by unanimous  agreement, including the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York,  Mr. Schumer. He thought Judge Gorsuch was good enough for the Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals. I would challenge him to identify a reason  why he is not well suited for the United States Supreme Court, unless  it is based on some political calculation.   As the Judiciary Committee this week considers his nomination, I want  to make crystal clear the purpose of the hearing. It is not about  pinning the nominee down or asking trick questions or asking the judge  to prejudge cases that might come before the Court. We know there have  been outside special interest groups who have criticized Judge Gorsuch  for failing to rule in favor of one sympathetic constituency or  another, but, again, that is not what judges do--or what they are  supposed to do. Are they really supposed to find the most sympathetic  party to a lawsuit and say: I am going to decide that case for them,  and I will figure out the justification for it later. That is not what  judges are supposed to do. Judges are supposed to apply the law  impartially and fairly and decide the facts and apply the law and  render judgments on cases or controversies that become before the  court, not write policy at large.   So I think some of these attacks are pretty silly, but they also are  a reminder of the importance of these hearings because I really believe  this is one of those opportunities to help acquaint millions more  Americans with our unique founding story and the unique nature of our  Constitution and our Nation of laws.   I see my friend from Tennessee here. I remember something he told me  once about telling his constituents that one of the important functions  of the Senate was to remind people what it means to be an American.  Well, being an American means believing in the rule of law and equal  justice for all.   I will close on this because I see my friend from Tennessee here  waiting to speak. This is another kind of an interesting statistic I  found pretty amazing, and the Presiding Officer, a distinguished lawyer  in his own right, can marvel at this as I do.   Judge Gorsuch is no radical. He follows the law wherever it leads:  sometimes for the police, sometimes for a criminal defendant; sometimes  for the government, sometimes against the government. That is the way  the rule of law works. He noted that about 97 percent of the thousands  of cases he has decided have been unanimously. As the Presiding Officer  knows, the circuit court sits in three-judge panels. The idea that 97  percent of the cases he decided were decided unanimously is pretty  remarkable, and he sided with the majority 99 percent of the time. This  is nobody out of the mainstream. This is a mainstream judge. So let's  be honest and open about it.    I hope our colleagues across the aisle, after this nominee is voted  out of the Judiciary Committee, will allow us to have an up-or-down  vote on this nomination. It wasn't until the Presidency of George W.  Bush in 2000 that somehow the tradition of allowing an up-or-down vote  for nominees went out the window and instead some people got together  and decided, well, we are going to come up with a rationale to raise  the threshold to 60. In other words, a President won't be able to see  his nominee confirmed unless not just a majority votes for it but 60  people vote for it in the Senate because of the Senate's rules on  cloture closing off debate. That period of our history during the  George W. Bush administration was an aberration, and I would hope no  one would want to repeat that--again, politicizing the judicial  nomination process.   People can vote any way they want, but denying the opportunity for  the Senate to vote up or down on a nominee, particularly to the U.S.  Supreme Court, is certainly not a road I would hope our colleagues  would go down. As they presumably learned this year, after Senator  Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, led his conference into the nuclear  option, which basically changed the Senate rules by breaking the Senate  rules--that is what allowed us to confirm the President's Cabinet with  51 votes, and that is what will allow us to confirm all lower court  judicial nominees with 51 votes. So we would think they might have  learned the lesson that what goes around comes around and that while  you are in the minority one day, you might be in the majority in the  not too distant future. What you force the Senate to do in order to do  its job may end up biting you in the future. So I hope they seriously  consider allowing Judge Gorsuch an up-or-down vote when his nomination  comes to the floor sometime around or after April 3.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m.  today, there be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual  form, remaining on H.J. Res. 69; further, that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the resolution be read a third time and the  Senate vote on the resolution with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).
