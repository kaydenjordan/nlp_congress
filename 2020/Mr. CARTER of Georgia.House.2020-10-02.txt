 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of a Good Samaritan and hero from Georgia's First  Congressional District, Mr. Timothy Ebert of Richmond Hill.   On August 9, Timothy Ebert was on his way to work at the Savannah- Hilton Head International Airport when he got out to help a motorist  near the intersection of I-95 and I-16. When he tried to help another  driver, he was, sadly, hit by another car and killed on the interstate.   Mr. Ebert was one of the kindest, most selfless people. His life was  marked by the way he served others. He was an E-7 Marine veteran who  served his country, friends, family, and even complete strangers with  his utmost abilities.   Timothy loved to spend time exploring the outdoors and playing games  with his family. His two sons, Bryce and Braden; his daughter, Tinley;  and his lovely wife, Lindsay, were his whole world.   It is people like Timothy who make our world a better place and  inspire us to be the best people we can be. He will always be  remembered for his selflessness and kindness, and I know his legacy  will continue.   His friends, family, and all who knew him will continue to be in my  thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on October 2, 2020, I voted  incorrectly on Roll no. 218, on agreeing to the resolution H. Res.  1154, ``Condeming QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theory it  promotes.'' The record should reflect that my intended vote on this  roll call should have been ``aye,'' in favor of passage of the  resolution.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
