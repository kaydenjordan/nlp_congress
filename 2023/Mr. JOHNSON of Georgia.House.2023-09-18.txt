 Mr. Speaker, as a proud member of the  Congressional Labor Caucus, I rise today to stand in solidarity with  the 150,000 members of the United Auto Workers who deserve a fair  shake.   Something is wrong when corporate bigwigs increase their salaries by  40 percent but autoworkers get only a 6 percent increase in the last 4  years.   Something is wrong when the Big Three automakers enjoy $250 billion  in profits over the last 9 years, $66 billion of that going to  shareholders, while autoworkers can't even afford to buy the cars that  they build.   Autoworkers play a huge role in this country's transition to clean  energy, and they deserve to have a fair wage along with benefits and  better working conditions.   I stand with the autoworkers in their fight to secure the contracts  that they deserve.                            ____________________
