 Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged  from further consideration of H.R. 785 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, this is truly a tragic case. The young  woman on my right was born in Guatemala. She suffers from a rare life- threatening disorder called MSP type VI. This is a genetic condition  caused by the absence of an enzyme that is needed for the growth of  healthy bones and connective tissue.   She uses a wheelchair, has a shunt in her brain, and requires a  tracheotomy to help her breathe. Because this was a clinical trial in  2003 when Ms. Bueso was 7 years old, doctors invited her and her family  to come to California so that she could participate in a clinical trial  to treat her condition. That trial led to the development of a  treatment that is now approved by the FDA. It is a 6-hour infusion of a  prescription drug that replaces the enzyme lacking in people with MSP  type VI.   Ms. Bueso now receives this lifesaving treatment every week at the  University of California San Francisco Children's Hospital. This  treatment is not available in Guatemala. If she were removed from the  United States, she would no longer have access to the lifesaving  medical care she needs. She would die.   For the past 10 years, Ms. Bueso and her family have received  deferred action from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services so that  she could continue receiving the treatments that keep her alive.   In 2019, she and her family were notified that their extensions of  deferred action were denied and that they would be deported if they did  not leave the United States within 33 days. This decision was,  effectively, a death sentence for this young person. USCIS ultimately  reconsidered its decision and granted Ms. Bueso and her parents an  additional extension of deferred action.   But since then, she and her family have lived in fear that they might  be forced to leave the United States with no way to provide for the  care she needs. She has beaten the odds because of one thing--the  lifesaving treatment that she is receiving in the United States.   She is now 26 years old. She lives in Concord, CA. She is a 2018  graduate of Cal State University in the East Bay, and I am very proud  of her. She has become an outspoken advocate on behalf of people with  rare diseases. Her family pays taxes, owns a home, and is active in  their community. The Bueso family will now be allowed to remain in  California, where they will continue to enrich their community and  where Ms. Bueso will be able to receive the care that allows her to  live a life and to thrive.   So I thank you, and I know my colleague Senator Padilla is here on  the floor. I would yield to him.    May I just make one remark? I want to thank the  Senator for his excellent remarks.  [[Page S7805]]    Once in a while, we have a case that is really so difficult and sad  to solve, and this is one of them. It happens to be a constituent of  both of ours in California, and they have asked for help. I hope this  Senate will respond and give that help.   Thank you very much.                            ____________________
