 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for the purpose of the majority leader telling us the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   I am going to have some specific questions about the tax bill, but  before I do that, it is our understanding that substantial changes are  being made in the tax bill that was put on the floor last Thursday, a  week ago.   Does the gentleman know whether that is accurate or not?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, regular order is having hearings and  witnesses, is it not?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   I don't share his enthusiasm for this bill, which I think will be  very harmful, will explode the debt, and be a bait-and-switch on the  middle class whether it will get a tax cut early and a tax increase  later on.   Is the gentleman aware, when he talks about growth, that in the  comparable 9 months of 2016 to the same months in 2017 under Trump,  that there were 326,000 more jobs created in 2016 than have been  created in 2017 in those analogous months?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, a lot more is the answer.   Why is the NFIB, Mr. Speaker, against this bill if it is so good for  small business? Why is the AARP against this bill if it is so good for  small business? Why is the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which is  worried about the national debt, against it?   Mr. Speaker, since I have been here, my Republican friends have been  talking about we have got to balance the budget. The President said he  is going to balance the budget in 9 years. That was hooey.   Our Republican friends have said they are going to balance the  budget. They said it in the Price budget. They said it in the Ryan  budget. The budget deficit keeps getting bigger, and they have been in  charge of economic policy for a long time.   The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, I have got a list of 50  groups that are against this bill because they think it hurts both the  debt and middle-income people.   The distribution, according not to fact-checkers but the Joint  Committee on Taxation, $1 trillion of the tax cuts go to business, $230  billion to individuals, and $170 billion on estates essentially. Now,  that doesn't add up to the $1.7 or $1.8 trillion that has been computed  to be the deficit created--the additional debt--by this bill.   In fact, that is why this bill is being rewritten right now. I  guarantee my friend--and he can call me this next week--that the bill  that was introduced last Thursday will not look like the bill that we  will consider on the floor. It won't.    It won't because, first of all, the debt is a problem for,  apparently, some people. It is a big problem for me. We ought to pay  for what we buy. That is what the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee, Mr. Camp, did: a bill that was paid for--an honest bill that  was paid for, as was the 1986 tax reform bill. It did not add to the  debt.   This adds an extraordinary amount to the debt. As a matter of fact,  it adds in one fell swoop the debt that was created on the Reagan  administration approximately $1.7 trillion. It is being rewritten now.   My presumption is, as we have done 49 times this year, that this bill  will be presented under a closed rule in a transparent Congress, where  everybody's views are going to be considered. I stand here and say that  the gentleman is not going to bring this bill to the floor with an open  rule where amendments can be offered, where people can discuss options,  and we can see what the ramifications are to middle class taxpayers.   The Joint Committee on Taxation also pointed out that, of this  figure, individuals are going to get a tax cut of  [[Page H8681]]  which Mr. Ryan talks about of $1,182--a typical family, he refers to  them--but that figure will start to go down in 2019 and will go down  further in 2020 so that it is a bait-and-switch. You get it up front,  but we are going to take it away.   In the Ways and Means Committee, one of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, I  tell the majority that I am not very enthusiastic is because they  asked: Do we also do this for businesses? Do we also do it for the  estate tax? Do we also do it for the wealthy?   The answer to that question is no. Only the middle-income worker has  their tax cut reduced over the next 5 years, but not so with business,  not so with the wealthiest taxpayers in America, and not so, obviously,  with the estate tax. So that, I can tell the gentleman, is why I am not  nearly as enthusiastic about it as some others would be.   We limit State and local tax deductions, which the middle class  takes. We limit the mortgage interest deduction used by homeowners. We  eliminate the student loan deduction and we eliminate the medical  expense deduction. So if you have a major medical expense, you are  going to lose under this bill.   It eliminates the deduction for moving expenses if your employer  wants you to go more than 50 miles from your home. It eliminates the  deduction for the adoption tax credit. That could be a credit of  $13,570 per eligible child that you will lose. It eliminates the  deduction for teachers that helps them purchase pencils, papers,  rulers, and other materials for students.   It eliminates the deduction for dependent care assistance--a  substantial challenge for many of our families in America. It eliminate  personal exemptions, which Americans can currently deduct for  themselves, a spouse and dependents that grows to the size of the  family. If you have a large family, you lose under this bill. If you  have one child, the majority leader may be right. When you get to two  children, three children, and four children with no deductions, you are  going to lose under this bill. That is why I am not very enthusiastic  about it.   I tell this leader, Mr. Speaker, perhaps the changes will make me  more enthusiastic. Perhaps there will be a recognition that this is not  the bill that is going to do what it is purported to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I heard almost word for word the majority party intone  that vision and prediction when we passed the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts-- almost word for word. That economic policy stayed in place until 2009.   Why?   Because the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the  Presidency.                                time  1145    And what did it bring us?   An almost Hoover-like depression. Not quite, because when we came  into office, we invested in bringing back a declining economy.   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader didn't respond when I said the  growth of jobs was better in 2016, under Barack Obama, than it has been  under Donald Trump.   We are going to have an opportunity to debate this bill, but I will  tell my friend, when he says this is the process, the process is going  to be that the chairman of the committee will come in with a major  amendment to this bill that none of us on this side will have seen, and  the bill will be brought to the floor next week.   My friend, the majority leader--and I want to say something: he is my  friend, and we do cooperate on a positive fashion--and I disagree  strongly on this issue. I am against the creation of debt.   He mentions the budget. Okay. That is a fair point. But I have been  pretty consistent throughout my career to join with the Peterson  Foundation that says we have got to get a handle on this debt. We have  a growing economy and 4.4 percent unemployment. The stock market is  going up.   So what do we have here?   An extraordinary stimulus bill with $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion,  $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion of debt, presumably, as the majority  leader admits, to stimulate the economy. Very frankly, if Democrats  were doing this, we would be savaged by the other side.   We will debate this, and we will look forward to seeing how the bill  is going to be when it comes to the floor. Hopefully, we might get the  manager's amendment, or, better said, the chairman's amendment, prior  to its coming to the floor. I would hope we would have, at least, maybe  even 48 or 24 hours' notice of what that amendment is going to look  like so that not only  [[Page H8682]]  we, but the American people, who will have no opportunity to come in  and give their opinions or testify, at least they will know what we are  voting on. We will try to make sure they know.   One other issue I would like to speak about, Mr. Speaker, before we  end, and that is the request that the President of the United States  made to us.   He talked about the order issued by President Obama dealing with  childhood arrivals who came here as minors, not on their own volition,  called DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. There were a  number of Republicans who had a press conference today, and they said  we ought to pass that bill before the end of this year. I urge the  majority leader to pass this bill by the end of next week, before the  Thanksgiving break.   This, Mr. Speaker, I believe is an issue on which, as Mr. Barton  said, who is one of the senior Members on the Republican side of the  aisle, if it is brought to the floor, it would have over 300 votes.   Representative Barton said that, not me. I said that last week. I am  glad that Mr. Barton agrees with me.   We need to take care of this issue at the request of the President of  the United States, who said: I love these kids. He didn't follow that  with: I am not going to send them out of the country. What he said was  that they were not protected the proper way and asked the Congress to  take care of this.   I have urged the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 months,  to bring this to the floor. I know that a task force has been  appointed. I don't know that the task force has reached a conclusion,  but I would urge the majority leader and Speaker Ryan, who urged the  President not to rescind the protection of these young people, urged  him not to rescind President Obama's order. But when he did, the  President said: I am going to do it because it wasn't done properly. It  is the Congress' responsibility.   Mr. Leader, I would urge you to bring to the floor the Dream Act,  which is the manifestation of the response to that. There are other  options as well. We understand that. But something ought to be brought  to the floor so that these young people are not twisting in the wind  through Thanksgiving and Christmas. This is the country they know. This  is the country in which they have been brought up.   When Rush Limbaugh says, ``We are not going to send these kids  home,'' I can't believe that any of us on this floor are going to vote  to send these young people home. We need legislation to pass to protect  them and to give them the confidence.   There is a wonderful editorial--I urge all of you to read it--from  Bob Gates, our former Secretary of Defense under both Presidents Bush  and Obama. He wrote an editorial about the thousands of, essentially,  DACA children, young people, who have served in our Armed Forces  valiantly. As a matter of fact, he said the attrition rate is a lot  less with DACA-protected individuals than it is with others.   Bob Gates is right. We ought to act. President Trump, in this  instance, is right. It is our responsibility. We ought to act. Fred  Upton said that today in the press conference. Joe Barton said that in  the press conference. The gentleman from Washington State, who led the  press conference, said that.   Mr. Leader, this is an issue I think on which we agree. The tax bill  is going to be an issue on which we are in contention. Let's give the  American people another example, as we have in the past, of a place  where we can work together, get something constructive and positive  done for our country and for these young people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   I will say on this floor--the fact-checkers check me--millions and  millions and millions of middle class taxpayers will get a tax increase  under this bill. Check me. Millions of people.   Why do I say that?   The Joint Committee on Taxation tells me that. Other think groups  tell me that from the conservative side of the ledger.   So we will argue this bill, but I will repeat again that I have heard  that argument over and over and over again. I heard it in 1981, and we  exploded the debt. I heard it in 2001 and 2003, and we exploded the  debt. We had the deepest recession anybody on this floor who is sitting  here now has experienced. I hear it today.   The reason the Peter G. Peterson Foundation is against this is  because they believe exploding the debt by another $1.5 trillion will  be an extraordinary detriment to our country.   I want to say to every Member, Mr. Speaker, when you get up and say:  I don't want to hurt my children, there may be people who get a tax cut  under this bill, but I guarantee you the people who are getting a tax  increase, in addition to the middle class I have just talked about, are  the children. They are going to have to pay off this debt. We will not  pay it off.   When you speak on this floor and say it is an immoral act to put our  children more deeply into debt, if you believe that, you will not be  able to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
