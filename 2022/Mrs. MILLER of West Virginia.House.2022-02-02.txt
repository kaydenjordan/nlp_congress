 Madam Speaker, President Biden's trade  moratorium undermines U.S. leadership and hands all adversaries a  dangerous opportunity to get ahead.   China is seizing this moment to advance in the Indo-Pacific. This is  why I join with my colleague, Darin LaHood, to introduce the U.S. Trade  Leadership in the Indo-Pacific and China Act. Our bill would require  President Biden to act and report on a trade strategy in the Indo- Pacific and with China.   Once again, Democrats didn't allow any bipartisan input in their  legislation. There has been zero guidance by President Biden on a trade  plan with China. Instead, we continue on a useless wait-and-see  approach.   The competition between the U.S. and China demands strong leadership.  Democrats must wake up to this reality and take decisive action.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our bill to ensure  America's lasting trade leadership.
