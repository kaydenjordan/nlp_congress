 Mr. Speaker, the bill before us creates  a dangerous race to the bottom, forcing States to accept concealed  carry permits from all other States, regardless of their training  standards, their background check system, or their safety requirements.   Make no mistake, this bill would make it easier to cross State lines  with hidden, loaded weapons, threatening local communities by making it  harder for law enforcement to determine who is lawfully caring a  firearm. No wonder sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement  agencies oppose this bill.   What a shame it is that, after the terrible mass shootings in Las  Vegas and Texas, the first gun-related bill this House considers would  actually make it easier for dangerous people to carry concealed weapons  in more places.   Mr. Speaker, these tragedies aren't inevitable. They are the result  of policy choices. We could be working together to enact commonsense  measures to respond to the gun violence epidemic facing our country.  But as long as Republicans are beholden to NRA extremism, these  proposals, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears.   I urge my colleagues to reject this shameful proposal and to work,  instead, to address the root causes of gun violence in this country.                                time  1315
