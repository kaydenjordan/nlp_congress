 Mr. Speaker, one of the things that I am most proud of  is being from Minnesota. What a beautiful State that we have. People  joke about how cold it is in the wintertime, but let me tell you,  Minnesota is awesome all year round.   One of the things that we are so proud of is the Boundary Waters. Mr.  Speaker, look at this picture. This is no glossed-up photo. This is  what it looks like. It is awesome.   Back before I was in Congress, I was able to bring young people to  the Boundary Waters who were court-involved. Mr. Speaker, one day a  judge asked me: Hey, Ellison, come up here. You want to take some kids  to the Boundary Waters?   I said: Fine. I kept doing it for 5 years straight because I loved  the place.   Yet this bill will perhaps damage all that, all that beauty, that gem  of our State, which not only is a beautiful place that needs to be  preserved for people, but also is a job-generator. A lot of people earn  good livings because of the Boundary Waters, and if we just do this,  pass this bill, what it will do is jeopardize their livelihood and our  crown jewel of our State.   This bill will grant a mining company the right to build sulfide-ore  copper mines along rivers and lakes that flow directly into the  Boundary Waters. Sulfide-ore copper mining has never been done without  polluting water, and thousands of communities and wildlife will be at  risk.   When you mine sulfide ore, water and air interact to create sulfuric  acid. One leak or spill would contaminate substantial portions of the  Boundary Waters, decimating wildlife and habitat, and destroying the  livelihoods of so many Minnesota workers.   The Boundary Waters, the waters of the Boundary Waters, are  especially vulnerable to acid mine drainage because they lack a  buffering capacity.   This bill is a bad idea, and I urge Members to vote ``no.'' This bill  will undermine core environmental laws, including the Antiquities Act,  the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the National  Environmental Policy Act.   The Antiquities Act is a bipartisan conservation law to protect  irreplaceable Federal lands, including in the Grand Canyon, Acadia  Forest, Zion, Muir Woods in California, and the Olympic National Parks.  If they undermine the Antiquities Act, what else is in danger? Well, I  would say every national treasure of the United States.   This attack on the Antiquities Act is an attack against our national  parks and monuments, making this not only a Minnesota issue, but a  national issue.   This bill would permanently lock in all mineral leases on Minnesota's  national forests by overriding two laws on mineral leasing in  Minnesota's national forests that require Forest Service consent to any  mining. They don't want to go around the regular process. They want to  use Congress to short-circuit that process.   If you have never been to the Boundary Waters, as I said, I urge you  to go there. If you vote ``no'' on this bill, you will not just be  protecting the Boundary Waters for yourself and people around all over  the United States, you will be protecting it for your grandchildren.   Much is said here about children and grandchildren. Think about the  Boundary Waters when you think about the legacy that we are leaving our  grandchildren and how H.R. 3905 would destroy and jeopardize that  legacy.   Economic analysis by Key-Log Economics shows that sulfide-ore mining  on the Superior National Forest lands and the watershed of the Boundary  Waters could lead to a loss of 5,000 jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 20,000  jobs in the rest of the economy.                                time  1600    As people tout this bill as a job creator, it is a job destroyer. I  would tell you that, if you are an outfitter or you are a wilderness  guide or you are a forest ranger, your job is just as important as  anybody else's. What this bill is saying is, no, your job is no good.  Nobody cares about it. Only the mine companies' interests are  important.   We could stand to lose $1.6 billion in annual income and $500 million  in reduction in private property values because of this piece of  legislation.   We shouldn't have to choose between a robust economy and a clean  environment. We can and must have both. Saying ``no'' to this piece of  legislation gives us a chance at both. Voting for it makes us pick one  over the other, and not just economic interests, but certain  interests--not everyone's.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  extra time.   Mr. Speaker, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are  studying this issue, but the author doesn't want to wait for the study  because he knows the study is not going to help. They just want to  drive this mine straight through without doing the proper care.   More than 126,000 Americans participated in the study and asked for  protection of the Boundary Waters. Minnesota voters oppose copper  mining near the Boundary Waters by more than 2 to 1, and 79 percent  support the current study.  [[Page H9508]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this. This is a  bad bill. It is not good legislation, and the damage it will do is not  Republican nor is it Democratic. It is American. Vote ``no.''
