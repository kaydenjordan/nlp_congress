 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized to speak as in morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest  gratitude to my friends at the Mayo Clinic's Arizona campus, where I  was recently treated for cancer. This is not my first obligation to the  Arizona branch of this landmark medical institution, which has been a  synonym for medical excellence for more than 100 years. I received  outstanding care for a prior, unrelated tumor in the year 2000.   In July of this year, I found myself at Mayo once again. It is no  exaggeration to say that the team of doctors, nurses, and technicians  who looked after me were my salvation. They located and removed a brain  tumor--a glioblastoma--that threatened my life. I will always be  indebted for their timely and skillful intervention and for the  outstanding support provided to my family by the entire Mayo community.  Their professionalism is unmatched, as is their compassion. Thanks to  my physicians, I was able to return to the Senate after only 10 days of  recuperation. Following my surgery, I received radiation and  chemotherapy at Mayo in one of the most modern facilities in the world.   I mention this to draw attention to Mayo's renown as a center of  excellence not only in the treatment of cancer but in virtually every  field of medicine. A nonprofit institution, Mayo has large hospitals in  Rochester, Minnesota, Phoenix, and Jacksonville, FL, which employ  almost 50,000 people. Mayo also operates a network of more than 70  affiliated hospitals and clinics, to which more than 1.3 million  persons turned for treatment this year, patients from all 50 States and  137 different countries. Moreover, the Mayo system operates several  premier colleges of medicine and is a world leader in medical research.  This breadth of activity, outstanding in each facet, is remarkable. It  is no exaggeration to claim that the Mayo Clinic is central to the  astonishing success of American medicine.   I have made my own career in public service, but as I reflect on my  experience as a cancer patient, I am humbled by the example of service  to mankind provided by the entire Mayo family. I am and will always  remain deeply grateful to everyone involved in my care.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to remember the  life and legacy of one of our Nation's veterans, a longtime staffer,  and a man whom I was fortunate to call my friend, James ``Bob''  Currieo. Following his retirement from my Tucson office in 2013, I am  grateful that Bob was able to spend his final years with his beloved  wife, Cecilia, before his passing on October 17, 2017. It is times like  these that we must reflect on the legacy of such individuals, who chose  service above self-interest, and Bob's 83-year life and service to our  Nation and to the great State of Arizona cannot be understated.   By the time I met Bob in 1982, he had already begun his tenure as the  national commander-in-chief for the Veterans of Foreign Wars; however,  his legacy of service began long before. A decorated Korean war  veteran, Bob honorably served over a 22-year career in the U.S. Army,  including a fortunate assignment to the U.S. Army Combat Surveillance  School at Fort Huachuca that would bring him to Arizona. Sierra Vista  introduced Bob to the rugged and diverse beauty of our great State, a  place that he would consider home for the remainder of his life.   I was fortunate that Bob accepted a role in my early Senate staff,  but so evident was Bob's innate dedication to service that I fully  understood and supported when he temporarily departed Arizona for the  opportunity to continue his duties with the VFW as an executive in  Washington, DC. We stayed in touch over the years, and I was most  grateful when he returned to his beloved Arizona in 1996 and agreed to  rejoin my Tucson office. There, he would spend the final 17 years of  his well-decorated career advocating on behalf of veterans and  servicemembers.   Every Senator will likely stress the importance of providing  constituent services in their home State, but Bob shared and supported  my strong opinion that, when it came to veterans and servicemembers,  State lines did not matter. Of the staggering number of cases that Bob  worked as a constituent advocate for residents of Arizona, nearly as  many more were for veterans from across the country and indeed across  the world. He helped them all equally with the same quiet but steadfast  commitment, and I feel there is truly no measure for how many lives he  touched and how many men and women he helped by the end of his storied  career.   I will forever be thankful that Bob Currieo's intrinsic desire to  serve put him on a path to Arizona that fortunately crossed my own. I  will fondly remember the years of friendship and wise counsel that he  so selflessly gave, and I hope his dear Cecilia will find comfort in  the immeasurable legacy left behind by such an honorable man.   Thank you.                            ____________________
