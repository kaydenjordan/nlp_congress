 Madam President, my home State has truly lost a  shining star. We have lost a devoted West Virginian, a noble Army  Veteran, a gifted performer, and a dear friend to all. George  Daugherty's enthusiasm for life was infectious to anybody who had the  privilege of knowing him, and it is an honor to recognize his life and  legacy.   You could often find George on Morgantown's High Street next to the  bronze statue of Don Knotts singing a rousing chorus of ``Hail West  Virginia.'' He would usually tack on a phrase at the end about beating  Pitt that was met with rousing applause from those who stopped on the  street to cheer him on. He was quite a character and best known as a  musician, but he made a life for himself by practicing law.   Despite his musical comedy role in the Charleston jamboree, George's  professionalism working on medical malpractice cases never faltered. He  said he never had a bad relationship with a doctor he sued, and he  generally ended up becoming friends with them. That was just who he  was.   Another key component that made George the person he was, affecting  his music and life, was his unwavering patriotism. His father was a  World War I veteran and instilled in him the pride and, of course, the  patriotic songs that George would perform on stage, dressed in American  flag-themed attire. He instilled these values in his children and  grandchildren, encouraging them to be grateful for our freedom and to  always remember where they have come from, and our statewide community  is better for it.   It was an honor to call George my friend, a man who proudly showcased  our State through performances across the Nation as ``the Earl of  Elkview'' or ``the Duke of Dunbar.'' He and my Uncle A. James were dear  friends for many years, and I know he would have been so very proud to  see all that George did to promote the State we love. Whether  performing on the Capitol City Jamboree and the Mountain Stage,  contributing over 50 years of excellence and professionalism practicing  law, or giving back to his community, George represented the best of  West Virginia, which is saying quite a lot. He was a proud  representative of our beautiful State no matter where life took him.   What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by  dear friends and family. It is my hope that his loved ones are able to  find peace, strength, and support in one another. I extend my  condolences to Mary Jarvis Currence and their children, Dick, Nancy,  Sallie, and Thomas, their grandchildren, Kiera, Devlin, Aidan, Jamie,  and Beth, as well as to George's many dear friends and extended family.  I know he is looking down on all of you with a smile. I am honored to  join each of you in honoring George's memory, as well as the unwavering  love he had for his family, our great Nation, and our home  State.                            ____________________
