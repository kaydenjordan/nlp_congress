 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member  Engel, and the co-chair of the Friends of a Free, Stable, and  Democratic Syria Caucus with me, Representative Boyle, for their work  on this bill.   In the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, we thought it was going  to be peaceful. Since then, 500,000 Syrians are dead--50,000 of which  are children--at the hands of the brutal Assad regime.   Assad, his regime, Russia, and Iran have committed genocide across  Syria. They have targeted hospitals and schools, and they have  destroyed critical infrastructure with indiscriminate barrel bombs and  airstrikes. They reduced much of the country to rubble. As long as  Assad is in power, they should be fully responsible for rebuilding.   The No Assistance for Assad Act would place conditions on American  non-humanitarian assistance in Syrian territories controlled by the  Assad regime or their allies.   By limiting our reconstruction assistance to Assad, we send a strong  message that the American people will not support any efforts to  legitimize or bolster the barbaric Assad regime--a regime that uses  chemical weapons on its own innocent civilians, as we saw especially  recently.   We have seen far too many horrifying images of the bloody and  besieged children across Syria, suffering at the hands of an evil war  criminal.   As of January 2018, the United States has provided more than $7.7  billion in humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria. We will  continue to support the innocent victims with emergency food, safe  drinking water, shelter, and other vital resources that they  desperately need.   Separately, this legislation places strict conditions on the non- humanitarian assistance for things like early recovery, stabilization,  and reconstruction in the Assad-controlled Syrian territories.   The release of all political prisoners and providing full access to  Syrian prisoners for human rights investigations and removing those  human rights abusers from positions of authority are just two of the  conditions included in this bill. The Syrian Government must also end  all attacks against civilians and halt the development and deployment  of ballistic and cruise missiles.   For our own national security and that of our allies, we must do all  we can now to prevent the next generation of terrorists down the road.                                time  1700    Without hope and opportunity, the people of Syria and those across  the Middle East will become prime recruits for groups like ISIS,  Hezbollah, and others.   The United States of America must take a stand against the genocide  in Syria, the inhumane war crimes against the innocent people of Syria,  and the oppressive strongmen, those like Assad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4681,  the No Assistance for Assad Act.
