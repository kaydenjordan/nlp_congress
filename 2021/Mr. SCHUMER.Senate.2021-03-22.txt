(The resolution is printed in today's Record under ``Submitted  Resolutions.'')                            ____________________     Madam President, this is a great and historic day. A few  weeks ago, I announced that LTG Karen Gibson would assume the  responsibility as Senate Sergeant at Arms, becoming only the 42nd  Sergeant at Arms in Senate history. I am very pleased this afternoon to  make her appointment official, with her family watching on--her father  David, her mother Rebecca, her sister Kathleen, her brother-in-law  Daniel, her nephew Bennett, and her cousin Aaron.   Lieutenant General Gibson is taking on a really big job, and I know  that her family could not be more proud of her.   The Senate Sergeant at Arms was established more than two centuries  ago, when the U.S. Senate was still in its infancy. Back then, the  primary duty of the Sergeant at Arms was essentially senatorial  babysitting; recalcitrant Senators made finding a quorum a routine  challenge. Today, the Sergeant at Arms is the Senate's chief  administrative officer and chief law enforcement officer. They have  enormous responsibility of keeping the trains running on time while, at  the same time, keeping everyone, everyone in the Capitol safe.  [[Page S1663]]    Suffice it to say, Lieutenant General Gibson has a tall order, but I  have every confidence that she will perform her duties at the same  exemplary standards she set over the course of her three-decade  military career.   As Senior Intelligence Officer in the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence, Lieutenant General Gibson supported U.S.  national security objectives in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Africa, Korea,  the Pacific, and across the Middle East. Since January 6, she has been  working with retired Army LTG Russel Honore on a comprehensive review  of the Capitol's security.   So given her background and given what she has done recently, I know  she is ready to hit the ground running. Lieutenant General Gibson is  ready to go, and her responsibility to ensure a safe working  environment for Senators, visitors, Capitol employees, staff, and  reporters she will take with the utmost of gravity and competence.   Joining her in the Office of Sergeant at Arms will be Kelly Fado, as  Deputy Sergeant, and Jennifer Hemingway, as chief of staff, two trusted  members of the Senate family.   This is a historic day in a second way. This will be the first time  in the history of the Senate that the leadership of the Sergeant at  Arms will be comprised entirely of women--another crack in the glass  ceiling. And I cannot think of a better team than the one we have put  together.   Congratulations to all three of them on officially starting their new  roles today. And I know, Madam President, you are proud of that as  well.   It is really a good day.                            ____________________     Madam President, next, another aspect of why this is a  good day.   Tonight, the Senate will confirm Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston to serve  as Secretary of Labor. The son of Irish immigrants, Mayor Walsh  followed his father's footsteps in construction and joined the  Laborers' Union Local 223 at age 21, eventually serving as its  president before being elected mayor of Boston.   During his testimony here in the Senate, Mayor Walsh said it was by  joining a union that his parents were able to climb up into the middle  class and give their son a shot at a better life.   We have something in common. My grandfather came to the United States  and became very involved with the labor movement. One day when he was  14, it was raining. He was looking for shelter. It was pouring. He had  almost nowhere to live. He walked into the labor temple, where he heard  Eugene V. Debs and Will and Ariel Durant give the annual address at  that temple established by the A.F. of L. to teach the immigrants about  the union movement. So we have that in common. Our grandfathers are  immigrants--one from Ireland, one from Eastern Europe, but both joined  the labor movement, and it helped their family move up.   The Department of Labor is in desperate need of a leader with Mayor  Walsh's perspective. For the past 4 years under President Trump and  Secretary Scalia, unfortunately, sadly, the Labor Department has too  often sided with corporate America, not the working people of America,  which it was formed to help. Once the Senate confirms Mayor Walsh,  American workers will finally have one of their own leading the  Department of Labor, someone from working America who will fight for  working America.   I am proud to say that once Mayor Walsh is confirmed tonight, the  Senate will have confirmed all 15 of President Biden's Cabinet  Secretaries.   Under extraordinary circumstances, unusual responsibilities, a later  than usual runoff election, an evenly divided Chamber, an insurrection,  an impeachment trial, and the passage of historic Federal relief, the  Senate has still stayed on track and confirmed President Biden's  Cabinet faster than both of the last two administrations. Let me say  that again. With everything else going on, the Senate has confirmed  President Biden's Cabinet faster than during both of the prior two  administrations, one a Democrat and one a Republican. Every single  member of President Biden's Cabinet has received a bipartisan vote in  favor of confirmation. I anticipate that the vote in favor of Mayor  Walsh will stay true to form, completing an unblemished record of  bipartisan confirmations to the Cabinet.   It is a tribute to President Biden and his team that they have chosen  such a fine Cabinet and a tribute to the Senators here that we have  moved in such a quick fashion despite so many other responsibilities  being placed on our shoulders in these early days of this Congress.   Few Cabinets in history have begun their tenures with such daunting  tasks: a once-in-a-century pandemic, an economy in the doldrums, global  challenges like climate change and democratic decline. Thankfully, this  Senate has made sure President Biden's Cabinet is in place and on the  job as quickly as possible. We will continue the personnel business  this week by installing the Deputy Director at OMB, the Surgeon  General, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, and  Deputy Secretaries at Energy and Treasury.                            ____________________     Madam President, PPP. In addition to these nominees, the  Senate has another important matter of legislative business on the  agenda this week: an extension of the bipartisan Paycheck Protection  Program, which is set to expire at the end of the month.   Since its inception, the Paycheck Protection Program has generated  more than 7.8 million loans to keep America's businesses afloat during  what has been the worst economic crisis in three-quarters of a century,  since the Great Depression. With the help of the American Rescue Plan,  our economy is finally turning the corner, but businesses are not out  of the woods yet and are likely to need assistance for another few  months as the country continues to recover.   Most borrowers are currently awaiting loan approvals at the Small  Business Administration, and many more are still looking to apply.  Working with the Biden administration, we made important changes to the  PPP program to expand eligibility and access to nonprofits, to hard-hit  independent venues, and to make it easier for the smallest, most  underserved businesses to get relief, particularly microbusinesses,  sole proprietors, and woman-owned and minority-owned businesses.   There is no reason--no reason--to let this program expire while there  are still scores of applicants in line and billions of dollars left in  the program. The House already passed the extension of the program by  an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 415 to 3. A bipartisan group of  Senators, including Senators Cardin and Collins, Shaheen, Marshall,  Sullivan, and Murkowski, support identical legislation here in the  Senate.   So we are not going to end this week without passing an extension.  Again, the Senate must pass another extension of the Paycheck  Protection Program before the end of the week and make sure the  Nation's small businesses can have access to this very vital lifeline.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 22, 2021, at 6 p.m., to conduct  a closed hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a joint resolution  at the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the joint resolution on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 23; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the nomination of Shalanda Young to be the Deputy  Director of OMB; further, that the cloture motions filed during  Thursday's session of the Senate ripen at 11:45 a.m., and if cloture is  invoked on the Young nomination, all postcloture time expire at 2:15  p.m.; finally, that the Senate recess following the cloture vote on the  Young nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus  meetings.    For the information of Senators, we expect to have four  rollcall votes during Tuesday's session of the Senate in relation to  the Young and Murthy nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Portman.
