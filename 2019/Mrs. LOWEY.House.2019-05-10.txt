 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2157.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Last year, we watched hurricanes pummel Florida, Georgia, and the  Carolinas; wildfires burn large swaths of the West; and typhoons strike  territories in the Pacific.   In addition to the tragic loss of life, families lost everything,  businesses were upended, and communities were ripped apart.   That is why, in January, the House passed an emergency disaster  relief bill, H.R. 268, to help our fellow Americans recover and  rebuild. Unfortunately, the bill languished for months  [[Page H3688]]  in the Senate over assistance for Puerto Rico. As it sat there, floods  battered the Midwest and tornadoes swept the South, resulting in even  more destruction. And it sat there in the Senate.   This legislation attempts to meet the needs of all of America's  disaster-stricken communities, whether in Puerto Rico or the Midwest,  California or the Carolinas, with $17.2 billion in emergency spending.   In addition to the funding provided in H.R. 268, the bill makes three  critical additions.   It includes $1.5 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for  repairs to Corps projects damaged by flooding and natural disasters.   It provides $1 billion for Community Development Block Grant Disaster  Recovery, with language ensuring it is spent quickly to help  communities rebuild housing, businesses, and public infrastructure in  the most impacted and distressed areas affected by major natural  disasters.   And it includes $500 million for the Department of Agriculture's  Emergency Conservation Program, providing emergency funding and  technical assistance to farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland  damaged by natural disasters.   That is an additional $3 billion to address the urgent needs  following the Midwest floods and Southern tornadoes, and an additional  $3 billion to rebuild damaged infrastructure, to help communities  recover, and to bring local economies back to life.   American citizens are relying on our Federal Government to deliver a  robust disaster relief package. They have waited long enough. Frankly,  they can't afford to wait any longer.   Further delays will only leave communities more vulnerable and  exposed to future natural disasters. With the Atlantic hurricane season  beginning in just 4 weeks and looming summer heat increasing wildfire  risk, we must act now.   Madam Chair, this legislation is a critical and long-overdue step to  meeting our fellow citizens' urgent needs. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) the chairwoman of the Energy and  Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.     Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Transportation  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Interior Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), the chairwoman of the Small Business  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from New York an  additional 2 minutes.                                time  0945     Madam Chair, it is time to stop playing games and provide  assistance to all Americans, no matter whether you lost your home to a  wildfire in the West, farmland to flooding in the Midwest, or your  entire community to a hurricane in Puerto Rico. Vote ``yes.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
