 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Meeks for his  extraordinary leadership in this very important moment.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 956 and in solidarity with the  people of Ukraine.   On February 24, Vladimir Putin thought he was making another step  toward realizing his delusional pursuit of reconstituting the U.S.S.R.  when he ordered the brutal invasion of the sovereign and peaceful  nation of Ukraine.   Vladimir Putin thought the Ukrainian people would give in quickly to  the violence and abandon their freedoms.   Vladimir Putin thought President Zelensky would flee and capitulate  to Russian demands.   Vladimir Putin thought the world would turn a blind eye toward  Russian aggression.   Vladimir Putin thought wrong.   In fact, as Chairman Meeks said, we saw firsthand the determination  and the will of the Ukrainian people to fight to preserve their own  country and their own freedoms. They are doing that today, fighting day  by day, hour by hour, to protect their country and secure a free and  democratic future for themselves and their families.   The free world has rallied together to impose devastating sanctions  against Russia, against the Russian economy, and to hold the Putin  regime and his enablers to account for their crimes.   I strongly support this resolution, and I know the United States and  its allies are united behind the people of Ukraine, behind the values  of freedom and democracy and against the tyranny of a thuggish  dictator, Vladimir Putin.   I thank Chairman Meeks for his extraordinary leadership and thank  Ranking Member McCaul as well.
