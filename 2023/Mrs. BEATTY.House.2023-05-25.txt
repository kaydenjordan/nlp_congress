 Madam Speaker, fact: Republicans went home.   Fact: Their side of the Chamber is empty.   Fact: They do not want to negotiate, and they are holding our economy  hostage to a ransom note of partisan demands.   Fact: They are taking Medicaid away from millions, firing teachers,  removing children from childcare, and ripping food assistance away from  our families. They are even slashing veterans' healthcare.   Fact: Their plan would cut jobs.   Republicans are playing political games. They have even said that  they are holding us hostage and will not negotiate.   Do you know what, Madam Speaker? It is the American people and our  children, like those who are in the gallery today, that they are  holding hostage.   It is obvious that Republicans are defaulting on our debt.    Instead of honoring our sacred obligation to pay our  bills--  Democrats will not let the bank of justice be destroyed  by MAGA Republicans.    We come to this floor today, the people's House, to put  people over politics.
