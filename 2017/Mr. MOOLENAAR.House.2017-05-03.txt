 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Cole, Chairman  Frelinghuysen, and the entire Committee on Appropriations, as well as  the President and congressional leaders in both the House and the  Senate for their work on this bipartisan appropriations bill.   This legislation is not perfect, but it addresses many priorities for  the people of Michigan and the United States. It funds the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative, which protects the Great Lakes. It instructs  the Army Corps of Engineers to turn over its report on stopping Asian  carp from invading the Great Lakes.   It funds important scientific research at Michigan State University,  and it continues support for vaccines against emerging threats. It also  commits funding for cures research at the National Institutes of  Health, including the fight against Alzheimer's, so we can work on  stopping this nefarious disease that steals golden years from our  seniors.   For the rural communities in my district, this legislation increases  funding for rural development grants and the Farm Service Agency.   This legislation promotes border security and integrity, providing  more money for Customs and Border Patrol and increasing the number of  Border Patrol agents hired.   This legislation will ensure that our men and women in uniform have  the resources they need to keep us safe from threats, including North  Korea, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.   This legislation makes important cuts, including eliminating wasteful  funding for U.N. programs that overreach and run counter to the ideals  of our country.   Finally, this legislation extends prohibitions on funding for  abortion that have been in place for years.   This legislation addresses many important priorities for the people  of Michigan and our entire Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.
