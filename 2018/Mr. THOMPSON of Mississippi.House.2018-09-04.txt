 Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6439, the Biometric  Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program Authorization Act  of 2018.   I have long supported Department of Homeland Security overseas  programs aimed at preventing terrorist threats from ever arriving at  our borders. In fact, over the years, I have sponsored a number of  measures that specifically seek to drive greater international  collaboration and expand DHS' overseas border security footprint.   Two well-established overseas DHS programs that come to mind are:   U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Preclearance program, in which  officers are posted abroad to screen travelers prior to boarding U.S.- bound flights; and   Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Visa Security Program, in which  ICE special agents are posted at overseas consulates to assist State  Department staff in visa vetting.   Earlier this Congress, Representative Filemon Vela, the lead Democrat  on our Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, introduced two bills  aimed at bolstering international border and counterterrorism  cooperation:   H.R. 2218 would authorize ICE's Border Enforcement Security Task  Force, a program that has been proven to be effective at enhancing  cooperation and information sharing among law enforcement along the  U.S.-Mexico border.   The second bill, H.R. 4578, is targeted at expanding efforts carried  out by CBP's National Targeting Center aimed at disrupting and  dismantling terrorists and other criminal networks.   When presented to the full House, both bills received unanimous  support from Democrats for good reason: They are effective  counterterrorism programs.   However, I am sorry to say, as of today, there is not enough data to  assess whether the same can be said for ICE's Biometric Identification  Transnational Migration Alert Program, or BITMAP, pilot. As such, I  cannot support permanently authorizing it, as set forth under H.R.  6439.   I would expect that some Members of this body are unfamiliar with the  program, as it is largely a classified program and, as such, little  information about BITMAP is in the public domain.  [[Page H7788]]    Since 2011, ICE's BITMAP pilot program has trained and equipped  foreign law enforcement partners on collecting biographic and biometric  data of foreign nationals migrating through partner countries so that  such information can be checked against U.S. intelligence and law  enforcement databases.   The stated goal of the program is to identify known or suspected  terrorists or criminals prior to arrival at our borders. Though in  operation for several years, the volume of data collected only started  to be significant in the last 2 years.   Prior to considering H.R. 6439 in committee, committee members had  repeatedly been presented in a classified setting with anecdotes about  successes that the program has experienced. While we appreciated  hearing positive news about this pilot, anecdotes are not enough to  justify permanently authorizing this program. Anecdotes are no  substitute for data and evidence of efficiency.   In an effort to secure data prior to committee consideration, I  submitted a number of basic questions about the program's efficacy and  operations to ICE.   I received a response prior to the committee's markup that raised  further questions about BITMAP's efficacy as well as core operational  questions, such as:   After checks against databases, what does the U.S. Government do with  the records it collects on migrants who are not found to have terrorist  ties?   What, if any, protections exist to guard against the collection of  highly personal and sensitive information from migrants with no  criminal or terrorist ties who are encountered nowhere near the U.S.- Mexico border and have no intentions of coming anywhere close to it?   What, if any, audit or oversight mechanisms exist to ensure that  foreign partners adhere to requirements of the program and do not use  this sophisticated law enforcement tool to suppress domestic  activities?   Over the recess, ICE officials briefed the committee staff about  BITMAP, but fundamental questions remain.   I hope that there will be a day when I can say without reservation  that, after careful review of BITMAP's operational documents and data,  I fully support making it permanent. Unfortunately, today is not the  day.   In the absence of evidence, I cannot support H.R. 6439, but I am  supportive of the pilot continuing so that ICE can work to aggregate  and assess critical data to make an evidentiary case to Congress for  why the program should be permanently authorized.                                time  1645    I would note that enactment of H.R. 6439 is not necessary for BITMAP  to continue to operate. With or without passage of H.R. 6439, ICE  expects to continue to be able to operate the pilot.   Madam Speaker, before I close, I include in the Record a letter from  the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to this legislation.                                                  September 4, 2018.      Re Vote NO on H.R. 6439, the Biometric Identification           Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP)           Authorization Act of 2018.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, National       Immigration Law Center and the National Immigration Project       of the National Lawyers Guild, we urge you to oppose H.R.       6439, legislation that would permanently authorize the       biometric pilot program known as ``BITMAP'' within the       Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The House is expected       to consider this bill under suspension of the rules on       Tuesday, September 4, 2018. We urge you to oppose H.R. 6439.        H.R. 6439 would permanently authorize BITMAP, a program       which has existed since 2010--but with no privacy or       transparency protections, and with insufficient fact-finding       during committee consideration of the bill. Although BITMAP       would continue without enactment of this legislation, the       House should not permanently authorize the BITMAP program       with limited information, no information on whether DHS takes       any steps to protect privacy, no studies regarding its       efficacy, and no statutory privacy or transparency       protections.        This bill raises significant concerns regarding the sharing       of information across foreign governments related to       suspicion of terrorism, gang violence, and other so-called       national security concerns with very little information as to       how this information is used and retained. In 2010, DHS began       piloting BITMAP to collect and share biometric and       biographical data on ``special interest aliens, violent       criminals, fugitives and confirmed or suspected terrorists.''       According to previous testimony by DHS officials, this also       includes gang members and other persons of interest who may       pose a potential national security concern.        There is no information or proof as to BITMAP's       effectiveness. Despite numerous requests from Congress,       including members of the House Homeland Security Committee,       DHS has failed to provide information since the program's       inception in 2010 that shows its effectiveness or that it is       tailored to meet its needs. Given this, it is premature to       permanently authorize the program, particularly given the       significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.        The legislation fails to require that the program adhere to       privacy protections. This program includes the sharing of       extraordinarily sensitive information regarding individuals       without warrant or analogous legal process. Yet, the       legislation fails to include any privacy standards that DHS       must follow with regards to the program. For example, what       information can be collected, how long can it be stored, when       can it be disseminated to other agencies, and can it be       shared with foreign partners? The omission of these       protections in the bill is particularly striking given that       the agency has not provided any public information regarding       what, if any, privacy protections currently apply to the       execution of BITMAP.        The legislation fails to place limits on how information       collected under BITMAP can be used. There is little to no       information regarding what actions may be triggered as a       result of these database checks nor information regarding       what is considered ``suspicion'' or a ``national security       concern.'' The terms used by officials in discussing this       program such as terrorism, gang members, and national       security concern have historically been used to target       Muslim, Arab, Iranian, Latinx, Middle Eastern, and South       Asian populations. The failure to provide information       regarding policies governing BITMAP raises significant       concerns that the program may result in unjust profiling and       discrimination. The existing legislation fails to include any       language that would prohibit such improper uses. Moreover,       insufficient information has been made public to assess       whether such profiling and discrimination are current       problems with the program.        Under this bill, DHS would have the authority to enter into       agreements with foreign countries to carry out BITMAP       operations without legislative or judicial review. Although       this bill would require DHS to notify Congress before the       execution of BITMAP agreements, the agreements would not be       subject to congressional authorization. This legislation       would significantly undermine Congress' oversight role by       allowing DHS to take measures without sufficient checks or       balances. Additionally, the bill fails to ensure that the       public is made aware of how DHS is exercising its authority.        It is irresponsible to permanently authorize BITMAP without       a full understanding of its effectiveness, policies and       procedures, privacy and civil rights protections, and       oversight mechanisms.        We urge you to oppose H.R. 6439.            Sincerely,      American Civil Liberties Union.      Immigrant Legal Resource Center.      National Immigration Law Center.      National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild.     Madam Speaker, it is our duty as Members  of Congress to ensure that counterterrorism pilot programs are  effective prior to permanently authorizing them. As I mentioned at the  outset, DHS has a number of proven overseas, border, and  counterterrorism programs that have strong congressional bipartisan  support.   However, with all due respect to the chairman, the efficacy of BITMAP  as a counterterrorism program has not been established. As such, a  permanent authorization of H.R. 6439 is premature.   Given the classified nature of this program, some Members are  unfamiliar with it and there are natural limitations as to what we are  able to discuss on the House floor. But I understand that at an  unclassified staff-level briefing during the recess on threats in the  Caribbean, ICE officials stated that BITMAP is working and successful,  but failed to provide data to back up the assertions.   I will concede that ICE has shared some promising anecdotes, and I do  not object to ICE officials touting what they see as a successful  overseas program to Congress. However, when ICE's broad-based  assertions and anecdotes are not backed up with data and metrics, it  falls to Congress to carry out oversight of the program, not blindly  authorize it.   Let's not reward the administration for failing to provide Congress  with necessary data and metrics. Let's come  [[Page H7789]]  together and vote down H.R. 6439. By taking such action, we will be  communicating to ICE our expectations, while in no way preventing the  BITMAP pilot from continuing as it has for the past 7 years.   As I said earlier, I sincerely hope that the positive aspects of  BITMAP being touted by the other side of the aisle today can be backed  up by reliable data and facts. Unfortunately, the little information we  have on BITMAP to date simply does not justify a standalone  authorization.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 6439, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6459, the TSA Opportunities  to Pursue Expanded Networks for Business Act, or TSA OPEN for Business  Act.   Madam Speaker, the Transportation Security Administration must  acquire and deploy effective security technology to keep up with  current threats. To do so, TSA must ensure its acquisition processes  incentivize security manufacturers to develop innovative solutions and  compete for contract awards.   Unfortunately, in practice, TSA's processes are unwieldy and full of  delays and roadblocks that limit interest and competition. Today,  companies looking to do business with TSA for the first time must  invest significant resources and expend years of effort on testing and  piloting before ever receiving a single purchase order.   For small businesses, which generally lack other revenue streams to  underwrite their operations while working through the maze of TSA's  processes, these impediments often prove insurmountable. There is no  way of knowing how many small businesses have had innovative security  solutions, but pursued other opportunities rather than risk getting  tangled up in TSA's acquisition web.   My bill, the TSA OPEN for Business Act, requires TSA to develop a  strategy to diversify the technology stakeholder marketplace that it  relies upon to acquire security technologies. Importantly, the strategy  must address barriers to participation for businesses that have not  previously provided technology to TSA, including small business  innovators.   It also requires TSA to conduct a feasibility assessment of  partnering with a nonprofit organization to provide venture capital to  help businesses commercialize innovative technologies, similar to the  In-Q-Tel program that has been so successful within the intelligence  community.   By pushing TSA to take proactive action to diversify the security  technology marketplace, H.R. 6459 has the potential to increase  competition within the transportation security technology marketplace  to ultimately deliver better security.                                time  1700    Madam Speaker, in fiscal year 2017, TSA awarded over $1.6 billion in  contracts. Within such a large marketplace, there should be plenty of  space for businesses of all sizes with innovative ideas to compete.  H.R. 6459 will push TSA to take steps to diversify the security  technology marketplace to ensure that it is positioned to acquire the  most innovative technology available.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side for their  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6430, the Securing the  Homeland Security Supply Chain Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6430 would authorize the Secretary of Homeland  Security to exclude an information technology and communication vendor  that is deemed to pose significant national security risk from  contracts for equipment and services.   I strongly believe that DHS must have the necessary tools to address  evolving cyber incursions and espionage by nation-states to keep our  country safe. The most significant risk to the supply chain comes from  Chinese and Russian companies.   For years, the intelligence community has warned that information and  communication technology produced by Chinese companies, most notably  ZTE and Huawei, could be used to carry out cyber theft and espionage.   Some companies with ties to the Russian Government also pose national  [[Page H7793]]  security risks. The U.S. Government has particularly highlighted  concerns about Kaspersky Lab. In September 2017, DHS issued a directive  requiring Federal agencies to remove all Kaspersky products from their  networks, given ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian  intelligence.   The risks to the supply chain are all too real and must be mitigated.  That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 6430, a measure that acts upon  the information provided to us by our intelligence community to help  DHS better counter these mounting threats.   H.R. 6430 provides DHS with needed authority to exclude vendors who  are bad actors from the information technology and communications  supply chain. If enacted, H.R. 6430 will allow the Department to be  proactive and effective in addressing these complex threats in the  future.   Importantly, the bill includes robust oversight provisions to ensure  that Congress receives notification and justification of any exercise  of authority under this act. Notably, this measure is based on a  similar authority provided to the Department of Defense in 2011 and  incorporates language provided by the Office of Management and Budget.   H.R. 6430 provides the Secretary of Homeland Security with a much- needed tool to eliminate national security threats to our supply chain.  Enactment of H.R. 6430 will help DHS secure information technology and  telecommunications equipment and services that are so essential to  keeping our Nation secure.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment the gentleman from New York,  who has significant experience in this area, for offering this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 6430, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6443, the Advanced  Cybersecurity Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 would codify the existing Continuous  Diagnostics and Mitigation, or CDM, program within the Department of  Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate, NPPD.   CDM is an important part of our national approach to securing Federal  networks. Through CDM, DHS works with Federal agencies to identify,  purchase, and integrate cybersecurity tools and services to help defend  their networks against cyber attacks.   By taking advantage of bulk pricing, CDM allows agencies to purchase  security services at a discounted rate and, in turn, devote more of  their limited resources to carrying out their missions. Another benefit  of the program is that it enables DHS to track threats to agency  networks, giving the Department a more holistic view of the threat  landscape.   Still, given the enormous challenges associated with protecting such  a massive and diverse set of networks, it is not surprising that DHS  has, at times, struggled.   For instance, in rolling out CDM, DHS officials mapped four phases of  implementation where, in the first phase, agencies would identify all  the assets and devices on their networks.   At the time, DHS projected that the last phase, which is focused on  protecting the data that agencies store, would begin being tackled in  2017. Unfortunately, the CDM deployment schedule has been plagued with  across-the-board delays, starting with the implementation of phase 1,  which took years. As a result of these delays, the data housed on  agency networks--what the bad guys are really after--remains less  secure than might otherwise have been.   H.R. 6443 would address CDM's challenges in a few ways, for example,  by asking DHS to reconsider its phased approach to implementation and  examine opportunities to streamline adoption of CDM technologies.   This bill would also require DHS to develop a comprehensive strategy  that addresses deployment challenges, areas where greater coordination  is needed, and recommendations for continuous improvement.   Finally, H.R. 6443 adds specificity to DHS' responsibilities under  CDM and includes robust reporting requirements to inform congressional  oversight.   Every year, Federal networks get hit by tens of thousands of  attempted intrusions, many of them sophisticated, state-sponsored  attacks. We have seen time and again the cost and damage that can flow  from a high-profile Federal breach. As such, we need CDM to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers  on this bill, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6443 seeks to improve DHS' capacity to carry out  one of its more important homeland security missions: the protection of  Federal agency networks.   Over the past decade, we have seen the number of cyber attacks  against Federal agencies rise by more than 1,000 percent. Last year  alone, the Office of Management and Budget reported that Federal  agencies experienced more than 35,000 cybersecurity incidents. A  challenge of this magnitude cannot be undertaken by each agency on its  own. They need help.   That is where the CDM program comes in. By authorizing CDM in law,  DHS and its agency partners can confidently move forward to bolster  Federal network security. By requiring the Department to revisit its  implementation plans and work to finally resolve its longstanding CDM  challenges, H.R. 6443 puts the program on an even more secure footing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border  Security Review Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5869 would require the Department of Homeland  Security to conduct a threat analysis of the maritime border. The bill  directs the threat analysis to identify terrorist and criminal elements  looking to enter the U.S. through, or exploit vulnerabilities of, our  maritime border. Further, H.R. 5869 directs DHS to identify  improvements to mitigate such threats.   In carrying out this analysis, DHS is directed to look at  vulnerabilities in law and policy that hinder border security and other  criminal efforts along the maritime border. It is important to note  that the bill limits the scope of the legal and policy analysis  provisions to maritime security and, as such, has no relationship to  the Jones Act.   In the current climate where we have a President who repeatedly  threatens to shut down the Federal Government if Congress fails to  provide funding to build a wall along the southwest border that  candidate Trump repeatedly told would be paid for by the Mexican  Government, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that border security  concerns more than the U.S.-Mexico land border.   I commend the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico for reminding us of the  need to secure maritime borders and seaports.   Cargo volume is up. In fiscal year 2017 alone, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection processed $2.39 trillion in imports. This translates  into our ports of entry processing more than 28.5 million in imported  cargo containers.   Seaports are critical infrastructure that drive our economy. As such,  it is critical that DHS stay abreast of the maritime security threat  picture. To that end, I support H.R. 5869, the Maritime Border Security  Review Act, and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in the current climate, it is easy to lose sight of the  fact that border security encompasses land, air, and maritime borders.  Maintaining situational awareness along our maritime borders and in the  transit zone can be a daunting task for the U.S. Coast Guard and  Customs and Border Protection, given the vastness of the maritime  domain. H.R. 5869 will position DHS to better understand what  additional resources are required to protect our maritime ports and  borders.   Given that the measures before us were authored by the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico, I would be remiss if I didn't take this moment to  acknowledge September 20 will mark a year since Hurricane Maria upended  the lives of millions of Americans living in Puerto Rico.                                time  1745    The death and destruction caused by this category 4 storm was  compounded by the Trump administration's flat-footed, weak, and slow  response to the suffering.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a piece published by The New  York Times this past weekend entitled ``Don't Give Trump a Pass on  Puerto Rico.''                  [From the New York Times, Sept. 1, 2018]                   Don't Give Trump a Pass on Puerto Rico      The president thinks the government did a fantastic job last year  handling Hurricane Maria. But the revision of the death toll, to nearly                       3,000 from 64, says different                         (By Mekela Panditharatne)         The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early       hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on       vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and       water poured into the city, the federal government tarried.       Later, Hurricane Katrina's long pall--the more than 1,800       related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal       response--would come to haunt Mr. Bush's presidency,       cratering his approval rating.        President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis       after last year's storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has       largely escaped the presidency-defining censure that dogged       Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week, Puerto Rico's       government increased the island's official death toll,       estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the       hurricane and its effects--up from the tally of just 64 that       had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after       the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among       the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States       in a century.        So why the pass for President Trump?        Mr. Trump's scandal-plagued presidency has benefited from a       deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive       dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under       his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not       the White House's job to coordinate with federal agencies and       that by extension, he does not own his agencies' failures.       This shouldn't stand.        The scope of the administration's negligence is reflected       in a report released by the Federal Emergency Management       Agency in July. FEMA said the agency ``had thousands fewer       workers than it needed'' and that many of those it had       weren't qualified to take on a catastrophe of this scale. The       report also states that the agency took longer than expected       to secure supplies and lost track of much of the aid it       delivered.        An investigation by Politico found that FEMA provided       roughly a third of the meals, half as much water and a small       fraction of tarps to Puerto Rico than it provided to Texas       after Hurricane Harvey in the first nine days after the       storm. Several weeks elapsed before FEMA and the Defense       Department increased their presence on the island, even       though airports and ports had reopened after a few days. The       agencies failed to direct the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham       Lincoln and other ships to Puerto Rico to aid with the       response. Mr. Trump remained largely out of the picture.        No president in recent memory has upended internal       executive branch norms so much. In immigration, military and       other matters, major executive orders have been introduced by       the Trump administration without consulting with his cabinet.       Agency heads have been caught off guard when policies       affecting them are put into motion. The robust interagency       exchange that typically characterizes complex decisions has       atrophied.        All of this makes it easy for Mr. Trump to escape blame for       his agencies' missteps. But this isn't normal. In an unwieldy       bureaucracy, pressure and high-level oversight from the White       House ensure that disaster response does not fall by the       wayside. Where agencies are ill-equipped to handle the on-      the-ground devastation and local authorities cannot fill the       void, presidential leadership assumes greater import.        The Trump administration has additionally taken actions       that may set back Puerto Rico's recovery. The funding request       the White House sent to Congress last November drew       condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats for being       too low. The administration gave Puerto Rico little choice       but to adopt an experimental funding formula to rebuild its       public infrastructure. The formula gives Puerto Rico       flexibility during the rebuilding process but requires the       island to pay for any cost overruns, putting it at risk of       being on the hook for costly receipts down the road. To make       matters worse, last Thursday a federal judge ruled that       Puerto Ricans who have been living in motels and hotels on       the mainland as part of FEMA's temporary housing aid after       Hurricane Maria have to check out on Sept. 14, possibly       rendering many of them homeless.        Going forward, Mr. Trump must ensure that his agencies       focus attention and resources on the resilient, sustainable       rebuilding of the outdated power grid and on restoration of       the water infrastructure and health care system in Puerto       Rico to buttress the island against future disasters. If not,       it's up to us, as fellow Americans, to hold him to task.        The image of Mr. Trump lobbing rolls of paper towels to a       crowd last October in Puerto Rico, arms arched, mimicking a       basketball player, should rank high in the pantheon of       presidential slip-ups. It brings to mind another iconic       image--Mr. Bush surveilling Hurricane Katrina's wreckage in       New Orleans, from Air Force One. Mr. Trump has defied many       dogmas in politics. But the abnormal executive branch       dynamics that he  [[Page H7799]]       has created should not absolve him from responsibility for       the grave humanitarian situation in Puerto Rico.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 4, 2018, on page H7799, the following appeared: has  created should not absolve him from responsibility for the grave  humanitarian situation in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.
