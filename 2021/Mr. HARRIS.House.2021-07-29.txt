 Madam Speaker, today the House majority will likely pass  the faulty Health Appropriations bill, which eliminates the protection  of the Hyde and Weldon amendments. This will happen despite polling  that consistently shows nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose the use  of hard-earned taxpayer dollars for abortion. And even more compelling,  more than 75 percent of Americans oppose the use of their tax dollars  to pay for abortions overseas.   As we all know, the Hyde amendment prevents the use of Federal tax  dollars for abortions. This policy rider has withstood the test of time  and enjoyed bipartisan support for 45 years, including from Senator Joe  Biden.   But just as important to me, as a physician, is the Weldon amendment,  which prevents healthcare providers from being compelled to participate  in a medical procedure to which they hold religious or moral  objections, namely abortion. Removing this protection would result in  gross violations of the Constitutional rights of Americans.   Madam Speaker, the Hyde and Weldon amendments are just two examples  of commonsense measures we have enacted over the years to protect life.  I urge my colleagues in the majority to reconsider dismantling these  important protections of the right to life.                            ____________________
