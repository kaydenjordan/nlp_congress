 Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a  bill that would add the counties in my Congressional District--Fresno,  Kern, Kings, and Tulare--to the Southwest Border Regional Commission.   Modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Southwest  Border Regional Commission, or SBRC, was established to promote  economic growth to help distressed regions that have historically been  left behind attain socioeconomic parity with the rest of the Nation.   The Central Valley is one such region plagued by economic  disparities, yet it is not part of any Federal regional commission.  This must change. That is why I am here.   My district continues to be in deep need of economic development and  Federal investment. Unemployment in the region is consistently higher,  and education attainment consistently lower than any other region in  California.   The need for more Federal investment is critical now more than ever  because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. Adding these counties  and funding the SBRC will jump-start communities and small businesses,  helping America ``Build Back Better'' while generating new economic  opportunities for hardworking people who are waiting for their chance  of achieving the America Dream.
