 Madam Speaker, yesterday was the birthday of Bob  Marley.   Born on February 6, 1944, in Jamaica, he became a reggae pioneer.  From humble beginnings, Marley went on to sell more than 20 million  records and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.   His music has served as an inspiration and mantra for social  movement. Let's hear some of those words now:       How can you be sitting there      Telling me that you care--      That you care?      When every time I look around,      The people suffer in the suffering      In every way, in everywhere.    And:       Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,      None but ourselves can free our minds.      Have no fear for atomic energy,      `Cause none of them can stop the time.      How long shall they kill our prophets      While we stand aside and look?      Some say it's just a part of it,      We've got to fulfill di book.      Won't you help me sing      These songs of freedom?      `Cause all I ever had,      Redemption songs.    We need redemption.   Happy birthday to Bob Marley.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   I was actually going to discuss some of the issues and specifics that  were in the bill, this incredible bill that is so helpful, but I think  the last comments caused me to have to take pause.   First of all, I don't know why we have to single out African  Americans in South Carolina, as if they are in more need than anybody  else for funding or for underfunding when they are more affected by  disasters. But the reason that these things are happening in the  territories is because of the underfunding of this body to the  territories in ways that do not happen in States throughout this  country.    There is no cap on Medicaid in South Carolina. There is no arbitrary  amount of percentage that the Federal Government is paying as opposed  to a local government is paying in South Carolina like there is in  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where Congress arbitrarily said: We  will only pay 55 percent. You pay 45 percent, based on a number that  has nothing to do with your population or its demographics.   There is no cap on highways and us being removed from Federal  formulas that the rest of the States have. So when we have a disaster,  yes, we need more money because we have underfunding and our  infrastructure is a lot more fragile than the rest of this country  because this body hasn't done its job.   The gentleman talks about taxes. Why doesn't the Virgin Islands pay  taxes in the same way? Because almost 100 years ago, when we asked this  government to be treated in the same way as the others, this government  said: You know what, we will let you keep your Federal taxes and then  we won't have to give you the same amounts of money that we give the  rest of the States, when, in fact, at that time, maybe 100 people met  the criteria of income to pay Federal taxes.   So it is a sham and it is an okeydoke what this country did to the  rest of us. And then everyone wants to hold us to the same standards  and make sure that we are not supposed to get money the same way. It is  just ridiculous.   I think this is an incredible bill. I think it is long overdue. This  does not even put us on the same footing as the States in terms of what  should happen, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment. This  amendment would increase the Department of Energy technical assistance  for electrical grid recovery in the U.S. territories by $3 million.   High energy costs have bedeviled the U.S. insular territories for  many years, harming consumers, limiting development, and draining  capital from our islands' economies. The average price of electricity  paid by U.S. Virgin Islands residents in mid-2019 was about three times  higher than the average power price in the mainland United States.   These islands have suffered at least one tropical cyclone, typhoon,  or hurricane in the last 3 years, storms made stronger by warming  oceans.   As a result of unprecedented recent disasters and the impact of  enormous physical damage, the Virgin Islands are currently going  through an energy crisis. Hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged  approximately 80 to 90 percent of the electrical transmission and  distribution systems in the territory. Rolling blackouts persist to  this day.                                time  1045    Successfully incorporating resiliency measures into the electrical  system recovery effort, including by building microgrid systems, and  adding renewable generation capacity to the system does require  significant technical assistance from the Department of Energy.   I am pleased that the House, through this bill, will be taking action  to make appropriations for technical assistance with rebuilding  electric systems in the insular areas. However, given the current state  of the islands, including Puerto Rico, which has had the unique  challenge of natural disasters reoccurring over the past several  months, I am concerned that the amount of $15 million may not be enough  to adequately address the urgent needs for assistance to improve grid  resiliency and to lower the cost of electricity.   That is why I requested this modest uptick of $3 million. It is to  see that utilities in the smaller territories like my district can get  the technical assistance they need to solve energy problems that are  unlike any other in the United States.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment. This is  important to the territories.   As you heard from my colleague from Puerto Rico, islands are very  fragile, and we do not have the scale that others have, nor do we have  grids that can be attached to other areas. So this is really important  to us, and the technical assistance of this Nation, from the Department  of Energy, would go a long way in supporting a more resilient grid.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
