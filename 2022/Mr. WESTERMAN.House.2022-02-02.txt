 Today, I think about when my four children were young.  They are stair-stepped 2 years apart. They used to have competitions in  the backyard. They would race from the patio to the elm tree and back.  And I would stagger the starting time: Let the youngest one go first,  then the next to the youngest, and so on. And by the time they touched  the tree and came back, it turned into a real competition--a photo  finish a lot of times.  [[Page H816]]    Mr. Speaker, we have all competed in games whose outcome has little  significance in life, but we are not facing an insignificant  competition in our future. We are in a race of ideologies. The stakes  are as high as they can be. We are literally in a struggle for the  future of western civilization, of democracy, of representative  government, of human rights, and freedom.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't a matter of competing. It is a must-win  scenario. And quite frankly, I am aghast that this majority thinks that  we only need to compete. Losing is not an option. Our attitude must be  to win. If we lose, humanity loses.                                time  1600    I believe freedom-loving Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and  people all across the world want America to win. I am disappointed that  the Speaker and this majority, once again, dropped a massive bill that  could and should be bipartisan, but instead is a cloak for failed Build  Back Better policies that lie dead in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, ``You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will  preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or  we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of  darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's  children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that  could be done.''   Those familiar words were from Ronald Reagan in the 1960s, but they  have never been more true than today.   How serious are the issues that we face? Take a look at these charts  from the economist. This first one is in 2000. The blue is the U.S. and  its trading partners. The red is China and its trading partners. Look  what has happened in a short 20-year span as we look at this same map  from 2022. We see a massive increase in red on this map and a massive  decrease of blue on this map.   What do provisions in this bill from the blue New Deal have to do  with us winning against China? It does the exact opposite by killing  American jobs. Restoring coral reefs off our coast is a commendable  goal, but what does spending $292 million on coral reef restoration  have to do with us winning against China?   This bill gives supreme, unilateral authority to the Fish and  Wildlife Service to determine what species can be imported into the  U.S. This so-called ``white list'' mandated in the bill is virtually  impossible to implement and will effectively shut down aquaculture and  similar industries who need trade to conduct business.   The weaponization of the Lacey Act will only empower bureaucrats and  ignores the current State-based approach on species imports. It is  legislative laziness since there have been no hearings or an introduced  bill on this topic. What in the world does that have to do with winning  against China?   The bill requires biased studies and new heavy-handed regulations  designed to kill American mineral development.   Mr. Speaker, how can this majority propose this bill while the  Democratic administration continues to illustrate incompetency by  killing American energy and jobs, and even pulling mining leases in  Minnesota that could create jobs and supply resources for the very  policies on electrification the administration supports? This only  shifts wealth and jobs to China. How does that help us win?   It reminds me of my kids' races, where the majority is trying to  handicap America and give China a head start. What we should be doing  to have a winning strategy--we should be working together on real  issues to ensure that America wins. We should be strengthening  diplomacy and trade with our allies and create a solid Western  Hemisphere alliance to ensure that America wins.   We should be developing our resources and jobs to help America win.  We should be part of the solution and not the problem. Americans and  freedom will win if we let them.   As I close, I want to remind you of a fable by Aesop, the Eagle and  the Arrow. The Eagle was struck by an arrow and as he lie on the ground  he looked back at it, and he said: Alas, I have been wounded by an  arrow that was feathered with my own plume.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to put more plumes on China's arrows. I  oppose this bill.
