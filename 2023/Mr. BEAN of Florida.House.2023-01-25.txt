 Madam Speaker, I rise today to wish you and all  Americans a happy Celebrate Literacy Week.   The Florida Department of Education has designated this week as a  week to focus on reading, but you don't have to be from Florida to  celebrate reading. All Americans can work to inspire students and  families to make reading a part of their daily routines and install a  lifelong love of reading.   This year's theme is ``Take a Deep Dive Into Literacy--Splash Into  New Worlds.'' Fitting with the theme, I was honored and proud to read  ``Pirate Pete's Talk Like a Pirate'' to the fourth grade classes at  Yulee Elementary School in northeast Florida.   Yulee Elementary School is an outstanding, rated-A school based on  the Florida School Accountability Reports. This school is led by  Principal Bryce Cubbal and Assistant Principal Tara Libby. These  educators are to be commended for the fantastic things they are doing  for our students.   Madam Speaker, they say reading is fundamental, but I will say that  it is  [[Page H291]]  only fundamental if we encourage reading. I encourage everybody that if  you get a chance to read to a young person, do it. It will be good for  them and for you.                            ____________________
