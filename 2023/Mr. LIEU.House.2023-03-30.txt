 Madam Speaker, extreme MAGA Republican policies on  education resulted in the following: A Florida principal lost his job  because they wanted to teach classical artworks like Michelangelo's  classic, ``David.'' A school in Florida banned ``Ruby Bridges,'' a  Disney movie that talks about desegregation. You have textbooks with  Rosa Parks but not describing her race.   What is going to end up happening is that MAGA students are going to  be so sheltered and unprepared for life. When they start work or go to  a 4-year college or a trade school, they are going to be made fun of.  They are going to be disrespected because they would have been kept  ignorant.   Don't keep your kids ignorant. Teach them classic works of art. Teach  them about civil rights. Teach them about slavery. Teach them about  desegregation.   They are going to learn it anyway when they grow up. Don't shelter  them.                            ____________________
