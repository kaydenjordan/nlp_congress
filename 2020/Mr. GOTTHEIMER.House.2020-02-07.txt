 Madam Speaker, this morning, hardworking families  across northern New Jersey woke up, made breakfast, and wished each  other good-bye before leaving for work or school.   But our thoughts are with one family that was unable to be together  this morning, this Sowore family from Haworth in Bergen County. That is  because Yele Sowore, a husband, father, and neighbor, remains in  Nigeria awaiting the outcome of his pending trial.   For months, members of the New Jersey delegation, including Senator  Menendez and Senator Booker, have been closely following Mr. Sowore's  case and working together with the Haworth community to advocate on  behalf of our neighbor and friend.   We were relieved when, in December, after months of detention, Mr.  Sowore was finally released on bail. But we continue to urge the  Government of Nigeria to follow its own laws and to do the right thing:  providing Yele with the due process rights he deserves.   I want to recognize Yele's family, especially his wife, Ope, who has  dealt with a trying situation with extraordinary courage and  determination.    As Representative of the Fifth Congressional District, I am very  proud to stand beside Yele's many friends and neighbors throughout  north Jersey whose hope is that he will soon be able to be reunited  with his family. We are thinking of him, praying for him, and I will  not stop working until he comes home.                            ____________________
