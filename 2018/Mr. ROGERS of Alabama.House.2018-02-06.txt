 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a  company in the Third Congressional District of  [[Page H898]]  Alabama that has given out $500 bonuses to all their 500 employees as a  direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Russell Lands in Alexander  City is the first company in my congressional district to distribute  bonuses as a direct result of the tax overhaul.   The historic tax reform legislation recently signed into law by  President Trump is helping companies and hardworking families in  Alabama and across America. Thanks to tax reform, U.S. companies are  paying more than $3 billion in bonuses, and over 3 million workers have  received a bonus or a pay increase because of the tax cuts.   I am proud of Ben Russell and his company for leading the way on  this, and I am thrilled that his employees are receiving this extra  money. This bonus is a car payment, a new washing machine, or savings  for school. This bonus represents opportunity, and I don't think you  would ever hear the employees at Russell Lands calling their bonus  ``crumbs.''                            ____________________
