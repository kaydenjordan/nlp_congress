 I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are discussing the budget resolution.  It is an interesting time to do it in the month of January. The fiscal  year, the spending year for the Federal Government, starts October 1.  We have tried, with no success, to pass appropriations bills--12 of  them--that would meet our obligation to fund the government for the  entire fiscal year. We have had two continuing resolutions, which are  temporary spending bills. And here we are again discussing a budget  resolution.   But it isn't really about the budget; it is about the Affordable Care  Act, known as ObamaCare, a law passed 6 years ago with the goal of  providing affordable health insurance for all Americans. I voted for  that bill. It is one of the most important bills I have ever voted for,  and I believe that, despite shortcomings, it has achieved its goal and  it has done it in a way that most American families would agree they  want to see.   As an example, there are very few families in America who have every  member of the family in perfect health. In the old days before the  Affordable Care Act, if you happened to have a child who had survived a  cancer situation, a spouse with diabetes, and you went to buy a health  insurance plan, you ran into a problem: They might not want to insure  your family because of that sick child, or they might want to charge  you a premium way beyond your reach. So in the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare, we said: As a health insurance company, you cannot sell  insurance in America and discriminate against a family or person  because of a preexisting medical condition.   From where I am sitting, my own personal life experience and my  family's experience, thank goodness. We had members of our family with  serious health issues. I worried about that all the time as a husband,  as a father. The Affordable Care Act gave me and every other American  the peace of mind that health insurance companies could not  discriminate against us or our families because of a preexisting  condition.   There was also a practice where they would put a limit on how much  coverage you could buy in a health insurance policy. So many people  thought: I have a great health insurance policy. It has a $100,000  limit. I will never hit that number; I am a healthy person.   The next accident, the next diagnosis, and that healthy person  realized that $100,000 in today's world of health care costs--you could  eat that up in a minute and find yourself without any health insurance  protection. What happens to you next?   You have been diagnosed with cancer. You start treatment. It is  expensive, and now your health insurance policy has reached a point  where it doesn't cover you anymore. What then are your options? Stop  treatment? Exhaust your savings? Throw yourself on the mercy of a  hospital and hope for the best?   We ended that. ObamaCare ended that. They can no longer put limits on  health insurance policies because none of us--not one of us--knows what  kind of health crisis we might face or a member of our family might  face tomorrow. That is important.   A third provision in ObamaCare, which most families would understand  in a hurry, involved what to do with that recent college graduate. What  are you going to do with that daughter whose graduation you are so  proud to go to, and then it dawns on you that she doesn't have a full- time job yet and that the part-time job she has doesn't have any health  insurance benefits.   I remember calling my daughter and saying to her: Jennifer, I know  you had health insurance as a student. What is your situation now?   Oh, Dad, I am fine. I am healthy. I am not worried.   I am worried, as a father, something is going to happen to her and  she will have no health insurance protection.   Do you know what ObamaCare did? ObamaCare said I could keep my  daughter under my family health insurance plan until she reached the  age of 26. Peace of mind for 2, 3, 4 years while that son or daughter  is starting their professional life, their life of employment. For  thousands in Illinois and across the United States, more peace of mind  that health insurance would be there when your family really needed it.   We also said we don't think you ought to discriminate against people  when you sell them health insurance just because, for example, you  happen to be a woman. Yes, the health insurance premiums charged women  were higher than those for men. Obviously, women can have challenges in  their lives but so can men. We said you cannot discriminate in health  insurance premiums under ObamaCare between men and women.   These are issues that affect the real world--what people pay for  insurance, whether they qualify for insurance, and whether insurance  will be there when you need it. That is what ObamaCare did. By  providing helping hands to those in lower and middle-income categories,  we extended the reach of health insurance under ObamaCare to cover 20  to 30 million more Americans. We currently have the highest percentage  of Americans with health insurance in modern history.   We had another provision too. We said: If you happen to be a senior  citizen under Medicare and you are paying for your prescription drugs,  that can be expensive. Under the old law, before ObamaCare, there was a  gap in coverage, and you might spend $1,000 or $2,000 out of your  savings account each year just to keep taking your meds. We closed the  gap so you had continuous coverage under Medicare as a senior.   Important? You bet it is. A lot of seniors ended up retired with  limited savings wanting their meds, their prescriptions, so they can  remain strong and independent as long as possible. Don't we want them  to? So that, in a brief summary, will contain four or five of the main  features of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act--more Americans with the  guarantee of health insurance than any time in our modern history in  the United States of America.   How important is it to have health insurance? If you have ever been  the father of a very sick child and you didn't have health insurance,  it is a life experience you will never forget. I know. I lived through  it. At that time, I thought, if I don't do anything else the rest of my  life, I am always going to have health insurance, and I did. At some  sacrifice to my wife and me, but we made sure we had it because for a  period of time when we had no health insurance, I felt like I had let  my family down and I let my daughter down. I didn't want it to happen  again.   I don't want anybody else to go through that. We want to make sure  health insurance is there for all of us. Some people say: If you are  rich, you ought to get it, but if you are not, tough luck.   I don't think so. I think health care and health insurance protection  should be a basic right in this great Nation of America. That was the  driving force behind passing ObamaCare, passing the Affordable Care  Act.   The Republicans hate the Affordable Care Act like the devil hates  holy water. They despise it. Over 60 times they voted to repeal it in  the House of Representatives. It drives them into a rage. The first  thing they say is, we can't wait to get a new President and abolish  ObamaCare.   The obvious responsible question to them is, And what happens the day  after you abolish it? What happens when it comes to preexisting  conditions? Can health insurance companies now discriminate against  people again? What happens when it comes to the limits on how much a  health insurance policy would pay? Are we going to be back in the day  when there isn't enough coverage when you and your family desperately  need it?   What happens to those kids fresh out of college if they can't get on  your family health insurance plan? Do you want to go out and buy an  individual policy for that son or daughter who is still looking for a  job? How about the seniors? Are they going to go back to the time where  they have to pay out of pocket for their prescription drugs? I think  those are all legitimate questions.   Do you know what the answer is on the Republican side? Trust us. We  are just going to abolish this program, and someday, not today and not  soon, but someday we will come up with another  [[Page S42]]  idea. That is irresponsible. They are replacing affordable care with  chaos. They are saying to the American people: Just trust us. Someday  we will dream up a plan.   You know what, they have had 6 years to come up with a plan, 6 years  to come up with an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. They have  been unable to do it. It is difficult. It is painful.   You know what is ironic, the Affordable Care Act is based on a  Republican model of health insurance. This was what the Republicans  suggested years ago: Use private insurance companies and make it  available to all Americans. That is what we did. A lot of Democrats  felt there was a better way: Why don't we make a Medicare Program for  every American a nonprofit program that is there. We couldn't get it  done. We didn't have the votes, and the Republicans wouldn't help us.   In the first step of the new year and the new Congress, the new  Republican majority in the Senate wants to abolish the Affordable Care  Act, wants to put millions of American families at the mercy of health  insurance companies. They must think we are suffering from amnesia and  that we had forgotten what that was all about--sitting on the phone for  hour after weary hour with some adjuster who may or may not be in the  United States, trying to argue about whether your son or daughter can  go into a hospital, whether your wife can receive the medical treatment  the doctor asked about.   That is what it used to be, and that is what it is going to go back  to when we abolish the Affordable Care Act and don't replace it with  something that is as good or better. That is the first step in the  Republican program, make 20 to 30 million Americans more vulnerable  when it comes to their health care. That is not the end of it.   I live in a State that has the great city of Chicago, Cook County  regional area, but downstate we are very rural, smalltown America. I  know from my congressional experience and from my life as a Senator  representing that State, there are downstate hospitals that cannot  survive without the Affordable Care Act. In my State, some of those  hospitals are the major employers in their communities and the only go- to place for someone seriously ill or injured.   The Republicans have yet to suggest any suggestion at all about how  we are going to keep those hospitals open. They are starting to contact  me now--the hospitals as well as the clinics and the health care  providers, and they are asking: The Republicans really aren't going to  do this, are they? They are not just going to abolish it and leave us  with this chaos to follow.   Sad to say, that is exactly what they are going to do. Senator Rand  Paul of Kentucky wrote an article today and said he thought it was  wrong on the Republican side to do that. He said: The responsible thing  to do is to have an alternative before you abolish the Affordable Care  Act. Good for him. That is common sense. You would expect it from a  party that says it is conservative in its approach to government. What  they are suggesting with the Affordable Care Act is not conservative.  It is destructive. It is catastrophic. It is irresponsible.   I hope my colleagues will join me. We need two or three Republicans  to join us to stop this effort. Let us sit down together, Democrats and  Republicans, take the Affordable Care Act and make it more effective,  fix the problems that are part of it--and there are some--make sure we  keep our promise to the American people that they will have access to  affordable, quality health care. Keep these providers covered by the  Affordable Care Act in business in rural areas and inner cities and all  across our Nation. That is our responsibility.                                     DACA    Mr. President, 16 days from now, and just a few steps from where the  Senate Chamber is located, we will have an inauguration for the 45th  President of the United States, Donald Trump. On that day, the fate of  more than 750,000 young people in America will be hanging in the  balance. They will be waiting to learn whether they have a place in our  Nation's future or whether they will be asked to leave.   It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by  Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana. On a bipartisan basis, we  asked the President to stop the deportation of young immigrants who  grew up in this country. We called them DREAMers, after a bill I  introduced 15 years ago. Who are they? Babies, infants, toddlers,  children, young adults under the age of 16 brought to America by their  parents from another country, and the proper papers were not filed. You  can't hold the kids responsible. They didn't decide to come here. You  certainly can't hold them responsible for not filing the papers. They  were just children at the time.   If anybody should be held responsible, it is the parents. What do we  do about the kids who have lived their entire lives in the United  States believing this was their country, this was their future, and now  come to realize in their teenage years they are undocumented and their  future is uncertain?   We asked President Obama: Will you give these young people a  temporary opportunity to stay, study, and work in America, and he  agreed to do it. It was called DACA. It was the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals Program. What it said was, if you are in that  category of a child brought to America and you are undocumented, step  forward, pay a filing fee of almost $500 so the government can process  your application, submit yourself to a criminal background check,  including fingerprints, and let us look into your background and see if  there is anything you have done that would disqualify you from staying  in the United States. If you are approved, for 2 years--renewable--you  will not be deported and you can work in America.   Many young people in that circumstance were reluctant to step  forward. Their parents had warned them their entire lives that if they  turned themselves into the government, they might be deported--in fact,  their family might be deported with them. They said: The President has  offered us this opportunity for a chance. We are going to follow this,  do the right thing, make an application. Almost 800,000 of them  qualified. They are DACA recipients. Others will be eligible in the  months ahead. DACA has been a success.   What will President Donald Trump do with these DACA students? He made  some pretty harsh statements during the course of the campaign about  immigration. I think he is reflecting on these kids as a special  category. This is what President-Elect Donald Trump said to TIME  magazine just a few weeks ago about the DREAMers, the DACA recipients.         We're going to work something out that's going to make       people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young       age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some       were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in       never-never land because they don't know what's going to       happen.    I appreciate Mr. Trump's comments, soon-to-be President Trump. I hope  he will keep the DACA Program in place, but I am working with my  colleagues on a bipartisan basis to give him an option. Senator Lindsey  Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and I have joined the lead  sponsors on what we call the BRIDGE Act. The BRIDGE Act is an  opportunity to protect these young people legally, on a temporary  basis, while Congress rolls up its sleeves and takes up immigration.   I am happy to have Senator Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, Republicans  from Alaska and Arizona as cosponsors, as well as Dianne Feinstein of  California and Chuck Schumer of New York, and I hope others will  follow. I believe DACA was a lawful exercise of the President's  authority. Some disagree with that completely. Regardless of whether  you agree or disagree, I hope you will agree that these young people  should be allowed to have a bridge so they aren't deported, they don't  lose their right to work or go to school.   Incidentally, when these young DACA DREAMers go to school, they have  to pay for it right out of their pockets. They don't qualify for any  Federal assistance. It is a special effort and a special sacrifice. I  have come to the floor over 100 times over the last 10 or so years to  tell the stories of these young people. I think the stories tell a lot  more than any speech I could give.    This young man is Luis Gonzalez. Forgive me for being especially  drawn to this photo because Luis is standing in front of my college,  Georgetown  [[Page S43]]  University, wearing one of the Georgetown Hoyas shirts.   Let me tell you about Luis. He was 8 years old when his family came  to the United States from Mexico. He had a difficult childhood in Santa  Ana, California. His parents separated. He lived with his mom in a car  garage for several years. After his mom remarried, he lived with his  stepfather, who turned out to be abusive.   Luis overcame these circumstances and still was a good student. He  graduated high school in the top 1 percent of his class with a 4.69  GPA, and he passed all nine advanced placement exams that he took. He  was involved in extracurricular and volunteer activities. He was the  secretary of the school's National Honor Society, and he helped  organize an anti-bullying campaign in his local elementary school. He  was a mentor to incoming freshmen in high school. Saturdays, instead of  taking it easy, he volunteered to tutor other kids in math, and he  volunteered to help a teacher at a local school. He was active in his  church every Sunday, translated the pastor's sermon into English for  those who didn't speak Spanish, and cleaned up the church before and  after the Sunday services.   Because of his outstanding record in high school, Luis was admitted  to Georgetown University. He is currently a sophomore majoring in  American studies and minoring in government. He continues to use his  spare time to help others. He is a member of the provost committee for  diversity and co-chair of Hoya Saxa Weekend, a program that brings  students from underrepresented communities to Georgetown. Luis is a  leader of Strive for College, a program that mentors students in the  inner city high schools. His dream is to be a high school teacher,  which isn't surprising given the strong commitment he has already  shown.   He wrote me a letter and here's what he said:         DACA gave me the confidence and security I've not had       before. I lived in fear and the shadows. Thanks to DACA,       however, I've been able to do things I otherwise wouldn't be       able to do like travel through an airport or working on       campus. I've always felt that I am an American, but having       DACA allowed me to stop living in constant fear and       uncertainty. Now these fears have come back again.    If DACA is eliminated, Luis could be forced back into the shadows.  The day after DACA, Luis will not be able to travel or work on a  campus. He will lose his legal status, and he could be deported back to  Mexico, a country that he hasn't lived in since he was 8 years old.   Luis and other DREAMers have a lot to give America. Would we be  stronger if we deport him, take this man's talent, drive, and energy  and banish him from this country? I don't think so.   I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and will continue  the DACA program. If he decides to end DACA, then I hope this  administration will work with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act into law  for Luis and for thousands of others who will be counting on it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
