 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and it is such an honor to  recognize the official renaming of the United States Post Office  located at 201 Tom Hall Street in Fort Mill, South Carolina, as the J.  Elliott Williams Post Office Building.   James Elliott Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and  lived an extraordinary life. Mr. Williams was in the United States Navy  for 20 years and served in and during the Cold War, the Korean war, the  Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam war.   One example of his heroic actions occurred during the Vietnam war  where he and his men fought off enemy combatants behind enemy lines for  3 hours in south Vietnam. Under Petty Officer Williams' leadership, the  American Naval force killed roughly 1,000 Vietcong guerillas, destroyed  over 60 vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistics operation.   James E. Williams retired on April 26, 1967, as the most highly  decorated enlisted sailor in the history of the United States Navy. He  was the recipient of multiple awards during his service in the Navy;  including, the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star Medal, the  Purple Heart, the Korean Service Medal, and the United Nations Service  Medal. Additionally, during his last 7 months in the Navy, he received  every sea service award for heroism.   On May 14, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, in the name of  Congress, presented James Elliott Williams the Medal of Honor. In the  20th century, three sailors of American Indian heritage received the  medal. Petty Officer Williams was one of the three.   Mr. Speaker, it was my great privilege to put forward this  legislation with the entire South Carolina delegation and have it  signed into law to honor the life, service, and sacrifice of James  Elliott Williams.                            ____________________
