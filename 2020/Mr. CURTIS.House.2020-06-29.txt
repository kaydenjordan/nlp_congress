 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1425.  Right now, we must deliver the most effective treatments to patients  infected with COVID-19 and all those suffering from other life- threatening illnesses. Breaking down barriers to receiving timely care  must remain our number one priority in order to halt transmission of  the virus.   H.R. 1425 does the opposite by dramatically expanding the role of  government through unconstitutional inventions in our pharmaceutical  industry and broader healthcare system. This would put our brightest  scientific minds in handcuffs and threaten their ability to develop  future cures for COVID-19 and other life-threatening diseases.   These are especially concerning decisions to make without bipartisan  input. We have to work together in order to deliver solutions that give  Americans more control over how they are receiving their health care.  Solutions could include expanding access to health savings accounts or  association health plans to be sold across state lines and with more  portability. I recently introduced legislation to increase access to  both options and I encourage my Democratic colleagues to join me as I  look for creative solutions to make health care more affordable for  millions of hard-working Americans.   Finally, I want to point out that Congress has already taken  unprecedented steps to increase access to care for the uninsured and  any American household dealing with the effects of COVID-19. It is  critical that our focus remains defeating this virus, keeping Americans  healthy, and allowing hard-working men and women across our great  nation to return to work. We cannot place greater strains on our  already over-worked health care system through one-size-fits-all policy  making.
