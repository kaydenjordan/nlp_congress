 Mr. President, first let me, before I begin, thank  Senators Carper and Capito for managing this bill and doing it in such  a fine way--and their staffs as well.   Now, Mr. President, it has been a long and winding road, but we have  persisted, and now we have arrived. There were many logs in our path,  detours along the way, but the American people will now see the most  robust injection of funds into infrastructure in decades.   In a few moments, the Senate will pass the bipartisan infrastructure  bill, dedicating over a trillion dollars to strengthen every major  category of our country's physical infrastructure. It has been a long  time in coming. Our economy is No. 1 in the world, but infrastructure  ranks No. 13. You will find better roads, bridges, airports, and  broadband in the United Arab Emirates than in the United States of  America.   Today, the Senate takes a decades-overdue step to revitalize  America's infrastructure and give our workers, our businesses, and our  economy the tools  [[Page S6203]]  to succeed in the 21st century. The bill will make large and  significant differences in both productivity and job creation in  America for decades to come.   To my colleagues, particularly the group of 10, then 11, then 22 who  worked so hard in a bipartisan way, congratulations. Congratulations on  a job well done. Thank you to our committee chairs and ranking members  whose expertise was required at several stages. And to the staff who  sacrificed weekends, family gatherings, and most often sleep in order  to finish this bill, thank you.   Thank you to President Biden and his team at the White House.  President Biden has been in office for only 7 months, and already the  Senate is about to pass the first major infrastructure package in over  a decade, on a bipartisan basis, with his complete and total  involvement.   Throughout the process, I have tried to prod the negotiators along  when they have needed it and given them space when they have asked for  it. At times, it took a deadline to kick negotiations into high gear;  other times it required a few extra days to allow compromise to gel.  But when the Senate is run with an open hand rather than a closed fist,  Senators can accomplish big things.   So despite this long road we have taken, we have finally, finally  reached the finish line.   Of course, we Democrats believe we need to do much more. The  bipartisan infrastructure bill is a very significant bill, but our  country has other very significant, very important challenges. Working  families need help. Small businesses need a leg up. Climate change  threatens the future of our planet. Our Tax Code needs to be  straightened out. Other parts of our infrastructure not addressed in  this bipartisan bill still need focus, attention, and help.   So to my colleagues who are concerned that this does not do enough on  climate, for families, and making corporations and the rich pay their  fair share, we are moving on to a second track, which will make  generational transformation in these areas.   Once this bill is complete, the Senate will immediately turn to the  second track in our two-track strategy, passing a budget resolution  that will unlock historic investments in American jobs, American  families, and the fight against climate change. The two-track strategy  is proceeding full steam ahead.   At its core, the Democratic budget--both parts--is about restoring  the middle class in the 21st century and giving more Americans the  opportunity to get there. Too many in the middle class are worried  about their future. The sunny American optimism has turned into a  sourness, an anger, a divisiveness in the land.   Bold, transformative action on both traditional infrastructure and on  helping families--middle-class families--cope and on climate will  restore that bright, sunny optimism that has been part of this American  psyche for centuries.   At its core, what we want to do is this: We want to cut taxes for  families.   We want to create millions of jobs while tackling the climate crisis,  and we want to pay for it by making corporations and the wealthy  finally pay their fair share.   After we pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill this morning,  Senators should expect to vote to proceed to the budget resolution, and  we will begin the process for debating amendments shortly thereafter.   Democrats are prepared to move quickly and decisively through the  amendment process so we can finish what we set out to do before the end  of the work period. The longer it takes to finish, the longer the  Senate will be in session.   At the start of July, I set two ambitious goals for this Chamber  before our August recess. One was to pass a bipartisan infrastructure  bill to boost our economy, something the Senate has not achieved in  many years, and this is a strong and bold accomplishment. The second  was to pass a budget resolution with the kinds of transformative  changes I have mentioned. Pundits called it wishful thinking in a  Chamber known for unhurried deliberation.   Well, we are moments away from achieving the first goal, and I am  confident that very soon the Senate will take the first major step  toward achieving our second goal. The Senate is on track to finish both  tracks and deliver an outstanding result for the American people.                              Vote on H.R. 3684     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, once again, congratulations to all of  those who worked so hard on this very significant and very important  bill, and now we proceed to the second track.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 122,  S. Con. Res. 14, the concurrent resolution on the budget.         Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 122, S. Con. Res. 14, a       concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget       for the United States Government for fiscal year 2022 and       setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal       years 2023 through 2031.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   (Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.)    Now, Mr. President, we have come to an agreement here. I  am going to read it in a minute, and I just want to say that we are  going to try to have everyone sit in their seat. There are 1, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 amendments. If we all sit in our seats and try to  stick to the 10 minutes or as close as we can get to it, we can finish  in 10 minutes. We can get this done quickly. If we all finish voting by  5, he can bang the gavel and get us to do it quicker than 10. OK?   (Applause.)    Thank you. That is the most Republican applause I have  gotten in a little while. OK.   I ask unanimous consent that following the Kennedy amendment, the  following amendments be the only amendments remaining in order; that  the amendments be reported by number and the Senate vote in relation to  the amendments in the order listed: Lee, 3141--Lee, the clerk; Inhofe,  3331; Daines, 3292; Hagerty, 3742; Hyde-Smith, 3568; Grassley, 3650;  Sullivan, 3626; Cruz, 3681; Lee, 3815; Kennedy, 3753; further, that on  the disposition of the Kennedy amendment, the last Kennedy amendment,  the Senate vote on the adoption of S. Con. Res. 14, as amended, with no  further intervening action or debate.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Thank you, my colleagues. Let's cooperate and finish this up.  [[Page S6231]]     Question.    Madam President, for my colleagues, the clerk is no  longer going to recount, to save us a little time. I just urge my  colleagues to please stay in your seats so we can move this along. Oh,  and speak up when you are called. Is that what you mean? I have no  trouble speaking loudly, as everyone knows here.    Madam President, we are about to vote on the budget  resolution.   I remind my colleagues that we will have a vote very shortly  thereafter on voting rights.   I thank the Presiding Officer.                     Vote on S. Con. Res. 14, as Amended     Madam President, now, Senate Democrats have just taken a  massive step toward restoring the middle class in the 21st century,  giving more Americans the chance to get there.   Teddy Roosevelt said:         Nothing in [the] world is . . . worth doing unless it means       effort, pain, [and] difficulty.    What we are doing here is not easy. Democrats have labored for months  to reach this point, and there are many labors to come, but I can say  with absolute certainty that it will be worth doing.   The Democratic budget will bring a generational transformation to how  our economy works for average Americans. It will cut taxes for American  families; it will lower costs for everyone; it will create good-paying  jobs while tackling climate change; and it will be paid for by making  our Tax Code more progressive and more fair: asking corporations and  the wealthy to pay their fair share; it will help middle-class  Americans stay in the middle class; and it will build ladders into the  middle class.   It will restore the basic social contract in America: If you work  hard, you can do better and pass on even greater opportunities for your  children.   And, in doing so, my friends, it will restore something in the  American character that we have nearly lost: that hopeful optimism;  that can-do attitude; that frontier spirit--eyes fixed on the horizons;  the kindness and decency and faith in the future that is fundamental  not only to the American spirit but to American democracy. I can think  of no more worthy pursuit.                            ____________________     Now, even at this late hour, and before the conclusion  of the session, this Chamber is going to take one more step in the  fight to protect voting rights in this country.   In a moment, I will move to discharge the Rules Committee from  further consideration of the For the People Act, a vehicle for the  Senate to have a debate on voting rights.   It is my intention that the first amendment to the bill would be the  text of a compromise bill that a group of Senators are working on.   Let me be very clear. This is a debate the Senate must have. In  America today, we are witnessing the most sweeping and coordinated  attacks on voting rights since the era of Jim Crow.   Reactionary Republican legislatures are making it harder for poorer,  younger, and non-White Americans to vote, while at the same time making  it easier for partisan actors to steal an election.   Senate Democrats are not going to stand by while this happens. We are  going to fight to protect the sacred right to vote.   Now, before I make my motion, I yield to my colleague and friend from  West Virginia.    Madam President, I thank my friend for his dedication to  finding a way forward on this critical issue.   And now, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Rules Committee being tied on  the question of reporting, I move to discharge the Rules Committee from  further consideration of S. 1, For the People Act of 2021.   And for the information of the Senate, it is my intention the first  amendment to the bill would be the text of a compromise bill that a  group of Senators are working on    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to yield all  remaining time on both sides.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2093, the For the  People Act of 2021.    The Republican minority has just prevented the Senate  from even having a debate--a debate; just that--on voting rights in  this country.   I understand my Republican colleagues don't approve of every aspect  of the Democratic bill to protect voting rights, but surely there are  areas where our two parties can find some agreement. Partisan  gerrymandering, for instance, has plagued our country for too long. It  skews our democracy towards the extremes. It strips the American people  of their right to have a truly representative government.   Voters ought to pick their politicians, not the other way around. But  in so many States, partisan legislators draw maps that artificially  maximize the number of seats that the majority party will win. Some  districts are so safe that the most extreme candidates can run and win  with hardly any competition.   Surely my Republican colleagues would agree that partisan  gerrymandering deserves a debate on the Senate floor. It is a small  part of S. 1 but one that has broad universal support--and the support,  by the way, of all 49 of my Democratic colleagues.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2670, Calendar No. 119, the Redistricting Reform  Act of 2021.    Mr. President.    So the American people should understand, Republicans  just blocked the Senate from even debating legislation to end partisan  gerrymandering and make our Congress more representative of the people.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2671    Mr. President, surely our Republican colleagues, however, would agree  that billions of dollars in anonymous campaign donations every year is  not a function of a healthy democracy. Surely they must agree that  America's representatives should have only one boss--the people, not  the special interests.   So I am going to ask the Senate now to debate a simple measure to  bring a much needed transparency to campaign donations--just  transparency, not even limits, although I would certainly support  those. At the very least, the American people deserve to know who is  trying to influence their representatives and how strenuously.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2671, Calendar No. 120, the DISCLOSE Act of 2021,  which has the support of our entire caucus.    Mr. President, I object to the Senator from Texas's  legislation. It is obvious to just about every American that it would  make a bad situation even worse. So I object.    Mr. President, in conclusion, before I turn it over to  some of my colleagues, Democrats have tried to do something very  simple. We asked the Senate to start debate--just debate--on  legislation to protect voting rights and strengthen our democracy.  Republicans said no. Democrats have asked to debate a measure just to  prevent partisan gerrymandering, and, then, frankly, in my colleague's  response, he was all over the lot: It is good to have politicians do  it; it is not good to have politicians do it. It is good to have judges  do it; it is not good to have judges do it.   We would set standards to make sure that in a State like Wisconsin,  where 53 percent of the people voted for a Democratic member of the  State assembly, only a third of the districts were Democratic, drawn by  a Republican legislature.   So Republicans have said no. They don't even want to debate these  issues.   Democrats have asked to debate the measure to bring much needed  transparency to campaign donations and get special interest dark money  out of politics. Republicans still said no.   So let there be no mistake about what is going on here. We have  reached a point in this Chamber where Republicans appear to oppose any  measure--any measure--no matter how common sense, to protect voting  rights and strengthen our democracy.   Let there be no mistake. Both inside this Chamber and outside of it,  Republicans have formed a wall--a total wall--of opposition against  progress on voting rights in the U.S. Senate. Even on an issue as  sacred as the right to vote, Senate Republicans refuse to allow even a  debate. They are afraid to debate.   Yesterday morning, we saw what it looks like when the Senate comes  together. This is what it looks like when it doesn't. Apparently, there  are very serious and important limits to bipartisanship. There are some  issues where Republicans refuse to join us, in good faith, to make  progress for our country.   I never thought I would see the day when voting rights, which used to  be supported in a bipartisan way as recently as 2006, would be one of  those issues. But that is what we have come to--total Republican  intransigence when it comes to simple measures to make our democracy  more perfect and strengthen the hand of the individual voter.   Now, let me be clear. Republicans refusing to support anything on  voting rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing. In recent  weeks, I met with a number of Democratic Senators: Senators Klobuchar  and Merkley, Manchin and Warnock and Padilla, Kaine, King, and Tester  to discuss a compromise voting rights bill. We have made a great deal  of progress on that legislation. We had a very good meeting as late  recently as yesterday afternoon, and we intend to rally around it.   So, tonight, I am filing cloture on a vehicle to allow the Senate to  take up the compromise voting rights bill. Voting rights--voting  rights--will be the first matter of legislative business when the  Senate returns to session in September. Our democracy demands no less.   I yield the floor. I yield to my colleague from Oregon and then my  colleague from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, I must do a couple of procedural things.   But do my colleagues from Georgia and California want to speak on  voting rights?   No. Thank you. I am sure the Senators from New Jersey and Connecticut  are very grateful as well.   I will be brief.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 64.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 252.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 260.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 251.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 77, S.  2093.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, August 11, be waived.    Thank you.   I yield the floor.
