 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4500, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2019.   Make no mistake; the United States is in a race to modernize and  build out the next generation of wireless infrastructure. As with  countless other industries, we have seen how American leadership can  benefit not only Americans, but consumers around the globe.   This bill, sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Walberg of  Michigan, would ensure Federal and private coordination and cooperation  when it comes to American participation in standards-setting bodies.                                time  1630    We all know by now the potential concerns associated with technology  that we can't fully trust. By ensuring that we have representation on  essential standards-making bodies, such as the International  Organization for Standardization, we will have a seat at the table to  help guide these policies in a helpful and secure direction.   As many of my colleagues in this body would agree, a forward-leaning  effort in this space will have positive effects long down the line.  [[Page H49]]    I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their  work on this, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Cindy Kelley and the Chatham Savannah Authority for the Homeless for  their work in the Tiny House Project for Homeless Veterans.   In November 2019, phase one of the Tiny House Project was officially  completed. In this part of the project, Chatham Savannah Authority for  the Homeless provided 23 veterans, two spouses, and five pets with  places to live. Phase two of the project began on December 1 and will  house an additional 24 veterans.   Unfortunately, veteran homelessness is one of the most persistent  issues facing those who risked their lives to serve our country.   I could not be more proud than to have a project like this one in the  First Congressional District of Georgia with such an innovative  solution to ensure our veterans are taken care of when they return  home.   Along with Ms. Kelley and the Chatham Savannah Authority for the  Homeless, I would like to thank the other members of our community that  were integral in this project, including the Home Depot Foundation,  Chatham Foundation, Nine Line Foundation, Dustcom Limited, Hansen  Architects, Thomas & Hutton, Better Life Properties, Joe Marchese  Construction, Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church, Sydney  Rangeley, Tom Taylor, and Henry and Suzanne Croci.                            ____________________
