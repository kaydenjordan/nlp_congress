 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Mr. Ralph Ahn, a pioneer in the Korean-American community, who  exemplified the American Dream.   Ralph was the youngest child of Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, and Ralph joined  the United States Navy and bravely served our country fighting in World  War II.   Ralph eventually started acting, following in the footsteps of his  older brother, Philip Ahn, who was one of the first Asian-American  actors.   Ralph made his film debut as a Korean prisoner in ``Battle Circus''  before taking on the roles in ``Mission Over Korea,'' ``Prisoner of  War,'' ``The Hook,'' ``It Takes Two,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' and most  recently as Tran on ``New Girl.''   I remember last seeing Ralph at an event about a year ago  commemorating the Korean-American Pioneers and Korean independence.   While I am sad that the last generation of Korean-American leaders  have passed, I know that their legacy will continue to live on. I offer  my deepest condolences to his beautiful wife, Anne, and his family.                            ____________________
