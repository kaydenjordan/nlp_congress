 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the importance of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   For more than 40 years, in a bipartisan fashion, Congress has passed  the Hyde amendment, a provision ensuring Americans are not forced to  pay for abortion on demand with their tax dollars.   This year, the Hyde amendment is under attack. I believe in the  sanctity of life, which is why I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R.  18.   H.R. 18 would make the Hyde amendment permanent and governmentwide,  providing additional protection to the unborn.   It was written in our Declaration of Independence that we all have a  right to life. As a Member of Congress, I intend to uphold this.   Madam Speaker, in that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.
