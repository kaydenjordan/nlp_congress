 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  allowing me to speak on this bill.   I rise in support of H. Res. 1156. I thank my colleague from  Massachusetts, whose bipartisan efforts more than 20 years ago led to  the creation of the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for  Education and Child Nutrition Program.   Since then, this program has enjoyed bipartisan support. The United  States continues to produce the highest quality, safest, most abundant,  and most economical food and fiber anywhere in the world.  [[Page H9721]]    Drawing on this abundance, we are able to provide school meals,  teacher training, and nutrition programs for pregnant and nursing  women. Whether at home or abroad, we know that by reducing hunger and  improving nutrition, we help support better educational outcomes.   This program is a win-win for America, supporting America's farmers  and producers by providing donated U.S. agricultural commodities and  using them to help reduce child hunger, improve education, and support  greater security in the world. I believe this program has been and will  continue to be an essential tool for diplomacy.   As chair of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food  and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, it has been my honor to  fund this program each year. It is true to the spirit of service and  compassion that Ambassador and former Senator George McGovern and  former Senator Bob Dole embodied. This program helps bring the bounty  of America's farmers, ranchers, millers, producers, shippers, and  commodity groups to assist vulnerable children and mothers around the  world.   So, in celebrating the first 20 years of its success, I look forward  to the program's enduring impact in the years ahead.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  urge its passage.
