 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gary Peterson, a  dedicated leader hailing from the Tri-Cities, who tragically lost his  battle with cancer this past month.   It saddens me that rather than announcing his next greatest  achievement, I am instead here to mourn his passing.   Gary was known throughout central Washington, the United States  Capitol, and the Department of Energy as a fierce advocate for the  interests of the Tri-Cities.   His leadership in our communities proved fruitful for decades,  sparking both economic development and innovation for the citizens of  central Washington.   His advocacy for the Hanford cleanup mission has been the cornerstone  of the success of our region, and I am in awe of the impact he has made  over the years.   His immense knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of our community's  priorities was matched by so few, and I have no doubt his name will go  down in history with the names of people like Sam Volpentest and Bob  Ferguson.   Gary's legacy includes leading advocacy for the Pacific Northwest  National Laboratory's campus, supporting the advancements of the  Hanford cleanup mission, and advocating for the growing local economy  at TRIDEC.   He will be known as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and  personal friend. He will be missed, but his legacy will continue to  live on.                            ____________________
