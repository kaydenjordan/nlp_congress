 Madam Speaker, right here in our Nation's Capital, crime  continues to soar at an alarming rate. Yet, the D.C. Council is  determined to advance a severely misguided bill to reduce penalties for  violent criminal offenses.   In fact, some of the very crimes that the D.C. Council included in  their radical legislation are on the rise. For example, last year,  robberies were up, vehicle theft increased by 8 percent, and  carjackings skyrocketed by 14 percent. Yet, the D.C. Council is  fighting to reduce--yes, reduce--penalties for these offenses. You just  can't make this stuff up.   Now, to her credit, D.C. Mayor Bowser opposes this dangerous effort,  correctly claiming: ``This bill does not make us safer.''   For once, I agree with Mayor Bowser because combating crime and  protecting citizens is not a conservative issue, it is a commonsense  issue; it is an American issue.   In the face of D.C.'s failed leadership, Congress must take immediate  action to prevent this disastrous bill from emboldening criminals and  threatening the safety of residents and visitors.    In the coming weeks, I will introduce a joint resolution of  disapproval to stop this insanity in its tracks. I look forward to  leading this fight, and I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and  Democrat, to join me so we can ensure that no American faces fear and  violence in our Nation's Capital.               Defense of Americans' Second Amendment Freedoms     Madam Speaker, I rise today in the defense of Americans'  Second Amendment freedoms.   The Biden administration is moving forward with yet another gun- grabbing tactic in order to register and ban millions of firearms,  moving one step closer to the left's ultimate goal of disarming our  Nation and dismantling our Second Amendment freedoms.   Earlier this month, the ATF finalized an unconstitutional rule  pertaining to firearms with stabilizing braces. Under the ATF's new  rule, any pistol-braced firearm would be considered an illegal short- barreled rifle, making these guns subject to the draconian regulations  under the National Firearms Act of 1934.   Let me be clear: Unelected, anti-gun bureaucrats at the ATF do not  have the authority to make laws. That authority rests right here in  Congress.   Congress cannot continue turning a blind eye to the Biden  administration's weaponization of the National Firearms Act and ongoing  assault on Americans' Second Amendment freedoms. The time to act is  now, and I am proud to lead this fight.   Next week, I will re-introduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles  Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National  Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning  pistols with stabilizing braces.   Additionally, as soon as the ATF's unlawful rule is published to the  Federal Register, I will introduce a Resolution of Disapproval under  the Congressional Review Act to override the Biden administration's  unlawful overreach.   I have always done my utmost in the defense of our constitutional  right to keep and bear arms. It is now time, now that the House is  under the Republican majority, to go on offense.   Madam Speaker, I want gun owners to hear me loud and clear: We are  fighting for you and your Second Amendment freedoms, and we will never  give up.                      Lawlessness at the Southern Border     Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the lawlessness  happening at our southern border.   To no one's surprise, President Biden attempted to conceal the  ongoing chaos, chaos created by his disastrous policies at the southern  border, by releasing the latest CBP report on a Friday night news dump.  But these tactics can't hide the truth.   Last month, over a quarter of a million, over 251,000 illegal aliens  were apprehended at the southern border, making December the highest  monthly total on record.   More than a quarter of a million in a single month. If that doesn't  pressure  [[Page H341]]  the Biden administration to fix this crisis, what will?   In a dangerous addition, 17 suspected terrorists were caught  illegally crossing the border in December, bringing the total number of  individuals to 38 who were on the terrorist watch list and caught at  the southern border, in just the first 3 months of fiscal year 2023.   How many suspected terrorists have to cross the southern border  before the Biden administration will take this border crisis seriously?   To make matters worse, CBP has already seized over 9,000 pounds of  fentanyl so far this fiscal year, which is enough to kill more than 2  billion people, over 6 times the population of the United States.   When will the Biden administration finally put an end to the wide- open southern border that allows this deadly drug from China to  devastate our communities?   While the White House willfully destroys our southern border and  subsequently demolishes our national security, House Republicans are  determined to secure the border and put Americans first.   Part of that commitment is ensuring that every solitary individual  responsible for this self-inflicted crisis will be held accountable,  starting with Secretary Mayorkas, whose impeachment is long overdue.   Without accountability, Americans will not have the safe and secure  Nation they deserve.                            ____________________     I have an amendment at the desk, No. 91.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 21,  the Strategic Production Response Act.   If enacted, my amendment would help hold the Biden administration,  which has proven to be the least transparent administration in American  history, accountable.   Under President Biden's anti-American energy policies and his embrace  of the radical left's Green New Deal agenda, America's energy  independence has been severely jeopardized. In response, my amendment  would require President Biden and his administration to submit their  plan to Congress addressing his misuse of our Nation's Strategic  Petroleum Reserve prior to the next drawdown of our reserve.   My amendment would ensure that the plan the administration develops  actually addresses our Nation's energy security and shows in writing to  Congress that it does not sell our country's emergency energy supply to  our adversaries, including companies aligned with the Chinese Communist  Party that have direct connections to the President's son.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment to submit the administration's plan to this body so we can do  the work the American people sent us here to do, which is to restore  American energy independence, unleash domestic energy production, and  hold the Biden administration accountable for creating this crisis.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
