 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with my  colleague Senator Casey that would reauthorize the only federally  funded programs that are specifically designed to develop a health  provider workforce to care for our older Americans. The Geriatrics  Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the Geriatrics Workforce  Enhancement Program and also reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career  Award Program.   The number of Americans aged 65 and older is growing rapidly. In my  State of Maine, we are reaching an aging milestone faster than are  other States. By 2020, the number of Maine seniors is projected to  exceed the number of Maine children. This is 15 years ahead of the  nationally projected date of 2035, at which point the number of  Americans aged 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18  for the first time in our Nation's history.   The United States is facing a critical shortage of geriatric health  professionals and direct service workers to support our aging  population. Today, we need 20,000 geriatricians. However, fewer than  7,300 of our Nation's nearly 1 million physicians are board certified  as geriatricians. By 2030, we will need 30,000 geriatricians and even  more geriatric health professionals and direct service workers. To  achieve this goal, we will need to train 1,600 geriatric specialists  per year over the next 12 years.   For the State of Maine, with an aging population of more than a  quarter million Mainers over the age of 65 and with only 40  geriatricians, there is an acute need to quickly train more geriatric  health professionals and direct service workers to meet the growing  demand. The University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine  has joined the University of Maine this year in proposing the ``Aging  Maine Transformation Collaborative.'' I was pleased to lend my support  to this collaboration earlier this year. If funded, AgingME would  become our State's first Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program and  would bring with it much needed assistance to communities and families  throughout our State.   Nationwide, our bill would reauthorize this workforce enhancement  program at $45 million per year over the next 5 years and would  reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career Award Program at $6 million  per year. Together, these programs would train the current workforce  and family caregivers while simultaneously developing a cadre of  emerging leaders in geriatric education in a variety of disciplines. By  doing both, we will ensure that older Americans will be cared for, for  decades to come, by a healthcare workforce that will be specifically  trained to meet their unique and complex healthcare challenges. This  training of using the most efficient and effective methods for older  adults will result in improved care while reducing unnecessary costs.   I am pleased to say that our legislation is supported by the leading  organizations in gerontology and geriatrics, including the Eldercare  Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, the Alzheimer's  Impact Movement, and the National Association of Geriatric Education  Centers.   I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be printed in  the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Eldercare Workforce Alliance,                                   Washington, DC, January 25, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Susan Collins and Senator Bob Casey: On behalf       of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance (EWA), we are writing to       express our support of the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement       Act.        EWA is a coalition of 32 national consumer, health care       professional, direct-care worker and family caregiver       organizations. The number of Americans over age 65 is       expected to reach 70 million by 2030, representing a 71%       increase from today's 41 million older adults. Today's health       care workforce is inadequate to meet the needs of older       Americans, many of whom have multiple chronic physical and       mental health conditions and cognitive impairments. Without a       national commitment to expand training and educational       opportunities, the workforce will be even more constrained in       its ability to care for the elderly population as the baby       boom generation ages.        This bipartisan bill supports two critical objectives.       First, it would formally establish funding for the Geriatrics       Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP). Second, it would       reestablish the Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACAs), a       previously funded program for developing clinician-educators.       By supporting the GWEP and the GACAs, the Geriatrics       Workforce Improvement Act would:        Foster education and engagement with family caregivers by       training providers who can assess and address their care       needs and preferences.        Promote interdisciplinary team-based care by transforming       clinical training environments to integrate geriatrics and       primary care delivery systems.        Improve the quality of care delivered to older adults by       providing education to families and caregivers on critical       care challenges like Alzheimer's disease and related       dementias.        Reach underserved and rural communities by ensuring       clinician-educators are prepared to train the geriatrics       workforce of today and tomorrow.  [[Page S804]]         This investment protects our most vulnerable elders and       invests in our country's future. We ask that you continue       your support for the programs at this crucial time, and thank       you for your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,      Nancy Lundebjerg, MPA,        EWA Co-Convener.      Michele J. Saunders, DMD, MS, MPH,        EWA Co-Convener.                                   ____                                      American Geriatrics Society,                                     New York, NY, January 25, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Susan Collins and Senator Bob Casey: The       American Geriatrics Society (AGS), an organization devoted to       improving the health, independence and quality of life of       older adults, supports the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement       Act. The AGS is thankful for your support of the geriatrics       workforce training programs and for your efforts to improve       care of older Americans.        The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would authorize       the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) and the       Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACAs) program under Title       VII of the Public Health Service Act. The AGS believes that       both programs must be authorized and funded if all Americans       are to have access to high-quality, person-centered care as       we grow older.        The GWEP is currently the only federal program designed to       increase the number of providers, in a variety of       disciplines, with the skills and training to care for older       adults. The GWEPs educate and engage the broader frontline       workforce including family caregivers and focus on       opportunities to improve the quality of care delivered to       older adults, particularly in underserved and rural areas.       The GACA program is an essential complement to the GWEP       program. GACAs ensure we can equip early career clinician       educators to become leaders in geriatrics education and       research.        The introduction of this important legislation follows       announcements of related funding opportunities from the       Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in       November 2018. Authorization of the GWEPs and GACAs as       outlined in the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act will       help ensure that HRSA receives the funding necessary to carry       these critically important workforce training programs       forward.        At a time when our nation is facing a severe shortage of       both geriatrics healthcare providers and faculty with the       expertise to train these providers, the AGS believes the       number of educational and training opportunities in       geriatrics and gerontology should be expanded, not reduced.       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,      Laurie Jacobs, MD, AGSF,        President.      Nancy E. Lundebjerg, MPA,        Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                      Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Casey: On behalf       of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact       Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of       advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues       and legislation important to Americans living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias, and to their caregivers. The       Alzheimer's Association and AIM are pleased to support the       Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act.        More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's       and, without significant action, nearly 14 million Americans       will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another person develops       the disease every 65 seconds; by 2050, someone in the United       States will develop the disease every 33 seconds. This       explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's costs to increase       from an estimated $277 billion in 2018 to $1.1 trillion in       2050 (in 2018 dollars). These mounting costs threaten to       bankrupt families, businesses and our health care system.       Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.        The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would develop a       workforce capable of providing complex, high-quality care       that improves health outcomes and reduces costs for a diverse       and growing aging population. It would reauthorize the       Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP), and       reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACAs)       Program, a previously funded program for developing       clinician-educators, two critical objectives to ensure       communities across the nation have access to health       professionals and other critical supports, improving care for       all of us as we age. By supporting the GWEP and GACAs the       Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would, foster education       and engagement with family caregivers by training providers       who can assess and address care needs and preferences, reach       underserved and rural communities by ensuring clinician-      educators are prepared to train the geriatrics workforce of       today and tomorrow, and improve the quality of care delivered       to older adults by providing education to families and       caregivers on critical care challenges.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your       continued leadership on behalf of all Americans living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to       continuing to work with you and your colleagues to improve       care and support for individuals and families affected by       Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. If you have any       questions about this or any other legislation, please contact       Rachel Conant, Senior Director of Federal Affairs.            Sincerely,      Robert Egge,        Chief Public Policy Officer, Executive Vice President,       Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.                                   ____                                           National Association of                                    Geriatric Education Centers,                                                   January 25, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Casey: On behalf       of the HRSA Title VII and Title VIII funded Geriatrics       Workforce Enhancement Programs (GWEPs) across the country,       thank you for your past support of geriatric education and       for introducing the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act. The       National Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is       pleased to offer our support for the Geriatrics Workforce       Improvement Act, which will reauthorize the GWEP and once       again make the Geriatrics Academic Career Award program       (GACA) a part of the effort to prepare the geriatrics       workforce for the aging of our population. We and the growing       numbers of older adults, caregivers, and clinicians caring       for elders will urge Congress to move quickly to pass your       bill and provide the resources to address our nation's       growing demand for geriatric care.        We appreciate the many discussions that your staff       facilitated with NAGE, as well as with the Eldercare       Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, and The       Gerontological Society of America during the process of       developing this legislation. This authorization and related       funding are needed for the development of a health care       workforce specifically trained to care for older adults and       to support their family caregivers. Currently there are only       44 GWEP sites in 29 states. The modest increase in the       authorization in your bill will have an important impact on       training in geriatric care. Likewise, the funds you have       authorized for the GACA program complement the GWEP, and       support faculty that will teach and lead geriatrics programs.       The bill will also assist in ensuring that rural and       underserved areas will have geriatrics education programs.        NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing       GWEP sites, Centers on Aging, and Geriatric Education Centers       that provide education and training to health professionals       in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to       help America's healthcare workforce be better prepared to       render age-appropriate care to today's older Americans and       those of tomorrow.        Thank you for your continued support for geriatric       education programs.            Sincerely,      Catherine Carrico, PhD,        President NAGE/NAGEC, Associate Director, Wyoming Geriatric       Workforce Enhancement Program, Wyoming Center on Aging,       Clinical Assistant Professor, College of Health Sciences,       University of Wyoming.                                   ____      Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this bipartisan bill that would ensure geriatric education for our  current workforce while it would optimize resources to bolster academic  careers in geriatrics and help to attract the best and the brightest  into this field. Together, these programs would develop exactly the  kind of highly qualified workforce that we need to care for Americans  as our Nation grows older.   I thank the Presiding Officer.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Tester, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Jones,          Mr. Boozman, Mr. Manchin, and Ms. Harris):   S. 304. A bill to reauthorize section 340H of the Public Health  Service Act  [[Page S805]]  to continue to encourage the expansion, maintenance, and the  establishment of approved graduate medical residency programs at  qualified teaching health centers, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my  colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, to fund Teaching Health  Centers, a time-tested model for success to train the next generation  of primary care doctors in communities where they are needed the most.  I am pleased that Senators Capito, Jones, Boozman, Manchin, and Harris  have joined us as cosponsors.   Over the next decade, the severe shortage of primary care doctors  could reach crisis levels in a growing number of rural and underserved  communities in Maine and across our Nation. Alarmingly, these  communities are often those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. By  2030, we will need an estimated 120,000 physicians to meet the growing  demand for health care services across the Country. In clinics and  health centers in Northern Maine, I frequently hear stories about  vacancies forcing Mainers to travel many miles simply to see a primary  care doctor or dentist.   For the past eight years, one program, the Teaching Health Centers  Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This  program trains medical residents in community-based settings, including  low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. For example,  since its inception in 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center  has trained 34 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in  Bangor, Maine.   Nationwide, this program has produced real results. Since the program  began, 632 new primary care physicians and dentists have graduated and  entered the workforce, and the number of Americans served is in the  millions. Those who train at teaching health centers are very likely to  practice primary care and remain in underserved or rural communities.  Last Congress, this Committee considered and successfully passed my  legislation to fund teaching health centers for two years. As a result,  for the 2017-2018 academic year, this program supported the training of  732 residents in 57 primary care residency programs, across 24 states.   The legislation I have introduced today would reauthorize the  Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for five  years and provide additional funding for expansion and the creation of  new programs. This bill is widely supported by leading community health  and physician organizations, including the American Association of  Teaching Health Centers, National Association of Community Health  Centers, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Association of  Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and Council of Academic Family  Medicine.   In the face of nationwide physician shortages, our legislation would  provide a solution for communities today and a path forward to train  the physicians of tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to join in  support of this important legislation, the Training the Next Generation  of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019.   Mr. President, I ask to include these letters into the Record.   Mr. PRESIDENT: With no objection so ordered.                                                          Council of                                        Academic Family Medicine,                                                   January 28, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Capito,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Doug Jones,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Jones, Capito, and Tester: On behalf       of the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including       the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of       Departments of Family Medicine, Association of Family       Medicine Residency Directors, the North American Primary Care       Research Group, we thank you for introducing the Training the       Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019. This       legislation is an important step to providing sustainable       funding and growth for a critical program that helps address       the primary care physician shortage in our country. We       appreciate your leadership on this issue and give you our       whole-hearted support for the legislation.        To help sustain this important graduate medical education       program your legislation provides suitable funding for       current Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education       (THCGME) programs to help address the crisis-level shortage       of primary care physicians. The funding level included in the       bill will allow for a per resident amount to be paid for       training that is on par with the Health Resources and       Services Administration (HRSA) funded study identifying a       median cost of approximately $157,600 per trainee. It allows       for programs to regain previous losses of residency positions       due to lower funding levels and instability. We are       particularly pleased that the legislation would provide a       five year reauthorization, giving the program some much       needed financial stability.        In addition, we are gratified that the proposed legislation       supports and funds the creation of new programs and/or       centers, with a priority for those serving rural and       medically underserved populations and areas. Evidence shows       that the THC program graduates are more likely to practice in       rural and medically underserved communities. Recognizing the       importance of growing this successful program to help address       geographic maldistributions of physicians across the country       is significant.        The current authorization for this vital program expires at       the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative action, the       expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the       primary care physician shortage, and a lessening of support       for training in underserved and rural areas. Your efforts in       support for this program since its inception have been key to       keeping it alive. We are grateful to all of you for your       exceptional leadership in supporting and sustaining this       vital program by introducing this bill and helping to       shepherd it toward enactment.        The CAFM organizations and our members are pleased to work       with you to secure this legislation's enactment.            Sincerely,      Beat Steiner, MD,        President, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.      Fred Miser, MD,        President, Association of Family Medicine, Residency       Directors.      Judith Belle Brown, PhD,        President, North American Primary Care Research Group.                                   ____                        Joint Statement for the Record      Hearing of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee on        Access to Care: Health Centers and Providers in Underserved                       Communities, January 29, 2018         On behalf of the more than 145,000 osteopathic physicians       and medical students we represent, we applaud the committee's       leadership and bipartisan effort to address the shortage in       our health care workforce. We are thankful for the Chairman       and Ranking Member for introducing legislation that would       reauthorize the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical       Education Program (THCGME) In anticipation of the upcoming       hearing, Access to Care: Health Centers and Providers in       Underserved Communities, we would like to highlight the need,       and encourage the committee, to support funding for growth in       the reauthorization of the THCGME program to help address the       shortage in our health care workforce.        The majority of THCGME programs are currently accredited by       the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD) programs, supporting       nearly 800 osteopathic resident physicians through their       training since the program's inception. Located in 27 states       and the District of Columbia, THCGME programs train residents       in much-needed primary care fields that have the largest       shortages nationally, including family medicine, internal       medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry,       geriatrics, and dentistry. It is a vital source of training       for primary care residents to help expand access to care in       rural and underserved communities throughout the country.        Osteopathic physicians (DOs) are fully-licensed to practice       in all specialty areas of medicine, with nearly 57% of active       DOs in primary care. Our training emphasizes a whole-person       approach to treatment and care, where we partner with our       patients to help them get healthy and stay well. Osteopathic       medical education also has a long history of establishing       educational programs for medical students and residents that       target the health care needs of rural and underserved       populations. Given this strong presence in primary care,       osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and       goals of the THCGME program that has proven successful in       helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary       care workforce.        Residents who train in THC programs are far more likely to       specialize in primary care and remain in the communities in       which they have trained. Data shows that, when compared to       traditional postgraduate trainees, residents who train at       THCs are more likely to practice primary care (82% vs. 23%)       and remain in underserved (55% vs. 26%) or rural (20% vs. 5%)       communities. It is clear that a well-designed THCGME program       not only plays a vital role in training our next generation       of primary care physicians, but helps to bridge our nation's       physician shortfall. The program also tackles the issue of  [[Page S806]]       physician maldistribution, and helps address the need to       attract and retain physicians in rural areas and medically       underserved communities. In the 2016-2017 academic year,       nearly all residents received training in primary care       settings and 83% of residents trained in Medically       Underserved Communities.        However, reauthorizing the THCGME program at its current       level funding, for the next five years, would lead to a       reduction of approximately 70 residency slots from the       currently funded 737 residency positions.        We respectfully ask the committee to consider legislation       by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Doug Jones (D-AL), Shelley       Moore Capito (R-WV), and John Tester (D-MT) the ``Training       the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019.'' In       addition to reauthorizing the THCGME program for the next       five years, this bill also provides funding and a pathway for       growth in the number of residents trained in underserved       rural and urban communities. This represents a much needed       expansion to address the physician shortages in our country.        We would also like to briefly highlight the broader role       osteopathic physicians have in reducing our nation's       physician shortage. Since 2010, the number of DOs has       increased by 54%. Today, more than 65% of all DOs are under       the age of 45, and if current enrollment trends continue, DOs       are projected to represent more than 20% of practicing       physicians by 2030. Because of the whole-person approach to       patient care that is inherent in osteopathic medicine, the       increasing share of DOs in the physician workforce, and the       number of DOs in primary care specialties, we have a unique       and important perspective on the needs of our nation's health       care workforce and would welcome the opportunity to       contribute to your work on this issue.        We appreciate your bipartisan effort to address the       shortage in our country's health care workforce, and we stand       ready to assist in your effort.

Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Jones, Capito, and Tester: On behalf       of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), which       represents 131,400 family physicians and medical students       across the country, I write to support your legislation to       reauthorize the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education (THCGME) program Thank you for your commitment to       this important, innovative program.        The AAFP is pleased to support the Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act because it updates the       THCGME program for five years, authorizes adequate and       sustainable funding for existing residency programs, and       supports expansion into rural and underserved communities In       addition, the legislation maintains the program's strong       transparency and accountability requirements. The THCGME       program directly addresses three major physician workforce       challenges: the serious shortage of primary care physicians,       geographic maldistribution of physician training, and the       need to increase health care access for medically-underserved       populations. Recognizing the importance of supplying well-      trained primary care physicians into communities that need       them most, we look forward to working with you to update and       expand the THCGME program early this year.        Again, we are pleased to support this important       legislation. For more information, please contact Sonya Clay,       Government Relations Representative.            Sincerely,                                             Michael L.

[January 29, 2019]     Physicians, Medical Educators, Community Health Centers Strongly    Support Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of                                    2019         Our organizations applaud the introduction of the Training       the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019 and       urge the Senate to quickly pass this important legislation.       We thank Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Doug Jones (D-AL),       Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), and John       Boozman (R-AR) for their commitment to ensuring that our       nation has a strong and robust primary care workforce.       Furthermore, we thank Senate HELP Committee Chairman Lamar       Alexander (R-TN) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA) for       their leadership in introducing the Community and Public       Health Programs Extension Act, which will extend for five       years federal funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate       Medical Education (THCGME) Program, community health centers,       the National Health Service Corps, and two other federal       health programs. These programs are set to expire at the end       of the fiscal year.        The THCGME Program, established in 2010 and reauthorized in       2015 and 2018 has been, by any measure, an overwhelming       success. In the 2017-2018 academic year, the program       supported the training of 732 residents in 57 primary care       residency programs, across 24 states. Since 2011, the program       has supported the training of over 630 new primary care       physicians and dentists that have graduated and entered the       workforce. Importantly, physicians trained in teaching health       center programs are more likely to practice in underserved       communities, increasing access to care for the country's most       vulnerable patient populations.        The value of primary care is well documented. In fact,       individuals who have a continuous relationship with a primary       care physician are more likely to be healthier and use fewer       health care resources. Research shows that our nation faces a       primary care physician workforce shortage. The THCGME Program       has proven its ability to efficiently increase the number of       primary care physicians trained.        This highly successful and impactful program is set to       expire on September 30, 2019 unless Congress takes action to       reauthorize and fund it. The legislation introduced today not       only reauthorizes the program, but also provides enhanced       funding and a pathway for increasing the number of residents       trained. Most important, the legislation will continue to       build the primary care physician pipeline necessary to reduce       costs, improve patient care, and support underserved rural       and urban communities.        We are extremely pleased that members of both parties are       working together to extend this vital program that brings       health care to medically underserved communities across the       nation. Our organizations strongly support Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019 and call on       the House of Representatives and Senate to ensure that the       THCGME Program is reauthorized and appropriately financed by       September 30.                                   ____                                             American Association of                                Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine,                                                   January 28, 2019.

Hon. Doug Jones,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Jones, Capito, Tester, and Boozman:       On behalf of the American Association of Colleges of       Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), thank you for your unceasing       bipartisan commitment and leadership in championing the       Health Resources and Services Administration's Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program by       introducing the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care       Doctors Act of 2019. We offer our strong support of this       legislation.        AACOM represents the 35 accredited colleges of osteopathic       medicine in the United States. These colleges are accredited       to deliver instruction at 55 teaching locations in 32 states.       In the current academic year, these colleges are educating       more than 30,000 future physicians--25 percent of all U.S.       medical students. Six of the colleges are public and 29 are       private institutions. AACOM was founded in 1898 to support       and assist the nation's osteopathic medical schools, and to       serve as a unifying voice for osteopathic medical education.       The association leads and advocates for the osteopathic       medical education community to improve the health of the       public.        With your introduction of the Training the Next Generation       of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2019, the osteopathic medical       education community commends your bipartisan efforts to       support this critical program that produces primary care       physicians in medically underserved communities across our       country by reauthorizing it for five years  [[Page S807]]       and providing enhanced funding and a pathway for growth in       the number of residents trained.        Established in 2010 and reauthorized in 2015 and 2018, the       THCGME Program has been a notable success. In the 2017-2018       academic year, the program supported the training of 732       residents in 57 primary care residency programs, across 24       states. Since 2011, the program has supported the training of       over 630 new primary care physicians and dentists that have       graduated and entered the workforce. Importantly, physicians       trained in THC programs are more likely to practice in       underserved communities, increasing access to care for the       country's most vulnerable patient populations.        As you know, the continuation of this program is vital to       addressing primary care physician workforce shortages and       delivering health care services to vulnerable patients in       need. It has encouraged greater connections and services       between traditionally underserved areas and the emerging       physician workforce by creating opportunities for medical       students to carry out their required training where their       services are most needed. The THCGME Program has been highly       effective in transitioning residents into medically       underserved areas, with more than 80 percent remaining in       primary care practice and over half remaining in high-need       communities.        On behalf of the nation's osteopathic medical schools and       the students they train, thank you for your steadfast       leadership, and I look forward to continuing our work       together to support a health care system that will enable       osteopathic medical students and future physicians to provide       primary health care to the patients they serve. We look       forward to working together on this important legislation.            Respectfully,                                       Stephen C. Shannon, DO, MPH,                                                 President and CEO.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Harris):   S. 308. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey  certain Federal lands in San Bernardino County, California, to the San  Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District, and to accept in return  certain non-Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with my  colleague Senator Casey that would reauthorize the only federally  funded programs that are specifically designed to develop a health  provider workforce to care for our older Americans. The Geriatrics  Workforce Improvement Act would reauthorize the Geriatrics Workforce  Enhancement Program and also reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career  Award Program.   The number of Americans aged 65 and older is growing rapidly. In my  State of Maine, we are reaching an aging milestone faster than are  other States. By 2020, the number of Maine seniors is projected to  exceed the number of Maine children. This is 15 years ahead of the  nationally projected date of 2035, at which point the number of  Americans aged 65 and older will outnumber those under the age of 18  for the first time in our Nation's history.   The United States is facing a critical shortage of geriatric health  professionals and direct service workers to support our aging  population. Today, we need 20,000 geriatricians. However, fewer than  7,300 of our Nation's nearly 1 million physicians are board certified  as geriatricians. By 2030, we will need 30,000 geriatricians and even  more geriatric health professionals and direct service workers. To  achieve this goal, we will need to train 1,600 geriatric specialists  per year over the next 12 years.   For the State of Maine, with an aging population of more than a  quarter million Mainers over the age of 65 and with only 40  geriatricians, there is an acute need to quickly train more geriatric  health professionals and direct service workers to meet the growing  demand. The University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine  has joined the University of Maine this year in proposing the ``Aging  Maine Transformation Collaborative.'' I was pleased to lend my support  to this collaboration earlier this year. If funded, AgingME would  become our State's first Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program and  would bring with it much needed assistance to communities and families  throughout our State.   Nationwide, our bill would reauthorize this workforce enhancement  program at $45 million per year over the next 5 years and would  reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career Award Program at $6 million  per year. Together, these programs would train the current workforce  and family caregivers while simultaneously developing a cadre of  emerging leaders in geriatric education in a variety of disciplines. By  doing both, we will ensure that older Americans will be cared for, for  decades to come, by a healthcare workforce that will be specifically  trained to meet their unique and complex healthcare challenges. This  training of using the most efficient and effective methods for older  adults will result in improved care while reducing unnecessary costs.   I am pleased to say that our legislation is supported by the leading  organizations in gerontology and geriatrics, including the Eldercare  Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, the Alzheimer's  Impact Movement, and the National Association of Geriatric Education  Centers.   I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be printed in  the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                   Eldercare Workforce Alliance,                                   Washington, DC, January 25, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Susan Collins and Senator Bob Casey: On behalf       of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance (EWA), we are writing to       express our support of the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement       Act.        EWA is a coalition of 32 national consumer, health care       professional, direct-care worker and family caregiver       organizations. The number of Americans over age 65 is       expected to reach 70 million by 2030, representing a 71%       increase from today's 41 million older adults. Today's health       care workforce is inadequate to meet the needs of older       Americans, many of whom have multiple chronic physical and       mental health conditions and cognitive impairments. Without a       national commitment to expand training and educational       opportunities, the workforce will be even more constrained in       its ability to care for the elderly population as the baby       boom generation ages.        This bipartisan bill supports two critical objectives.       First, it would formally establish funding for the Geriatrics       Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP). Second, it would       reestablish the Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACAs), a       previously funded program for developing clinician-educators.       By supporting the GWEP and the GACAs, the Geriatrics       Workforce Improvement Act would:        Foster education and engagement with family caregivers by       training providers who can assess and address their care       needs and preferences.        Promote interdisciplinary team-based care by transforming       clinical training environments to integrate geriatrics and       primary care delivery systems.        Improve the quality of care delivered to older adults by       providing education to families and caregivers on critical       care challenges like Alzheimer's disease and related       dementias.        Reach underserved and rural communities by ensuring       clinician-educators are prepared to train the geriatrics       workforce of today and tomorrow.  [[Page S804]]         This investment protects our most vulnerable elders and       invests in our country's future. We ask that you continue       your support for the programs at this crucial time, and thank       you for your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,      Nancy Lundebjerg, MPA,        EWA Co-Convener.      Michele J.

Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Special Committee on Aging,      U.S. Senate Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Susan Collins and Senator Bob Casey: The       American Geriatrics Society (AGS), an organization devoted to       improving the health, independence and quality of life of       older adults, supports the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement       Act. The AGS is thankful for your support of the geriatrics       workforce training programs and for your efforts to improve       care of older Americans.        The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would authorize       the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) and the       Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACAs) program under Title       VII of the Public Health Service Act. The AGS believes that       both programs must be authorized and funded if all Americans       are to have access to high-quality, person-centered care as       we grow older.        The GWEP is currently the only federal program designed to       increase the number of providers, in a variety of       disciplines, with the skills and training to care for older       adults. The GWEPs educate and engage the broader frontline       workforce including family caregivers and focus on       opportunities to improve the quality of care delivered to       older adults, particularly in underserved and rural areas.       The GACA program is an essential complement to the GWEP       program. GACAs ensure we can equip early career clinician       educators to become leaders in geriatrics education and       research.        The introduction of this important legislation follows       announcements of related funding opportunities from the       Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in       November 2018. Authorization of the GWEPs and GACAs as       outlined in the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act will       help ensure that HRSA receives the funding necessary to carry       these critically important workforce training programs       forward.        At a time when our nation is facing a severe shortage of       both geriatrics healthcare providers and faculty with the       expertise to train these providers, the AGS believes the       number of educational and training opportunities in       geriatrics and gerontology should be expanded, not reduced.       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,      Laurie Jacobs, MD, AGSF,        President.      Nancy E. Lundebjerg, MPA,        Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                      Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2019.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Casey,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Casey: On behalf       of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact       Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of       advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues       and legislation important to Americans living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias, and to their caregivers. The       Alzheimer's Association and AIM are pleased to support the       Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act.        More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's       and, without significant action, nearly 14 million Americans       will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another person develops       the disease every 65 seconds; by 2050, someone in the United       States will develop the disease every 33 seconds. This       explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's costs to increase       from an estimated $277 billion in 2018 to $1.1 trillion in       2050 (in 2018 dollars). These mounting costs threaten to       bankrupt families, businesses and our health care system.       Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.        The Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would develop a       workforce capable of providing complex, high-quality care       that improves health outcomes and reduces costs for a diverse       and growing aging population. It would reauthorize the       Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP), and       reinstate the Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACAs)       Program, a previously funded program for developing       clinician-educators, two critical objectives to ensure       communities across the nation have access to health       professionals and other critical supports, improving care for       all of us as we age. By supporting the GWEP and GACAs the       Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act would, foster education       and engagement with family caregivers by training providers       who can assess and address care needs and preferences, reach       underserved and rural communities by ensuring clinician-      educators are prepared to train the geriatrics workforce of       today and tomorrow, and improve the quality of care delivered       to older adults by providing education to families and       caregivers on critical care challenges.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your       continued leadership on behalf of all Americans living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to       continuing to work with you and your colleagues to improve       care and support for individuals and families affected by       Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. If you have any       questions about this or any other legislation, please contact       Rachel Conant, Senior Director of Federal Affairs.

Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Casey: On behalf       of the HRSA Title VII and Title VIII funded Geriatrics       Workforce Enhancement Programs (GWEPs) across the country,       thank you for your past support of geriatric education and       for introducing the Geriatrics Workforce Improvement Act. The       National Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is       pleased to offer our support for the Geriatrics Workforce       Improvement Act, which will reauthorize the GWEP and once       again make the Geriatrics Academic Career Award program       (GACA) a part of the effort to prepare the geriatrics       workforce for the aging of our population. We and the growing       numbers of older adults, caregivers, and clinicians caring       for elders will urge Congress to move quickly to pass your       bill and provide the resources to address our nation's       growing demand for geriatric care.        We appreciate the many discussions that your staff       facilitated with NAGE, as well as with the Eldercare       Workforce Alliance, the American Geriatrics Society, and The       Gerontological Society of America during the process of       developing this legislation. This authorization and related       funding are needed for the development of a health care       workforce specifically trained to care for older adults and       to support their family caregivers. Currently there are only       44 GWEP sites in 29 states. The modest increase in the       authorization in your bill will have an important impact on       training in geriatric care. Likewise, the funds you have       authorized for the GACA program complement the GWEP, and       support faculty that will teach and lead geriatrics programs.       The bill will also assist in ensuring that rural and       underserved areas will have geriatrics education programs.        NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing       GWEP sites, Centers on Aging, and Geriatric Education Centers       that provide education and training to health professionals       in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to       help America's healthcare workforce be better prepared to       render age-appropriate care to today's older Americans and       those of tomorrow.        Thank you for your continued support for geriatric       education programs.            Sincerely,      Catherine Carrico, PhD,        President NAGE/NAGEC, Associate Director, Wyoming Geriatric       Workforce Enhancement Program, Wyoming Center on Aging,       Clinical Assistant Professor, College of Health Sciences,       University of Wyoming.                                   ____      Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this bipartisan bill that would ensure geriatric education for our  current workforce while it would optimize resources to bolster academic  careers in geriatrics and help to attract the best and the brightest  into this field. Together, these programs would develop exactly the  kind of highly qualified workforce that we need to care for Americans  as our Nation grows older.   I thank the Presiding Officer.                                  ______
