 Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce my bill to protect  one of the most unique and fragile environments on Earth, my Hawaii,  from devastating invasive species.   Isolated Hawaii has one of the highest number and rate of endemic  species anywhere. Invasive species have wreaked havoc on our natural  environment as well as Hawaii agriculture.   In the last 200 years alone, countless plant and animal species have  gone extinct, in large part because of invasives.   Leading countries have required strict invasive prevention measures.  Even the continental United States requires inspections of goods from  Hawaii to prevent the introduction of species that may damage mainland  crops.   Yet, Hawaii's prevention regime is weak. My bill simply says that if  these invasive species prevention requirements are good enough for the  rest of the country and much of the world, then they are good enough  for Hawaii.                            ____________________
