 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition  of November as Lung Cancer Awareness Month.   Despite many advances in cancer diagnosis, care, and treatment, lung  cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in America today.  Screening is key to detecting lung cancer early and can significantly  improve survival outcomes. But fewer than five percent of all eligible  Americans undergo screening for lung cancer each year.   It is vital that we encourage all those who are eligible to get  screened and ensure that receiving screening is as easy as possible. By  improving access to screening, we can catch lung cancer early and give  patients the best possible hope for beating this terrible disease.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I was listening intently to the other side extolling the virtues of  nothing but a cynical assessment of the American economy when the  American economy, in fact, needs investment.   A couple of facts I want to clear up here, if the United States  economy had grown at the increased rates seen under Democrats since  1933, the average income of Americans would be more than double than it  currently is today.   Economic growth since 1933: 4.6 percent under Democrats; 2.4 percent  under Republicans.   Annual jobs increases since 1933: Under Democrats, 2.8 percent; under  Republicans, 1 percent.   Since 1962, Democrats created 21 million more jobs than Republicans.   Ten of 11 of the United States recessions between 1953 and 2000 began  under Republicans administrations.   George Bush I, a Republican, created a $300-billion deficit. William  Clinton, a Democrat, wiped out the entire deficit and left the next  administration, Bush II, with a $300-billion surplus. Bush II turned  that into a $1.3-trillion deficit. Obama, a Democratic President, cut  that deficit to $600 billion.    Will the gentleman yield?    That would be 91 percent.    It was reduced to 77 percent under a  Democratic administration, under John F. Kennedy.    That is right, sir.    Well, I think the point that is being made  here is, despite perceptions to the contrary and the assertions of  those who have now left perhaps because they can't defend this, clearly  the American economy performs much more efficiently, much more  effectively under Democratic administrations.   That is why the Build Back Better program invests not in wars that  don't create any new roads and bridges in America, that don't pull any  kids out of poverty, that don't provide childcare and child tax  credits. Complete waste of money. Brown University just came out with a  study that said Americans paid $6.2 trillion in the past two decades in  three Middle East wars.   The Build Back Better program invests in America by rebuilding  America, by investing in young America so that they become safer, have  better nutrition, and have more economic activity at a very young age.   Every single study points to the same conclusion, that if you invest  in kids, the child tax credit, pre-K, childcare, you produce a more  productive citizen. University studies show that for every dollar that  you spend, you produce in long-term economic benefits $7 to $8.     Madam Speaker, my two colleagues from  Pennsylvania were very clear about the component parts of this plan and  the good things that they do for individuals, but they also do good  things for our Nation as a whole.   Madam Speaker, the conservative economist from Moody's Analytics,  Mark Zandi, did an analysis of the 2017 corporate tax cut. He said that  for every dollar that you gave away, you could expect to recapture 32  cents. That is a loss in investment of 67 percent.   On infrastructure, the conservative economist says that for every  dollar that you spend on infrastructure, you produce $1.60 in economic  activity. The gain on investment on infrastructure is 60 percent. So it  is beyond the bricks and mortar of infrastructure. It is also the good  that that does for the growth in the economy.   I would leave you with this: The oil age isn't going to end because  we run out of oil. The oil age is going to end because we find a better  way than the internal combustible engine, something that is quieter,  cleaner, and eventually cheaper. And guess what? This bill, the Build  Back Better, the infrastructure bill, has money to provide charging  stations to facilitate the making and the using of electric vehicles,  ending this Nation's addiction to foreign oil.
