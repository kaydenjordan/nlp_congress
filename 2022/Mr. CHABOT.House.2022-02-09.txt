 Mr. Speaker, greater Cincinnati is in the grips of  Bengals fever.   From pep rallies at Paul Brown Stadium, to celebrations at bars and  restaurants, and at home, to wall-to-wall coverage on the nightly news,  everyone is celebrating the Bengals' third trip to the Super Bowl.   In that spirit, the city of Cheviot, on Cincinnati's west side, just  renamed a number of streets after Bengals players. Cheviot residents  will be driving down Joe Burrow Way rather than Harrison Avenue and  Chase Drive instead of Glenmore Avenue.   It reminds me of the last time the Bengals went to the Super Bowl,  back in 1989. Yes, it has been a while. We faced legendary 49ers  quarterback Joe Montana for the second time at the Super Bowl. I was on  the Cincinnati City Council at the time, and Montana Avenue became  Esiason Street--that is Boomer Esiason, the Bengals quarterback--all in  good fun, of course.   Well done, Cheviot. And I will just close with this: Who Dey.                            ____________________
