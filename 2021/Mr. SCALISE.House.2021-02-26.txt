 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill  because we should be here tonight focused on real priorities of the  American people, and that should be number one. Reopening our schools  now. Mr. Speaker, we should be focused on helping our small businesses,  who are dying on the vine. Mr. Speaker, we should be focused on helping  put more vaccination shots in the arms of Americans. Unfortunately,  that is not what this bill does.   You are talking about over a trillion dollars that is still available  from previous bipartisan bills that is out there.                                time  0000    There are tens of billions of dollars to reopen schools that are  available today that are not being used. We had amendments to say, any  new money in this bill for schools is tied to reopening schools.   Do you know that every Democrat voted against that amendment?   In fact, if you look at some of the spending in this bill that has  nothing to do with COVID, $350 billion to bail out failed states.  California gets over $40 billion in this bill when they just announced  they had a $10 billion surplus. In fact, California is going to be  getting a subway for the bay area--$112 million.   Mr. Speaker, I say we defund BART and give that money to those  students right now who are being held back from going to school, who  have mental health issues. That is what Mrs. Hinson's amendment will  do.   Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit actually focuses on helping kids.  We are holding our kids back. This bill will actually delay reopening  of schools; 95 percent of the school money in this bill can't even be  spent until 2022. Our kids can't wait. We ought to be focused on  helping families, on helping businesses, on reopening schools, and more  vaccines.   If this bill did those things, they wouldn't be bringing it up at  midnight on a Friday night. This bill ought to be in full public view.  You don't pass this bill to find out what is in it. We need to defeat  this bill and help families.
