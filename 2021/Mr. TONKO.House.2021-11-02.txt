 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Cartwright), and thank him for leading us in tonight's discussion  on both physical and human infrastructure.   Let me start by extending my comments toward the child tax credit  that you made mention of in your last comments. The data now are  available from July and August. As we all know, families received their  first check in July, and what a bit of welcome relief. And as we look  at where those dollars went, 47 percent, from July and August  payments--those are the data available currently--47 percent went to  put food on the table; 28 percent went toward utilities, including  broadband.    So we are talking about kids doing their homework. We are talking  about parents having an opportunity to reach the outside world. Middle- income America to have cottage industries up and running. So 75 percent  of that tax cut went to food and utilities, and other incidentals  absorb the remaining amount of payments. Now, that is a staggering  statistic. That should tell us something about the value added of this  tax cut.   Madam Speaker, as Representative Cartwright indicated, there is a  stark contrast between Republican leadership in the House and  Democratic leadership in the House. When the majority was run by the  Republicans, they joined the former President in providing a tax cut  for the 1 percent of the highest wealth in the country. This reaches  across the spectrum of middle-income communities and those looking to  ascend to the middle class.   The statistic that I find most heartwarming is that one-half of  children living in poverty in our country, one-half of those children,  will be lifted out of poverty with this child tax credit. That is a  moral standard that we should all embrace.   If you want to really see a comeback in our economy, we support those  families, middle-income families, those looking to ascend to the middle  income. Those are the families that need the shot in the arm. And it is  going to happen by further extending that tax program.   So our heart is with children. Our heart is with those children who  need early education, three- and four-year-olds that will be able to  have advantages, too. The programs that will provide, not only  educational training, but cognitive skill development, cognitive  awareness, social awareness that will drive the factors that lead to a  productive life.                                time  1915    And so many times education experts will cite the availability of  early education as the big factor in determining the outcome of a  person's work career and the dollars that individual brings home; so  that is very important.   Access to quality childcare. So many families are not rejoining the  workforce because they don't have access to healthcare. And if the  schools are in this undecided state whether they are going to have  virtually learning or in-classroom learning or part of each combined,  they need the security of childcare.   So the human fabric, the human infrastructure that is part of the  Build Back Better Act introduced and envisioned by this President,  President Biden, is tremendously reinforcing to so many families across  the country. Powerful information and powerful reinforcements that  enable them to  [[Page H6114]]  dream their version of the American dream.   Now, when we talk about the physical infrastructure, I would be  remiss if I didn't equate that to the 20th Congressional District of  New York. My district hosts the eastern mouth of the Erie Canal. And  the vision for infrastructure in really difficult economic times, by  Governor DeWitt Clinton, was to connect the great ocean, the Atlantic,  with the Great Lakes.   That inspired not only the development of New York as an entry port,  and we now know what a metropolis it is, but it inspired the necklace  of communities that were given birth to as mill towns; and then  inspired a westward movement. That is infrastructure playing into our  economic development into our future. It expanded the turf of this  country. It gave so many people the opportunity to insert their skill  set, their passion, their abilities into products that fed the quality  of life around the world.    Yes. Not a civil engineer, but mechanical and industrial.   But those engineers are powerful because they make the world spin.  And that whole feat, today, if you were to visit the Erie Canal and see  the lochs that were developed at a time when modern equipment and  machinery wasn't available, it was not only an engineering feat, but a  tremendous salute to the workers and the skill and the work ethic that  they bore.    Absolutely.    Absolutely. And as we invest in rail, we increase  ridership if you are getting from A to B in a quicker time period than  you would if you were traveling by car. It makes common sense and  economic sense. From rail to broadband--I have communities in my  district that are unserved or underserved with broadband services.   Today, this is about doctors reading x-rays, children doing their  homework, cottage industries launching and staying in business. This is  an important bit of modern-day infrastructure. It is akin to the Rural  Electrification Act of the 1930s, in the last century.   We have a history that speaks to us boldly about what infrastructure  meant. The Rural Electrification Act made America buzz with economic  activity; provided economic justice by reaching every corner of this  country, which broadband will do.   Let me just mention this, and I will close with this for now. I chair  the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change reporting to the  Energy and Commerce Committee. Under our umbrella falls the  responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act.   The drinking water infrastructure in this Build Back Better effort,  and infrastructure in general, is about making certain no children  drink out of lead-infested pipes. 10,000 pipes in this country that are  feeding and serving homes. There is no way children and families should  be drinking water that has lead in it: we know that it is a permanent  damage, irreversible; and we know that it is about social and economic  justice.   We also provide for more dollars in the SRF, the State Revolving  Funds, which 50 capitals across the country receive in terms of the  Federal downpayment for water infrastructure. I was in county  government back when I started my career, and we had much more of a  partnership with Washington.   Today, we are getting on average maybe 4 to 5 percent of all projects  that are drinking water-based as a Federal share. Come on, we can do  much better than that. If we don't, the issue doesn't go away, and  local property taxpayers have to pick up that burden. It is a  regressive tax.   So for many, many reasons, we are on board here with a plan that  really speaks to the definitive times in which we reside. We now are  living in a moment of history where we need to reengage, reengineer our  skill sets, our resources, to advance an innovation economy; and to do  that, we need a 21st century toolkit and the Build Back Better Act and  the infrastructure act, they do it. It is a good downpayment. We are  going to still have more work to do.   The President has a vision; it is bold. But we know that leaders in  the past, Governor DeWitt Clinton, President Eisenhower, President  Franklin Roosevelt, President Teddy Roosevelt with parks, setting aside  lands for park development, these were giants in their times.   We have a giant now calling on Congress to help bring the vision into  clear view and tether it into the communities across this country.    Worker training, worker retraining, apprenticeship  programs, skills development, childcare, so that families can  comfortably go to work and know that their children are in good stead.  We have many households that are headed by single-parent moms. We have  many households that have both members of the household, couples,  having full-time jobs.   It is a different economy. These are different times. We need to  adjust. We need to invest in America and into her people, and that is  what this measure is about.   I am also involved with the offshore wind industry. And making  certain that my district, hundreds of miles away from any offshore wind  project, is going to have many jobs because we are going to be building  foundations. We are going to be building tower components. We are going  to be building the ancillary pieces that are a part of it. We may be  building some of the turbine blades that are then installed in the  offshore capacity along the eastern network where everyone is going to  prosper from this. And we are going to clean the environment, which is  a demand of the generations behind us and those yet to be born.   They have the right to demand clean air; to have made clean the air  they breathe; and make safe the water they drink. It is a mission that  is justified, and we need to be part of that justification.    Will the gentleman yield?    Representative Cartwright mentioned, Madam Speaker, the  strength of manufacturing and growing our manufacturing jobs. The  pandemic alerted us to a supply chain crisis. The Build Back Better Act  speaks to addressing the shortages that we had for manufacturing.  Supply shortages. That is critical.   We also combined the efforts for manufacturing to be more profitable  and provide more jobs by addressing retrofitting manufacturing, so it  is energy-smarter as an outcome.   Now, we know we have a very robust plan, a goal that is very robust  by the year 2050 to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. If we are  going to achieve that, we have to reach to every sector of the economy  in order to attain those goals; so we need to look to manufacturing.   Retrofitting manufacturing, making certain it is energy-smart, making  certain it can compete in a global marketplace with all the tools at  their fingertips is an important standard that is established in the  Build Back Better Act.   So the President says we are at an inflection point. I couldn't agree  more. We are now in a focus mode where we are going to determine the  best outcomes by combining legislation and resources that will speak to  the most forceful, sharpest competitive edge for our business  community, for our manufacturing base to address our supply chain, to  hold down energy costs, reduce costs, reduce the tax burden on  households, and provide a vision that will get us to where we need to  be.   It is about time that we had this sort of leadership; not just  reducing programs, cutting down government, not seeing the  effectiveness of sound government. Now we have a leader who understands  the public-private partnership--business working with government--to  address the needs of those businesses, their workers, worker training,  and having the resources to be robustly competitive so that we grow a  more fair, more just, more robust, and a more sustainable economy. It  is a powerful opportunity.                                time  1930     Madam Speaker, I will also cite the fact that some of the  greatest looking institutional buildings in our districts are from the  FDR era: libraries that speak significantly to the cityscapes,  institutional settings, schools that really laid out an  [[Page H6116]]  image of importance to children of how great education is. We have been  taught by generations before us that there should be a commitment to  people across this country, especially children, to invest in our  tomorrows.   How dare we just pass by and cut everything and not help build?   We are hurting ourselves by not investing in those resources that  will get us to a stronger economy, research money that will be part of  the $555 billion that is part of the investment in climate change, the  response to climate change. It is much stronger than that, but there in  the Build Back Better Act is the opportunity to advance that effort.   Now, that will include a number of jobs in the trades, installing a  lot of the renewable energy and innovative concepts, retrofitting  manufacturing and the like. But then there are going to be the white  collar jobs as engineers and planners go to work on investing in the  newness of discovery. That will come with many people working in labs  and research centers who will get us to a stronger outcome.   Where there is no vision, the people shall perish. We learn that when  we open our Book. That should speak to us. It is important for us to  have a boldness of vision that will take an investment but certainly  render lucrative dividends for the people in this moment and those  generations that will follow us.    Let them look 100 years from now at this moment and say they got it;  they invested; they received great assets from those before them; and  they saw that they had to do likewise and contribute to the tomorrows  that that group will enjoy 100 years out and beyond.   This is our moment to really shine.   The gentleman talked about the fact that this effort is paid for.  That is a good balance that we bring into the House. We tell people  that we balanced it so that there is a payment mechanism for all that  we choose to do. That was not the case with the huge tax cut of 2016.  They expected a trickle-down and that it would pay for itself.   What did we see happening to the deficit? It bloated from that tax  cut.   Then, Madam Speaker, you will hear debate on this floor about raising  the debt ceiling so that America can pay her bills. What was their  message? They want this money so they can spend more.   No, we are paying the dollars off that you incurred as bills when you  were President and you were the Republican leadership in this House.  That is paying for bills that came from the last several years. This  payment mechanism will make certain we go forward with an investment in  America that is paid for and that will reach the great many of us, the  great middle-income community.   The strength of America lies in her middle class, and the strength of  the middle class lies in union jobs, which is part of this package.  Thanks to our partners in unionized labor, union labor, they have  worked with us to develop a blueprint for a sounder tomorrow.   Let's get aboard. Let's get this done. Let's go forward and show  people that America is strong and that she is at her best when she  embraces that pioneer spirit that I saw when I mentioned the Erie  Canal. There has always been that pioneer spirit within us. It is part  of our DNA.   How dare we deny it as we come together in this crucial moment where  we are asked to come up with a response to a global economy, where it  is not the U.S. running the entire economy of the world, where we have  to compete and compete effectively, and where we give the people of  this country the dignity of work where they can earn a great and fair  check so they can support their families, pay for the roof over their  head, set some money aside, and enable their children to enjoy that  future set-aside?   That is what this is about. This is speaking to America, her  families, and those in need. It will result in a stronger and healthier  workforce and one that has a sense of hope. If we can deliver the  commodity of hope to the doorsteps of Americans, we will have achieved.   So, Madam Speaker, I thank President Biden; I thank the leadership in  the House; and I thank Representative Cartwright for leading us this  evening in this great discussion.
