 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the  bipartisan, bicameral EMPOWER Act.   The goal of this consequential legislation is simple: create safe  workplaces and a society where everyone can thrive.   We all have the right to work in a safe environment, but over the  past months we have heard stories of individuals from all walks of  life. We have seen how widespread harassment is, and the culture of  silence. In fact, according to the EEOC, it is estimated that 90  percent of harassment incidents never get reported. That is why we need  this bill.   The EMPOWER Act outlines what sexual harassment is, creates systems  that foster accountability, and removes the fear of retaliation that  keeps so many victims from coming forward. By removing that fear of  reporting, eradicating deceptive nondisclosure agreements, and  increasing transparency, we are taking meaningful steps to make our  workplaces harassment-free and creating a culture of respect throughout  society.   From Harvey Weinstein to factory floors to Time's Up and the #MeToo  movement, we are going from a moment to a movement to action. I ask  that my colleagues join me in supporting this bill.                            ____________________
