 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen marine  from my congressional district. Our Nation relies upon young men and  women voluntarily stepping forward to defend and protect the liberties  we hold so dear. As a young man growing up in Norco, California, Lance  Corporal Kareem Nikoui was inspired to answer that call.   When he joined the Marine Corps, Kareem was following in the  footsteps of patriots. Like his fellow marines, he was not signing up  for glory or reward but out of a sense of duty.   In his final days, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui was on the front  lines of a mission to secure freedom for desperate people. Kareem and  our other fallen heroes conducted themselves with bravery and  compassion. In those dark days, they shined bright.   Our community in Riverside County, California, has stepped up to  support and embrace the Nikoui family as they grieve this unimaginable  loss. We should honor Kareem by carrying the torch of service, duty,  and sacrifice he so proudly advanced until his final breath.   May God comfort the Nikoui family, and may God bless America.                            ____________________
