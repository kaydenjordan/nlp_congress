 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a critical  step towards ensuring a country where Black people are treated as equal  citizens, not just in theory, but in real life. This bill weaves into  our laws the truism that Black Lives Matter. This bill will help build  trust between law enforcement and the communities that they are sworn  to protect and serve.   ``Equal Justice Under the Law'' may be etched atop the entrance to  this Nation's highest court, but it is not a privilege enjoyed by each  of us. We must act now to ensure that we protect the humanity of every  person. Stand up for the principle of equal justice for all.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  vote ``yes'' for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
