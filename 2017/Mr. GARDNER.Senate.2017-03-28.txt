 Mr. President, I understand there is a time agreement on  the recess before lunch.   I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to finish and complete my  remarks.    Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor again to  express my strong support for a very mainstream, well-qualified nominee  for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.   Last week, this country got to watch the Senate Judiciary Committee  carry out days of hearings that questioned and probed Judge Gorsuch's  legal approach, that questioned his temperament to the bench, his  suitability to be on our Nation's High Court. I believe every member of  the Senate Judiciary Committee had at least an hour to question Judge  Gorsuch, to provide lengthy opening statements, to have an extended  period of time to have a back-and-forth with Judge Gorsuch in order to  go over his judicial philosophy--his approach--that he would take with  him from the Tenth Circuit Court to the Nation's High Court.   A number of interest groups and personal witnesses were talking about  whether or not they believe Judge Gorsuch is qualified for the bench,  and some were highly favorable and spoke very highly of him, and others  opposed his confirmation. That is what is great about this country--to  be able to come before our Congress, our government, and to testify for  or against somebody who will be in that third important branch of  government, the judicial branch. It is incredibly inspiring to watch  this process unfold. There were student groups around the country,  classes and teachers, who were watching the confirmation hearing as a  project, as an educational experience, as a lesson in civics,  democracy, and government.   I mentioned, of course, that Judge Gorsuch is a judge on the Tenth  Circuit Court today. He is a fourth generation Coloradan. He was  confirmed to that position in 2006, 11 years ago, unanimously. He was  confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court 11 years ago unanimously. Based on  some of the comments we have heard opposing Judge Gorsuch, it is hard  to believe that anybody would have supported him unanimously 11 years  ago--based on the things we have heard from the other side of the aisle  about him. Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by 12 current  Democratic Senators who did not oppose his confirmation 11 years ago  and who serve in this body today.   Twelve Democratic Senators serve in this Chamber today who agreed  with his confirmation or didn't oppose his confirmation 11 years ago.  In fact, not a single Democrat opposed his nomination--not a single  one, and his nomination was unanimous--not Minority Leader Schumer, not  Senator Leahy, not Senator Feinstein, not Senator Durbin, not Senator  Cantwell, not Senator Carper, not Senator Menendez, not Senator Murray,  not Senator Nelson, not Senator Reid, not Senator Stabenow, and not  Senator Wyden. Judge Gorsuch's nomination also was not opposed by then- Senator Barack Obama. It was not opposed by then-Senator Joe Biden, and  it was not opposed by then-Senator Hillary Clinton.   This level of support for the other party's nomination is almost  unheard of in today's political climate. But now, these very same  colleagues are vowing to break 230 years of Senate tradition, to  dispense with 230 years of precedent, and to join a partisan filibuster  of a nominee who has the right judicial temperament and holds  mainstream views that are supported by the Constitution.   Throughout the confirmation hearing process, we heard Judge Gorsuch  talk about the over 2,000 opinions that he was a part of--2,700  decisions that he was a part of--and I believe he testified before the  committee that he joined in the majority in 97 percent of those  opinions. That is somebody who sounds to me like the person who could  have received the unanimous support of the Senate--who did receive the  unanimous support of the Senate, including colleagues who serve with us  today.   But, unfortunately, across the aisle, we still haven't heard a reason  articulated--a compelling rationale--for why this supremely qualified  nominee should be opposed. Sometimes they will reference a letter from  a law student at the University of Colorado, or perhaps they will find  one case out of the 2,700 cases that tugs at the heartstrings but not  at the law and try to hang their hat on that decision as to why they  should oppose Judge Gorsuch. To use a baseball analogy, it is a little  bit like a batting average. You would think that a professional  baseball player that had a 400 batting average was a pretty doggone  good baseball player, but that would mean they missed the ball a heck  of a lot much of the time. It seems to me the argument they are making  with Judge Gorsuch is that unless he had a perfect batting average and  never missed a single pitch and had a hit every single time--that is  the standard, apparently, that our colleagues are looking for. It is a  standard that no one has ever met in this country before.   We are looking for mainstream judges with the right temperament and  the right philosophy, and that is what Judge Gorsuch has proven time  and again in the Tenth Circuit Court--that temperament that we need on  the highest Court.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle should abandon their  threats of a filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote to occur for Judge  Gorsuch. It is what Senate tradition and precedent requires.   Today, though, I thought it important to talk about Judge Gorsuch's  exceptionally strong record on religious liberty. Judge Gorsuch is  perhaps widely known for his participation in the Tenth Circuit's Hobby  Lobby case, a decision which involved the protections afforded by the  Religious Freedom and Restoration Act and which was ultimately affirmed  by the Supreme Court. In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch made a number  of telling pronouncements regarding religious liberty. Regarding the  case, he wrote that the law in question requires the owners of Hobby  Lobby to ``violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an  impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to  be gravely wrong.''   Let me say that again. In Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch wrote that the  law requires the owners of Hobby Lobby to ``violate their religious  faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to  conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.''   In determining which religious beliefs are entitled to protection,  Judge Gorsuch said it doesn't matter if the beliefs are contestable or  even offensive. It only matters if they are sincerely held--if they are  sincerely held.   He went on to stress that ``it is not the place of courts of law to  question the correctness or the consistency of tenets of religious  faith, only to protect the exercise of faith.''   It is these same constitutional principles of religious liberty that  Judge Gorsuch has also used to protect religious minorities and prison  inmates.   In Yellowbear v. Lampert, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a Native American  prisoner was entitled to the use of a prison sweat lodge under Federal  law.  [[Page S2032]]    Judge Gorsuch went on to stress that while prisoners give up many  liberties, the freedom to sincerely express their religion is not one  of them. His reasoning was later adopted by the Supreme Court to extend  similar religious liberty protections to a Muslim prisoner. Judge  Sotomayor even quoted the opinion of Judge Gorsuch in her concurrence  in that case.   From his opinions, it is clear that Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream  nominee who understands the importance of putting personal beliefs  aside and applying the law as written. This is why George Washington  University Law School professor Jonathan Turley argued that Judge  Gorsuch shouldn't be penalized for his past opinions. As he said, ``the  jurisprudence reflect, not surprisingly, a jurist who crafts his  decisions very close to the text of a statute and, in my view, that is  no vice for a federal judge.''   It is for the reasons I have cited today and for the reasons we have  seen over the past week that I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make  Colorado proud and that his decisions will have a positive impact on  the Supreme Court and this country for generations to come.   I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination and to make  sure that we uphold the best traditions and the precedent of this  Senate.   Mr. President, thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
