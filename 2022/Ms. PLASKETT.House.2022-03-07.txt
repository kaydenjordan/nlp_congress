 Madam Speaker, the nation of Ukraine is dealing with an  alarming crisis, a war. I have been overwhelmed by the number of images  and stories of families trying to escape the terrors and war crimes  being unjustly committed against the people of this country. Since  February 24, more than 870,000--now we understand more than 1 million-- Ukrainians have fled the country.   However, within that exodus are disturbing reports of mistreatment of  Black families, Africans, and Asians as they try to evacuate a deadly  war zone. This is unacceptable.   My office has been working with other members of the Congressional  Black Caucus--Chairman  Greg Meeks of the Foreign Affairs Committee and  Barbara Lee of the Appropriations Committee--to determine the veracity,  the specifics, and the extent of the allegations.   While we stand with Ukraine and encourage America's commitment to the  Ukrainian Government, any engagement of the United States and American  dollars appropriated to humanitarian efforts or lethal weapons must  guarantee that all refugees, all fleeing, are treated equally. We will  not move from that position.                            ____________________
