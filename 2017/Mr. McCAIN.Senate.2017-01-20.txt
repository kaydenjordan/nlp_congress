 Madam President, I ask for 1 minute on the nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Arizona is recognized.    Madam President, I know it is unnecessary, but I urge an  ``aye'' vote on General Kelly. He is experienced. He is talented. He  understands borders. He understands the challenges we face for our  national security throughout the world. I strongly urge an ``aye'' vote  for General Kelly.
