 Madam President, I rise today to  commemorate the life and legacy of Dr. Malcolm Dorman.   I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Dorman for nearly four decades. He  was a dear friend, whose kindness and compassion was felt by all around  him. He loved his family and friends deeply  [[Page S2351]]  and would do anything for them. He was a man of great faith, served his  synagogue faithfully, and steadfastly supported many Jewish causes. In  1995 he was awarded the Man of the Year Award by Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, and in 2006, he was awarded the Distinguished  Guardian of Israel Award by Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister of the  State of Israel and Nobel Peace Prize Winner.   Dr. Dorman was a spectacular surgeon who saved many lives and exuded  compassion and love for his patients. For 25 years, he served as the  chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery and cochairman of  the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Miami Heart Institute.  He then moved to the JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, FL, where he was  the medical director of cardiac surgery and established and directed  the Valvular Heart Institute. Along with the countless patients he  helped heal, Dr. Dorman invested in the growth of students as a member  of the Florida Atlantic University Board of Trustees and FAU's Charles  E. Schmidt College of Medicine Advisory Board. He selflessly gave his  time and effort to serve others and help them grow into all that they  could be.   Ann and I are praying for all of Dr. Dorman's family, friends, and  loved ones. He exemplified what it means to love and to serve and was a  dependable friend I looked up to. We mourn this very heavy loss, but we  are blessed to have known Dr. Dorman and to call him a friend.                            ____________________
