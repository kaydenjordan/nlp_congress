 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 835,  the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act.   H.R. 835 would expand the eligibility criteria for an accredited  investor for purposes of participating in private offerings of  securities to include an individual determined by the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) to have qualifying professional knowledge  through educational or professional experience.   The current definition of an accredited investor relies on a net  worth threshold for individuals and households irrespective of the  sophistication of the would-be investors.   Traditionally, the accredited investor threshold has been determined  through asset and income tests, resulting in both an under- and  overinclusive definition that leaves out sophisticated investors who  may not meet financial thresholds while including a wealthy person with  no experience in financial markets.   Excluding these individuals unfairly limits Americans' participation  in capital markets.   This bill would increase the total number of Americans eligible to  purchase restricted securities.   H.R. 835 would amend the Securities Act of 1933 to codify certain  qualifications of individuals as accredited investors for the purposes  of the securities laws.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1579,  the Accredited Investor Definition Review Act of 2023.   This bill revises who may be considered an accredited investor for  purposes of participating in private offerings of securities.   Certain unregistered securities may only be offered to accredited  investors.   Specifically, the bill allows the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) discretion in determining what certifications, designations, or  credentials investors must possess for purposes of investor protection,  provided that the credentials are at least as broad as the existing  regulations.   Additionally, the SEC must review these credentials every five years.   This bill amends the definition of investor in the Securities Act of  1933 by adding the following language:   ``(C) an individual holding such certifications, designations, or  credentials as the Commission determines necessary or appropriate in  the public interest or for the protection of investors, where such list  of certifications, designations, or credentials shall be no less broad  than those certifications, designations, or credentials described in  the amendments made to section 230.501 of title 17, Code of Federal  Regulations, by the final rule of the Commission titled `Accredited  Investor Definition' (85 Fed. Reg. 64234; published October 9, 2020).''   This amendment will give small business startups and everyday  citizens in Houston and around the U.S. the opportunity to participate  in the growth and success of our economy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2593,  the Senior Security Act of 2023.   This bill establishes the Senior Investor Taskforce within the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   The taskforce must report on topics relating to investors over the  age of 65, including industry trends and serious issues impacting such  investors, and make recommendations for legislative or regulatory  actions to address problems encountered by senior investors.   The Government Accountability Office must report on the financial  exploitation of senior citizens.   The proposed taskforce would do the following:   A) identify challenges that senior investors encounter, including  problems associated with financial exploitation and cognitive decline;   B) identify areas in which senior investors would benefit from  changes in the regulations of the Commission or the rules of self- regulatory organizations;   C) coordinate, as appropriate, with other offices within the  Commission, other taskforces that may be established within the  Commission, self-regulatory organizations, and the Elder Justice  Coordinating Council; and   D) consult, as appropriate, with State securities and law enforcement  authorities, State insurance regulators, and other Federal agencies.   The Government Accountability Office Study will observe the economic  costs, frequency, and policy responses of the financial exploitation of  senior citizens.   The Taskforce and the study that it will conduct is important because  it will help prevent the financial exploitation of senior citizens.   The Taskforce and its study could also inspire legislation to prevent  the financial exploitation of senior citizens.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 2608, a  bill to amend the Federal securities laws to specify the periods for  which financial statements are required to be provided by an emerging  growth company, and for other purposes.   H.R. 2608 would change the reporting period for financial statements  submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an  emerging growth company (EGC) or former EGC when it acquires another  company.   The bill would ensure that EGCs and former EGCs submit financial  statements for their target companies that cover a reporting period  that does not exceed the earliest audited period for the EGC or former  EGC, as presented in connection with an initial public offering.   Under current law, when reporting to the SEC, acquiring companies  (including EGCs) must submit up to two years of financial statements  for their target companies.   H.R. 2608 is a measure that will limit the financial information an  emerging growth company must submit to the Securities and Exchange  Commission.   Specifically, an emerging growth company is not required to present a  financial statement for any period prior to the earliest audited period  of the emerging growth company in connection with its initial public  offering, such as a statement for an acquired company.   This bill is being amended to clarify and specify language in the  original text.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2610,  which amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   This amendment specifies certain registration statement contents for  emerging growth companies.   Additionally, the amendment permits issuers to file draft  registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for  confidential review prior to a public filing.   Further, emerging growth companies will only be required to submit  profit and loss statements from the previous two years in registration  statements submitted to the SEC, rather than the previous three years  currently required by law.   This bill facilitates greater efficiency and capital formation  without sacrificing investor protection.   In my home state of Texas, the Houston area leads the Nation in small  business development and is one of the top emerging ecosystems for  startups globally.   More broadly, Texas remains the top destination in the Nation for new  companies.   Under this bill, emerging companies across Texas, the City of  Houston, and the Nation will better be able to explore their options  for future growth, evaluate required disclosures, and thoughtfully  consider whether they will proceed with their public offering.   This bill will boost these businesses and enhance their ability to  catalyze economic growth and job creation nationwide.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2610 and the  economic growth of our Nation, which is fueled by these emerging growth  companies.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res.  43, Authorizing the Use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater  Washington Soap Box Derby.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association shall be permitted  to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races, on the Capitol  Grounds.   The event shall be held on June 17, 2023, or on another designated  date, whereby the sponsor shall assume full responsibility for all  expenses and liabilities associated with the event.   The event shall be free of admission charge and open to the public;  and arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.   The Soap Box Derby is a youth soapbox car racing program which has  been run in the United States since 1933.   It is also an event we support in my district by way of the Greater  Houston Soap Box Derby (GHSBD) which is an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3)  non-profit, Texas corporation organized for charitable and educational  purposes.   I support the expansion of this event and all those who are dedicated  to having a race program that is safe, fun, fair, professionally run,  and that reaches out to all youth.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2793,  the Encouraging Public Offerings Act of 2023.   This bill provides statutory authority for all issuers of securities  to use certain offering procedures that are available to emerging  growth companies.   Specifically, the bill allows under statute issuers of securities to  communicate with potential investors to ascertain interest in a  contemplated securities offering, either before or after the filing of  a registration statement (i.e., test the waters).   Additionally, issuers are allowed under statute to submit a  confidential draft registration statement to the Securities and  Exchange Commission for review prior to public filing or within one  year after the initial public offering or registration.   This bill strikes ``an emerging growth company or any person  authorized to act on behalf of an emerging growth company'' and inserts  ``an issuer or any person authorized to act on behalf of an issuer.''   This bill further adds the following additional requirements:   (A) In general--the Commission may promulgate regulations, subject to  public notice and comment, to impose such other terms, conditions, or  requirements on the engaging in oral or written communications  described under paragraph (1) by an issuer other than an emerging  growth company as the Commission determines appropriate.   (B) Report to Congress--Prior to any rulemaking described under  subparagraph (A), the Commission shall submit to Congress a report  containing a list of the findings supporting the basis of the  rulemaking.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost an  insignificant amount for the agency to justify any further rulemakings  to the Congress because the SEC already allows such practices under  current policy.   The Congressional Budget Office expects that the net effect on  discretionary spending over the 2023-2028 period would be negligible,  assuming appropriation actions consistent with that authority, because  the SEC is authorized to collect fees each year to offset its annual  appropriation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2812,  the Middle Market IPO Cost Act.   H.R. 2812 would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  study and report on the costs encountered by small- and medium-sized  companies when undertaking initial public offerings and certain  offerings exempt from securities registration requirements.   The report commissioned through this bill will provide information to  facilitate cost reduction for small and medium-size businesses when  they conduct an initial public offering and ``go public.''   This bill constitutes an important step toward protecting small and  mid-size businesses from the penalties they currently face under  historic fee structures and restrictions on IPO funding.   The Houston area leads the Nation in small business development and  is one of the top emerging ecosystems for startups globally.   In 2021, over 150,000 new-business applications were filed in the  Houston area.   This bill will boost these Houston businesses by making it easier for  them to grow and create jobs.   By going public, businesses in Houston and beyond will be able to  give American families the opportunity to invest directly in their  businesses and build wealth for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I stand for American families. I stand for economic  growth and small businesses. This bill will equip Congress to better  [[Page H2731]]  understand and address the burdens and costs of conducting an initial  public offering.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and in  working to ensure accessible economic opportunities for all.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in  the Congressional Black Caucus to honor Caribbean American Heritage  Month and to express my appreciation to the multiples of talent in the  Caribbean-American community.   Over the last decade, there have been approximately 4.5 million  members of the Caribbean-American community. Of course, two of those  who I am most proud of are my late grandmother and grandfather, Mr. and  Mrs. Jackson, who migrated from Jamaica, West Indies.   My grandfather worked on the Panama Canal. What an emotional  experience to go to the Panama Canal and see his name, Alfred Jackson,  listed with those who have worked on the canal.   I also had the privilege of attending the funeral of one of Jamaica's  iconic Prime Ministers, Prime Minister Manley, who is beloved around  the nation.   Let me salute the Caribbean-American community in Houston, Texas,  rich and inviting with their wonderful culture, cuisine, and, yes, the  brilliance that they serve in public service, medicine, education,  and business.    This is a great moment to be able to celebrate the richness of our  diversity in this country. I can assure you, we have often said that we  are a melting pot, but really, we are a mosaic. The pieces fit together  where all of us are distinguished but yet part of America--part of  America's democracy, part of America's work ethic, and part of  America's freedom.   I salute my Caribbean-American friends and kinship. God bless you.                            ____________________
