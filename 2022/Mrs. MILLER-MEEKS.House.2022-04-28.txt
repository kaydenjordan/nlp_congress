 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of a small business in Iowa's Second District.   Jefferson County Ciderworks of Fairfield recently won four awards at  the annual New York International Cider Competition. This competition  featured over 300 different ciders from around the world and was judged  by industry professionals.   Jefferson County Ciderworks finished the competition with four  medals, including being named the Iowa Cider Producer of the Year. Four  additional ciders were awarded medals in the modern, fruit, and spiced  cider categories.   I applaud Jefferson County Ciderworks for proudly representing Iowa  on the international stage and wish them the best in the Great Lakes  International Cider and Perry competition later this year.                            ____________________
