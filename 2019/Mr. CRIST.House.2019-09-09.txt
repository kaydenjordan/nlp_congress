 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to applaud the heroic work of  the United States Coast Guard in response to the historic Category 5  Hurricane Dorian.   The Coast Guard motto is ``Always Ready,'' and they have shown that  in the wake of this disaster. By strategically positioning personnel,  aircraft, and cutters ahead of the storm, they were able to respond  quickly and save lives. In fact, in total, the Coast Guard first  responders rescued over 200 people in Dorian's wake.   Back home in Pinellas County, Florida, I had the opportunity to visit  the first responder crews from Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater after  they returned home. We could not be prouder of their dedication as well  as their service.   Again, I thank the brave folks of the United States Coast Guard for  always being ready to keep America--and our neighbors--safe and secure.                            ____________________
