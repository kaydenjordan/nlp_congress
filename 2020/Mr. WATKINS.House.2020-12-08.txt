 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kansas Middle School  wrestling coach Nick Gieber. To be clear, he is not dead. He is way too  tough for that.   For decades, Coach Gieber would transform boys into men through  wrestling practices that were so hard we thought that death was an  option. But it wasn't just developing us mentally and physically, he  also developed a sense of camaraderie, rapport, integrity, and honor.  He would say, ``You never know, boys. Today could be the most beautiful  day in the world.''   Coach Gieber, from the floor of the United States House of  Representatives, thank you. And you never know, today could be the most  beautiful day in the world.                            ____________________
