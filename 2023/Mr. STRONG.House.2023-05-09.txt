 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th  anniversary of the U.S.-Israel alliance.   This historic partnership has been a critical driving force behind  the promotion of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East.   It is a partnership based on shared values and strategic interests.  As we take a moment to commemorate this milestone, I draw attention to  the unique relationship between Israel and my home State of Alabama.   Alabama was one of the first States to recognize the state of Israel  back in 1948 and, in 1997, presented a formal memorandum of intent to  promote trade and technology transfer.                                time  2140    Today, Israel is Alabama's 23rd largest export market, with  significant collaboration on a number of projects, including missile  defense and cybersecurity.   More than half of the U.S. military's foreign weapon sales are  managed through the Missile Defense Agency at Redstone Arsenal.  Redstone is also proud to lead four joint U.S.-Israeli programs at MDA,  including David's Sling and the Iron Dome.   Today, let us reaffirm our commitment to the U.S.-Israel alliance and  continue to work together to build a brighter future for both of our  nations.
