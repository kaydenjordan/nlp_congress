 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, after years of  struggling to get ahead, America is finally better off. America is  stronger at home and abroad, with a booming economy, safer communities,  and a revived military.   Thanks to the historic tax reform, unemployment is at an all-time  low; job openings are at record highs; paychecks are increasing; wages  are rising; and small businesses are expanding. I hear it from people  in Florida all the time: My constituents are better off.   Mr. Speaker, I represent Florida's Fourth Congressional District,  which is home to many military families; and I am proud to say that we  have begun to rebuild our military and support our men and women in  uniform. We have passed legislation giving our troops the largest pay  increase in almost 9 years, and investing $144 billion in upgrading and  maintaining our military facilities. Our military men and women are  better off.   The work that we have done and continue to do is creating a better  way for the people of northeast Florida and for all Americans. Although  there is much more to do, the economy is soaring, and Republican  policies are helping to improve people's lives, making it easier for  families to get ahead with a renewed sense of confidence.                            ____________________
