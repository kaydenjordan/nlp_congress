 Mr. Speaker, each year in the month of March, our Nation  takes time to celebrate Women's History Month and to recognize the  important role women have played in our personal, local, national, and  world history.   We have made progress elevating women throughout our society, but it  is not enough. There is still more work to be done here at home and  around the world.   Women play a critical role in the history of every American.   As the son of a single mother who worked multiple jobs while putting  herself through night school, I owe everything I am to this strong,  independent, American woman. She and millions of other women like her  blazed the trail for me, for today's young women, and, particularly,  for my 15-year-old daughter, Anderson.   I am proud to be raising a young woman at a time where we have seen  tremendous gains for women in our Nation.   I am proud to serve alongside a historic 102 women here in this  Congress, the 116th Congress, including trailblazers like Martha  McSally, the first female fighter pilot in Congress, and numerous other  Republican colleagues in the House who were the first women to  represent their districts: Representatives like Liz Cheney and Elise  Stefanik, who are working diligently to ensure more female candidates  have the resources they need to compete in our election system, and  countless others who inspire me.   As these national role models continue to be important, it is also  critical to recognize the important role local heroes and local women  have in our communities and our Nation, including many from my own  district in Florida. That is why each week this month I will be  honoring local women who have had or are having an important impact in  our community, women like:   Alice Scott Abbott, a Flagler County resident of the early 1900s who  worked with the national women's suffrage movement and, following the  ratification of the 19th Amendment, fervently employed her fellow  Flagler County women to register and participate in the 1920 November  election;   Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, who founded the Volusia County School that  would later become Bethune-Cookman University. She was a national  leader on issues related to civil rights, to education, to women and  young people until her death in 1955.   Mr. Speaker, as these local heroes exemplify, women and their  contributions are critical to our success as a nation, but I also  believe their strength is an essential part of our national security.   As a Green Beret who operated all over the world, I know firsthand  where women thrive in business, where they thrive in civil society, in  politics, and in government, extremism does not. Where women thrive,  extremism fails.   As an Afghan elder once told me during one of my combat tours, he  shared with me his secret weapon in defeating the Taliban. It wasn't a  weapon or a missile or some type of other secret device. It was his  teenage daughters, whom he had sent to India to be educated. He looked  at me and said: This is our secret weapon to defeat extremism.   And I will quote for you, Mr. Speaker, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning  young girl who was shot in the face for attending school, Malala  Yousafzai. She said: ``Extremists have shown what frightens them most:  a girl with a book.''   So this Women's History Month must serve as a reminder that as a  nation we have a responsibility to empower women who participate in  every aspect of our society--not only for the betterment of America,  but also as an example for the world.   So thank you to the women of my district, our Nation, and the world  who worked to make their communities a better place for us all.                              Daytona Bike Week     Mr. Speaker, This week is Daytona Bike Week, where my  district welcomes nearly 300,000 avid motorcyclists for our community's  78th annual celebration of liberty, freedom, and two-wheeled, motorized  muscle. No other event comes close to matching our combination of  bikes, Florida beaches, sun, and fun.   It all started in January 1937, on a 3.2-mile race course running  along the world's most famous beach--Daytona Beach. Riders first headed  south on the paved roadway of Route A1A, turned left onto the beach,  then raced north on the sand until turning back onto the pavement at a  spot now marked by a favorite local restaurant named Racing's North  Turn. Then, the riders did it again and again and again for 200 miles.   This was the birth of the famed Daytona 200 motorcycle race and the  Bike Week that now surrounds it. Since then, only World War II has  interrupted these annual festivities. Today, the Daytona 200 headlines  Bike Week as a spectacular finale in the famed Daytona International  Speedway.    Don't miss the week's other high-adrenaline racing, too. The American  Flat Track series opens its season this week, and the Daytona  Supercross is back again, bigger and better than ever.   If you are unsure of where to start, try the brand-new official Bike  Week Welcome Center, located in One Daytona.
