 Mr. Speaker, as we stand here today, 33 days into the  longest shutdown in our history, hundreds of thousands of Federal  employees are being forced to work on our Nation's behalf without pay.   We are all able to confidently shop for groceries and eat in  restaurants because FDA food inspectors are on the job. We are able to  pass through airport security and fly across the Nation because TSA  agents and air traffic controllers continue to do their jobs. We can  all sleep soundly at night knowing our shores are protected because the  men and women wearing the uniform of the Coast Guard remain resolutely  at their posts, on the job.   The list goes on and on, and all of these Federal workers, these  Americans, are working without pay.   Mr. Speaker, this situation is unconscionable. It is unjust. It is  immoral.   This past weekend, Jason, an 8-year-old boy from my district,  presented me an impassioned letter, remarkable for its wisdom. He  writes: ``Dear Mr. President. . . . All of us work hard for our money.  . . . I hope you see my point of view and end this shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask the President to listen to Jason and the majority  of the American people. End this shutdown and pay the American workers  who every day keep our Nation safe, secure, and strong.                            ____________________
