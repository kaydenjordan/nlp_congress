 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in opposition to the default  on America act. House Republicans' debt default bill before us here  today holds the economy hostage in exchange for slashing investment in  American families to the tune of $4.5 trillion in cuts.   The debt ceiling extension has happened 78 times, Mr. Speaker; 49  times under Republican administrations. This is not new. This is an  artificial crisis, which can create catastrophic economic conditions  across the world. Not just the United States economy, but the world  economy can be affected.   Police officers on the street will be cut through the Department of  Justice. Veteran benefits will be cut. Working moms will no longer have  daycare. That is what this accomplishes, this default on America act.   I stand in opposition, Mr. Speaker, and I ask my colleagues to do the  same.
