 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the war on women  is escalating and more dangerous with H.J. Res. 43.   Let's not beat around the bush. Let's call this joint resolution what  it really is. It is a backdoor attempt to restrict access to a woman's  constitutional right to an abortion.   We all know that Federal funding for abortion is already prohibited,  but this goes further--much further. It cuts off funding for  contraception, screenings, and treatment if a provider also offers  abortions paid for with private funds.   Providers either stop doing abortions or they lose the Federal funds  they need to keep their doors open to serve their communities. In other  words, the supporters of this resolution are willing to sacrifice  women's access to basic healthcare services in order to stamp out  abortion. It is cruel, it is wrong, and I would say it is  discriminatory. When is the last time this body was called upon to cut  off access to basic health care for men?   Vote ``no.''
