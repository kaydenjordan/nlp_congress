 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor this  afternoon to talk about a young man named Enes Kanter, who plays  basketball for my hometown Portland Trail Blazers.   I wish I could be here to run through Saturday's box score or preview  tonight's match up against the Clippers, but, unfortunately, Mr. Kanter  is facing dangers that are far more serious than the outcome of any  basketball game. His family is now facing those dangers as well.   Mr. Kanter is from Turkey. His love of basketball brought him to the  United States in 2009, and he was selected third overall in the 2011  NBA draft by the Utah Jazz. Enes is a bright, intelligent, and soft- spoken guy. He pays attention to what goes on back home in Turkey; he  cares deeply about his country's future; and he rightfully believes  that he ought to be able to express his opinion as he sees it on these  important issues. For that, Turkey's President Erdogan has labeled Enes  Kanter a terrorist.   President Erdogan and his cronies are too thin-skinned to tolerate  Enes Kanter's eloquence and inspirational dissent off the  court. Erdogan revoked Mr. Kanter's passport based on accusations that  lacked any real proof. President Erdogan has demanded that INTERPOL  issue a red notice on Mr. Kanter, which means he has to stay in the  United States whenever his team travels outside the country. It has  kept Mr. Kanter from going to London and going to Toronto.    As Mr. Kanter himself wrote in a recent Washington Post opinion  article, ``I am definitely a target, and Erdogan wants me back in  Turkey where he can silence me.''   Following strategies right out of ``The Dictator's Playbook,''  Erdogan has responded like a coward to Mr. Kanter's criticism and has  tried to silence him by threatening his family--his family who still  lives in Turkey.   Mr. Kanter recently told reporters that his father would be going on  trial this week, in just a few days, in Turkey. The details of that  trial are shrouded in the fog of secrecy--where authoritarians thrive.  Yet Mr. Kanter's powerful words cut cleanly through that fog just a few  days ago. When asked what his father was on trial for, Enes said for  ``just being my dad.''   Enes is a young man who has already sacrificed so much. As a  teenager, he moved thousands of miles away from home to pursue his  dream of playing in the NBA. For the crime of just voicing his opinions  on the future of Turkey--a nation that is supposedly an American ally-- Enes was labeled a terrorist. Years ago, he cut off contact with his  family because he believed Erdogan would punish them for speaking with  someone who was critical of Erdogan's government. Now, without being  able to contact them, Enes has to live in constant fear of what is  going to happen to his loved ones back home.   So, as I stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I want to make sure  there isn't any confusion on two important topics.   First, Mr. Erdogan, the world is watching how you treat Enes Kanter's  father this week and in the weeks ahead. Mr. Erdogan, the world is  watching how you treat Mr. Kanter both when he is on American soil and  when Enes travels abroad.   Second, the United States cannot and must not stand idly by while  Enes and his family are subjected to this autocratic torment.   I have called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to raise Mr. Kanter's  case with his counterparts, and I have asked our Secretary of State to  state clearly that our country will actively resist these contrived red  notices or extradition requests. The fact is, our State Department  should be taking all of the necessary steps to ensure that Mr. Kanter  can travel safely with the Trail Blazers or to advocate for the freedom  of his people. Enes Kanter is a young man--an American resident--who is  exercising the right to free speech that is enshrined in our  Constitution. The United States must not stay silent in the face of  such a blatant attack on free thought and expression.   In my view, this is not exactly an isolated issue. It is certainly  not just a sports story. The situation ought to be examined in a  broader context--a government that is taking a supposed NATO ally down  an increasingly authoritarian road.   When the Saudis brazenly killed Washington Post columnist Jamal  Khashoggi in a consulate in Turkey, Erdogan styled himself a fierce  defender of journalists, but this is a classic situation of actions  speaking louder than words, for Erdogan jails more journalists than do  the Saudis. In fact, Erdogan jails more journalists than do the  Russians, the Chinese, and more than any other authoritarian regime  that is out there.   Erdogan does not only target journalists or independent media  outlets, all of whom knowingly, bravely risk such oppressive actions  when they just want to report the truth; Erdogan has thrown peaceful  demonstrators into  [[Page S1785]]  jail as well. Just last Friday, he cracked down on people who were  assembling peacefully in Istanbul for International Women's Day.   It gets worse--worse because Erdogan is brazen enough to push his  assaults on democratic norms right here on American soil. Less than 2  years ago, Erdogan gave the go-ahead for his security detail to  brutally attack nonviolent demonstrators right here in the Nation's  Capital. That assault, to emphasize the point, took place on American  soil--right here, just a short walk from the White House. Americans  ought to be outraged over this sort of behavior, especially from a  supposed friend and ally like Turkey.   It has not gone unnoticed that Erdogan recently doubled down on his  decision to make a major military purchase from Vladimir Putin's  Russia, and his use of fraudulent INTERPOL red notices is right out of  Vladimir Putin's playbook.   It is past time for the State Department to stand up to this  behavior. The State Department needs to call this behavior out. It is  not a far-off threat to other people the Federal Government can  conveniently ignore. Erdogan's abuses are happening right here in our  country, on American soil. People like Enes Kanter are the victims.   As a younger man back in the day, I went to school on a basketball  scholarship. I often tell people at my townhall meetings that I wanted  to play in the NBA--a ridiculous idea because I was too small, but I  made up for it by being quite slow. My abilities on the court were  certainly light years removed from Enes Kanter's, but I can tell you,  from playing in college, I certainly remember the value of a full-court  press. I am firmly committed and will state once more that our State  Department must put a full-court press on Turkey to treat Mr. Kanter-- and all of those who speak out against Erdogan's totalitarian regime-- with respect for their human rights and freedom of expression.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, just before they leave, I thank both  Senator Whitehouse and Senator Van Hollen for conveying the urgency  behind this climate change issue. Both of them have gone through the  specifics of what this is all about. Suffice it to say, I share many of  the concerns they have been discussing here this evening. I thank them.                            ____________________     Madam President, tonight, the Senate is debating another  Trump judicial nominee who is attempting to run away from appalling  statements they wrote in the not-so-distant past. This time, it is  Neomi Rao, who is up for a lifetime appointment to the powerful DC  Circuit Court of Appeals.   While studying at Yale, Ms. Rao wrote that sexual assault victims  were partly to blame for having been assaulted.   She ridiculed feminism and women's rights activists. She attacked  groups that promoted multiculturalism and minority rights. She  belittled those who fought for LGBTQ rights. She wrote that warnings  about what we now identify as climate change are, in effect, fake news.  And that's not all.  [[Page S1804]]    After these writings came to light, she stuck to the same script as  the other Trump nominees have done who found themselves in the same  position.   They say: It is all way in the past. I have grown up. I no longer  hold those views.   Except in Ms. Rao's case, she cannot plausibly claim the views she  put into writing back then would have no bearing on how she would  decide cases as a judge today. That is because you can see those  extreme views reflected in the work she is doing right now as the head  of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.   This is an office that doesn't get a lot of time in the spotlight,  but the individual in charge of that office has more power to shape  Federal rules than almost anyone outside the Oval Office.   During Ms. Rao's time as the head of this program, she has taken a  buzz saw to protections for women's health, for sexual assault victims  on college campuses, for LGBTQ Americans, and for Black and Latino  Americans.   Under her watch, the Trump administration has allowed polluting  corporations to poison Americans' air and water, propped up dirty  powerplants that belch carbon into the skies, and added to the extreme  dangers of climate change.   During her nomination hearing, she called--and this was her  description--some of what she wrote ``cringeworthy.'' She wrote a  letter to the Judiciary Committee saying she was sorry, and that's all  well and good, but it doesn't change the fact that she has helped turn  those same extreme views--those same extreme views--into Federal policy  under President Trump.   To help spell this out, as they say on so many television shows: Go  to the tape.   In the long essay titled ``The Feminist Dilemma'' published in the  mid-1990s, Ms. Rao laid out her views on a range of issues dealing with  women's rights and sexual violence. At the time, our country was waking  up to the fact that most sexual assaults are not random acts of  violence committed in dark alleyways; they are committed by someone the  victim knows.   The term ``date rape'' was relatively new to a lot of people. In this  essay she wrote: ``Although I am certainly not arguing that date rape  victims ask for it,'' she did exactly that--several times. She put the  burden on women to prevent their assaults.   She also described ``The dangerous feminist idealism which teaches  women that they are equal.'' That is an exact quote--``dangerous  idealism which teaches women that they are equal.''   She went on, ``Women believe falsely that they should be able to go  anywhere with anyone.'' That is a quote. ``Women believe falsely that  they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.''   Now, as I noted already, Ms. Rao has tried to separate herself during  her nomination from those thoughts--what she wrote as a younger  person--but she continues to double down on these views and their  influence in her current position.   A few years ago, there was an effort to strengthen Federal rules to  reduce sexual assaults on campus and compel schools to do a better job  of protecting women. With Ms. Rao's help, Education Secretary Betsy  DeVos and Donald Trump are now rolling those protections back.   Ms. Rao has also taken steps to roll back rules designed to fight  wage discrimination and sexual harassment against women in the  workplace. She worked to make it harder for women to get no-cost  contraception under the Affordable Care Act.   Now I am going to turn to her views on the rights of other groups.  LGBTQ Americans, Black, and Latino Americans are just several examples.   Here she has attacked so-called multiculturalists, writing:  ``Underneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to  undermine American culture.'' When you read that sentence, it seems  like she believed the American culture in need of protecting is  actually one of intolerance.   Now, she protested that ``homosexuals want to redefine marriage and  parenthood,'' to which I say: Anyone like Rao, who defines marriage and  parenthood by limiting the definition of love, is just wrong and,  frankly, un-American.   She even blasted African-American and Latino fraternities and  sororities, arguing they were the ones who didn't understand the true  meaning of Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech.   In a book review, she praised an author for writing:         Perhaps it is time to stop thinking of blacks--and having       them think of themselves--as a category. Let them rise or       fall as individuals.    A nominee for the Federal bench ought to be able to recognize that  the design of racism has been to have society and governments at all  levels in this country discriminate against African Americans as a  category and to prevent individuals and their families from rising from  this hardship.   Again, Ms. Rao can try and try and try some more to distance herself  from these writings, but she cannot distance herself from the work she  does right now in her current job.   Civil rights activists scored a major victory in a recent Supreme  Court case, Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The  Inclusive Communities Project. The case dealt with what have come to be  known as the ``disparate impact'' regulations. The Court held that  housing policies that inadvertently discriminate against minorities  violate the Fair Housing Act. That type of ``disparate impact''  regulation exists across Federal law. But right now, with Ms. Rao's  help, Donald Trump is working to undo these protections. Here I quote  from the Washington Post:         The Trump administration is considering a far-reaching       rollback of civil rights law that would dilute Federal rules       against discrimination in education, housing, and other       aspects of American life.    This article continues:         Past Republican administrations have done little to erode       the concept's application, partly out of concern that the       Supreme Court might disagree, or that such changes would be       unpopular and viewed as racist.    Apparently, that is not a big enough concern to stop Ms. Rao and the  Trump administration.   Now, briefly, I would like to look at her writings on climate and  environmental protection.   She mocked what she called the ``three major environmental bogeymen,  the greenhouse effect, the depleting ozone layer, and the dangers of  acid rain.''   In an extraordinary twist of logic, she suggested that people who  warned about climate change were clinging to a ``dangerous  orthodoxy''--her quote--``with no reference to the prevailing  scientific doubts.''   Her work at the Trump administration shows no change in perspective.   Fuel economy standards that reduce carbon emissions and save drivers  money at the pump have been axed by the Trump administration and Ms.  Rao. The Clean Power Plan--gone under with the Trump administration and  Neomi Rao. Rules cracking down on mercury pollution, which causes brain  damage to kids, weakened by the Trump administration and Ms. Rao. Rules  designed to protect workers from exposure to dangerous chemicals on the  job--rolled back again by Ms. Rao and the Trump administration. The  list can go on.   This nominee's record shows, in my view, that an apology is not  enough--even a written one--because the shocking and offensive views  she put into words in the past are reflected by her work in the  present.   It is all right here in her CV as a Trump official. She is  responsible for those policies that lead to more discrimination, that  are taking rights and protections away from women, Black Americans, and  Latino Americans.   She doesn't even have a long record of legal experience which she can  fall back on and cite qualifications. Her qualifications seem to be her  extreme views and membership in the far-right Federalist Society--a  well-funded outside group that the Trump administration has empowered  to fill the judiciary with extreme nominees from well outside the  mainstream.   Actions Ms. Rao has been green-lighting have been challenged in  court, and rulings against them have made clear that the Trump  administration is willing to break the law to get their preferred  ideological outcome.   For example, just last week, a Federal judge slammed Ms. Rao's  actions to undo efforts to crack down on wage discrimination. The judge  said Ms. Rao's decision was arbitrary, it was capricious, and  unsupported by any analysis.  [[Page S1805]]    Perhaps that is why, during her nomination hearing, she refused to  recuse herself from cases involving issues she worked on during the  Trump administration.   So here is my bottom line. The Senate has seen this before--Trump  nominees with extreme, offensive, and what are essentially incendiary  writings from the past. In Ms. Rao's case, there are current examples  of how she has not left those views in the past.   When it was Ryan Bounds nominated to the Ninth Circuit, this body-- the U.S. Senate--stood up and said no. Mr. Bounds' views were extreme.  More importantly, he knew it, and he hid them.   In my view, it is time to take a stand once more in the Senate, where  Ms. Rao's views are on display for all to see. I am going to be a no on  the nomination of Neomi Rao. I urge my colleagues to join me.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
