 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that Representative Chris  Smith is a Member of the United States Congress because of his  leadership, because of his enormous heart, and his enormous caring.   It is amazing--those of us who believe in God--the way our lives  develop. I was a guy that grew up; I never liked to hug anybody. But  when we had three beautiful incredible girls added to my wife's and my  life, I became a hugger. Fox has a show named ``Outnumbered,'' but that  has been my life for years now.   I know there are so many people that say you are a man and you have  no right to speak about this. I guess, when I was a judge, there were  those who thought, since I was not a person that had been on both sides  of a civil lawsuit or had been a defendant in a case, maybe I should  not be able to say anything about or pass sentence. But we have laws,  and laws are there to protect people.   I do believe, as our Founders did, in nature's God, that we have a  Creator who provided us inalienable rights. But in this world, you have  to fight for any inheritance, including your inalienable rights.   It does appear that nature gave a greater percentage of women a  nurturing greater sense of loving and caring than most men. That gets  changed for some of us when you have a house full of girls.                                time  1800    But I could identify with the doctor who had performed, I think he  said, over 1,000 abortions, who came before our Judiciary Committee and  testified about how it was just a procedure, how it was nothing to him,  and how he would go into the uterus.   Of course, the pregnant mom was not dilated and not going to be able  to deliver a baby that had begun forming, had a heartbeat. But that is  why he would go in with his instrument, feel around with his clamps for  something that felt long, and when he found it, he knew that it was  either a leg or an arm, and he would grab it and pull it out from the  baby's body, and continue till he did that four times, and then reach  in and find something that felt bulbous, and he would--he knew the head  could not come out in a bulbous form, and so he would crush it and pull  out the baby's head. And that was the way he went about beginning the  abortion of a child that had begun developing like that.   He never thought a thing about it until his daughter died, and then  he became nauseated, and he was never able to do another abortion like  that, and it became such a burden that he had done what he had done.   I know from my years on the bench as a judge, I know from my years as  an attorney helping people, if something is built on a lie, the chances  are that the outcome will not be good for a majority of people. I also  know that if someone encourages and perpetuates a lie within some other  person's life, they are not that person's friend.   So I would like to quickly reference an article published by WND  called ``The Real `Jane Roe' '' and just hit some of the highlights  about the real Jane Roe, the woman.   I was talking with my friend, Chris Smith, about Norma McCorvey. He  is quite familiar with her, and I believe he said he had talked to her  and had come to know her. Being the Christian that Chris Smith is, he  cares deeply about people, and that included Norma McCorvey.   But this article says: ``At the age of 21, McCorvey was pregnant with  her third child. She had given her other two children up for adoption  and McCorvey did not want to say good-bye to her offspring a third  time. So she decided to have an illegal abortion, but the Dallas clinic  she went to had been recently raided and shut down. So McCorvey made up  a story--she had been raped, she told her doctor and two lawyers. She  signed an affidavit on condition of anonymity, and the lawsuit began.''   And she told WorldNetDaily: `` `I considered abortion and, because of  this, I was put in touch with two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda  Coffee. They had just recently graduated from law school and were  interested in challenging the Texas abortion statute.' ''   She says: `` `Plain and simple, I was used.' '' This is Norma  McCorvey. `` `I was a nobody to them. They only needed a pregnant woman  to use for their case, and that's it. They cared, not about me, but  only about legalizing abortion. Even after the case, I was never  respected--probably because I was not an ivy-league educated, liberal  feminist like they were.' ''   But she goes on and says--well, this was from a New York Times  interview: ``McCorvey describes her meeting the two young attorneys. .  . .   `` `Sarah Weddington sat right across the table from me at Columbo's  pizza parlor, and I didn't know then that she had had an abortion  herself. When I told her then how desperately I needed one, she could  have told me where to go for it. But she wouldn't because she needed me  to be pregnant for her case. I set Sarah Weddington up on a pedestal  like a rose petal. But when it came to my turn, well, Sarah saw these  cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person  sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy. She knew I  wouldn't go outside of the realm of her and Linda. I was too scared. It  was one of the most hideous times of my life.' ''   She says: `` `My experience with pro-abortion leaders is that they  are snobs. They claim they care about women and their rights but, in my  experience, they care for nothing, not even themselves in a way,' ''  McCorvey said.   ``McCorvey said in a 1990 New York Times interview that the rape lie  caused her to be `terribly depressed.' ''   `` `I was brought up not to lie and, because of this story, I had to  lie all the time. And the depression periods got deeper and longer  until the night I cut my wrists.' ''   Well, it is one of the difficulties that attorneys have: when you  represent someone and you are sworn to do the best job you can, it  should be more than simply about getting the legal result that a lawyer  wants. It ought to be about helping the client. You can't always do  that.   But it is rather tragic that Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, now looks back  on that as the most hideous time of her life, and that she was taken  advantage of by people that didn't care about her. They had an agenda.   I heard someone here on the floor talking about the Women's March and  how that was for all women, except the hypocrisy of that march was it  was not about all women because there were pro-life women that tried to  march. It was about women that think exactly like they do, and nobody  else gets to participate.   It is the same kind of mentality that would--when in the majority  here in this body say: We want everybody to participate in debate,  except we are  [[Page H672]]  going to have a record-setting number of closed rules so nobody can  debate. We don't want your input on ObamaCare. We don't care that you  support what we do on preexisting conditions and on kids living with  their parents.   Heck, some of us said 30 would be a better number than 26. They  didn't care. They could pass it without our votes. They didn't want our  input.   So then to hear people who treated us like that say we care about  open debate, knowing that some of those same people came down here and  grabbed microphones and, for the first time we can find in  congressional hearing, prevented the majority from starting into  session; and then they want to lecture us on openness and kindness and  open debate? Really?   Let's go back to the Norma McCorveys of the world. Let's minister to  them individually, as my church, as a number of ministries with which I  am greatly familiar do. Let's help the real person. Let's help that  child so that that little boy or that little girl doesn't have its arms  and legs jerked out of the uterus. Let's help that child have a life  that will be so full they will never think about slitting their wrists,  as Norma McCorvey did. Let's vote for life.    Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for his very  passionate and incisive remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure, the Agriculture, and  the Natural Resources Committees. I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith), my colleague, for his continued leadership on this very  important topic, a moral one, I think, that reflects truly an important  part of the fiber of our country.   Which way are we going to go on this? What are our values going to  be?   The gentleman has been a consistent leader way before my time during  Congress as well.   As we reflect on this week, landmark legislation again passed  tonight, H.R. 7, that would prohibit funding for abortion in this  country, on the heels of the Mexico City solution that President Trump  just signed today as well.   We are seeing that hearts are turning in this country on this issue.  And when you look at it in the categories of people across the country,  about half and half, rough numbers. Half the country might label itself  pro-life, and the other half that favors Roe v. Wade being the law of  the land, that might label themselves as pro-choice or pro-abortion.   When we get down to H.R. 7, we find that the half that is pro-life  can be joined by many additional people on the other side of that  argument that don't think it is appropriate to have government funding,  their taxpayer dollars, used for abortion as a birth control tool in a  lot of cases.   So this shows that we do have the tide going in this direction on  that, as people become more and more informed on this and understand  and don't listen to the rhetoric and don't listen to misinformation on  what this really is. This is a baby you are talking about. It doesn't  form into something else. Each pregnancy will result in a human baby.   So when we fight this battle, we find it is those that would speak on  this side of the issue come under a lot of persecution. Many, many  people will be joining together in this town later this week in the  March for Life. You will be persecuted to some extent or another. You  will be called things. But, you know, we know from the Bible that those  that speak the truth are often persecuted as well, and we all need to  be strong and firm in that.   God is watching what we do here. God will be watching later this week  and at all times on those that are marching for life. So be strong.   Also, put your arms around those folks that might be strongly  opposed, because there are a lot of people hurting on that. We  understand. People that have had to make a difficult abortion choice  and chosen to do so, they need healing as well. They need understanding  and compassion on that. If we can show them that, and if we can show  that those that are contemplating abortion, there are alternatives out  there. There are many alternatives. If we can just come alongside them  and show them that there is more than one way to do this, and there are  people willing to help and willing to counsel you in that, because that  is really what it comes down to.   When you talk about a choice, show that woman in crisis, in that  situation that she has many choices, informed choices to make; and, by  and large, maybe she will make the right one. In a lot of cases I  believe she will.   So God bless those that are going to come for this march later this  week and stand for this, put up with the level of persecution that  comes with any of these types of issues, including the one on being  pro-life.   Again, God bless you, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, for being a consistent  leader on this.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman so very much for his  kind remarks, but also his very eloquent concern for post-abortive  women and those who may be contemplating abortion. You know, the  Pregnancy Care Network, 4,000 strong throughout the United States, is  there as a front line to say: We love you both, mother and baby.   So I thank the gentleman for bringing attention to that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice), a member of the Oversight and Government Reform, and the Natural  Resources Committees.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my  good friend, Chris Smith, for his leadership for so many years on this  issue of life. He is deeply loved and appreciated, and I am grateful to  be able to share this time with him as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure it has been said this evening already many  times over that since the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, we have lost  over 50 million lives. That is such a staggering number, but within  that number, of course, are mothers, daughters, fathers, sons, all of  them lost to abortion.   This decision of Roe v. Wade, at the crux of the matter, is one that  has the question: When does life begin?   And with that question, I was reminded of the opinion of the Supreme  Court Justice Blackmun. During that period of time when Roe v. Wade  came into law, Blackmun made the decision and wrote in his opinion. He  said: ``We, the Court, need not resolve the difficult question of when  life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of  medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any  consensus, the judiciary,'' he said, ``at this point in the development  of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the  answer.''   What a startling statement that was made. But here we are at this  time, this body, at this point of our Nation's history, we have no need  as to speculate on this question any longer. There is clear science  that, without question, tells us when life begins. And life begins at  conception. There is no question about this.   We know inside the womb is a human life. And we know with that life,  based on what we know of God and what we in our own country know from  our own Declaration of Independence, the very first inalienable right  protected is that of life.                                time  1815    So I just believe it is time that we correct this wrongheaded  decision that was made by the Court some 44 years ago. Even just  recently, a couple of days ago, I introduced H.R. 586, the Sanctity of  Human Life Act, which makes clear that life begins at conception. I  certainly would ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.   I just dream of the time, 44 years from now, that we could be  celebrating the right to life rather than 44 years from now looking  back and mourning over yet another 50 million American babies who have  been lost to the horrible stain of abortion. So, again, I thank you for  your leadership, and I deeply appreciate the opportunity to join you in  this Special Order.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you very much for your eloquence and  reminding us all that the Supreme Court itself said that we need not  resolve the difficult question of when human life begins; then they  went on to say that any child, at any point until birth, could be  killed by way of an abortion. They resolved it, but they  [[Page H673]]  resolved it in the negative without science, without the information.  Ultrasound certainly has shattered that myth, and I thank you for  reminding all of us about that.   I also would remind my colleagues that Jean Garton--a great leader-- ran Lutherans for Life for years. She was preparing a presentation on  abortion that included some actual pictures of aborted babies. It was  late at night, but her young child walked in while she was doing this  and said: Mommy, who broke the baby?   So even a small child could recognize--and did recognize--that  abortion destroys the life of a baby. Sadly, the Court has not been  able to. With all of their much-vaunted intelligence capacity, they  missed it by a mile. So thank you for reminding us of that.   Mr. Speaker, how much time remains.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marshall). The gentleman has 21 minutes  remaining.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ex-President Barack Obama, the abortion President, has  done serious harm. No human rights abuse, however, need be forever.  Today, we have an extraordinary opportunity. We have, I would submit, a  duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable and to reassert  protections that have been sadly lacking for the last 44 years.  Protecting unborn children and their mothers is the most important  human rights cause on Earth. And this week, on Friday, thousands are  expected to march for life, to march for this fundamental human right-- the right to live.   Now, as never before, we must work, pray, and fast for that day when  every life is cherished as a gift; every life loved, despite one's  disability, race, sex, color, religion, or condition of dependency; and  every life welcomed, no matter the inconvenience. Earlier in this  Special Order, Steve King talked about caring for people at every stage  of development--every stage--including the unborn. Birth is an event  that happens to each and every one of us. It is not the beginning of  life.   Again, ultrasound imaging of the unborn child has just opened up  everyone's eyes to the little child--twins if there are two--that  resides within.   He also talked about, and I would agree with him, children with  disabilities need to be welcomed. A prenatal diagnosis of disability  should mean empathy and concern for the child, not exclusion or a death  sentence, because every life is a gift.   Mr. Speaker, it is very encouraging as to how many young people are  stepping up to protect and lead in this human rights cause.  Increasingly, the young people on college campuses, Students for Life,  and so many young people in their 20s, the millennials--and the polling  shows the millennials are pro-life--are stepping up.   Tom Brokaw often talked about the Greatest Generation. They are  stepping up as the next Greatest Generation who by their compassion,  faith, and determination will transform America into a culture of life.   All of us in the pro-life movement are especially thankful for the  growing number of courageous women who are silent no more. Some of the  groups are called the Silent No More Awareness campaign. For example,  women, all of whom have had abortions, have suffered psychological and  emotional harm, and yet they, thank God, have found reconciliation and  peace, often through faith. But now they blaze a hope-filled path for  other post-abortive women to find healing, reconciliation, and inner  peace. They admonish society not to offer the false solution of killing  an unborn child.   There are two victims in every abortion: the baby, the most obvious,  but equally the mother. Women deserve better than the false solution of  dismembering or chemically poisoning unborn children. The other side of  the issue seldom talks about the child, if ever, don't even use the  word abortion much anymore, just choice or reproductive rights, and  just refuses to accept or to acknowledge or to debate what the deed  actually does.   Children have their arms and legs torn off their bodies by the  abortionist as well as decapitation. Chemicals literally starve the  child to death. RU-486 is euphemistically called medical abortion like  the other pills that are provided. First, the child starves in the  womb, and then another chemical brings on labor.   For the pro-life movement, we all acknowledge that the way forward is  fraught with obstacles that must be overcome. The promotion of human  rights is never easy. The promotion of human rights is never obstacle  free. If past is prologue, the history of the pro-life movement,  however, shows that we will never quit.   Earlier today, the House voted on the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, H.R. 7, to end  taxpayer complicity and funding of abortion. I especially want to thank  our very principled leadership, great people like the Speaker, Paul  Ryan; Kevin McCarthy, our majority leader; Steve Scalise, our whip; and  Cathy McMorris Rodgers; and so many others who take a principled stand  for the unborn and equally for their mothers.   No matter what The Washington Post or The New York Times might say,  they are willing to stand into the wind rather than to go along with it  because the sanctity of life--the preciousness of those children and  equally of their mothers--demands it. I want to thank them for their  extraordinary leadership. As we all know, the bill passed 238-183.   The extraordinary news is about the Hyde amendment and its  consequences. It has saved the lives of over 2 million children, and  that is a conservative estimate. There may be many more. Other funding  bans at State levels, as well as our funding bans in our Federal  policies, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, have  also saved lives because the money was not there to facilitate the  demise--the violent demise--of those children.   Even the Guttmacher Institute, the former research arm of Planned  Parenthood, acknowledges that about 25 percent of the Medicaid  abortions that otherwise would have occurred do not occur. Those  children go on to be born, and that is where the 2 million figure,  about 60,000 per year--children who evade the scalpel or the chemical  poisoning of abortion.   Forty years ago, Congress enacted the Hyde amendment. It has been  continued every year, and now it will be made permanent if this bill  were to become law. We know, as was said during the debate by my  friends on the other side of this issue, that they are determined to  eviscerate the Hyde amendment, and those 2 million children, had they  had their way over the last 40 years, would have been killed.   We also want to take abortion out of ObamaCare. The President stood  right at that podium, Mr. Speaker, in September of 2009, and said:  ``Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions. .  . . ''   We know that is absolutely untrue. He also signed an executive order  where he said that the Hyde amendment would be applied to the plans in  the exchanges. So we went to the Government Accountability Office and  asked for a study. It took about a year, and they came back and said  that 1,036 insurance plans across the country paid for abortion on  demand with taxpayer funding. H.R. 7, title II, would end that  complicity of the taxpayer with the procurement of abortion.   Let me also say that we hope to bring up in this House a bill that  was sponsored last Congress and is again today by Trent Franks of  Arizona, a great champion of life. It is called the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act to legally protect most babies at 20 weeks  postfertilization. Of course, many of those kids die of dismemberment.  Again, we need a national debate on abortion because the methods have  been hidden by the facade of the abortion industry. They have been very  good at cloaking, concealing, and diminishing any focus on what happens  to the baby. Even when abortion is through ultrasound-guided abortions  and the mother is there, semi-sedated, they turn the screen away from  her so she doesn't see the dismemberment of the child, because,  obviously, as Dr. Nathanson, the founder of NARAL and an abortionist,  once said--he came to the conclusion after having killed 60,000  children and then became a pro-lifer--he said that if wombs had  windows, if everyone, including the woman, could see the child, she  would run out of that abortion mill.   So, again, I want to say thank you to Trent Franks. I know he is  here, and  [[Page H674]]  I hope that he will join us tonight. He has led on born-alive  legislation, which is also transformative.   Imagine that the former President of the United States, Barack Obama,  said that he would veto a bill that would provide a standard of care,  including a right to private action, when the child is born alive from  a later term abortion. We can't even help that child? Yet Obama, the  abortion President, said: No, we can't. Trent Franks, again, has been  the leader on that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus)  who is a good friend and colleague, and then to close, Congressman  Trent Franks.
