 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Miami  Lighthouse for the Blind on its new Lighthouse Learning Center and Pre- K program.   The Miami Lighthouse has served south Florida since 1931, offering  life-changing programs and resources for those who have visual  impairments. President Virginia Jacko and her staff are making history  once again with the Lighthouse Learning Center.   The Miami Lighthouse is partnering with Miami-Dade County Public  Schools to provide a comprehensive learning program for pre-K students  using an evidence-based curriculum to support and empower visually  impaired students to achieve their potential. Children in this program  will receive the training they need to perform at the same level as  their sighted peers by the time they enroll in school.   Mr. Speaker, it fills me with great pride to recognize Virginia Jacko  and the entire staff at the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind for their  tireless work in launching this wonderful learning center in the heart  of Little Havana, located in my congressional district.                            ____________________
