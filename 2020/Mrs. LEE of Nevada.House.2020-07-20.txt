 Mr. Speaker, I stand with Congressman Takano in  support of this amendment to close the 90/10 loophole for the  Department of Defense military education benefits.   Educational institutions are required to derive at least 10 percent  of their revenues from non-Federal sources. The intent of this  requirement is to ensure that schools offer an education that is of  high enough value and high enough quality that people would actually  want to use their own money to pay for it.   It is about proving market viability, which is supposed to guarantee  that taxpayers will not support low-quality schools. If they can't  compete in the open market, they should not be supported entirely by  the government.   This loophole, which effectively treats Defense Department money as  the same as what is supposed to come out of people's pockets, violates  the safeguards we intended to have in place. That is why it is called a  loophole. And it explains why certain untrustworthy colleges, many of  which are for-profit, target servicemembers and veterans.   Closing this loophole is a concrete step to ensuring we protect our  servicemembers.
