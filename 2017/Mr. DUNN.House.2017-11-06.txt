 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Deane Bozeman School, a  title I school, located in Bay County, Florida. Deane Bozeman School  prides itself on developing boys and girls of character and as well- educated American citizens. The school's administration, faculty,  staff, and parents join in investing and educating over 1,300 students,  prekindergarten through 12th grade. The result is that Deane Bozeman  School continues a tradition of academic excellence.   This year, Deane Bozeman School reaches yet another milestone in  excellence by adding a fully chartered Army Junior ROTC program to its  curriculum. As cadets, the ROTC program will develop middle and high  school students into leaders whose characters are based on the  fundamental values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service,  integrity, and personal courage.   Under the leadership of Chief Warrant Officer Retired Jeff Adkins,  these students will certainly thrive.  [[Page H8501]]    Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Deane Bozeman School  for taking such a bold step and enriching the lives of the students in  this inaugural year of its Army ROTC program.                            ____________________
