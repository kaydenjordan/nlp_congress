 Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 67.    Mr. President, over the last 8 years, American workers  grappled with a sluggish economy and policies that often made it harder  for families to get ahead. Even on its way out the door, the Obama  administration pushed forward with more unfair regulations that hurt  the middle class. It tried to advance regulations that threatened jobs  and hindered economic growth. It tried to shift power away from people  and toward government on everything from education to land management  issues.   Under the guise of helping more people save for the future, it  undercut a system of private retirement savings that has served  millions of Americans very well for decades. It introduced regulations  that would push more and more Americans into government-run retirement  plans. These retirement savings regulations are a classic case of the  whole being worse that the sum of its parts.   The Obama administration encouraged States and municipalities to set  up government-run retirement plans for private sector workers. Sounds  great, some might say, but that is until you see the fine print.   States always had the power to set up these plans, but they chafed at  Federal laws protecting the workers who would be automatically enrolled  in them. They didn't like that the basic retirement protections that  apply to those who manage private sector retirement plans would apply  to the government too. So they sought a waiver from long-accepted  Federal protections like the requirement to invest prudently and the  rule against self-dealing.   That is what these regulations are actually about. They allow States  and cities to create an employer mandate that forces private sector  workers into these government-run plans. They liberate the States and  big-city mayors from Federal consumer protections for these hard-earned  dollars, and they create a competitive advantage for these new  government-run plans. The end result would be more government at the  expense of the private sector.   Fortunately, we can begin to roll back these regulations. We will  take a vote today to protect workers should big-city governments try to  force their private sector employees to auto-enroll in government-run  savings plans. Later, we will advance another CRA to protect workers  from similar efforts at the State level.   Congress is able to push back against troubling regulations like  these because of the tools provided by the Congressional Review Act, or  CRA. Just last week, we sent the 11th CRA resolution to the President's  desk, and we hope to add to those regulatory relief efforts again.   I thank Senator Hatch, the Finance Committee chairman, for his  leadership on this issue. He understands that  [[Page S2056]]  we need to do more to encourage private retirement savings, and he has  advocated numerous policies that would do just that. He also  understands that more government involvement in the retirement of  private sector workers is not the answer. He introduced companion  legislation to the House bills we will vote on soon. We should pass  that legislation without delay so that we can, as the chairman said,  ``give employees and small-business owners more flexibility and freedom  to choose how to financially invest and build a nest egg for  retirement.''                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, on another matter, since Judge Neil Gorsuch was  nominated to the Supreme Court, Senate Democrats have searched high and  they have searched low for a reason to oppose him. They looked at his  background, and they found a Columbia alum, a Harvard Law graduate, and  an Oxford scholar. They looked at his reputation and found an impartial  and fair judge, an incisive and eloquent writer, and a humble and even- tempered man. They looked at his record as a judge and found someone  who follows the facts where they lead without favoring one party over  another; someone respected by Democrats, Independents, and Republicans  alike; and someone who understands that his role is to interpret the  law, not legislate from the bench.   Our colleagues across the aisle also had the opportunity to spend  hours with Judge Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing. Once again, they  found little to hang their hat on when it comes to a reason to oppose  him. Instead, the hearings made clear a point recently stated by a  board member of the liberal American Constitution Society: ``The Senate  should confirm him because there is no principled reason to vote no''  on Judge Gorsuch. That was David Frederick, a self-proclaimed ``long- time supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes'' in a  recent Washington Post op-ed. This prominent Democrat said he supports  Judge Gorsuch because he ``embodies a reverence for our country's  values and legal system. . . . We should applaud such independence of  mind and spirit in Supreme Court nominees.''   Unfortunately, instead of coming together behind this nominee, some  of our colleagues continue to press forward with convoluted excuses as  to why they won't support him.   Just yesterday, my friend the Democratic leader came to the floor to  share his reasoning. He talked about the need for the nominee to be  independent and impartial. Well, Judge Gorsuch passes that test, and  the American Bar Association, the organization revered as the ``gold  standard'' for evaluating judges by the Democratic leader himself and  the former Judiciary chairman, certainly agrees. It said: ``Based on  the writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to reach our  rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the  independence of the judicial branch of government, and we predict that  he will be a strong and respectful voice in protecting it.''   In addition to independence, the Democratic leader talked about his  concern that Judge Gorsuch has earned the support of conservatives.  Well, that is true. Judge Gorsuch has earned the support of  Republicans, just as he has received praise from many on the left as  well, like President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal Katyal;  President Obama's legal mentor, Professor Laurence Tribe; and left- leaning law professor E. Donald Elliot, among so many others.   The Democratic leader talked about the need for the nominee to offer  assurances about how he would rule on a certain case and assurances  that he would stand up for certain groups, but, as Judge Gorsuch  pointed out, nominees are, to quote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to  offer ``no hints, no forecasts, no previews'' on how they would rule in  certain cases. Similarly, judges are to decide cases based on the  facts, not personal views or political preferences.   Finally, the Democratic leader talked about the importance of a  nominee's record. Well, I would like to take a moment to remind my  colleagues of Judge Gorsuch's record. He said at his hearing:         I have decided . . . over 2,700 cases, and my law clerks       tell me that 97 percent of them have been unanimous, 99       percent I've been in the majority. They tell me as well that,       according to the Congressional Research Service, my opinions       have attracted the fewest number of dissents from my       colleagues of anyone I've served with that they studied over       the last 10 years.    To sum it up, more than 2,700 cases, in the majority on 99 percent of  them, and part of a unanimous ruling on 97 percent of them--it simply  doesn't get much better than that. No wonder the ABA gave him its  highest rating: unanimously ``well qualified.''   So when we hear our Democratic colleagues talking about breaking  longstanding precedent to oppose this noncontroversial, outstanding  judge by mounting the first-ever purely partisan filibuster to try to  defeat his nomination, we can only assume one thing: This isn't about  the nominee at all; it is about a few on the left whose priority is to  obstruct this Senate and this President whenever and wherever they can.  Months after the election, they are still in campaign mode, calling for  Senate Democrats to obstruct and to resist.   Let's be clear. These leftwing groups aren't concerned by the  qualifications of this judge. They aren't looking out for what is best  for the Court, for the Senate, or for the country. They simply refuse  to accept the outcome of last year's election.   We realize the enormous pressure our Democratic colleagues are under.  It is why we are hearing talks of some mythical 60-vote standard that  doesn't exist. Just ask fact-checkers who have repeatedly debunked that  idea. A 60-vote threshold has never been the standard for a Supreme  Court confirmation--not for President Clinton's Supreme Court nominees  in his first term and not for the Supreme Court nominees of a newly  elected President Obama, either.   As the Washington Post Fact Checker reminded us again just this very  morning, ``Once again: There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or  `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often  Democrats claim otherwise.''   So I would ask our Democratic friends, do they really want to launch  the first wholly partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in  American history? Do they really think history books or the American  people will look kindly on them for filibustering this amazingly well- qualified and widely respected nominee?   Judge Gorsuch has earned an enormous amount of praise from across the  political spectrum and from a wide array of publications all across our  country, like The Chicago Tribune, which recently called for his  confirmation, saying that Judge Gorsuch ``has shown himself to be  committed to the principle that judges should rule on the law as  written, and apply it equally to all.''   The newspaper The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch ``is proving  himself an even-tempered, deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be  confirmed by the Senate. The hearings confirm,'' it said, ``that  Gorsuch is [eminently] qualified, and there is nothing radical in his  judicial history.''   In the Denver Post: ``As we've noted several times in the run-up to  Gorsuch's confirmation hearings, the 10th Circuit judge possesses the  fairness, independence and open-mindedness necessary to make him a  marvelous addition to the Supreme Court.''   The Post went on to say that Senators should not ``[miss] the chance  to rally behind Gorsuch--who has been roundly praised here by Democrats  and Republicans alike.'' In other words, Judge Neil Gorsuch should be  treated fairly, receive an up-or-down vote, and be confirmed to the  Supreme Court, just like all four first-time Supreme Court nominees of  Presidents Clinton and Obama.   Again, as even those on the left can't help but admit, ``there is no  principled reason to vote no'' on Judge Gorsuch. It is a sentiment we  have heard from many of our colleagues here on the floor as we have  been debating Judge Gorsuch's nomination over the past few weeks.   As we wait for the Judiciary Committee to report out his nomination,  I would encourage Members of both sides to continue to take advantage  of available floor time to discuss this important issue. I would also  remind Senators that we will have all of next week--all of next week-- to continue debating Judge Gorsuch's nomination  [[Page S2057]]  as well. I look forward to hearing from our colleagues as we work to  advance this extremely well-qualified nominee.
