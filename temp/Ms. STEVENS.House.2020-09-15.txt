 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  efforts of the Thelander and Zarate families, who have spearheaded a  conservation and awareness program for thousands of beautiful monarch  butterflies that began their lives as caterpillars in Michigan's 11th  District before attempting the 2,000-mile migration to central Mexico  every year.   A couple of years ago, Maecy Zarate, who was then just 8 years old,  petitioned the Highland Township board to establish the Milkweed Mile,  a beautiful stretch of land along highway M-59 in Highland Township  that provides a sanctuary for monarchs.   Along this stretch of road, which is designated as a no-mow zone,  milkweed is left to grow and thrive freely, creating an ideal  environment for monarch caterpillars to complete their lifecycle.   Each summer, these conservation efforts culminate in the Highland  Monarch Butterfly Festival, an annual celebration of these amazing  butterflies, in an effort to raise awareness of this species that has  seen their global populations plummet in recent years.   I was honored to visit the Highland Monarch Butterfly Festival in  August of 2019, and it was so inspiring to meet young Michiganders  passionate about conservation and biodiversity in our great State.   This is also part of the work that we are doing on the House Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, to protect and to promote biodiversity  throughout the world.   The Thelander family also tags and releases hundreds of monarchs  every year. One butterfly, named Jeronimo, was tracked all the way from  Michigan's 11th District to central Mexico last year, beating the odds  and completing a grueling 1,900-mile journey over 3 months.   This is significant and symbolic. It is symbolic because of the  journey that we are on as a Nation right now in somewhat uncertain and  troubling times but with an end goal to reach the other side.   The monarch sanctuary along Milkweed Mile provides a special  opportunity for young people to get involved in real conservation  efforts right in their backyard. As Maecy says, ``If there's no  milkweed, there's no monarchs.''   I look forward to working with monarch lovers all over Michigan to  protect Milkweed Mile as a sanctuary for years to come.   I ask this Chamber to join me in recognizing the inspiring efforts of  the next generation of conservationists who are making a difference in  our community through their passion and dedication for these beautiful  butterflies. I could not be more proud of their efforts, and I look  forward to learning more about their progress in next year's Highland  Township Monarch Festival.                            ____________________
