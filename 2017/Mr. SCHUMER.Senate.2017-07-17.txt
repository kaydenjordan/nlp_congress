 Mr. President, first, I want to tell my colleague from  Florida  [[Page S4014]]  that it is always a pleasure to listen to him. He is erudite, well- researched, and passionate--always about a subject that matters.   On the subject he just spoke about, no State in our entire Nation has  more experience with the frailties of this planet, given that it is  heating up, as the Senator from Florida, given all the low-lying,  heavily populated areas on the oceanside and the Gulfside. I thank him  for his continued pursuit of these issues that are very important to  every one of us.
