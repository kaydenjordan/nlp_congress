 Mr. President, it doesn't matter whether you are watching  FOX News or reading the editorial page of the New York Times, the  media--indeed the Nation--is in broad agreement that there is a crisis  on our southern border, and the responsibility lies squarely with  Congress to fix it.   Month after month, the number of people crossing our border has  ticked up and up and up, and the only people who seem unfazed by these  mind-boggling numbers--144,000 last month alone--are House Democrats.   Despite continued pleading from officials at the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and  some of our Democratic friends in the House, the leadership in the  House of Representatives is still trying to absolve themselves of any  responsibility to act. Well, it is getting harder and harder for them  to ignore this crisis that continues to get worse on our border. The  recordbreaking number of migrants who cross our border make a difficult  and dangerous journey to get here. They travel in the company of human  smugglers, appropriately known by most as coyotes. These criminal  entrepreneurs do not view the migrants in their custody as human  beings. They view them as cargo. It is really their meal ticket.   Coyotes get their customers to the United States, but a safe journey  is not part of the deal. Migrants, especially children, often arrive at  our border in poor health, suffering from dehydration, exposure, any  one of a number of infectious diseases, and, unfortunately, sadly, many  are left for dead by their smugglers.   Last week, Border Patrol found a young girl believed to be about 7  years old from India, dead and alone along the border in Arizona. The  area where she was found is a rugged desert, and the temperature that  day was 108 degrees.   Stories like this are heartbreaking and more common than many want to  believe. Those who survive the torturous journey from Central America  up through Mexico and into the United States often arrive in critical  health. The national Border Patrol Council vice president, Jon  Anfinsen, has been an agent for 12 years and is based in Del Rio, TX.  He said the number of people in custody and the high rate of illnesses  is ``unprecedented.''   He has seen cases of scabies, chickenpox, mumps, measles, flu, body  lice, and countless common colds. Overcrowded facilities make these  illnesses spread like wildfire, and even the Border Patrol agents and  people offering assistance to these migrants are getting sick too. That  is because Congress has not appropriated the money for the facilities,  funding, and for the personnel to manage these record-breaking numbers.  They are obviously in dire need of our assistance.   Last month, the administration requested $4.5 billion for the  Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the  Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice to address this  growing crisis.   Two weeks after this request, the situation had grown so much worse  than expected that the Secretary of Health and Human Services notified  Congress that the Department would soon be running out of funding and  that another $1.4 billion could be needed for humanitarian assistance  alone. That brings the total to almost $6 billion. Since the funding  request was submitted, more than 144,000 individuals have illegally  crossed our border, adding to the growing weight these folks are  feeling.   Without providing the necessary funding, we are sending these  dedicated law enforcement officials out on a losing mission. We are  asking them to carry the weight of hundreds of thousands of migrants  without giving them the tools they need to do so.   Enough is enough. It is high time Congress steps up and come to an  agreement to get much needed and long overdue funding to the men and  women struggling to manage this humanitarian crisis not of their  making. This critical funding is needed along the entire southern  border but particularly in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso sectors,  which have been disproportionately affected by the dramatic increase in  crossings.   For months, communities in Texas have requested help in feeding,  transporting, and sheltering these migrants. They have gone above and  beyond the call of duty, diverting millions of dollars in local  taxpayer funds that are traditionally intended for things like clean  water and power for their own residents.   Today I am sending a letter to the Appropriations Committee and  asking them to include assistance to these communities. The  Appropriations Committee is holding a markup tomorrow, and I hope they  can come to an agreement to provide the Departments, Agencies, and  local communities in Texas struggling to manage this crisis with the  resources they need to be successful. To borrow a saying from Border  Patrol Chief Carla Provost, the current situation is akin to holding a  bucket under a faucet. It doesn't matter how many buckets you have if  you can't turn the water off. The emergency funding is a bucket, and  hopefully it will be a sufficient bucket, but we still have to get to  the source of the problem.   Last week, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan  testified before the Judiciary Committee and said: ``I want to make  clear that this crisis is unlike anything we've ever seen at our border  and it, in large part, is due to the gaps in our immigration laws that  are driving it, causing a dramatic demographic shift in the flow of  illegal immigration into the United States that is placing children at  unique and critical risk.''   Of the more than 144,000 people who illegally crossed the border in  May, 69 percent were either unaccompanied children or families. The  number of unaccompanied children apprehended last month is larger than  any monthly total from the surge in 2014, back when President Obama  called it ``a humanitarian and security crisis.'' It is an  understatement to say we lack the resources to properly care for these  children.   In addition to providing more resources and better care, we need to  get to the ``why'' of these rising numbers. I have no doubt this surge  in humanity is being driven by the pull factors in the immigration  system, most notably the Flores settlement agreement. By ``pull  factors,'' I mean the thing that attracts the migrants to attempt to  make this dangerous journey from their homes into the United States.   The Flores settlement agreement is one of them. In the beginning, the  Flores settlement agreement provided additional standards of care for  children, including a limit on the time they could remain in DHS  custody, but a subsequent, flawed court ruling expanded this agreement,  in effect applying it to families as well. That essentially turned  children into a ``get out of jail free'' card for migrants, something  which is now openly advertised by the coyotes in Central America.   In other words, the coyotes--the smugglers who earn money off of each  person they bring into the United States--are letting these people know  that if you just come as a child or if you come as a family, you are  going to be able to make it successfully into the United States, and it  is a money-making proposition, obviously, for them.   A recent Washington Post article quoted a man as saying the  following:         That is the thing that everyone knows now. If you go, you       need to bring a child.    This has gotten so bad that Acting Secretary McAleenan said the  Border Patrol is now running DNA tests and is discovering significant  numbers of adults who are claiming a biological connection to a child  that is not theirs. This is the ultimate ``get out of jail free'' card:  Bring a child--anybody's child.    This loophole has turned into a major pull factor, and single adults  are using it to their advantage. Rather than arriving at the border  alone, they are bringing kids with them so they can pose as a family  unit and be released in 20 days. These aren't all legitimate families,  as I said. It is no exaggeration to say that children are literally  being kidnapped to serve as a  [[Page S3643]]  free ticket into the United States. That is a sad truth.   If we want to stop this abuse of our system and of these children and  bring down the skyrocketing numbers that are flooding across our  border, we have to fix this expansion of the Flores agreement when it  comes to family units.   Last month, Congressman Henry Cuellar of Laredo, TX, a Democrat, and  I introduced a bill called the HUMANE Act, which, among other things,  would close this dangerous loophole--something Congress never enacted  and never intended and which is being exploited by the coyotes.   Our bill would clarify that the Flores agreement only applies to  children, not to families, and would remove that pull factor and  prevent single adults from exploiting them in order to gain entry into  the United States. The HUMANE Act would make additional, targeted  reforms to make our immigration system more fair and efficient and  provide better protection for the children who are brought here.   Perhaps the most important thing to note is that this bill already  has bipartisan support--something that is tough to find when it comes  to immigration reform these days. As our friend the majority leader  said on the floor last week, ``The crisis at the border hasn't gone  anywhere and neither has our resolve to address it.''   I appreciate my friend and colleague Congressman Henry Cuellar for  working with me on this bill. I hope the border communities in Texas  and along the entire U.S.-Mexico border will call and write or go see  their Congressman and say: Get on board with Congressman Cuellar in the  House of Representatives.   Let's vote on the HUMANE Act so the Senate can pass it and send it to  President Trump for signature. I can't imagine how people can be at  peace with their own conscience knowing what is happening right now and  simply sitting on their hands and doing nothing to address this  humanitarian and security crisis. We owe it to the dedicated law men  and women who work to manage this crisis along the border who now are  being overwhelmed by this influx of humanity. Our resolve to help them  remains as strong as ever. Now what we need is a strong bipartisan vote  to get it done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
