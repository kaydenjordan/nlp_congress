 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Tax Day 2022 is fast approaching.  Americans around the country are prepping their tax returns.   If you talked to most Americans, I don't think you would find that  the IRS is their favorite government Agency and with good reason. The  Agency  [[Page S1724]]  has gained a reputation for poor taxpayer service. The last tax filing  season was particularly miserable for taxpayers. ``If you call the IRS,  there is only a 1-in-50 chance that you'll reach a human being,'' noted  a headline in the Washington Post last April.   The national Taxpayer Advocate noted in her 2021 report to Congress:         Calendar year 2021 was surely the most challenging year       taxpayers and tax professionals have ever experienced--long       processing and refund delays, difficulty reaching the IRS by       phone, correspondence that went unprocessed for many months,       collection notices issued while taxpayer correspondence was       awaiting processing, little or no information on the Where's       My Refund? tool for delayed returns. . . .    And bad customer service isn't the only thing tarnishing the IRS's  reputation. The IRS has also gained a reputation for mishandling the  confidential taxpayer information it has access to. In fact, the IRS  was recently subject to a massive leak or hack of private taxpayer  information--information that somehow ended up in the hands of  advocates at ProPublica, an outfit that promotes progressive causes and  went on to publish taxpayers' private information last June. Months  later, neither the Treasury Department nor the IRS has provided  meaningful followup about the data breach, much less any  accountability.   Who could forget the IRS scandal during the Obama administration when  the IRS targeted a number of organizations based on their political  beliefs? Nor did the IRS inspire confidence a few months ago when it  announced it would start requiring taxpayers to submit biometric data  in order to access certain IRS services.   Fortunately, after Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee and  others weighed in, the IRS abandoned its plans to allow the harvesting  of taxpayers' biometric data, but it was a concerning instance of  government overreach from an Agency notable for repeated mishandling of  private taxpayer information.   The IRS was a frequent subject of discussion in regard to the  Democrats' so-called Build Back Better plan. It would have been nice if  this was because Democrats had proposed a real plan to improve taxpayer  services and increase Agency accountability. But, no, what they  proposed in their Build Back Better plan was a massive increase in  funding for the IRS--$80 billion--essentially doubling the size of the  Agency without any plan for ensuring improvements to basic taxpayer  services.   I am hard pressed to imagine why anyone would contemplate handing a  massive budget increase to the IRS without simultaneously prioritizing  a plan to substantially increase accountability and improve taxpayer  services. But, of course, Democrats weren't interested in improving  taxpayer services. Their main interest in handing the IRS a supersized  budget increase was to increase tax collections to raise revenue to  help pay for their partisan tax-and-spending spree.   It is the same reason why they included a provision, until widespread  public opposition forced them to remove it, that would have allowed the  IRS to examine the details of Americans' bank accounts. Under one  version of this provision, the IRS would have been able to sift through  the bank records of any American with just $600 in annual  transactions--$600. In other words, the IRS would have been able to  look through the bank records of just about every American and find out  just how much you spent on Starbucks or your last doctor's bill or that  new pair of running shoes.   Republicans are not opposed to enhancing resources for the IRS if  needed to improve taxpayer services, but any enhanced resources for the  IRS must be paired with serious reform, including measures to improve  customer service, ensure that existing resources are being used  optimally, and promote smarter and more effective audits.   I am a cosponsor of Senator Crapo's Tax Gap Reform and IRS  Enforcement Act, which would codify additional protections for  taxpayers against IRS overreach.   Among other things, the legislation would help ensure that the IRS is  not able to target taxpayers for their political and ideological  beliefs, and it would prohibit the kinds of bank reporting requirements  that Democrats sought to impose in their Build Back Better spending  spree. It would also take steps to increase IRS expertise and improve  the audit process. It would improve the information that we have on the  tax gap, which is the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid.   Reducing the size of the tax gap and improving enforcement of our tax  laws is something we should look at, but any effort has to be balanced  with taxpayer responsibilities and taxpayer rights. Vastly increasing  the size of the IRS without any new accountability or Agency oversight,  as Democrats wanted to do with their Build Back Better spending spree,  would be more likely to result in increased harassment of law-abiding  taxpayers than in a meaningful reduction in the tax gap.   Just in case anyone thinks I am exaggerating about harassment, I  would like to note that a provision in the House version of Democrats'  reckless tax-and-spending spree would repeal a measure requiring  written approval of a supervisor before an IRS agent can assess any  penalties. The provision was intended to prevent overreaching IRS  agents from threatening Americans with unjustified penalties. It is  hard to imagine why Democrats would try to repeal this measure if they  were not trying to pave the way for much more aggressive IRS pressure  on American taxpayers.   In her 2021 report to Congress, the National Taxpayer Advocate noted  that ``there is no way to sugarcoat the year 2021 in tax  administration. From the perspective of tens of millions of taxpayers,  it was horrendous.''   Taxpayers deserve better. They deserve an efficient and accountable  IRS and timely and effective customer service, and Congress should  focus on giving it to them. I hope to be able to move away from  Democrats' intrusive and reckless Build Back Better IRS proposals and  toward bipartisan efforts to reform the IRS and ensure the taxpayers  can reliably depend on the Agency.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
