 Mr. Speaker, I don't know what it is like to lose a child  to gun violence. My words are not sufficient to describe that pain.   These are the words of Patricia Oliver, the mother of Joaquin Oliver.  Joaquin was killed 1 year ago tomorrow at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School in Parkland, Florida.         Dear Representative Deutch: I am writing to you to plead       with you to ensure that other mothers and fathers do not have       to endure this gut-wrenching pain, the senseless and       unnecessary loss of life, liberty, and the pursuit of       happiness for my family.        My name is Patricia Oliver. My beautiful son, Joaquin, was       one of the 17 who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman       Douglas High School last year. Words cannot express the       devastation wrought on the families of the victims, the       shattering of families, friends, and those who survived.        After the avoidable mass shooting, many said we were in       their thoughts and prayers. How many of you in this Chamber       uttered just those words?        I thank you for your prayers, but are you actually thinking       about your constituents, about those you have sworn an oath       to serve, and about those you know and love? If you were       thinking, you would do something.        It is in your power to enact commonsense gun laws,       commonsense mental health support, and appropriate support       and guidance  [[Page H1530]]       to law enforcement. If we have the courage to stand up and do       this, then never again will thoughts and prayers be needed in       the aftermath of a mass shooting.        This country is at a crossroads. We need your leadership.       We need your love, your compassion. We need your serious       thought unmarred by lobbyists.        I implore you to think about the kids. Think about how you       would feel if it were your son, your daughter, your       granddaughter, or your grandson, because it could be.        Had we--had the Members of this body--learned the lessons       of Columbine and of Sandy Hook, Joaquin would still be here.       The lives of hundreds would not have been ripped to pieces.       This was preventable.        Something you can do, and urge your colleagues to do right       this moment, is support the recently introduced universal       background checks bill.        It is now my mission in life to do whatever I can to ensure       that no mother and no father have to endure the pain I have,       that no shining beacon of light, hope, and love like my       Joaquin is snuffed out too soon in a preventable mass       shooting.        We know that he didn't have to die if our leaders had done       enough. Other countries have solved this problem. The roadmap       exists. Please follow it.        Sincerely, Patricia Oliver, Parkland, Florida.    Mr. Speaker, Patricia and Manuel, Joaquin's father, have not allowed  Joaquin to remain a victim. He is an advocate.   Last month, the Olivers visited Capitol Hill with a statue of Joaquin  to deliver this letter and to call for change. It is time to listen to  them, Patricia, Manuel, and Joaquin. We shouldn't have to know the pain  that Patricia and Manny know, that 16 other families in Parkland know,  and that families in every corner of this country know, to do something  about gun violence.   The time to act is now.                            ____________________     One year ago, Madam Speaker, on February 14, 2018, 17  people were killed in a senseless and horrific act of gun violence at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.   I ask the Members of the House of Representatives to use this time to  center their thoughts on the 17 who were killed, the 17 who were  injured, the healing of the Parkland community, and the 40,000 lives  lost to gun violence in every corner of this Nation each year.   I ask that we work together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as  Americans to end this silence with action to make all our communities  safer from gun violence.   I ask that this moment of silence not be in vain, and I ask my  colleagues to please rise and bow your heads as we remember Alyssa  Alhadeff, Scott Beigel, Martin Duque Anguiano, Nicholas Dworet, Aaron  Feis, Jaime Guttenberg, Chris Hixon, Luke Hoyer, Cara Loughran, Gina  Montalto, Joaquin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pollack, Helena Ramsay,  Alex Schachter, Carmen Schentrup, and Peter Wang.
