 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the Lenoir-Rhyne  University's men's lacrosse team for bringing home the NCAA Division II  National Championship in an overwhelming 20-5 victory over Mercyhurst  College.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, the Bears made their first appearance in  the national championship game but came up just short. This time,  though, they would not be denied. In fact, this wasn't just one  dominating game for the Bears, it was a dominating season. All of North  Carolina is proud that Lenoir-Rhyne has brought the national title home  to Hickory. I am proud to represent Lenoir-Rhyne here in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Greg, the Lenoir-Rhyne president,  Dr. Whitt, the entire Lenoir-Rhyne community, and the Greater Hickory  Metro.   Go Bears.                            ____________________
