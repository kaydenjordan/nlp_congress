 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H5783]]  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the  motion to instruct.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this motion would bring TRICARE contraception on par  with the Affordable Care Act by prohibiting cost sharing for any method  of contraception provided in the TRICARE retail pharmacy network or  mail order.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's servicemembers should be provided the same  access to preventive healthcare as those insured under the Affordable  Care Act.   Currently, TRICARE beneficiaries, including non-Active servicemembers  and their dependents, and certain Active military members, do not have  the same access to cost-free preventive care as civilians do.   By requiring coverage for contraceptives with no out-of-pocket costs,  the ACA increases women's access to contraceptives and saves women $255  per year, on average. This is a benefit we currently deny our female  servicemembers. One-third of our U.S. military are women. Currently,  about 15 percent of Active Duty servicemembers and 19 percent of the  Reserve forces are comprised of women.   Women are bravely serving in all parts of the military, including  infantry and other combat units. Servicewomen are continuing to break  barriers across the military, proving again and again that they are  indispensable when it comes to defending this Nation.   Unfortunately, this House continues to refuse these brave  servicemembers access to the same healthcare that all civilian females  have access to.   Preventive healthcare services, including contraception, should be  provided to all TRICARE beneficiaries without any copays. Access to  preventive healthcare is vital for the health and quality of life of  all women serving this Nation, but it is also critical to the readiness  of our military.   In 2008, researchers found that the rate of unintended pregnancy was  roughly 50 percent higher among servicemembers compared to the general  population. This problem is made worse by the fact that it is often  difficult for female servicemembers to access this preventive  medication in the field.   Another recent study found that, among servicemembers who use  contraceptives, only 24 percent brought enough medication to last their  entire deployment. Forty-one percent of those needing refills found  them difficult to obtain while deployed on Active Duty.   We should not make it more difficult for these women to access  contraception by asking them to pay for medication that the civilian  population already receives at no cost. We are doing an absolute  disservice to those who are willing to sacrifice their lives to defend  our Nation every day by denying them preventive healthcare that is  critical to treat certain health conditions and for family planning.   The Senate has included this TRICARE provision in their bill for the  past 2 years because they understand this issue goes beyond political  parties and personal views. This is about the health and well-being of  those who are sacrificing their lives every day to defend our Nation.  This is about providing the resources and delivering policies to the  military that will increase readiness.   This motion would provide all servicemembers access to preventive  healthcare, which they not only deserve, but are entitled to, and I  would say earned.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, today, to put politics aside and  follow in the Senate's footsteps and support this motion.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those comments from my good friend and  chairman of the Armed Services Committee, but the fact of the matter is  that, for 2 years, we have not been able, in conference, to address  this very important issue. There is always one excuse or a barrier  raised at one time or another. And, in fact, what ends up resulting is  our servicewomen, who are putting their lives on the line for our  country, are being treated as second-class citizens. They are not  afforded the same equality as their male counterparts and those in the  civilian world.   Mr. Speaker, what this motion does is simply achieve parity with  prevailing law. I want to point out that TRICARE beneficiaries want  this parity, and it is time we finally deliver.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion. Let us  finally provide all servicemembers with the same access to preventive  healthcare that we all have access to.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
