 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Long Beach Fire  Department Captain David Rosa, who was killed July 2 after suffering a  gunshot wound while responding to a fire at a senior living facility.   Captain Rosa was a 17-year veteran of the Long Beach Fire Department  assigned to station 10 in the heart of the city of Long Beach,  California. During his tenure, David faithfully served the city of Long  Beach and its surrounding communities, working as a paramedic and  trainer.   Last week, I attended his memorial service and saw an outpouring of  love. He was a beloved member of our community and admired by his  family and his firefighter family.   I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the Long Beach Fire  Department, station 10, and Captain Rosa's friends and family,  especially his wife and two sons.                            ____________________
