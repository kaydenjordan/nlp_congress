 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work  on this important legislation.   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens  Act. This legislation will bring much-needed relief to our American  farmers. They put in a great deal of time and money to deal with  duplicative regulations like the one we are addressing here today. This  bill will take away needless provisions regarding pesticide regulations  under the Clean Water Act.   Pesticide applications are already federally regulated by the  Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide,  Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. This permitting was unnecessary and  duplicative, punishing American farmers due to a misguided court  decision.   In my district in Georgia, farmers have to deal with a variety of  environmental difficulties, like the devastating freeze just this last  March. The Federal Government should not be adding redundant mandates  to already overburdened farmers.   The Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act has been passed out of the House  Agriculture Committee five times. It is time for Congress to correct  this mistake and give farmers and pesticide applicators much-needed  relief once and for all.   Mr. Chairman, as a proud cosponsor of this bill, I urge my colleagues  to support this important legislation.
