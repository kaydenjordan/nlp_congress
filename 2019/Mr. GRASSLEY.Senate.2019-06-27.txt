 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 90  seconds as in morning business.    Mr. President, June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month.   It is important to recognize the impact Alzheimer's has on families  in Iowa and across the country and to recognize the cost to taxpayers  because of the care it takes in the last years of their lives. This  disease robs Americans of their memories and impacts their ability to  speak, pay attention, and exercise judgment.   The best way for Congress to help with Alzheimer's disease is to  ensure adequate research funding to find treatments. As Congress  considers appropriations for next year, we should continue to fund  research and work toward curing this disease.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another point, the Supreme Court made  a decision this week that I very much disagree with. I am an advocate  for the Freedom of Information Act and for the public's business being  public, and this Supreme Court decision inhibited that.   In a self-governed society, the people ought to know what their  government is up to. Transparency laws, like the Freedom of Information  Act, help to provide access to information in the face of an opaque and  obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and  new regulations at the EPA and the Department of the Interior are  undermining access to there being public information.   In other words, the public's business ought to be public. So I am  working on legislation to address these developments and to promote  access to government records. Americans deserve an accountable  government, and transparency leads to accountability.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a little lighter note, I am proud to  say that the NBA season concluded with a University of Northern Iowa  graduate's being able to call himself a champion.   The Toronto Raptors' head coach, Nick Nurse, graduated from my alma  mater. He played for the University of Northern Iowa Panthers from 1985  to 1989. Nick went on to coach numerous teams, including for Grand View  University in Des Moines. Nick knows how to reignite hometown pride. He  led the first and only boys' Class 3-A championship for Kuemper  Catholic High School in Carroll, IA. He is a class act. Congratulations  to Nick.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
