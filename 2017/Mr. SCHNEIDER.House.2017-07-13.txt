 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Washington for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support for my amendment to  the National Defense Authorization Act.   Our men and women in uniform are not immune from the epidemic of  opioid addiction, an abuse that is ravaging our country. In fact, the  National Institutes of Health reports opioid misuse are higher among  servicemembers than among civilians, due to the use of these drugs to  treat the symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain.   Our brave servicemembers have earned our gratitude and deserve our  highest quality of care. We need to do all we can to ensure our  military doctors are equipped with the most up-to-  [[Page H5820]]  date, best practices to help fight back against this disease.   This amendment requires medical professionals in the Department of  Defense that prescribe opioids for pain management to undertake 12  hours of training every 3 years in order to prevent overprescribing and  better identify and treat abuse.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense  amendment to ensure that our Active-Duty military get the medical care  they truly deserve.
