 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment to  H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of  2017. This has truly proven to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  reform the disability claims process for the benefit of our Nation's  veterans.   I want to specifically thank Chairman Roe for bringing this bill to  the floor today and for ensuring that the entire process that got us  here was open, fair, bipartisan, and followed regular order. It is  gratefully appreciated, and I think we end up with a good piece of  legislation because of his leadership.   I also want to recognize the efforts of our colleagues, the chairman  of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, Mr.  Bost. He has been an incredible addition to the VA committee and dug  his heels in on this one and got us this far, so I thank him; and to  his counterpart on our side of the aisle, Ranking Member Esty, for  exceptional work that they have done together to get this bill to the  floor.   I would also like to thank our veterans service organizations. This  is how I think the American people think legislation should be brought;  on issues at hand, experts are brought in, Representatives talk. The  expertise that was brought by the VSOs helped us work out some of the  kinks. It is not perfect, but the coalition got us to a point where I  think many of us are comfortable moving forward.   The bill is complicated. To those who still have concerns in the  process, let us know. There is still work to be done. It is still  working in the Senate, but there is an openness that has been expressed  through the entire process.   Secretary Shulkin and the VA leadership have been vital in this  effort. They helped pull the stakeholders together, providing the  technical expertise to help us understand what it takes over the past  several years.   I want to recognize our former colleague on the committee, Dina  Titus. She is going to be speaking a little bit later, but I think what  is so important on veterans issues, members come and go from the  committee, but their commitment to getting this right stays. And her  tenaciousness in the 114th Congress laid the groundwork for this.   So in short, Mr. Speaker, as you heard the chairman say, there are  470,000 veterans. Each one of them is an individual. Each one of them  is someone's friend, father, mother, sister, brother. It is time we  peel back the layers of the complicated rules governing the process,  modernize it with new technology, and get the benefits delivered in a  timely manner to those who have earned them. I support the manager's  amendment to H.R. 2288 and encourage all my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. Esty), my good friend, ranking member of the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.  [[Page H4465]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), my friend and the vice ranking member of the  full Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), my good friend and, more importantly, a friend  to all veterans, a new member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus), a good friend and former ranking  member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee,  and someone who has worked on this almost longer than anyone in the  House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I applaud all the work that was done on behalf of our veterans  and those that are waiting. I thank the professional staff on both  sides of the aisle for doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank this House for proving to the American people  that we can work together for a common good. We can make improvements  and we can move things along as they are meant to be.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the comments of Chairman Roe and  I support H.R. 467. I also thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Walorski) for crafting this. She was, and still remains, a staunch  supporter of veterans, always advocating for them. She taught me much,  including, I think, the definition of Hoosier. I am still a little  confused on that one, but we are working on it.   By holding the VA leadership accountable, we can ensure that the VA  is accessible to all veterans. While the VA has made progress to  shorten wait times, we cannot rest on our laurels. If one veteran's  health is compromised because she or he was unable to receive timely  care, then the VA has failed in its mission.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I ask my colleagues to stand in support  of Mrs. Walorski's bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana  for her passion and for the chairman to bring this commonsense  accountability piece to the floor.   I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congressman Zeldin's bill,  H.R. 1005. This legislation is a timely solution to a problem that  affects many of our aging veteran populations. Nursing homes are often  a family's last resort, and I believe that is the way it should remain.  By allowing veterans to receive daily care and assistance at a nursing  home and then return to their homes at night, veterans will receive the  care, medical support, and attention they need without sacrificing the  community family support and independence they want.   For that reason, I ask my colleagues to support this really smart  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 1005, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1162. With all of the things  that you heard the chairman talk about and substance abuse disorder on  the rise, the VA should continue to explore the benefits of alternative  treatments and how best to provide care to our veterans.   Medical providers must think outside of the box and find effective  ways to treat the symptoms a veteran is experiencing, and do so in a  way that does not compromise a veteran's health, relationships, and  progress towards a successful transition home.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I would ask my colleagues to support  this important piece of legislation and start moving in a direction  that serves our veterans with the best treatment for them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Knight) for his innovative approach in trying to get services to our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join us in passing H.R.  1162.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1545 offered by the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), who is the ranking member  of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and, as importantly,  a champion of policies that make sure the scourge of opioid addiction  is addressed in this Congress, and is a leading expert on it.  [[Page H4474]]    This legislation would make significant progress towards curbing  substance abuse disorders and diversion of prescription medication in  our veteran population.   As you heard, currently, a veteran's dependent can receive a  prescription for a controlled substance from a provider in the  community, and then they receive the same prescription for the same  controlled substance from a VA provider without either provider's  knowledge of what happened.   Congress, in the past, has attempted to remedy this problem but, due  to confusion within the VA, was unsuccessful. I believe that  Congresswoman Kuster's legislation would clear up this confusion and  allow the VA to better serve both veterans and their dependents by  allowing the VA and community providers to recognize and treat  substance abuse disorders instead of contributing to them by  unintentionally overprescribing.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support this legislation. I would encourage all  of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my good friend and the ranking member of the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and a critical partner in  serving our veterans.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Walz) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) for  their support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on my bill, H.R. 1545, the VA  Prescription Accountability Act. This bill demonstrates the power of  bipartisanship in this Congress, especially on the House VA Committee.   I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) for his willingness to  co-lead this bill with me, and also the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bergman) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley) for  cosponsoring this commonsense legislation.   This bill is common sense because it improves upon the Prescription  Drug Monitoring Programs, also known as PDMPs across this country.  PDMPs are proven resources in combating our Nation's opioid epidemic.  PDMPs improve the public health and our general well-being.   In 2012, the VA was finally authorized to connect its patient  population to State PDMPs. But, unfortunately, an issue with the VA's  antiquated computer systems meant that literally hundreds of thousands  of nonveteran patients at the VA were left excluded from the data  reported to PDMPs by the VA.   As the ranking member of the House Veterans' Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee, I am all too familiar with the continued  issues with computer systems across the entirety of the VA. This issue  underscores the need for the VA and this Congress to ensure effective  and rapid reform to the VA's computer systems. When those systemic  shortcomings potentially exacerbate the Nation's opioid epidemic, I saw  the importance to take action.   Through my Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, we in Congress have learned  the importance of ensuring prescription opioids are not misused. The  consequences are truly dire. Over 30,000 Americans die in opioid- related overdoses every year. That number just continues to rise.   This bill represents a small but practical step forward in addressing  this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this  low-cost bill. It will help ensure these important programs work as  intended by closing the gap in prescription information. I urge my  Senate colleagues to quickly take up the bill and pass it in the Senate  as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), our vice ranking member of the full Committee  on Veterans' Affairs and a true champion of veterans.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in passing  H.R. 1545.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this piece of legislation.   I want to thank the chairman personally for bringing this forward and  for being very eloquent in his words on what this does. It is  appropriate that it is part of this block of legislation dealing with  appeals reform also.   I thank the folks who have worked on this for years: Mr. Denham, Mr.  Langevin, Ms. McSally, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Costello, Ms. Kuster, Mr.  Higgins of New York, and Ms. Shea-Porter.   As originally introduced, this bill sought to change a current  requirement stipulating that initial physical examinations of those  seeking to file disability claims must be conducted by the VA. It was  to allow veterans to see a local doctor.   Again, as the chairman so clearly pointed out, it was to relieve some  of the pressure on the VA, while recognizing we have quality, ethically  trustworthy physicians in the private sector who can deliver some of  these services. The idea was that requiring the VA to accept private  medical evidence from a qualified physician would ease the benefit  process in rural communities, expedite diagnosis of disabilities, and  reduce the wait times and the backlogs.   This is a problem that we have been working on for many years. We  introduced similar language in 2013, 2014, and 2015.   I would like to thank all my fellow members, both on and off the  committee, and those who are no longer in Congress for working toward  this. I am especially thankful to Chairman Bost and Ms. Esty for having  worked with me to tighten the scope of this bill to address the cost  that the Congressional Budget Office scored it to.   As it is now, the bill requires an annual report on how veterans  obtain private medical evidence in support of their claim, how often it  is rejected, and why. It is my hope that this data will help build our  case for mandating that the VA accept all credible private medical  evidence. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and need  to get started gathering this data as soon as possible.   As we also work to improve the appeals process today, making it more  convenient for veterans to get and submit medical evidence, this  component will be important. By continuing our work on this issue,  veterans will be able to complete their claims faster; start receiving  the benefits that they have earned faster; and make sure that the  stress you heard about with 20 years of waiting, much of that time  [[Page H4476]]  seeing private physicians and gathering evidence to support the very  claim that is being denied, this piece of legislation should make sense  with that.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone involved with this. I urge my  colleagues to support this piece of legislation, H.R. 1725.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to support H.R. 1329, as amended. The Veterans' Compensation  Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act provides a 1-year cost-of-living  adjustment for the rate of compensation for veterans with service- connected disabilities as well as the rates of dependency and indemnity  compensation for survivors.   As most of us know, this adjustment is tied directly to the rates of  increase in Social Security benefits. Disability payments are vital to  the economic well-being of most veterans, and that support should never  be eroded by inflation. This bill ensures that does not happen.   I thank Chairman Roe for bringing the bill to us in a totally  bipartisan process, and the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs, as always.   The names of Chairman Bost and Ranking Member Esty have been brought  up a lot today. It says something about it. They are tackling issues  that have lasted years. They are bringing up important issues that are  going to impact the well-being of veterans. You heard them both say it.  They did so in a bipartisan manner that I think serves the reputation  of this House well. We sorely need more true bipartisan problem solving  like this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1329. But as we get ready to  close on the final piece of seven pieces of legislation, some that have  taken years, that have included diverse groups coming together to try  to find solutions, you are seeing today all seven of these bills are  going to pass this House. They are going to pass with overwhelmingly,  if not unanimous, bipartisan support.   I have stood on this floor and have expressed my displeasure and my  discomfort when we don't work together. Today it is one of those  pleasures to stand here and say this is what the American people  expect, and this is the hard work that needs to be done. That kind of  thing does not happen by chance. It usually takes one person standing  at the middle of that in leadership to make it happen.   I would like to thank my friend and colleague, our chairman of the  committee, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), for ensuring that  veterans come before politics, veterans come before partisan  differences, and that veterans legislation can be done together in a  bipartisan manner. So, I thank him for that and encourage support of  all of these pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
