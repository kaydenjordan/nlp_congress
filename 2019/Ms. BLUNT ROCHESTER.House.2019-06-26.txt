 Mr. Speaker, since January, the House of  Representatives has passed bills lowering prescription drug prices,  strengthening protections for preexisting conditions, and making sure  Americans can find affordable, quality health insurance coverage.   I know thousands of Delawareans, small businesses, and millennials  all across the board are struggling to afford the healthcare that they  need, and in 2019 that is unacceptable.   Many of us saw hope and help when the Affordable Care Act was passed,  and my commitment to the American people is protecting the ground that  we gained while strengthening this landmark legislation.   As part of that commitment, six bills stabilizing the ACA and  lowering the cost of prescription drugs were incorporated into my bill,  the MORE Health Education Act, and the entire package passed the House  a few weeks ago.   This bill will help lower the cost of prescription drugs by bringing  generics to the market faster, helping Americans understand health  insurance options available to them, and protect those with preexisting  conditions.   I am proud that this legislation passed the House of Representatives,  and I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure that these  bills become law.   Every American deserves quality healthcare that is accessible and  affordable, and we will keep fighting for our States and for the  country.                            ____________________
