 Colleagues, let me just say, this next vote will be  the last vote of the evening.   Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the nomination, and I  move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Presiding Officer of the Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on  the part of the Senate to join with a like committee on the part of the  House of Representatives to escort the President of the United States  into the House Chamber for the joint session to be held at 9 p.m. on  Tuesday, February 28, 2017.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 69, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, February 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Zinke nomination postcloture; finally, that all  time during leader remarks, morning business, recess, and adjournment  of the Senate count postcloture on the Zinke nomination.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of Mr. Daines.
