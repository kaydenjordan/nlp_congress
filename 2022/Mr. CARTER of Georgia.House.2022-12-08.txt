 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ross  Sheppard for his recent selection to the Georgia 40 Under 40 list.   Ross is a successful real estate agent who wants to help buyers and  sellers understand the value that historic preservation brings to the  housing markets.   While many people view historic preservation and real estate  development as conflicting ideas, Ross sees it differently. His desire  to show people that preservation is a sustainable economic path for  real estate has led him into philanthropic pursuits.   A member of the Georgia Trust and the Historic Savannah Foundation, a  board member of Georgia's Old Capital Heritage Center, and a former  board member of the Flannery O'Connor Andalusia Foundation, Sheppard's  passion for preservation is a leading force in his life.   He has renovated and rehabilitated several historic homes, with one  of his projects being featured on HGTV's ``Life Under Renovation.''   He was chosen as Humanitarian of the Year by his alma mater, Georgia  College, and has endowed a scholarship there.   Ross resides in Savannah's Landmark Historic District, one of the  most beautiful parts of Georgia's First Congressional District. He  leads a life dedicated to showing others the beauty that lies beneath  the surface by championing historic preservation.   I, on behalf of the entire First Congressional District of Georgia,  congratulate him for his outstanding service to this State and his  selection to the Georgia 40 Under 40 list.                            ____________________
