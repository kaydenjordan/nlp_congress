(e) Sunset.--Section 60126 of title 51, United States Code,       is amended by striking ``September 30, 2020'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2030''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 6845, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6845, the Commercial  Remote Sensing Amendment Act of 2022. I thank Science Committee Ranking  Member Lucas for introducing this bipartisan bill, and Representative  Ed Perlmutter, a member of our Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics  that I chair, for being an original cosponsor.   This bill will provide increased transparency in the licensing of  commercial remote sensing systems by requiring the regulatory agency,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide  additional reporting on the licensing of commercial remote sensing  systems.   The bill also amends the statute to ensure that the time required for  issuing commercial remote sensing licenses aligns with updated  regulations.   I am pleased that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology  strengthened the bill in its consideration of the legislation. An  amendment we sponsored added further annual reporting requirements on  the applications for licenses submitted and licenses issued.   The amendment also sustained the sunset clause of annual reporting.  The sunset date of 2030 will ensure that we go back, review the law,  and stay responsive to changes in this rapidly growing commercial space  sector.   Commercial remote sensing is a highly competitive global industry,  with $2.6 billion in revenue for 2020 alone, according to a report of  the Satellite Industry Association.   Commercial remote sensing data are used in energy, agriculture,  disaster monitoring, mapping, national security applications, and much  more. This bill provides Congress with transparency in information that  will benefit our oversight of the licensing and regulation of this  important and growing industry.   I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 6845, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time to  speak at this time, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6845,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7569) to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a  program to provide financial assistance to graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of study relating to  cybersecurity and energy infrastructure.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 7569         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Cybersecurity       University Leadership Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. ENERGY CYBERSECURITY UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in energy-      related critical infrastructure after an intrusion occurs is       inefficient, ineffective, and costly.        (2) Integrating cybersecurity considerations into the       research, design, and development of energy infrastructure       represents a cost-effective approach to enhancing the       security, resilience, and reliability of the electric grid,       oil and natural gas pipelines, and other energy distribution,       transmission, and generation systems.        (3) Successfully employing the approach outlined in       paragraph (2) as a guiding principle for the Department's       energy infrastructure activities will require a diverse,       inclusive, and highly skilled workforce which possesses       energy-specific cybersecurity expertise and familiarity with       associated research, development, and demonstration needs.        (4) A dedicated science scholarship program at the       Department for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers       studying energy-specific cybersecurity disciplines could help       address the challenges stated in paragraphs (1) through (3).        (b) Program.--        (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish       an Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Program       (referred to in this section as the ``Program'') to carry out       the activities described in paragraph (2).        (2) Program activities.--The Secretary shall--        (A) provide financial assistance, on a competitive basis,       for scholarships, fellowships, and research and development       projects at institutions of higher education to support       graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing a       course of study that integrates cybersecurity competencies       within disciplines associated with energy infrastructure       needs;        (B) provide graduate students and postdoctoral researchers       supported under the Program with research traineeship       experiences at National Laboratories and utilities; and        (C) conduct outreach to historically Black colleges and       universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and minority-      serving institutions.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources of the Senate a report on the development and       implementation of the Program.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the       Department of Energy.        (2) Historically black college and university.--The term       ``historically Black college and university'' has the meaning       given the term ``part B institution'' in section 322 of the       Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061).        (3) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of       1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).        (4) Minority-serving institution.--The term ``minority-      serving institution'' means an eligible institution under       section 371(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1067q(a)).        (5) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory''       has the meaning given such term in section 2 of the Energy       Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801).        (6) Tribal college or university.--The term ``Tribal       College or University'' has the meaning given such term in       section 316(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1059c(b)).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 7569, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7569, the Energy  Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2022.   This bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish a program  to support graduate students and postdoctoral researchers pursuing  coursework at the intersection of cybersecurity and energy  infrastructure.   In doing so, the bill aims to empower the Department of Energy to  train a new generation of scientists and engineers who can design and  develop energy infrastructure systems with cybersecurity considerations  from the very start.   In addition, to financial assistance for scholarships, fellowships,  and research projects, awardees will be provided with research  traineeships at national laboratories and utilities to gain practical,  hands-on experience with developing new tools and technology.   Furthermore, the bill explicitly encourages the Department to  leverage this program as a tool for diversifying the high-skilled  workforce by expanding outreach to historically Black colleges and  universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving  institutions.   In sum, this bill represents a necessary and fundamental change from  our current approach to securing our infrastructure, where  cybersecurity solutions are retroactively applied only after attack has  actually occurred.   I thank Representative Ross for introducing this thoughtful  legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7569.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Ross).    Madam Speaker, with great thanks to Ms. Ross for her  leadership and to my friend, Ranking Member Lucas, for his support, I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7569, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6933) to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require  reporting relating to certain cost-share requirements.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 6933         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cost-Share Accountability       Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.         Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C.       16352) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Reporting.--Not later than 120 days after the       enactment of the Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2022, and       at least quarterly thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to       the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and Committee       on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee       on Appropriations of the Senate, and shall make publicly       available, a report on the use by the Department during the       period covered by the report of the authority to reduce or       eliminate cost-sharing requirements provided by subsections       (b)(3) or (c)(2).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 6933, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6933, the Cost-Share  Accountability Act of 2022. Many of the clean-energy technologies  deployed throughout the Nation today have benefited from financial  support from the Department of Energy. The Cost-Share Accountability  Act of 2022 would strengthen reporting requirements related to certain  cost-share requirements at the Department of Energy. Better reporting  on financial assistance will help us ensure that taxpayer dollars are  being spent wisely.   Madam Speaker, I thank Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee  Ranking Member Obernolte and Chairman Foster for their work on this  important legislation, and I urge adoption of H.R. 6933.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support H.R.  6933, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7289) to provide for the National Academies to study and  report on a Federal research agenda to advance the understanding of  PFAS, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 7289         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal PFAS Research       Evaluation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)       are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in a       wide range of products since the 1940s including firefighting       foam, carpeting, packaging, and cookware. There are more than       5,000 types of registered PFAS compounds. This chemical class       is not currently regulated at the Federal level.        (2) PFAS have been detected in air, water, soil, food,       biosolids, and more. They can accumulate and remain in the       body for a long time, and potentially lead to serious health       effects including cancer, low infant birthweight, liver and       kidney issues, reproductive and developmental problems, and       more.        (3) There remains much unknown about PFAS toxicity, human       and environmental health effects, exposure pathways, as well       as effective removal, treatment, and destruction methods, and       safe alternatives to PFAS.        (4) Federal research efforts have been fragmented at       various agencies and struggled to  [[Page H7093]]       effectively address the full scope of challenges presented by       PFAS.        (5) Regulatory action and cleanup depend on scientific       analysis of toxicity data, decision making on how best to       deal with PFAS, and understanding the significance of the       many exposure pathways that exist. A consensus study by the       National Academies would help inform decisions by Federal and       State Governments, industry, and other stakeholders on how to       best address PFAS.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORTS.         (a) Research Assessments of PFAS.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date on       which amounts are appropriated for fiscal year 2023 to carry       out this section, the Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency, in consultation with the Director of the       National Science Foundation, the Secretary of Defense, the       Director of the National Institutes of Health, and other       Federal agencies with expertise relevant to understanding       PFAS exposure, behavior, and toxicity, shall enter into an       agreement with the National Academies to conduct a study and       submit a report in accordance with this subsection to further       address research and knowledge gaps identified by the Federal       Government Human Health PFAS Research Workshop held on       October 26 and 27, 2020, and identify research and       development needed to identify, categorize, evaluate, and       address individual or total PFAS.

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.         Not later than 180 days after submission to Congress of       latest of the National Academies reports under section 3, the       Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in       coordination with all relevant Federal agencies, shall submit       to Congress an implementation plan for increased       collaboration and coordination of Federal PFAS research,       development, and demonstration activities. In preparing such       an implementation plan, the Director shall take into       consideration the recommendations included in the reports in       section 3.       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) National academies.--The term ``National Academies''       means the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and       Medicine.        (2) PFAS.--The term ``PFAS'' means per- and polyfluoroalkyl       substances, including mixtures of such substances.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7289, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7289, the Federal PFAS  Research Evaluation Act.   PFAS are a class of substances that are commonly referred to as  forever chemicals because of their persistence throughout the  environment. These chemicals are found within countless household items  such as cooking appliances, weatherproof clothing, and even food  packaging.   While this heat-, water-, and oil-resistant chemical was created over  80 years ago to solve problems, it has become increasingly clear it has  created more problems than it solved.   Traces of PFAS can also be found within the human body, animals,  drinking water, fish, and soil. In fact, a recent report by the CDC  found PFAS was in the blood of 97 percent of Americans.   Despite the shocking finding on the prevalence of PFAS in the human  body, there is little data that examines the long-term health and  environmental implications of these artificial chemicals. There are  also many research gaps in our understanding of these substances  overall.   H.R. 7289 would help address these gaps by authorizing the  Environmental Protection Agency to enter into agreements with the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study the  impact of PFAS on human and environmental health through a series of  reports. These reports would touch on outstanding questions such as  human exposure pathways to PFAS. They would also help to identify  critical research gaps related to managing PFAS and examining safe  chemical alternatives.   Finally, these studies would inform an Office of Science and  Technology Policy implementation plan for Federal research,  development, and demonstration activities for PFAS.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Science Committee,  Representatives Lizzie Fletcher and Peter Meijer, for introducing this  commonsense and bipartisan legislation, and I encourage my colleagues  to support its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time to  speak on this bill, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, urge my colleagues to support H.R.  7289, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3952) to strengthen the role of the Chief Scientist of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in order to promote  scientific integrity and advance the Administration's world-class  research and development portfolio.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3952         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NOAA Chief Scientist Act''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Saving Clause.--The individual serving as Chief       Scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration on the day before the date of the enactment of       this Act may continue to so serve until such time as the       Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration selects such a Chief Scientist in accordance       with subsection (d) of section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 4       of 1970 (5 U.S.C. App), as amended by subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3952, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3952, the NOAA Chief  Scientist Act.   Scientific integrity is a critical component of scientific research.   NOAA supports the American public in a variety of ways but is well  known for its provision of civilian weather forecasts, watches, and  warnings. This is why it is important for the agency to  [[Page H7096]]  be considered a trusted scientific authority. The role of NOAA's chief  scientist is pivotal in this respect.   While this position is statutorily defined, prior to this bill, the  role lacked clear expectations and responsibilities or even  qualifications. This has led to inconsistencies in how the role has  been carried out historically.   This bill clarifies the role of the chief scientist to ensure that  they adhere to and uphold scientific integrity directives at NOAA.   This commitment to scientific integrity at the highest levels of  NOAA's leadership further underscores its importance to the agency's  mission. This bill also requires the NOAA administrator to consider  candidates with an established background of practice-led research and  scientific achievement in fields relevant to NOAA's mission. This  ensures the chief scientist will have pertinent experiences and  expertise to draw from while carrying out this role.   H.R. 3952 also establishes an Office of the Chief Scientist within  NOAA. Critically, this office will support the chief scientist's  efforts to foster an environment that would encourage the recruitment  and retention of a diverse scientific workforce. Diversity is a key  component of ensuring that all voices and research perspectives are  heard.   Attracting scientists with a diversity of backgrounds and expertise  will allow NOAA to approach research questions from new perspectives.   I also take a moment to acknowledge NOAA's recent appointment of Dr.  Sarah Kapnick as NOAA's chief scientist. Dr. Kapnick has a rich  background that includes experience as a physical scientist at NOAA and  more recently in the private sector. She embodies many of the qualities  identified for consideration in a chief scientist that this bill  requires, and I congratulate her on her selection.   I also thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill) and the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra) for working together to introduce  this bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill's  passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3952,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7361) to upgrade the communications service used by the  National Weather Service, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7361         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.          This Act may be cited as the ``National Weather Service       Communications Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS.         (a) In General.--Title IV of the Weather Research and       Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (15 U.S.C. 8541 et seq.)       is amended by adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 415. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS.         ``(a) System Upgrade.--The Director of the National Weather       Service shall improve the instant messaging service used by       National Weather Service personnel by implementing a       commercial off-the-shelf communications solution hosted on       the public cloud to serve as a replacement for the       communications system in use as of the date of the enactment       of this section (commonly referred to as `NWSChat'). Such       communications solution shall satisfy requirements set forth       by the Director to best accommodate future growth and perform       successfully with increased numbers of users.        ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000 for       each of fiscal years 2023 through 2026, to remain available       until expended.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act       of 2017 is amended by inserting after the item relating to       section 414 the following new item:  ``Sec. 415. National Weather Service communications.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 7361, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7361, the National Weather  Service Communications Improvement Act.   This bipartisan bill, introduced by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Feenstra) directs the National Weather Service to improve its current  instant messaging communication service, also known as NWSChat.   NWSChat is a vital tool used by National Weather Service  professionals to communicate with emergency managers, the media, and  other strategic partners during high-impact and severe weather events.  This tool ensures that the media and emergency response managers can  retrieve real-time information to help protect Americans and their  property during dangerous events.   However, NWSChat has experienced several issues recently which have  caused delays in the National Weather Service's ability to share  critical weather information. This bill would help to address these  issues by requiring the National Weather Service to transition NWSChat  to an up-to-date, cloud-based commercial platform.   Just last week, the National Weather Service announced that it would  be upgrading its chat service to use the commercially available Slack  collaborative platform. It was reassuring to see the Weather Service  take this step to address the recent outages and issues with NWSChat.   This bill will help support the agency with clear congressional  direction and corresponding authorization of appropriations language to  help ensure a seamless transition of NWSChat to this new platform.   Reliable and uninterrupted communication is critical during severe  weather events. The National Weather Service Communications Improvement  Act will support the improvement of this lifesaving tool.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support H.R.  7361, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3588) to coordinate Federal research and development efforts  focused on modernizing mathematics in STEM education through  mathematical and statistical modeling, including data-driven and  computational thinking, problem, project, and performance-based  learning and assessment, interdisciplinary exploration, and career  connections, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3588         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mathematical and Statistical       Modeling Education Act''.       SEC. 2. MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL MODELING EDUCATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The mathematics taught in schools, including       statistical problem solving and data science, is not keeping       pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the public and       private sector, resulting in a STEM skills shortage and       employers needing to expend resources to train and upskill       employees.        (2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United       States will need 1,000,000 additional STEM professionals than       it is on track to produce in the coming decade.        (3) The field of data science, which is relevant in almost       every workplace, relies on the ability to work in teams and       use computational tools to do mathematical and statistical       problem solving.        (4) Many STEM occupations offer higher wages, more       opportunities for advancement, and a higher degree of job       security than non-STEM jobs.        (5) The STEM workforce relies on computational and data-      driven discovery, decision making, and predictions, from       models that often must quantify uncertainty, as in weather       predictions, spread of disease, or financial forecasting.        (6) Most fields, including analytics, science, economics,       publishing, marketing, actuarial science, operations       research, engineering, and medicine, require data savvy,       including the ability to select reliable sources of data,       identify and remove errors in data, recognize and quantify       uncertainty in data, visualize and analyze data, and use data       to develop understanding or make predictions.        (7) Rapidly emerging fields, such as artificial       intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing and quantum       information, all rely on mathematical and statistical       concepts, which are critical to prove under what       circumstances an algorithm or experiment will work and when       it will fail.        (8) Military academies have a long tradition in teaching       mathematical modeling and would benefit from the ability to       recruit students with this expertise from their other school       experiences.        (9) Mathematical modeling has been a strong educational       priority globally, especially in China, where participation       in United States mathematical modeling challenges in high       school and higher education is orders of magnitude higher       than in the United States, and Chinese teams are taking a       majority of the prizes.        (10) Girls participate in mathematical modeling challenges       at all levels at similar levels as boys, while in traditional       mathematical competitions girls participate less and drop out       at every stage. Students cite opportunity for teamwork, using       mathematics and statistics in meaningful contexts, ability to       use computation, and emphasis on communication as reasons for       continued participation in modeling challenges.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3588, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3588, the Mathematical and  Statistical Modeling Education Act. I thank Representatives Chrissy  Houlahan and  Jim Baird for introducing this bill.   U.S. capabilities in science and innovation are critical for our  future prosperity, national security, and global competitiveness. I am  thrilled that this week the House will consider landmark legislation  that will accelerate progress on cutting-edge science and technology.  However, we cannot fully realize this vision unless we build a domestic  STEM workforce that is poised to turn these investments into  breakthrough discoveries and transformative innovations. To that end,  we must address the longstanding challenges in K-12 STEM education.   H.R. 3588 will advance research to improve mathematics education by  incorporating statistical modeling into mathematics curriculum. We know  that students from diverse backgrounds are attracted to STEM if they  can see it as a tool for solving real-world challenges. This bill will  help researchers develop innovative teaching methods to do just that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Madam Speaker, so far this year, I have completed two undergraduate  mathematics courses at George Mason University. Calculus II starts on  August 22.   I will tell you personally the evolution of the teaching of math has  come so far since I graduated from college. I am very excited by this  legislation. The thought that we can take so much progress in teaching  and software to our next generation of students is very exciting.  [[Page H7101]]    As I sit, sometimes in despair, watching my friends get out their  calculators to figure out the 15 percent or 20 percent tip, I think  this would be wonderful legislation to move forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3588, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7180) to authorize the Director of the National Science  Foundation to award grants to support research on the disruption of  regular cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infection, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7180         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Brycen Gray and Ben Price       COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act--        (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the       National Science Foundation;        (2) the term ``National Academies'' means the National       Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine; and        (3) the term ``eligible entity'' means an institution of       higher education (as such term is defined in section 102 of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)) or a       consortium composed of non-profit organizations and       institutions of higher education.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect       of life across the globe. Furthermore, it has produced major       disruptions of individual's physical and mental health,       including with respect of children and adolescents.        (2) Historical epidemiological perspectives suggest an       association between exposure to general respiratory viruses       and subsequent disruption of regular cognitive processes.        (3) Early research suggests that one in three individuals       diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection experiences a disruption       of regular cognitive processes within six months of such       diagnosis.        (4) Research is urgently needed to better understand why       disruption in regular cognitive processes occur in patients       as a consequence of a COVID-19 infection and how long such       disruptions can continue after recovery.        (5) The National Science Foundation has a deep history of       supporting interdisciplinary, basic research that spans the       social, behavioral, and fundamental biological sciences and       paves the way for scientific advancements.       SEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH.         The Director shall award grants to eligible entities,       including through the RAPID funding mechanism, on a       competitive, merit-reviewed basis to support       interdisciplinary research on the disruption of regular       cognitive processes associated with both short-term and long-      term COVID-19 infections, including with respect to children       and adolescents. Such research may include the following:        (1) Foundational studies on the effects of cognition,       emotion, and neural structure and function relating to any       disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with       COVID-19 infection.        (2) Analysis of findings on the disruption of regular       cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infection,       including the development of predictive theoretical       frameworks to guide future research.        (3) Development of physical and conceptual tools needed to       evaluate cognition, emotion, and neural structure and       function of the brain as a consequence of a COVID-19       infection, and the potential relevance of such infection to       the disruption of regular cognitive processes.        (4) Studies on the relevance of psychological and       psychosocial factors, including major disruptions of physical       health, mental health, and economic stability associated with       the COVID-19 pandemic, on the disruption of regular cognitive       processes, including an identification and evaluation of such       factors.        (5) Any other activities the Director determines will       support interdisciplinary research and collaboration on the       disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with       COVID-19 infection, including with respect to children and       adolescents.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL ACADEMIES STUDY ON THE DISRUPTION OF                     COGNITIVE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19                     INFECTION.         (a) Study.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director shall enter into an       agreement with the National Academies to study and produce a       report on the disruption of cognitive processes associated       with COVID-19 infection. The study shall--        (A) review the research literature and identify research       gaps regarding Federal programs and activities with roles in       addressing both short-term and long-term consequences       associated with COVID-19 infection;        (B) assess the necessity of establishing causal inference       approaches into research on the impacts of COVID-19 infection       on cognitive processes to determine reverse causation;        (C) evaluate and make recommendations regarding the       coordination of research and data collection, including with       respect to children and adolescents, to identify the       disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with       COVID-19 infection, including long-term COVID-19;        (D) evaluate impacts of COVID-19 infection on populations       under-represented in cognitive literature, such as poor,       rural, and minority populations; and        (E) make recommendations regarding ways to coordinate       engagement with researchers and stakeholders from       universities, industry, public health organizations, State       and local governments, elementary and secondary educational       organizations, and non-profit organizations to ensure that       research, information, and best practices relating to the       disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with       COVID-19 infection, including long-term COVID-19, are shared       among such entities.        (2) Completion.--The study required under paragraph (1)       shall be completed by not later than the date that is 16       months after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (b) Reports.--        (1) By the national academies.--Upon completion of the       study under subsection (a), the National Academies shall       transmit to the Director and Congress a report on such study.        (2) By the director.--Not later than three months after       receipt of the report under paragraph (1), the Director shall       transmit to Congress a summary of the Director's plans, if       any, to implement the recommendations of the National       Academies contained in such report.       SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director to       carry out this Act $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2023, to       remain available through fiscal year 2025, of which       $1,000,000 is authorized to carry out the study and produce       the reports under section 5.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7180, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7180, the Brycen Gray and  Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act. I thank Representative  Gonzalez for introducing this important bill.   The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted our lives in countless ways over  the past 2 years. As many of us continue to pick up the pieces and  settle into a new normal, we can't lose sight of those who haven't been  as fortunate.   Early research results indicate that a COVID-19 infection may leave  individuals with an increased risk of developing mental health  conditions. Millions who have been infected with COVID-19 now find  themselves saddled with crippling anxiety, depression, and sleep  problems, and they may be at an increased risk of death by suicide and  drug overdose.                                time  1530    While researchers are raising alarms about these risks, improved data  collection and additional research is needed to better understand the  mental health implications of a COVID-19 infection. This bill directs  the National  [[Page H7102]]  Science Foundation to rally the research community to take on this  task.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, thank Congressman Gonzalez for  offering this bill. I suspect there is nary a family represented in  this body that has not been touched by a mental illness at one point or  another and the tragedy and the suffering that that involves. We have  all seen what happens with the loss of a child.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7180, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
