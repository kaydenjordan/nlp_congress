 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise  awareness about the single greatest threat to Tennessee's lake and  river systems. Invasive Asian carp are destroying Tennessee's native  fisheries across the State.   If ignored, these fish will decimate recreation, sporting, and  tourism industries that rely on more than 60,000 miles of streams and  rivers in my State.   For years, the focal point for combating Asian carp has been in the  North, particularly the Great Lakes. However, this continued threat has  spread through the Southeast. It is time to recognize that this species  is invading States like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama.   Congress needs to take action, or we are going to lose some of the  most biologically diverse rivers and bass fishing in the country.   Asian carp have the capacity to destroy the food systems of highly  valued recreational and commercial fisheries, which generate $2 billion  in economic impact annually in Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, this issue cannot be ignored, and I implore my  colleagues to work with me to combat the invasion of Asian carp in  Tennessee and throughout the Southeast.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my  amendment to increase funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking  Areas program by $5 million.   I have had numerous conversations with law enforcement throughout my  district, and it is crystal clear that the opioid epidemic continues to  be one of their primary concerns. Our drug task forces in the Eighth  Congressional District desperately need these resources, as we have  seen a spike in narcotics trafficking along Interstate 40 in Tennessee.   Mr. Chairman, I know that many of my colleagues are having similar  discussions in their district, so they understand just how serious this  issue is becoming for the safety and the security of the American  people. It is no secret that the spread of illegal drugs throughout  west Tennessee and across the Nation leads to higher crime rates, which  ultimately increases the financial strain on our local, State, and  Federal law enforcement.   We must do more to support law enforcement in this fight. This  amendment will provide necessary funds for additional equipment and  man-hours to conduct and carry out lengthy investigations to arrest  these drug traffickers. The brave men and women in uniform are working  tirelessly on the front lines to combat the opioid epidemic, and we  can't afford to simply sit back and watch.   We also must think of the resources needed to battle the drug  addiction epidemic, such as the opioid crisis. The extra funding will  take major steps to target these high-risk areas in a front-end  approach to preventing the spread of the opioid crisis in our  communities. We must be proactive now, because prevention is the best  long-term solution.   I am a former United States attorney, and I have seen firsthand how  much these funds can make a huge difference in forward progress. I  believe that funding the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program  is a good first step to supporting our law enforcement and combating  rampant opioid epidemics.   Law enforcement at the local, State, and Federal level have expressed  support for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same  today.   I also want to thank my colleagues, Mrs. Comstock and Mr. McKinley,  for their hard work and support of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2030
