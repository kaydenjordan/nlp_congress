 Mr. President, I rise today to welcome home and  congratulate a young man from my home State of Louisiana, Mr. Mason  Williams Andrews. Mr. Andrews just achieved his mission of setting a  new world record as the youngest solo pilot to complete a  circumnavigation of the globe, as Mason is about 4 months younger than  the current record holder.   Mr. Andrews set out on July 22, on ``Mason's MedCamps Mission'' from  Monroe, LA, in an effort to achieve the new world record, as well as  raise funding and awareness about MedCamps, which is a summer camp for  children with disabilities and illnesses. Today Mr. Andrews has  achieved both of his goals and will make his official and final landing  in Monroe tomorrow morning, Saturday, October 6.   It is my honor to recognize Mr. Andrews on a job well done. We are  grateful for his safe return and applaud his courageous efforts to help  a worthy cause by raising over $25,000 for MedCamps throughout his 2  month journey.   On behalf of the people of Louisiana, I would like to express my  congratulations to Mason and thank him for his efforts in helping  MedCamps continue their mission of serving children.                            ____________________
