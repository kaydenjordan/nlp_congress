 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member on the  committee, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the PRO Act of 2021.   Out of many features that would hurt employees and economic growth in  Arkansas in this bill is a hostile practice  [[Page H1151]]  banned by the National Labor Relations Act of 1959. This bill fully  resurrects it.   Yet, these unfair practices continued post-1959 in the construction  industry.   For example, Mr. Speaker, in 2004 the Eighth Circuit heard a hot  cargo agreement case. In exchange for a no-strike pledge, a  construction firm agreed to perform the work and agreed it would hire  union workers, but they hired a subcontractor, who, while they didn't  sign the agreement, agreed to use union labor anyway. They went on  strike, Mr. Speaker, even though they hired union workers. This is the  kind of unfair approach that does not deserve to be enshrined in this  bill. As a result, the contractor received a cease and desist demand  and workers lost the opportunity to work.   I tried to amend this bill to remove this hot cargo bad idea, but the  amendment was rejected by House Democrats.   This is an example of how this party wants to go back to 1959 and  instill this for all workers across our Nation. We need to oppose this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I missed the vote and I would like to submit  my vote for Roll Call No. 67. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 67.
