SEC. 5. EQUAL VALUE EXCHANGE AND APPRAISALS.

(2) Withdrawal revocation.--Any public land order that       withdraws the Federal land from appropriation or disposal       under a public land law shall be revoked to the extent       necessary to permit disposal of the Federal land parcel to       BHI.        (3) Withdrawal of federal land.--All Federal land       authorized to be exchanged under this Act, if not already       withdrawn or segregated from appropriation or disposal under       the public lands laws upon enactment of this Act, is hereby       so withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, until the       date of conveyance of the Federal land to BHI.        (b) Postexchange Land Management.--Land acquired by the       Secretary under this Act shall become part of the Pike-San       Isabel National Forest and be managed in accordance with the       laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the National       Forest System.        (c) Exchange Timetable.--It is the intent of Congress that       the land exchange directed by this Act be consummated no       later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this       Act.        (d) Maps, Estimates, and Descriptions.--        (1) Minor errors.--The Secretary and BHI may by mutual       agreement make minor boundary adjustments to the Federal and       non-Federal lands involved in the exchange, and may correct       any minor errors in any map, acreage estimate, or description       of any land to be exchanged.        (2) Conflict.--If there is a conflict between a map, an       acreage estimate, or a description of land under this Act,       the map shall control unless the Secretary and BHI mutually       agree otherwise.        (3) Availability.--Upon enactment of this Act, the       Secretary shall file and make available for public inspection       in the headquarters of the Pike-San Isabel National Forest a       copy of all maps referred to in this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 618, the Crags, Colorado Land  Exchange Act of 2017 that I introduced along with Congressman Tipton  and Congressman Polis. This legislation will facilitate a mutually  beneficial land exchange between the U.S. Forest Service and the  Emerald Valley Ranch in El Paso and Teller Counties in Colorado.   Specifically, this legislation would convey to the United States the  320-acre Crags property located on the west side of Pikes Peak that is  currently owned by The Broadmoor Hotel, and a perpetual public-access  easement for the lower portion of the popular Barr Trail. In exchange,  an 83-acre Federal parcel located at Emerald Valley Ranch on the  southeast side of Pikes Peak and a perpetual access easement along two  Forest Service roads would be granted to The Broadmoor. This would  eliminate the management and liability issues currently facing the  United States because of the significant upgrades and improvements The  Broadmoor has made to the Emerald Valley Ranch parcel.   This land exchange is intended to provide increased recreational  opportunities for the public on the Pike National Forest. The 320-acre  Crags property is completely surrounded by the Pike National Forest and  has been the top acquisition priority for the Pikes Peak Ranger  District for several years. The property provides several opportunities  to connect Forest Service trails emanating from the Crags campground  with trails in the Putney Gulch area. In addition, existing trails  within the property could become key links in the proposed Ring the  Peak trail.   I thank Chairman Bishop and Chairman McClintock and the entire staff  of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands for all of their work and bringing  this bill to the floor.   I urge the adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I echo what my colleague has just said  about those of us from Colorado working together. Of the six bills that  we are going to be discussing today, four of them are from Colorado;  and yourself, myself, and Representative Tipton from southwest Colorado  have collaborated on these four bills. It is bipartisan and we have  worked hard and have gotten some good legislation to offer to the House  for consideration. I look forward to doing this through the rest of the  afternoon, plus two other bills as well.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 698) to require a land conveyance involving the Elkhorn  Ranch and the White River National Forest in the State of Colorado, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 698         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Elkhorn Ranch and White       River National Forest Conveyance Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE, ELKHORN RANCH AND WHITE RIVER                     NATIONAL FOREST, COLORADO.         (a) Land Conveyance Required.--Consistent with the purpose       of the Act of March 3, 1909 (43 U.S.C. 772), all right,       title, and interest of the United States (subject to       subsection (b)) in and to a parcel of land consisting of       approximately 148 acres as generally depicted on the map       entitled ``Elkhorn Ranch Land Parcel-White River National       Forest'' and dated March 2015 shall be conveyed by patent to       the Gordman-Leverich Partnership, a Colorado Limited       Liability Partnership (in this section referred to as       ``GLP'').        (b) Existing Rights.--The conveyance under subsection (a)--        (1) is subject to the valid existing rights of the lessee       of Federal oil and gas lease COC-75070 and any other valid       existing rights; and        (2) shall reserve to the United States the right to collect       rent and royalty payments on the lease referred to in       paragraph (1) for the duration of the lease.        (c) Existing Boundaries.--The conveyance under subsection       (a) does not modify the exterior boundary of the White River       National Forest or the boundaries of Sections 18 and 19 of       Township 7 South, Range 93 West, Sixth Principal Meridian,       Colorado, as such boundaries are in effect on the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (d) Time for Conveyance; Payment of Costs.--The conveyance       directed under subsection (a) shall be completed not later       than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.       The conveyance shall be without consideration, except that       all costs incurred by the Secretary of the Interior relating       to any survey, platting, legal description, or other       activities carried out to prepare and issue the patent shall       be paid by GLP to the Secretary prior to the land conveyance.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 698, the Elkhorn Ranch and White River National Forest  Conveyance Act sponsored by my colleague, Congressman Scott Tipton of  the great State of Colorado, and cosponsored by Congressman Polis and  myself, resolves a longstanding surveying issue in the White River  National Forest in western Colorado.   In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government issued a series of  patents conveying Federal land to private landowners in the region.  However, a land survey conducted in 1949 brought these conveyances into  question, and the ownership of the land has been in dispute for nearly  70 years. In 2014 the White River National Forest conducted a survey to  finalize the land ownership and concluded that 148 acres were  improperly within the forest's boundary.   This legislation simply conveys this land back to its rightful  ownership. This land conveyance is consistent with the existing forest  management plan, and the Forest Service is managing this land as though  it were already private property.   This bill has the support of a wide range of stakeholders in the  community and I thank the Congressman from Colorado for his work on  this legislation. I would point out, as we discussed earlier, there is  bipartisan support from within the Colorado delegation for this bill as  well.   I urge adoption of the measure and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those comments. I would point  out, for anyone who is interested, that the three of us who are here-- and I am about to yield the floor to Representative Tipton--we are all  on the Natural Resources Committee. This is a committee that is going  to be doing a lot of exciting and interesting things in this Congress.  We are going to be very busy. I am looking forward to that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), my friend and colleague, who is also a  member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 688) to adjust the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest,  Colorado, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 688         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Arapaho National Forest       Boundary Adjustment Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ARAPAHO NATIONAL FOREST BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT.         (a) In General.--The boundary of the Arapaho National       Forest in the State of Colorado is adjusted to incorporate       the approximately 92.95 acres of land generally depicted as       ``The Wedge'' on the map entitled ``Arapaho National Forest       Boundary Adjustment'' and dated November 6, 2013, and       described as lots three, four, eight, and nine of section 13,       Township 4 North, Range 76 West, Sixth Principal Meridian,       Colorado. A lot described in this subsection may be included       in the boundary adjustment only after the Secretary of       Agriculture obtains written permission for such action from       the lot owner or owners.        (b) Bowen Gulch Protection Area.--The Secretary of       Agriculture shall include all Federal land within the       boundary described in subsection (a) in the Bowen Gulch       Protection Area established under section 6 of the Colorado       Wilderness Act of 1993 (16 U.S.C. 539j).        (c) Land and Water Conservation Fund.--For purposes of       section 200306(a)(2)(B)(i) of title 54, United States Code,       the boundaries of the Arapaho National Forest, as modified       under subsection (a), shall be considered to be the       boundaries of the Arapaho National Forest as in existence on       January 1, 1965.        (d) Public Motorized Use.--Nothing in this Act opens       privately owned lands within the boundary described in       subsection (a) to public motorized use.        (e) Access to Non-Federal Lands.--Notwithstanding the       provisions of section 6(f) of the Colorado Wilderness Act of       1993 (16 U.S.C. 539j(f)) regarding motorized travel, the       owners of any non-Federal lands within the boundary described       in subsection (a) who historically have accessed their lands       through lands now or hereafter owned by the United States       within the boundary described in subsection (a) shall have       the continued right of motorized access to their lands across       the existing roadway.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 688, sponsored by Congressman Jared Polis and cosponsored by  Congressman Tipton and myself, would adjust the boundary of the Arapaho  National Forest in the State of Colorado to incorporate 93 acres. It  passed the House under suspension of the rules during the 113th and  114th Congresses.   The legislation would incorporate 10 undeveloped parcels of land into  the Arapaho National Forest. The parcels sit between the Arapaho and  the Rocky Mountain National Park and will help the Forest Service to  better manage this land. The bill ensures that private landowners with  parcels within the national forest will continue to have access through  these parcels. Additionally, the land purchased by the Forest Service  must be with the written consent of the landowner.   I urge adoption of the measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to just build on what my  colleague was saying about the rest of his bills.   On this one, there is strong collaboration and consensus. I look  forward to working with him to pass it. I will make an offer on the  rest of his bills. If he lets me help him write them, I bet we could  get them to the floor sooner.   In all seriousness, the Rocky Mountain National Park is a crown jewel  of the National Park System. I believe it is in the top five of all  parks in the entire country in terms of visitorship. It is very  popular, and for good reason. It is a spectacular and accessible place  near Boulder, Colorado, not far from Denver.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 689) to insure adequate use and access to the existing Bolts  Ditch headgate and ditch segment within the Holy Cross Wilderness in  Eagle County, Colorado, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 689         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bolts Ditch Access and Use       Act''.       SEC. 2. BOLTS DITCH ACCESS.         (a) Access Granted.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall       permit by special use authorization nonmotorized access and       use, in accordance with section 293.6 of title 36, Code of       Federal Regulations, of the Bolts Ditch headgate and the       Bolts Ditch within the Holy Cross Wilderness, Colorado, as       designated by Public Law 96-560, for the purposes of the       diversion of water and use, maintenance, and repair of such       ditch and headgate by the Town of Minturn, Colorado, a       Colorado Home Rule Municipality.        (b) Location of Facilities.--The Bolts Ditch headgate and       ditch segment referenced in subsection (a) are as generally       depicted on the map entitled ``Bolts Ditch headgate and Ditch       Segment'', dated November 2015.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since 1882, the town of Minturn, Colorado, has used Bolts Ditch to  fill Bolts Lake, a place of recreation for the town and an important  source of water for the surrounding community. When Congress passed the  Colorado Wilderness Act in 1980, 450 feet of Bolts Ditch was  inadvertently included in the Holy Cross Wilderness area, leading to  questions and the town's ability to access this important  infrastructure. After a discussion amongst stakeholders, the town  agreed to seek a legislative solution to address this access issue.   This bipartisan bill, sponsored by Congressman Jared Polis and  cosponsored by Congressman Tipton and myself, simply allows the Forest  Service to issue a special use permit to the town of Minturn to allow  nonmotorized access to maintain a headgate and water ditch in the Holy  Cross Wilderness. This bill ensures the town will have access to Bolts  Ditch for basic maintenance needs.   H.R. 689 was developed in consultation with the community and the  Forest Service and enjoys support from a wide range of groups in the  region. I urge adoption of the measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 337) to transfer administrative jurisdiction over certain  Bureau of Land Management land from the Secretary of the Interior to  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for inclusion in the Black Hills  National Cemetery, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 337         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         The Act may be cited as the ``Black Hills National Cemetery       Boundary Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. WITHDRAWAL AND TRANSFER OF PUBLIC LAND FOR CEMETERY                     USE.         (a) Due Diligence.--Prior to the withdrawal and transfer in       subsection (b), the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will       complete appropriate environmental, cultural resource and       other due diligence activities on the public lands identified       in subsection (c), so that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       may confirm that the land is suitable for cemetery purposes.       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall notify the Secretary       of the Interior of such due diligence activities prior to       initiating and shall coordinate as needed during the       performance of such activities.        (b) Withdrawal and Transfer.--After completion of the due       diligence activities in subsection (a) and upon receipt by       the Secretary of the Interior of written confirmation from       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that the land is suitable       for cemetery purposes, and subject to valid existing rights,       the public lands described in subsection (c) shall be--        (1) withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the       public land laws, including the mining laws, the mineral       leasing laws, and the geothermal leasing laws, for as long as       the lands remain under the administrative jurisdiction of the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs;        (2) deemed property as defined in section 102(9) of title       40, United States Code, for as long as the lands remain under       the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs; and        (3) transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs for use as national cemeteries       under chapter 24 of title 38, United States Code.

(b) Legal Effect.--The legal descriptions prepared under       subsection (a) shall have the same force and effect as if the       legal descriptions were included in this Act, except that the       Secretary of the Interior may correct any clerical and       typographical errors in the legal descriptions.

(b) Decontamination.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall be responsible for costs of any decontamination of the       lands resulting from contamination on the lands withdrawn,       deemed property, and transferred under section 2(b) while the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs exercised jurisdiction over       those lands subject to a notice under subsection (a)       determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be necessary       for the lands to be restored to the public lands.        (c) Restoration to the Public Lands.--The lands subject to       a notice under subsection (a) shall only be restored to the       public lands upon acceptance by the Secretary of the Interior       and a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that       such lands are suitable for restoration to the public lands  [[Page H986]]       and operation of one or more of the public land laws.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 337, the Black Hills National  Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act, sponsored by Congresswoman Kristi Noem  of South Dakota.   This bill expands the Black Hills National Cemetery, outside of  Sturgis, South Dakota, by permanently transferring the jurisdictional  authority of approximately 200 acres of undeveloped Federal land from  the Bureau of Land Management to the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Originally opened in 1948, the cemetery now houses a memorial  carillon, a memorial to Korean war veterans, and is the final resting  place of many notable veterans, including Medal of Honor recipient  Sergeant Charles Windolph. With its existing acreage, the cemetery can  only accommodate a finite number of additional burials. Transferring  jurisdiction of the land from the BLM to the VA will provide space for  hundreds of additional grave sites for future generations of American  veterans. Without the transfer, the National Cemetery Administration  will be forced to close the cemetery to further burials in the very  near future.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation that will ensure that the  Black Hills National Cemetery can continue to provide proper burial  sites and final resting places for America's fallen heroes.   At this point, I include in the Record an exchange of letters with  Chairman Roe of the Veterans' Affairs Committee regarding this bill. I  thank him for helping to expedite the consideration of this bill today.   I commend Representative Noem for working closely with both the BLM  and the VA on this issue, and I urge the adoption of the measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R. 337,       the Black Hills National Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act.       There are certain provisions in the legislation which fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       337 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of       the measure on the House floor. Thank you.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, February 2, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: H.R. 337. the Black Hills National       Cemetery Boundary Expansion Act, was introduced on January 5,       2017. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on       Natural Resources, with an additional referral to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Veterans' Affairs       to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This       discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support having       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs represented on the       conference committee. Finally, to memorialize our       understanding, I would be pleased to include your letter and       this response in the Congressional Record when the bill is       considered by the House.        Thank you for your response and cooperation. I look forward       to further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for his  gracious remarks.   I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the  great State of South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), who is working hard for the  people of her State.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 494) to expand the boundary of Fort Frederica National  Monument in the State of Georgia, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 494         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Frederica National       Monument Boundary Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. FORT FREDERICA NATIONAL MONUMENT, GEORGIA.         (a) Maximum Acreage.--The first section of the Act of May       26, 1936 (16 U.S.C. 433g), is amended by striking ``two       hundred and fifty acres'' and inserting ``305 acres''.        (b) Boundary Expansion.--        (1) In general.--The boundary of the Fort Frederica       National Monument in the State of Georgia is modified to       include the land generally depicted as ``Proposed Acquisition       Areas'' on the map entitled ``Fort Frederica National       Monument Proposed Boundary Expansion'', numbered 369/132,469,       and dated April 2016.        (2) Availability of map.--The map described in paragraph       (1) shall be on file and available for public inspection in       the appropriate offices of the National Park Service.        (3) Acquisition of land.--The Secretary of the Interior may       acquire the land and interests in land described in paragraph       (1) by donation or purchase with donated or appropriated       funds from willing sellers only.        (4) Written consent of owner.--No non-Federal property may       be included in the Fort Frederica National Monument without       the written consent of the owner.        (5) No use of condemnation or eminent domain.--The       Secretary of the Interior may not acquire by condemnation or       eminent domain any land or interests in land under this Act       or for the purposes of this Act.        (6) No buffer zone created.--Nothing in this Act, the       establishment of the Fort Frederica National Monument, or the       management plan for the Fort Frederica National Monument       shall be construed to create buffer zones outside of the       Monument. That activities or uses can be seen, heard, or       detected from areas within the Fort Frederica National       Monument shall not preclude, limit, control, regulate, or       determine the conduct or management of activities or uses       outside of the Monument.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 494, introduced by my colleague Congressman Buddy Carter of  Georgia, expands the boundary of Fort Frederica National Monument by  authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to acquire approximately 21  acres of land. The St. Simons Land Trust currently owns the additional  acreage and will steward the land until the National Park Service can  acquire the property.   The Fort Frederica National Monument, located on St. Simons Island,  Georgia, preserves the archaeological remnants of a fort established in  1736 by James Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe constructed the fort to protect  the Colony of Georgia from attack from the Spanish. The fort  successfully fended off a Spanish attack in 1742 and confirmed Georgia  as a British territory.   This bipartisan legislation is fully supported by the Georgia  delegation, and an identical version of this legislation passed the  House by voice vote in the 114th Congress. I urge the passage of the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
