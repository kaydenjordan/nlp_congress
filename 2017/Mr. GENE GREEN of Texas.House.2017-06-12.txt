 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  338, to Promote a 21st Century Energy and Manufacturing Workforce  Future Act.   For years, many of the industries I represent have complained of  workforce shortages.   In East Houston and Harris County, if we were able to recruit every  union electrician in the country, we would still have a shortage.   The same is probably true for pipefitters, welders, etc.   The economy in our part of the country is rapidly expanding thanks to  the development of the Eagleford shale and the Permian Basin.   We must ensure that this economic prosperity is shared across all of  our community.   In Texas, workforce diversity has to be a reality.   I am pleased that Representative Rush has crafted this legislation  and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor.   I am also proud to support workforce development opportunities for  Hispanics, African-Americans, and women in the energy field.   The industry needs skilled workers and we need to create opportunity  for everyone, including many of those I represent in and around the  area.   The bill will encourage the Department of Energy to conduct outreach  to these communities to ensure they have access to the knowledge,  skills and abilities required to fill high paying jobs in the energy  field.   Thanks to efforts by ExxonMobil and the Texas Gulf Coast Community  College Consortium, we are already addressing the workforce needs of  our industries but more needs to be done and this bill will help us  achieve these goals.
