 Mr. Speaker, this is a most historic  night.   First of all, I thank President Biden. President Biden invited me,  along with the other leaders, ranking member, and chairman of our  Agriculture Committee. It gave me a chance to talk straight to the  President about the serious food shortage that is coming to our  veterans.   Many of you may not know this, but the veterans are living in more  food-insecure households than anybody else--7.4 percent higher than the  general public. When I told President Biden that, he said that we have  to do something about it. That is when he moved, with his energy, to be  able to take not only the veterans but others off of SNAP work  requirements.   God bless this President for his leadership.
