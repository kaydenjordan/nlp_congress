 Madam Speaker, put simply: insulin is too  expensive for millions of Americans.   Here are the facts: From 2014 to 2019, the average retail price of  insulin rose by 54 percent. And in America, people pay more than 10  times the price of insulin compared to other countries.   What is the result of these high prices? Around one in four Americans  who rely on insulin have cut back or skipped doses due to costs.   No person should have to choose between paying rent or buying the  insulin they need to survive. And no person should be forced to skip or  ration doses.   Last week, the House passed the Affordable Insulin Now Act to cap the  cost of insulin at $35 per month. Insulin is a lifesaving drug, but it  must never be a wallet-wrecking drug.   We must continue to work to lower costs for families everywhere from  the pharmacy counter to the gas pump.                            ____________________
