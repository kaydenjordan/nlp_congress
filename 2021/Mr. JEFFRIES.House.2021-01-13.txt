 Madam Speaker, I did not come to Congress to impeach  Donald Trump, but the constitutional crimes by an out-of-control  President inspired by his hatred and the big lie that he told cannot be  ignored. Donald Trump is a living, breathing, impeachable offense. It  is what it is.   The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was an act of insurrection  incited by Donald Trump. He is a clear and present danger to the  health, safety, and well-being of the American people. That is why this  impeachment is necessary on the House floor for a second time with a  bipartisan majority.   Violence will not win. Insurrection will not win. Sedition will not  win. Terror will not win. Lawlessness will not win. Mob rule will not  win. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.   Democracy will prevail.
