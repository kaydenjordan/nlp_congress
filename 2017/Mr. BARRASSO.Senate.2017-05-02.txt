 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the weekend, President Trump  celebrated 100 days that he has been in office as President of the  United States. Newspapers and magazines and pundits on television were  all talking about  [[Page S2661]]  what the President has accomplished in those first 100 days.   From what I heard talking to people at home in Wyoming this past  weekend, his first 100 days has been a huge success. People tell me  that they think America is finally headed in the right direction again.  I had a lot of people tell me they feel as if they have actually gotten  a new spring in their step as a result of the Presidential election  last year and President Trump taking office.   The other day when I was home, I was in line at the gas station  behind a guy. A friend of his came and said: Hey, how are you doing?  The guy said: Great. We are hiring again.   That is the kind of confidence that is happening all around Wyoming.  The polling company Gallup says that it is happening not just in  Wyoming but all across the country. For 24 straight weeks, more  Americans have been more optimistic than pessimistic about the economy.  As soon as Donald Trump was elected President, economic confidence  soared, and it has stayed positive ever since. Gallup said that this is  the exact opposite of what they had seen in the previous 8 years; that  is, during the whole Obama administration, during the entire so-called  economic recovery.   In another poll released last week, Gallup said that people are also  less worried that they will lose the job they have. They found that  American workers are less concerned about being laid off from their job  than at any time since Gallup started asking questions way back in  1975. That is more than 40 years ago.   Why are people optimistic now? I think it is because they see that  President Trump and the Republicans in Congress are serious about  improving the economy. They see that we are serious about giving relief  to Americans who have been getting buried under an avalanche of  redtape. They see that the President is off to a very fast start in the  White House.   Just look at what we have already done to help relieve the burdens on  Americans. Congress has rolled back 13 different midnight regulations  that President Obama tried to sneak through at the last minute. We  struck down a stream buffer rule that was meant to block coal mining.  We got rid of a rule that puts Americans at a competitive disadvantage  when they are trying to develop energy resources overseas. We got rid  of a regulation that took the control of local energy issues away from  the State officials; we got rid of that regulation. And we got rid of  one of the regulations that gave more control to Washington and less to  States. These were regulations that harmed Americans and wiped out  American jobs. Now those regulations are gone.   We have more that we can do to roll back terrible regulations like  these. I have introduced a resolution to block another damaging rule  that has come out by the Bureau of Land Management, which has to do  with the Obama administration rules on methane that is produced at oil  and gas wells. The new regulations created confusion by duplicating  other rules that were already on the books.   That was the problem with so many of these regulations coming out by  the Obama administration as they left office: regulation on top of  regulation causing costs and confusion. They added costs that  discourage energy production and kill energy jobs.   I hope that we can have a vote on this resolution very soon and get  rid of this unnecessary red tape.   As active as Congress has been getting rid of these unfair, last- minute rules, President Trump has been even more active. He has already  signed at least 30 Executive orders to help clear a path for the  American economy to take off again. He signed a major Executive order  promoting American energy independence. This has been an enormous shift  away from the Obama-era approach of disruptive regulations,  restrictions, and Washington overreach. All of these regulations did  more to harm hard-working Americans than they did to actually help the  environment. From now on, Washington will be looking for ways to  protect our environment while helping our economy to grow.   Just last week, President Trump took another important step to keep  his promises. He eased restrictions on drilling for oil and gas in  offshore areas, like the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. These places  have great potential for producing the energy America needs. President  Trump is helping to create certainty that those resources will be  available if we need them.   President Obama couldn't imagine that it was possible to have  responsible energy development in America. President Trump knows  differently. He knows it is possible. He knows that American workers  can do the job. He knows that America will be stronger because of it. I  think that is the kind of thing the American people mean when they tell  me that they feel they have a spring in their step.   I can also tell you that this is just the beginning. Remember when  President Obama bragged that he had a pen and a phone? Well, President  Trump has proved that he has a whole drawer full of pens, and he  intends to keep using them to help get the American economy growing  again. He wants to hear more people saying that things are great; we  are hiring again. That is what the President has been doing, and it is  what Congress is doing. These are the kinds of things that will get  this country back on track when it comes to our energy policy.   In Wyoming and in much of the country, energy means jobs. Our goal  should be to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can  without raising costs on American families. All of us should be able to  agree on that. It is time to restore that balance to America's energy  policy. President Trump is dedicated to getting that balance right.   Republicans in Congress are dedicated to getting the economy back in  gear, and I hope that more Democrats will join us with their ideas and  with their support. That is what the American people want, and it is  what they voted for. It is why people are confident and why they see  better days ahead for this great country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
