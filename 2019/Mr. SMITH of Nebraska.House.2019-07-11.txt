 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Vera Dulaney who passed away July 5.   Last November, I was able to recognize Vera on the floor for her  retirement and how much she meant to our community. For more than 30  years, she served the community through her position as Scotts Bluff  County clerk and election commissioner, as well as in various other  volunteer capacities.   Throughout her public service, Vera's diligent work maintained the  integrity of our local elections and assisted the effective and  efficient operation of Scotts Bluff County. Her outstanding efforts  across the community were recently acknowledged when she was presented  the Community Volunteer Award for Public Service.   Vera was well-known in our community for her years of official  service, humble demeanor, and dedication to family. Her smile always  lit up the room. Her devotion to the Nebraska Cornhuskers and Chicago  Cubs was only surpassed by her devotion to her family and our community  as a whole.   Throughout her long and prosperous life, she touched countless  others. Now in passing, we celebrate her life and keep her family and  friends in our prayers.                            ____________________
