 Mr. Speaker, under current practice, if a veteran or  beneficiary is appointed a fiduciary by the VA, they are automatically  labeled as mentally defective and added to the FBI's background check  system which prohibits them from purchasing a firearm. This rule fails  to identify which beneficiaries have a mental illness that make them a  danger, instead instituting a blanket ban on anyone who needs help  managing their benefits, and it discourages veterans who need help from  seeking help.   The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act will prohibit the VA from  considering a beneficiary just because they are assisted by a fiduciary  as mentally defective without due process. Just because you have  trouble managing your finances doesn't mean you are dangerously  mentally ill. This discourages veterans who may need help from seeking  help.   We owe it to our veterans and to all Americans to protect the  freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and ensure that they are not  taken away without due process. That is why I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this bill.
