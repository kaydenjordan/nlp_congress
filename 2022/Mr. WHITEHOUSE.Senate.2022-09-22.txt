 Madam President, I understand that Senator Thune is  next in order on the floor, but not seeing him on the floor, I thought  I would take the time before he arrives to echo the terrific remarks of  my Judiciary chairman, Dick Durbin.   As I think people know, a lot of money has been spent in this effort  to control the Court by special interests. Indeed, the last count is  that it cost $580 million in dark money to achieve that purpose. I  don't know anybody who spends nearly $600 million--more than half a  billion dollars--without having a purpose in mind. And when you see the  undoing of women's right to determine their own reproductive choice,  when you see new weaponry rolled out against pollution regulations,  when you see 100-year-old gun laws being taken down, when you see the  agenda of the big-money rightwing being implemented by the Court, it  begins to look like, in fact, they got their money's worth, and they  didn't mind spending big.  [[Page S4946]]    One of the ways they did this was to make sure that all of the Trump  selections of nominees went through the Federalist Society. Never in  our history has that happened, with a private organization stepping in  and deciding who would be on the Supreme Court.   I see that Senator Thune has arrived. The floor is his. I will  interrupt my remarks because I was just filling time.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the place where I left off, when  Senator Thune came to the floor, was discussing the extent to which  huge floods of dark money had taken control of our Supreme Court. I  will just dig into that a little bit further while we have a moment,  because one of the vehicles for this effort was the Federalist Society.   It is extremely unusual in any modern democracy that the selection of  who got onto the Supreme Court would be parceled out to a private  organization. It is even more peculiar when that private organization  has a very distinct political and ideological bent, and it is worse  still when that private organization, while acting as the gatekeeper to  Supreme Court appointments, was receiving massive dark money infusions.   Before it got that role, the Federalist Society did not get loads of  dark money. Back in 2002, their anonymous donations summed to a grand  total of $5,000. But once it became clear that they were the gatekeeper  to the Supreme Court for the Republican Party, by 2019, they were up to  $7 million pouring in in dark money.   We don't know how those names were picked for Donald Trump's  Federalist Society list. There was no public process. There was no  disclosure. There was some back room someplace where those lists were  assembled. And who got a voice controlling who got on that list, I  suspect, has a lot to do with that $7 million.   Again, when you are spending $7 million, you are not kidding around.  You want results, and they have got them.   The other piece of the pie here is one of Leonard Leo's little nodes  of phony front groups funded by dark money. He has got an 85 Fund and a  Concord Fund, a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4). That is the state of the art  in dark money political manipulation: You do a 501(c)3. You do a  501(c)(4). You put them in the same office with the same staff, with  the same oversight and the same funders, but you pretend that they are  different. Then, to make it even more complicated, you file under  Virginia corporate law fictitious names--that is what it is actually  called under Virginia corporate law--fictitious names for other front  groups. So in this dark money Court capture machine, even the front  groups have front groups.    One of them is right here. It is called the Judicial Crisis Network.  The Judicial Crisis Network was the one that took in the dark money  from anonymous big donors to push out the television ads to capture the  Court: ads for Gorsuch, ads for Kavanaugh, and ads for Barrett. They  put out some pretty good money to do that. For Gorsuch, they spent $21  million. For Kavanaugh, they spent $17 million. For Barrett, as far as  we know so far, they spent $14 million. These came in not from  grassroots donations. The checks were as big as $15 million. The checks  were as big as $17 million. And if the same person was writing those  $15 million and $17 million checks, our count is that it is $60 million  or more. And if one person has paid $60 million or more to influence  who gets on the Supreme Court and we don't know what business they have  before the Court, that is an open avenue and prescription for  corruption.   Right now, after all that money got spent by the Judicial Crisis  Network to push all those rightwing FedSoc Justices onto the Court, the  Honest Elections Project, another fictitious-name leg of this dark  money critter, is in the Supreme Court right now pushing the argument  developed by John Eastman--the Big Lie argument that in Georgia and  other States the State legislature should be able to throw out the  outcome of a Federal election and replace the winner of it with the  person they want.   The theory is so extreme that it even posits that the State court  system can't control the State legislature. The principle of judicial  review of legislative acts is undone by this. It is wildly extreme.   But there is the Honest Elections Project--so-called--showing up in  Court as an amicus, pushing the Big Lie theory to the very judges who  the Judicial Crisis Network paid to get on the Court.   And guess what. Do you think they disclosed to anybody that that was  the connection? No, I have got to come to the floor of the Senate to  point that out because the Supreme Court, which is behind so much of  this--the unlimited money, the failure to enforce the transparency  requirement, the gobs of dark money that are going through--also won't  enforce the rule that requires amicus curiae, the people who file the  briefs, to tell the Court and the other parties who is really behind  them. So they are getting away with it from the judges who got put on  the Court.   This whole dark money problem goes well beyond just dirty dark money  flooding into our elections. It goes beyond the cause of the slime of  the dirty, noxious TV ads that come pouring out of our television  screens, pouring through our devices with a phony-baloney name behind  the advertisement.   The good Senator is from New Jersey. Perhaps it could be ``New  Jerseyans for Peace and Puppies and Prosperity.''   Anybody watching the ad knows that that is not a real organization.  And what does it tell you, as a citizen, when slimily, lying, dirty  smear ads are being pushed through to you, through your TV screen,  through your device by a group that you know is a phony? How do you  have confidence in that?   I will close because Senator Hirono is here, and I want to have her  speak. But I will say that I am not alone in thinking that requiring  people to stand up and identify who they are when they are trying to  influence our politics is a distinctly American quality.   In fact, I quote:         Requiring people to stand up in public for their political       acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is       doomed. For my part, I do not look forward to a society       which, thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns anonymously . .       . and even exercises the direct democracy of initiative and       referendum hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the       accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home       of the Brave.    The author of that: Justice Antonin Scalia.   I will continue later, but I want to defer to the busy schedule of my  friend Senator Hirono.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii, who  has been such an ardent and effective ally in this fight, for coming to  the floor today and for all of our work in the Judiciary Committee and  also through briefs that we file in the Supreme Court trying to wake up  the Court to what is happening around them.   I would add an additional point to my description of this little node  of the dark money apparatus that has controlled the makeup of the  Supreme Court and works very hard to control the decisions of the  Supreme Court--and too often does--because you have heard Senator  Durbin and others speak on the floor today about the biggest dark money  contribution ever made, $1.6 billion, given to an organization run by  this same individual.   And you see it going in but only because some whistleblower told the  press what had happened. But even knowing that $1.6 billion went in,  you don't know where it goes next because this complicated apparatus  and others like it enable the money to be sluiced through underground,  subterranean, clandestine channels and pop out in political races  through unknown, phony front groups with preposterously sweet names.   And nobody who is a citizen is allowed to understand what is  happening. You can bet the word gets to the candidate about who is  behind ``New Jerseyans for Peace and Puppies and Prosperity,'' and you  can bet the big donors know. And if it is a House race, you can bet the  House leaders know; and if it is a Senate race, you can bet the Senate  leaders know. And you can bet that gives immense clout at stopping  things in this building.   And, sure enough, that $1.6 billion went into Marble Freedom Trust.  And one of the first things it did was give money to the Concord Fund,  one of the other Leonard Leo groups. You will recognize that as this  chart behind me, and you add to it the Marble Freedom Trust that was  the vehicle into which the $1.6 billion got dumped, and then--zip--here  came money straight to the Concord Fund, among other uses of it. So  this thing is sort of a creature of multiple fronts.   And I was struck today when I read a news article about the  resignation in Iraq of the finance minister, who is largely regarded as  being the voice of integrity and decency and honesty in that  government. And he quit, and he said one of the reasons was that he  felt that there was around him a ``vast octopus of corruption and  deceit.''   This is just one piece of a vast octopus of corruption and deceit  whose target is the American people and whose desire is to control  government from behind the scenes without even showing up and showing  who they are. If you want to see some of this mischief in action and in  relation to what I have said about how this captured Court, with its  FedSoc Justices, has delivered for the big-donor interests, the biggest  thing that they have done so far in terms of affecting the trajectory  of honesty and decency and public accountability in this country has  been in a case called Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta.    What did the judges who dark money put onto the Court that dark money  built do? They built a brandnew constitutional right to dark money-- unprecedented. And when they did it, when the case came up to them-- interestingly, as part of this octopus of deceit are innumerable front  groups that file amicus briefs.   I talked about how they don't disclose, and the Court lets them get  away with it. Let me give you an idea of the number at the certiorari  stage, which, for those not familiar with Supreme Court practice, is  the point where the Supreme Court decides whether or not they will take  up the case. And then there is the merits decision later on, on how  they decide the case. But on the question of whether they take up the  case, we counted about 50--5-0, 50--of these phony, dark money-funded  front groups coming in and saying: You have got to take up this case.  You have got to take up this case. You have got to take up this case.   It was signaling; it was flares; it was semaphore telling FedSoc  Justices: We put you there. This is what we want you to do.   So let's take a quick look at a little bit about the Americans for  Prosperity Foundation because it is related--remember what I said about  501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s twinning together and having basic identity?  Well, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation is the 501(c)(3) twin to  a 501(c)(4) called Americans for Prosperity.   And guess what Americans for Prosperity is? It is the biggest  battleship in the Koch brothers' political influence operation. It is  the mother ship. It is as political as you get. It goes directly into  elections and spends dark money.   And here are the big differences between Americans for Prosperity and  the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. Well, the CEO and director of  Americans for Prosperity is, amazingly enough, the CEO and director of  the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. And the secretary of the  Americans for Prosperity group happens also to be the corporate  secretary of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. How about that?  Oh, here is a big difference. The senior vice president of grassroots  operations for Americans for Prosperity is the senior vice president of  state operations for Americans for Prosperity Foundation. There is a  difference. The treasurer and vice president of Americans for  Prosperity is the same as the treasurer and vice president of finance  for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, and the director of  Americans for Prosperity is the chair of the Americans for Prosperity  Foundation.   There is a thing in law called piercing the corporate veil. This is a  corporate veil you could pierce with a banana. This is the kind of  phony fun and games that dark money allows to intrude into our  democracy. And in this  [[Page S4949]]  terrible death loop, dark money puts Justices on the Supreme Court who  get told by dark money amici what they want, in flotillas of 50, and  then deliver for dark money to a nominal plaintiff who is the  indistinguishable twin of the Koch brothers' political battleship,  letting that money loose into our politics with now constitutional  imprimatur.   And they show up in droves. Here is just one case: Seila Law. This  was the one about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You know  the dark money people hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In  fact, they hate regulation. That is why they are trying to undo  American government as best they can.   So here are some of the amici that showed up in Seila Law. I actually  put this in my brief to the Supreme Court in that case as an appendix  so they could see what was going on around them. A lot of good it did.  So here are some of the front groups, all of whom take dark money, and  here are some of the dark money sources we were able to trace them  having taken: Donors Trust, widely described as the ATM of the far  right. It has no purpose. Donors Trust doesn't make a product. You  can't buy a Donors Trust car or bicycle or tire or pedal. It doesn't  provide services. You can't go to Donors Trust and get your taxes done.  You can't go to Donors Trust and get your shoes polished.   It does one thing and one thing only: It takes money in; it scrubs  off the identity of the person who gave it the money; and then it sends  the money where that person wants, as Donors Trust. That is it. It is  an identity laundering machine for the dark money operation that we  have running for this vast octopus of deceit.   And here are other foundations: Bradley, Scaife, Searle. Look at how  much of this is in common. That was not described to the Court.   My time is running out. I will say two things as I go. One is, until  the Supreme Court opened the floodgates of unlimited money, Republicans  wanted disclosure. Republicans wanted disclosure. Mitch McConnell, the  leader:         We need to have real disclosure. Why would a little       disclosure be better than a lot of disclosure?    He was in favor of a lot of disclosure on ``Meet the Press.''   ``I think disclosure is the best disinfectant,'' he wrote.         We could do disclosure more frequently. I think disclosure       is the best disinfectant.    Mitch McConnell.   But then along came the Supreme Court in 2010; they opened the  floodgates of unlimited money. And particularly the fossil fuel  industry, which wanted to stop climate legislation, knew that if it  showed up as Exxon, as Marathon, as Chevron, as Shell, the public would  get the joke; their unlimited money would be useless because everybody  would see the self-interest and the corruption behind all of that. So  they immediately went to work through phony front groups, 501(c)(4)s,  Donors Trust, shell corporations.   And the Supreme Court let them do it despite the fact that, 8 to 1,  the Supreme Court in Citizens United has said:         Without transparency, this unlimited money is corrupting.       Without transparency, this unlimited money is corrupting.    Despite having said that, for 12 years, they have done nothing but  let the dark money flow--over a billion dollars now into any single  election.   It is intensely frustrating to see our country head down this filthy  road, where huge special interests, defined by just a few  characteristics--one, they have unlimited money to spend; two, they can  win in politics by spending it; and, three, they want to hide--is that  group of people the ones we want controlling our country? I don't think  so. How about regular voters? How about regular people? How about  farmers and doctors and business owners, nurses? No.   I know the leader wants to come to the floor, and I will yield as  soon as he comes to the floor. Before he does, I want to thank him for  bringing this measure here, for the strength of his statements, for the  strength of his commitment, for his help to organize all of this. This  began originally as his bill years ago, after Citizens United. So I  want to yield to him when he gets here.   But I want to go back to this departure of Minister Allawi, who talks  about the Iraqi state having become degraded and become a play thing of  special interests. That is the choice we face in this vote: Is this  going to be America the beautiful or is this going to be America the  degraded placing of special interests? This vote will determine it.   I yield to the leader for his remarks.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
