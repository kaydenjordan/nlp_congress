 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my  sincere gratitude to one of the most valued and dedicated members of my  team, Jack Walecki.   After over 4 years of service to our country and the people of  Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District, Jack is going to be leaving  our D.C. office to pursue a law degree at Pepperdine University.   For the past 2\1/2\ years, and through some of the most historically  significant events in recent memory, I have relied upon Jack's steady  counsel as my lead staffer for judiciary issues. His level head and  steadfast commitment to his work have been instrumental in helping to  right the ship in truly tumultuous times.   More importantly, Jack's easy-going, quintessentially California  attitude will leave a lasting mark on our team. We will sorely miss his  obscure cultural references and random tidbits of knowledge that would  make a trivia master's head spin.   We are all saddened to see Jack leave, but we are also delighted to  see him take this next step in his life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Jack for all his work and dedication. God has  great plans for your life. Our family and staff wish him all the best.   Onward, my friend.                            ____________________
