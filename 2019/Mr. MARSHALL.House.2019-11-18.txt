 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, I had the pleasure of  joining Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in Kansas City to celebrate  the relocation of two of USDA's research agencies to the heartland.   This move will save the country's taxpayers hundreds of millions of  dollars in rent and upkeep over the next decade. It will place the  agriculture resource center within a 3-hour drive of 19 land-grant  colleges, creating synergies in efficiency and research, thus getting  more research to our agriculture producers more quickly.   From Columbia, Missouri, to Kansas City, to Manhattan, Kansas, to  Lincoln, Nebraska, over 300 animal and pet health-related companies dot  the landscape. This area is already known worldwide as the animal  health corridor and now accounts for over 50 percent of the total  worldwide animal health, diagnostics, and pet food sales.   By relocating the Department of Agriculture's agriculture research  agencies NIFA and ERS to the center of the animal health corridor, and  with NBAF's construction in Manhattan, Kansas, near completion, the  Kansas-Missouri partnership will truly be the world's leading corridor  for agriculture research as well.   This relocation places USDA research where it belongs, in the heart  of the world's agriculture industry and close to our land-grant  colleges, which all fuel and modernize the agriculture industry.   I often brag that I represent the largest agriculture-producing  congressional district in America, a brag that I am going to keep  repeating until someone knocks me off that hill. But today, I want to  emphasize how important agriculture is to metropolitan areas like  Kansas City.   In the Kansas City metro area, agriculture, food, and food processing  support over 100,000 jobs, or 7 percent of the entire workforce in the  area. These industries provide a total economic contribution of over  $29 billion, roughly 22 percent of the local Kansas City metro economy.   As an example of the importance of agriculture to the area, I can  point to the BNSF facility, where we export 10 million pounds of  protein every week. Also, the DeLong Company elevator exports nearly  300,000 tons of soybeans and dried distillers grains yearly.   Guess what? All these commodities, all these products, are grown in  my home district, the big First District of Kansas.    The Kansas City metro area is home to several international grain  trading companies, including Bartlett Grain, ADM, Cargill, Grain Craft,  Scoular Company, and many others. Seaboard Foods calls Kansas City its  home as well.   A big thanks to Secretary Perdue for his leadership, for all he does  for agriculture, for being a voice of hope to all agriculture  producers, and for fighting to keep new markets open.   And a big thanks to President Trump for his leadership, for his faith  in the heartland, and for making this bold move.   Kansas and Missouri will make this the agriculture research corridor  for the world.                   Celebrating Kansas as World Air Capital     Mr. Speaker, Kansas is known as the air capital of the  world, manufacturing up to 70 percent of the world's embedded aircraft  fleet, while creating nearly 50,000 jobs and approximately $10 billion  in economic output.   Growing up just outside of Wichita, I was well aware of the impact  and importance the aviation industry had in my State.   Today, as a U.S. Congressman, I have had the pleasure of seeing the  evolution of the aerospace industry in Kansas and the continued impact  this sector has on our district and the State.   This week, our office is celebrating America's superiority in the  aerospace sector and Kansas' role in that industry. From the  manufacturing of 747s by Spirit AeroSystems, to aviation safety  research at the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita  State University, to drone technology development at the Kansas State  Polytechnic in Salina, communities across Kansas have benefited from  the past, present, and future needs of the aerospace industry.   Since the industry's inception, the United States has been a world  leader in aviation research and innovation. But other countries are  rapidly gaining speed. It is essential that we maintain our competitive  advantage, not only for continued economic growth in Kansas but for our  national security and the sustained evolution of space and science  technologies.   I have seen the impact this sector has had on my State, and I am  proud to support the many people, businesses, and organizations  involved in making the aerospace industry so dynamic and innovative.                                time  1215                              Thanksgiving Week     Mr. Speaker, Thanksgiving is only a week away, and it  is good to have a reminder for myself and everyone to take a moment to  recognize the many blessings we enjoy as Americans.   Our Founding Fathers bestowed upon us a Constitution and a Bill of  Rights unlike anything any other country has created. Americans enjoy  not only freedom to worship our God, but to enjoy the protections of  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   This country has allowed a Kansas farm kid like me to live the  American Dream, to not only go to college and to  [[Page H8913]]  medical school, but to raise a wonderful family and enjoy a successful  career practicing medicine, serving in our Nation's military, and, now,  serving our Nation and my hometown and my home State in our Capitol.  America is a country of opportunity, self-determination, and the  freedom to choose your own path.                            ____________________
