 Mr. Speaker, it is with great disappointment that I rise  today on the 19th day of this unnecessary and reckless government  shutdown.   Just last week, this body passed the very same Republican funding  bills that would open the government and keep Americans safe and  secure.   My community in south Florida is home to one of the biggest airports  in our Nation, Miami International Airport. Just yesterday, 130,000  passengers passed through the airport. Yet, TSA employees, air traffic  controllers, and Customs and Border Protection agents who inspect  international cargo are forced to work without pay, and must deal with  the unbearable decision of choosing between paying for healthcare or  putting food on the table.   Nearly a quarter of the households in my district rely on food  stamps. If this shutdown continues, these families are at risk of  losing access to food.   There is absolutely no reason why families should be evicted from  their homes or go hungry because their nutrition benefits were left  unprocessed.   There is absolutely no reason why the Everglades and Biscayne  National Parks, and our national treasures around the country, must  continue to rely on the kindness of devoted volunteers to keep them  from deteriorating.   Mr. Speaker, I have been through a shutdown before. I oversaw 125,000  employees at HHS during the longest shutdown.   No one wins in a shutdown. It was painful.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the ability of the Speaker, on  behalf of the House of Representatives, to intervene and defend the  Affordable Care Act in the case of Texas v. United States.   This case is a backhanded way to do what Republicans could not do  legislatively: repeal the ACA and take away comprehensive health  insurance from millions of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I represent a district that has the highest number of  people--more than 100,000--enrolled in the ACA. Whether you get your  health insurance from your employer, from Medicare, from Medicaid, or  from the marketplace, you have something to lose if this disastrous  court case is upheld.   Not only will insurance companies again be able to deny coverage to  people with preexisting conditions, young people will no longer be able  to stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26. Preventive  services like flu shots and annual checkups will not necessarily be  covered without cost. Women may, once again, face buying insurance that  doesn't cover maternity care.   Our bipartisan efforts to phase out the Medicare doughnut hole could  [[Page H339]]  come to an end. Our seniors should not have to choose between paying  exorbitant costs for prescription drugs and buying food or paying rent.   An overwhelming majority of Americans support all of these  provisions.   Madam Speaker, with this rule, we simply want to stand in court and  defend the valuable protections in the Affordable Care Act that this  case threatens to take away.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Oklahoma  for his kind words at the beginning of his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), who is the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on  the Judiciary.  [[Page H342]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Allred).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Ways and Means.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Madam Speaker, I inquire whether the gentleman from  Oklahoma is prepared to close. I am prepared to close on my side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time,  and I thank my distinguished colleague.   It has been more than 9 years since Congress passed the Affordable  Care Act. It has withstood dozens of repeal attempts, and the Supreme  Court already has held it constitutional. Now a district court in Texas  has determined that the whole law should be null and void.   But the ACA is now so enmeshed in our society that we sometimes  forget the numerous benefits that are now threatened by this case. It  is not simply protections for preexisting conditions. It is subsidies  to help the middle-class families and small businesses to buy health  insurance. It is caps on out-of-pocket health insurance costs. It is an  end to annual and lifetime limits.   No matter where someone gets their healthcare, they have something to  lose if this case is upheld. Madam Speaker, that is why the House of  Representatives must intervene in this case. We need to stand with the  American people, the overwhelming majority of whom support the crucial  benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   The administration is unwilling to intervene in this case and protect  the rights of Americans; thus, it is up to Congress to defend and  uphold this law and all of the crucial protections it provides for our  citizens.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
