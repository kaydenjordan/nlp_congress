 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Rachel Brand's  nomination to the No. 3 spot in the Justice Department. Now, there are  many reasons I am opposed to this nomination, but those reasons are all  grounded in a central question facing America today: Whom does this  government work for? Does it work just for the rich and powerful? Does  it work just for the well connected? Does it work just for the  billionaire in the White House or does it work for everyone?   One of the worst kept secrets in America is that there are two  justice systems; one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone  else. The first justice system is an exclusive club for giant  corporations and wealthy individuals. In that justice system, serious  crimes are punished with a slap on the wrist and a small fine.  Taxpayers bail out corporations that stole the life savings, and  wealthy criminals go back to their lives without missing a beat.   The second justice system is for those who can't buy their way out of  prison time. In that system, minor, nonviolent offenses are punished  with harsh prison sentences. When those individuals are eventually  released, they are branded with the scarlet letter that closes doors to  employment and opportunity. It is a system that swallows up people  whole and spits them out with nothing.   Americans are very familiar with the difference between those two  justice systems. We saw the difference after the worst financial crisis  in a generation, when Wall Street tycoons who gambled away the life  savings of working Americans walked away free as a bird. We saw it in  the War on Drugs when countless Black and Brown people were shoveled  into prisons, where they wasted their lives away.   We need to fix this problem. We should be devoting every resource we  have to fixing this problem. That starts with the Justice Department,  the agency responsible for ensuring that nobody is above the law, and  everyone--everyone is held accountable.   Unfortunately, it has been pretty clear to me for some time now that  President Trump's Justice Department is pushing as hard as possible in  the opposite direction. For much of President Obama's second term,  prosecutors were allowed some discretion to consider the unique  circumstances of each case and make a measured decision about when to  ask for the most serious charge with the maximum penalty or when to ask  for less.   It worked. Jail time for low-level drug offenses went down. States  saved money, and lives were not irretrievably broken. Last week, that  modest advance came to an end. Attorney General Sessions directed  prosecutors to charge individuals with the harshest sentences possible.  ``Lock them up'' seems to be his approach--but not in all cases. Jeff  Sessions sings a very different tune when it comes to white-collar  crime. He believes corporations should not be punished for the actions  of their executives. Don't punish the companies for a few bad CEO  apples.   In Jeff Session's world, we should throw the book at criminals,  unless they are rich and powerful. Now, President Trump has chosen to  somewhat help Jeff Sessions carry out his vision. His choice to be the  third highest ranking official at the Justice Department is Rachel  Brand, the nominee for Associate Attorney General.   She is well equipped to carry out that soft-on-white-collar-crime  approach. She has extensive experience--years of experience--fighting  on behalf of the biggest and richest companies in the world. She spent  years leading the Chamber of Commerce's assault on the rules that  protect working families, evidently deciding time after time that it is  corporations that should get every break.   As the head of regulatory litigation of the chamber of commerce, Ms.  Brand worked to dismantle environmental rules that prevent companies  from poisoning our air and water. She worked to shield financial  companies  [[Page S3001]]  from accountability when they broke the law or did not play by the  rules. She worked to end the employment rules that prevent companies  from abusing their workers.   If she is confirmed to the No. 3 spot at the Justice Department, she  can watch out for giant corporations from her perch right inside the  government. The Brand nomination is just another predictable move from  a President who clearly believes that one set of rules should apply to  the rich and powerful, and another set of rules should apply to  everyone else.   We all remember Donald Trump's promise during the campaign that he  was going to drain the swamp. Well, it is 118 days in, and the swamp is  bigger, deeper, uglier, and filled with more corrupt creatures than  ever. Over the last several days, President Trump has made it perfectly  clear that he believes he should be above the law.   After he fired FBI Director James Comey, Trump went on national  television and told the world that he fired Comey, in part, because  Comey was leading an investigation into ties between the Trump  campaign, the Trump administration, and Russia. Trump said top of mind  when he fired Comey was ``this Russia thing with Trump.''   Now we have learned that he apparently pressured Comey in private  meetings to drop aspects of the Russia investigation before he fired  him. It is a basic presumption of our democracy that politicians cannot  interfere with the law enforcement investigations into their own  potential wrongdoing, but President Trump openly admitted trying to  interfere with an ongoing investigation, and he clearly believes there  should be no consequences for himself.   I understand that President Trump thinks he should be able to decide  what investigations into his dealings go forward and what  investigations get stopped on the spot. I understand that President  Trump thinks he should be able to pack his Justice Department full of  people who will watch out for billionaire CEOs and giant corporations.  After all, he has packed other agencies with similar people.   I understand that is what President Trump thinks, but he is wrong.  One of the things that makes our democracy strong is that we believe no  one is above the law, not CEOs, not giant corporations, and not the  President of the United States. It is up to the Senate to remind the  President of that fact. We can start by rejecting the nomination of  Rachel Brand to serve as Associate Attorney General. I ask everyone who  believes in the promise of equal justice under the law to do the same.   (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 1162  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I rise today to announce the  reintroduction of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act  of 2017. This legislation would allow student loan borrowers to take  advantage of lower interest rates, and I urge both my Senate colleagues  and the Trump administration to support it. In a few short months,  millions more college graduates will be hit with their first student  loan bills.   Already, more than 44 million Americans have student loans, and many  are struggling to pay loans that are running at interest rates of 6  percent, 8 percent, 10 percent and even more. It is time for real  action to help struggling borrowers. That is why, today, I join 36 of  my Democratic colleagues in the Senate and 98 of my Democratic  colleagues in the House of Representatives to reintroduce our plan to  allow borrowers to lower their monthly payment by refinancing their  existing loans to today's lower interest rates, 3.76 percent for  undergrads, a little higher for graduate students.   Supporting America's students should not be a political food fight.  In fact, President Trump talked about student loans when he was on the  campaign trial, including a plan to reduce the maximum number of years  for repayment for most students.   As a candidate, Donald Trump said that ``students should not be asked  to pay more on the debt than they can afford.'' I agree with that,  which is why Congress should allow students to lower their monthly  payments by refinancing to today's lower interest rates. Donald Trump  also said that ``student loan debt should not be an albatross around  student's necks for the rest of their lives.''   I agree with that too. The legislation I am introducing today would  lower the outstanding balance for millions of Americans, allowing them  to get out from under their student loans faster. Here is one more.  Donald Trump said that it is ``terrible that one of the only profit  centers we have is student loans.'' He also said that ``it is not fair  and that should not take place.''   Unfortunately, right now, that is exactly what is happening.  According to a recent analysis of Congressional Budget Office data by  the Institute for College Access and Success, after all the costs are  accounted for, the Federal Government is now on track to make $81  billion off student loans over the next 10 years.   That is obscene. The Federal Government should not be making a profit  off the backs of our students, period. Yes, Candidate Trump talked a  lot about this problem, but talk is cheap, and President Trump has not  done a thing to fix the problem. In fact, he seems to have lost all  interest in students and their student loans. Since his election in  November, he has not even mentioned his campaign promises about student  loans.   Instead, he and Education Secretary DeVos have gone in the opposite  direction, using their short time in office to deliver one blow after  another to hard-working Americans who are struggling with student debt.  Back when he was running for President, Donald Trump made a lot of  promises, but empty promises don't help the students who have been  punched in the gut by Secretary DeVos's decision to roll back critical  consumer protections for borrowers.   Hollow campaign pledges do not help the students, the veterans, the  members of our Armed Forces when they are hurt by student loan  companies, like Navient, that break the law and brazenly announce to  the world that they don't think they have a responsibility to act in  the best interests of students.   Rally speeches don't mean much when this administration is ripping up  policies that would have made it harder for greedy student loan  companies to rake in lucrative government contracts while cheating  students. Last year's rhetoric means nothing to the struggling  borrowers who can now be charged sky-high fees--as high as 16 percent-- by student loan collection companies thanks to yet another policy Betsy  DeVos ripped up.   Students know what is going on. The loan companies know too. Industry  stocks have skyrocketed since November. Mr. President, keep your  promise and start by supporting this refinancing bill.   For nearly 4 years, Republicans have filibustered this bill and  refused to even debate it, despite its overwhelming public support.  Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have offered nothing--nothing--to  seriously address the problems of student loan borrowers. Those  problems keep getting worse. Today's students are wrestling with $1.4  trillion in student loan debt, and every year the student loan debt  increases by nearly $100 billion.   Interest rates are scheduled to jump up again later this summer,  meaning the urgency for Congress to act and allow borrowers to access  today's rates is stronger than ever. The Bank on Students Emergency  Loan Refinancing Act would give millions of borrowers across this  country a chance to save hundreds and in some cases thousands of  dollars a year. That is real money, money they can put toward paying  down the balance on their debt, money they can use to save for a home,  money they can spend on buying a car, money they can put toward  building a solid future.   By refusing to act and ignoring this debt crisis, Republicans  threaten to bury the hopes of an entire generation. It is time for  Congress to step up and fix this problem. It is also time for the  President to step up as well.   President Trump, you campaigned on the idea that the Federal  Government should not be making a profit off the backs of hard-working  students. So support this legislation. Put it in your annual budget,  this proposal. Call on Members of your own party who have held up this  bill to get on board. Demand action to refinance student loan debt, and  keep the promises you made to America's young people.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Cruz, and          Mr. Cotton):   S. 1163. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  ensure compliance of medical facilities of the Department of Veterans  Affairs with requirements relating to the scheduling of appointments,  to require appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate  of certain  [[Page S3016]]  health care officials of the Department, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
