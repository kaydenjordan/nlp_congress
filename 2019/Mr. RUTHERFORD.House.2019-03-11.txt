 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments and the retirement of Major General Michael A. Calhoun,  who has faithfully served America for over 40 years in numerous  capacities, but most recently as Florida's Adjutant General for the  last 4 years.   General Calhoun began his service as a private in 1977, and then he  secured his commission in the Medical Service Corps. Throughout his  distinguished career, he has served at every level of command in the  State and was deployed overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom,  earning the respect and confidence of all under his command.   During his time as Adjutant General, he responded to five named  storms that  [[Page H2630]]  impacted the State of Florida, one of which resulted in the largest  mobilization of Florida guardsmen in the State's history.   It was during that time that I had the privilege of personally  working extensively with General Calhoun, and I can personally attest  to his commitment to excellence and to the people of the State of  Florida.   Despite the rapid pace of operations over the past 4 years, General  Calhoun never lost sight of his mission.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his selfless leadership and service, and  I wish him and his wife, Sophia, the best in their retirement. A  grateful State and Nation say thank you.                            ____________________
