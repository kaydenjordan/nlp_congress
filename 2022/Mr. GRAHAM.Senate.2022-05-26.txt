 Mr. President, I will speak for about 5 minutes or so, if  that is OK.   As we depart for our Memorial Day recess and the unofficial beginning  of summer, many of us in political life will go to events honoring  America's fallen heroes who have died in service of our Nation.   Memorial Day is different from Veterans Day. On Veterans Day, we  celebrate all those who serve. On Memorial Day, we have somber  remembrance for those who failed to make it home.   Hundreds of thousands of Americans, men and women from all different  backgrounds, have died on foreign battlefields in the name of freedom  and protecting our homeland. This is the one day that we set aside each  year to remember them.   I will do my best to rededicate myself to being a better American,  appreciating the freedoms I have, and trying to find a way forward for  our Nation as a whole. So that is what this holiday week is about.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before we leave Washington, I want to make  a few comments about the war in Ukraine.   Our allies in Ukraine are fighting like tigers against a Russian  invasion that is without foundation, that is illegal under  international law and is one of the most brutal acts of war in the 21st  century--maybe in any century.   I just want to let the Ukrainian people know that the American people  are with you in your struggle for freedom.   There have been some comments made by folks whom I respect talking  about the need to end this war, where Ukraine has to recognize certain  parts of their territory as actually Russian territory. I cannot  disagree more. Any effort to impose upon Ukraine a ceasefire that leads  to a peace agreement where they have to give territory to Russia is not  ending a war; it will be starting new wars.   Have we learned nothing from the last century? Appeasing Putin in  Ukraine makes him want more, not less. We found that to be true in the  1930s with Hitler in Germany.   So this idea that Ukraine needs to come to the table and give up  Ukrainian land to Putin makes zero sense to me. All the people who have  been fighting in Ukraine would have died in vain. And that line of  reasoning I reject completely.   Here is the state of play: Due to the commitment of the Ukrainian  people to fight for their freedom and their homeland, Russia has just  been delivered a mighty blow. Their army is in decline. They just  changed their laws so that the limitation on service from 18 to 40 now  has been lifted. There was a 63-year-old retired general fighter pilot  shot down in Ukraine, a Russian general. All I can say is that the  Ukrainians have met their end of the bargain.   This body, expressing the will of the American people, passed a $40  billion aid package. That is a lot of money, but you either pay now or  later when it comes to Putin. I am convinced, along with most of my  colleagues here, that if Putin is successful in Ukraine, he only goes  further; he never stops. His words, not mine--he wants to reconstruct  the Soviet Union, the Russian Empire, whatever you would like to call  it. There are other nations in his crosshairs.   So the battle in Ukraine will stabilize Europe if it is done right.  If the battle in Ukraine ends where Putin feels like he got away with  mass war crimes and was able to get territory by force of arms, he will  not stop. China will, surely as I am speaking, have a green light to go  into Taiwan.   So those who argue that we need to end this war by giving Ukrainian  territory to Putin, you are starting another war in Asia, most likely.  You are going to create a larger appetite for Putin, and I think you  have lost the lessons of the last century.   We have much to understand about the nature of this war. We have  Russian diplomats resigning in protest. We have people at concerts  shouting some pretty vulgar things about the war. You have a Russian  military that is under siege in terms of manning. The more weapons we  provide to the Ukrainians, the more lethal they become on the  battlefield, the more likely this war ends on favorable terms.   So I just want to remind the American people as we go into this  holiday, remember those who sacrificed for our freedom. There is a hot  war in Europe.   It is 2022. Did anybody really believe after the fall of the Berlin  Wall that we would be having a war with Russia in Europe trying to take  over a sovereign country called Ukraine? Well, that is where we are,  and I guess one thing to learn about mankind is that the calendar may  change, but there is a dark side of mankind--powerful people trying to  push the less powerful around; people trying to take things through  force of arms rather than the rule of law.   So I want the Ukrainian people to know that I am with you. I think  most Americans are with you. We don't want you to entice Putin to go  beyond Ukraine by surrendering your territory. We stand with you. Not 1  inch of Ukrainian territory should be given to Putin because he chose  force of arms. The rule of law versus the rule of guns is at stake. I  am hoping that we will send you more lethal weapons, not less, that we  will increase your capability to inflict pain on the Russian military.    I do believe that people in Russia are beginning to understand that,  with Putin, they have a very limited future; that if you continue to  support Putin, the world will isolate you further; that we are not  going to forgive and forget the war crimes.   NATO is getting bigger. Finland and Sweden have applied to NATO. I  have talked to our friends in Turkey. I hope we can resolve that.   So it would be wonderful in the next coming weeks here that the  Senate, in fast fashion, could include two more members of NATO; that  everything Putin wanted has backfired; that the Ukrainian nation still  stands; that NATO is bigger not smaller; that war crimes investigations  move forward, they don't stall.   In the International Criminal Court, Mr. Khan is doing a good job of  gathering evidence against Russian atrocities committed by Russian  military leaders and Russian forces, all under the control of Putin,  and I just encourage that effort to go further. Ukrainian courts have  convicted a Russian soldier of murder, a war crime.   So what I would like to see is the Western world, the democratic  world, reinforce our commitment to Ukraine, not talk about having to  give Putin territory to end this war, because that is not the way to  end the war; that is a way to expand the war.   If we can end this through diplomatic means, great, but what should  be off the table is rewarding Putin for this invasion. What should be  on the table is a commitment to Ukraine. As long as they are willing to  fight, as long as they are willing to fight for their freedom and die  for their territory, we should help them, because Putin won't stop with  Ukraine if he is successful.   The blood and treasure that we have spent since 9/11 has been tough  for our country, but not one American soldier is on the ground in  Ukraine. They are not asking for soldiers; they are only asking for the  ability to defend themselves--economic assistance, military assistance.   I do not want to let the pressure off Putin. Senator Risch and  Senator Menendez--the chairman, Senator Menendez, of the Foreign  Relations  [[Page S2727]]  Committee--are considering marking up legislation urging the Biden  administration to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. So  let's keep the pressure on Putin. Let's let the Russian people know  that, as long as Putin is your leader, you will be isolated from the  international community, your economy can't grow, and there are going  to be more and more young Russians killed in this folly.   I would urge the Russian people to change course here. Pick a new  leader. The world will embrace Russia. Russia is a land of many  talented people, with a long rich history.   I am hoping and praying that the freedom-loving world will not make  the mistakes in 2022 that we made in 1932, that we made in 1937 and  1938 where we thought the way to end the war was to appease a brutal  dictator. That is not the way to end a war; that is the way to continue  wars and make them bigger.   So, as for me, I will do everything in my power to help the Ukrainian  people as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I will do everything in my power  to hold Putin accountable. I will do everything in my power, working  with my Democratic and Republican colleagues, to isolate Putin's  Russia.   This is a difficult time for the world. If he fails in Ukraine, if  the Russian people rise up and change course, the world will be a lot  better off. If he succeeds, God help us all because the worst is yet to  come.   No problem here at home gets better by turning our back on Ukraine  and not holding Putin accountable. Whatever problems we have at the  border, with inflation, gas prices, all the domestic violence here at  home, none of those problems get better if Putin wins in Ukraine.   Here is the good news for the American people: The Ukrainian people  are not asking for our young men and women to fight and die in Ukraine;  they are only asking for our help. They need arms. They need weapons.  They need economic assistance. If we will continue to show our  resolve--the Western world--Putin will lose and the people of Ukraine  will win. Now is not the time to put on the table capitulation.   So to everybody, I hope you have a safe Memorial Day. I look forward  to coming back after the break to see if we can find a pathway forward  on commonsense gun reforms. Between now and then, let's keep the people  of Ukraine in our prayers.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
