 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), the minority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity to  inform the Members of where we are. So many of us have been through  this process before, and I know that every Member wants to have as much  certainty about the schedule as possible. But, also, every Member  understands that when we are at a period of time when we are trying to  leave for a week and we have important legislation to do, that these  events sometimes drag out.   So the schedule is this: After the next vote we are going to break  for dinner. Members will be on notice that they will receive a 1-hour  notice if we are going to return. As the House knows, we are scheduled  to meet tomorrow as well, which we intend to do. So it is not unusual  that we would go long before the last day, assuming that is the last  day.   I want everybody to get the ramifications of assuming that tomorrow  is the last day. We want to get two major pieces of legislation done.  They are controversial pieces of legislation, we know, but we want to  get those done. We are working on that. The other side has gone through  that experience themselves.   Members should be on notice that we have an intention to break after  this next vote for dinner, subject to an hour's notice to be back here,  with the expectation that there may well be votes this evening. We are  hopeful that those votes would be sooner rather than later in terms of  going late into the night.   We will meet tomorrow at 9 o'clock and hope to complete the remainder  of the business that was noted as possible for this week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the question, and  then we will conclude. We hope to have not only a JCT score but also  CBO scores. As the gentleman knows, the overwhelming majority of the  bill has been pending for some time. Obviously, the CBO has been  reviewing the individual items for some time. We expect to have very  close to most of the bill.   It does not need a CBO score. It does need a CBO score, however, when  it goes to the Senate, as the gentleman knows. That would be our  intention, to have as much information available to Members as we have  in hand. We do intend to move forward with the bill.    We are working on that. We hope the CBO can accommodate  that objective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
