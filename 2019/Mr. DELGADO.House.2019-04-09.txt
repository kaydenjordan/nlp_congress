 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I want to first thank my colleague, Chairman Doyle, for  his leadership on this bill.   The Save the Internet Act restores critical net neutrality  protections that the FCC repealed last year. This legislation is  necessary to hold on firm legal ground the net neutrality principles we  should all support: no blocking, no throttling, and no paid  prioritization.   While ensuring a free and open internet is of the utmost importance,  so, too, is ensuring broadband internet access for all. In fact,  according to the FCC's 2018 Communications Marketplace Report, nearly  one in four Americans lack access to broadband internet service at  home.   As a proud Representative of one of the most rural congressional  districts in the country, I cannot overstate what  [[Page H3183]]  a huge problem this is. Individuals and small businesses in my district  still lack access to stand-alone broadband internet because of high  service costs, a lack of broadband infrastructure, and outdated and  unreasonable bundling practices that require consumers to purchase a  home telephone service or a cable package as a condition for purchasing  broadband internet service.                                time  1700    In today's global economy, broadband shouldn't come with any strings  attached. That is why my amendment would give GAO 1 year to report to  Congress on the benefits to consumers of making broadband internet  service available to everyone on a standalone basis.   Additionally, it would include recommendations to Congress on ways to  increase the availability of stand-alone broadband internet service to  consumers, particularly those living in rural areas.   Consumers increasingly don't want to buy big cable bundles. They just  want access to the internet. That is why I urge support for this  amendment and for the underlying bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Communications and Technology.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I would like to thank Chairman Doyle for introducing this  critical legislation and urge Members on both sides of the aisle to  support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
