 Mr. President, it is my hope that soon the Senate might be  able to vote on a bipartisan agreement to keep the government open and  funded through February 18.   I know both parties are working on that agreement right now. I wish  those who are doing it good luck. I have certainly been working hard  with the Appropriations Committee to help on that as have others. In  fact, the only thing  [[Page S8901]]  worse than running the government under a continuing resolution, a CR,  is a government shutdown. A shutdown only hurts the American people. We  know last time we had one, it wasted billions in taxpayer dollars.   And with the agreement that I anticipate, I am glad that the bill  will include critical funding to support Afghan refugees as we help  them get resettled here in the United States. These brave women and men  were our allies through 20 years of war. We have an obligation to  support them as they begin their new lives.   I am not giving this speech as some kind of a victory lap. We are 2  months into the fiscal year, and we appear no closer to getting an  agreement on full-year appropriations bills.   Now, if we vote on this, which I hope we will soon, we are buying  time to complete these negotiations, and we have to complete these  negotiations. It is not a matter of whether we should; we have to. But  in order to complete these negotiations, we have to begin them. We have  to have both sides represented at the table. My Republican colleagues,  to this day, have not come to the table. I have been talking to many of  them, and I am hoping they will because the American people deserve  better than that from their elected officials. They expect to see both  Democrats and Republicans sitting down negotiating--no matter how we  vote in the end, that we are working on coming to something that will  be voted on.   On October 18, nearly a month and a half ago, Senate Democrats  released a comprehensive offer in an effort to jump-start these  negotiations. We wanted to let all Senators--both parties but  especially our Republican colleagues and the American people--know our  values. Since then, it has been very, very quiet. We haven't heard any  response.   Let me tell you about our offer. I believe the offer was fair. I  talked with Senators across the political spectrum. We provided a 5- percent increase for defense programs compared to last fiscal year and  a 13-percent increase for all other programs. I took that 5 percent  because it is exactly the amount passed by a 25-to-1 vote by the Senate  Armed Services Committee. It certainly is significantly higher than the  1.7-percent increase for defense proposed by the Biden administration,  and the amount is lower than the 16 percent the administration proposed  for nondefense programs, even though I would like that 16 percent. But  it is called compromise. We took from one; we gave to the other. It is  compromise. It is how you get things done. Nobody gets every single  thing they want, even if you are chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee.   As I mentioned earlier, the 5 percent wasn't something I picked out  of thin air. It was the exact amount contained in the fiscal year 2022  National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, that is before the Senate  this week and again reported from the Senate Armed Services Committee.  I think it was 24 to 1, but it was overwhelming.   The work on that bill has fallen due to Republican obstructionism  over a series of amendments. To be clear though, none of the amendments  Republicans are fighting for on the NDAA would increase total spending  in the bill. That is because the 5-percent increase has bipartisan,  bicameral support--Republicans and Democrats, both in the House and the  Senate. That is the percentage they agreed to. Republicans unanimously  endorsed the 5-percent increase when the NDAA was marked up in the  Senate Armed Services Committee. And the 5-percent increase passed  overwhelmingly in the House when they considered the NDAA over 2 months  ago.   I have been here for 47 years. This is as close to consensus as we  can get--unanimous and near-unanimous votes. So I have to ask, why not  take yes for an answer? If I was a cynical person, I would think this  delay was deliberate. If I was a cynical person, I would think this  delay was meant to drive us into a full-year continuing resolution. If  I was a cynical person, I would think that because some in the  Republican Party have even expressed this desire out loud.   But for a party that claims to care about our Nation's defense, I  suggest they do the math. A full-year CR would not only reduce defense  spending instead of increasing it, it would reduce it by $37 billion  compared to the levels set forth in the NDAA that they voted for  unanimously. Actually, it would cut defense spending below last year's  level.   So stop the hyperbole. Stop the rhetoric. Deal with the reality. I  have to ask those Republicans who are advocating for a full-year CR is  their support for our Nation's security merely political theater? I  hope not because what they are asking for is a tremendous cut in  defense, not an increase.   But also I look at the nondefense area. The impact a full-year CR  would have on American families in all corners of this country is  equally unthinkable. Housing, education, childcare, critical healthcare  programs--every one of these are at risk under a full-year continuing  resolution. I can't possibly imagine that any Senator of either party  is going to go home and say: Oh, I support huge cuts in housing,  education, childcare, critical healthcare programs. I cannot possibly  believe that is an outcome the other side would endorse, but that is  what they are asking for in a CR.   Every week, it seems I receive letters from advocacy groups and  industry associations--both those normally associated with Republican  positions and those normally associated with Democratic positions--and  they all say the same thing. They detail the problems that would come  from the full-year CR and ask us to do our job and enact full-year  bills. Among those, they include the National Defense Industrial  Association, the Aerospace Industries Association, numerous veterans  groups--all groups we say we support.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four of these letters be  printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.    These four letters and others expressing concern can be  found online at https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/download/ advocacy-and-industry-group-letters.   Let me be clear. Refusing to come to the negotiating table undermines  national security and inhibits our ability to invest in American  families, impedes our capability to respond to the coronavirus and what  we now see as emerging variants--which I am sure the Presiding Officer  hears in his State, I hear in my State, and I guarantee you in the  other 48 States, every Senator is hearing about that concern.   But also there are 100 of us. We are elected to represent the whole  country, 325 million Americans. We are elected to do our job. If we  don't do it, it is irresponsible. That is the reason we are here today  kicking the can down the road another 2 months.   Let's stand and vote yes or no on these issues. We have a job to do.  The bill we will soon vote on, which I expect will be coming over soon  from the House, gives us roughly 2 months to do it, and that is plenty  of time.   But I would ask the Republican leadership to step up and engage, and  I hope they will do it in the next few weeks.   I am prepared any day--any day, any weekend, any evening, any  morning, whenever--if we could do this. Otherwise, we are going to be  back here February 18, and the American people, no matter what party  they belong to, are going to say: What are you folks doing? Where is  this legislation?   So when the bill comes over, I urge my colleagues to vote aye on the  bill, but I urge my Republican colleagues to work with me and with the  House to ensure that we do not have to pass another one in February.   I have talked with Members of the Republican Party and the Democratic  Party. They will tell me privately they are willing to work, they want  to work, and they want to get it done. I appreciate that, but now is  the time to step up and do it. I think we can. I hope we will.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    National Defense                                          Industrial Association,                                    Arlington, VA, November 1, 2021.        Dear Chairman Leahy, Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Members       Shelby and Granger: On behalf of the thousands of companies       represented by the National Defense Industrial Association       (NDIA) and across the defense industrial base, we write to       request  [[Page S8902]]       the expedited completion of the defense appropriation bill.       While we applaud the bipartisan effort to pass a continuing       resolution (CR) and avoid a government shutdown, it is a poor       stand-in for the full-year appropriations desperately needed       by our warfighters and those who provide them with the       equipment and services that enable their mission.        We cannot stress enough the importance of the defense       appropriations bill to our national security and to a healthy       defense industrial base. The limbo caused under CRs wastes       precious time and money our nation cannot recover. Delayed       new starts and initiatives place a strain on companies and       their workforce, particularly as they recalibrate operations       to a post-pandemic normal. Our nation's competitors face no       similar challenges putting us at a competitive disadvantage,       particularly with emerging technologies, and place our supply       chains at increasing risk, something we cannot afford after       the nearly two years of pandemic impacts.        Doing business with the Federal Government is already hard.       The tomes of regulations, burdensome business requirements,       sometimes Kafkaesque contracting and oversight procedures,       and compressed margins have combined to drive businesses out       of the defense sector with a net outflow of well over 10,000       companies since 2011 and, as noted in our annual Vital Signs       report, a halving of new entrants to the sector between       fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 alone. Add to that the       uncertainty of ``if and when'' a full-year defense       appropriations gets signed into law, more companies will       reassess their participation in the defense industrial base.       The ultimate price of this is paid by our warfighters who       will lose out on innovations and new capabilities not       delivered.        The inefficiencies caused by beginning 12 of the last 13       fiscal years without full-year funding have cost the military       services billions lost in inefficient expenditures and       program delays. Also, delayed contract starts challenge       larger contractors while threaten the existence of smaller       prime contractors and small businesses down the supply chain.       The effect of that has a human face and a long-term impact.       To execute a new-start contract, a company must recruit,       hire, and train a workforce despite a tight labor market and       a shortage of workers with the required security clearance.       Faced with a delayed start, that company must now choose       between two bad options, either pay that workforce to stand       idle or let those workers go-both of which could lead to       contract or business failure and undelivered capabilities to       our service members.        With no full-year funding, we cannot afford to go too long       without hampering readiness recovery efforts, delaying       capabilities to our warfighters, and postponing investments       in advanced technologies while allowing our defense       industrial base to erode. NDIA supports a bipartisan       agreement on domestic and national security spending and       encourages the adoption of a two-year budget to prevent       another year of budget instability and to provide the needed       support to the Department of Defense for their critical       missions.        We appreciate your attention to this critical issue and       look forward to working with your Committees moving forward.            Very respectfully,      Herbert J. Carlisle,        General, USAF (Ret), President and CEO, National Defense       Industrial Association.      Arnold L. Punaro,        MajGen, USMC (Ret) Chairman of the Board, National Defense       Industrial Association.                                   ____                                 Aerospace Industries Association,                                                   November 2, 2021.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Ranking       Member McConnell, and Ranking Member McCarthy: The United       States aerospace and defense industries are an essential       partner with the federal government in an array of efforts       vital to our economy and our national security. Each fall,       that partnership is tested when those programs are slowed       down or deferred by the use of multiple continuing       resolutions (CR) to keep the government running. On behalf of       our vital industries and our more than two million employees,       the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) strongly urges you       to reach a near-term agreement on fiscal year 2022 funding to       avoid further CRs beyond December 3, 2021.        Government watchdogs continue to document the waste and       unnecessary disruption that CRs cause to federal programs.       Multiple agencies advised the Government Accountability       Office (GAO) in a 2021 report that longer CRs ``contributed       to distortions in agencies' spending, adding to the rush to       obligate funds late in the year before they expire.'' The GAO       determined that contracting officers working under a CR must       continuously align the period of performance under their       contracts to the specific timeframe of a given CR, resulting       in many unnecessary contract modifications during the year.       Hiring of new civilian staff is also delayed, making it       harder for agencies to meet their goals. The GAO notes that       agencies apply creative workarounds in the first quarter of       each fiscal year, because they assume that appropriations       bills will not be in place by the beginning of the fiscal       year. However, these effects become far more serious, and       agency staff have fewer options, when CRs continue into the       second quarter and beyond.        The Department of Defense (DOD) is uniquely harmed under       CRs because these bills typically prohibit DOD from starting       new programs or activities or increasing any program's       production rate beyond that of the current fiscal year. Both       `new starts' and rate increases are critical for our national       defense because our defense posture and threats are always       evolving. As CRs extend to longer periods during the year,       this is an increasing problem for which DOD seldom gets       relief. DOD reported to the GAO that between FY10 and FY20,       they had requested exceptions to CR language (called       ``anomalies'') 1,258 times and had only been granted three       percent of those requests. Most of these requested relief       from the prohibition on new starts and rate increases. We       strongly believe that, should Congress produce CRs extending       into the second quarter of FY22, it should eliminate the       prohibition on new starts and production rate increases.        FY22 is the first year in a decade when discretionary       spending levels have not been fixed in statute by the Budget       Control Act. AIA has long argued that statutory caps are not       needed because Congress and the administration are able to       assess and address the needs of the nation more effectively,       and with greater oversight, through the annual appropriations       process. Last year, Congress enacted all 12 full year       appropriations bills by December 27. If Congress fails to       once again enact full-year appropriations bills, or continues       running the government into 2022 under continuing       resolutions, it will send the wrong signal to the       government's partners, like those in our industry. We count       on stable, reliable and adequate funding to support the       critical capabilities that we provide for all Americans.        Like other industries, COVID-19 took a serious toll on our       workforce and the thousands of small- and medium-sized       businesses along the supply chain that are at the heart of       the aerospace and defense industries. More than ever,       businesses across all industries need predictability and       consistency.        We again ask that you ensure that all government programs       receive full Fiscal Year 2022 funding on or before December       3, 2021.            Sincerely,                                                   Eric Fanning,                                        President and CEO, Aerospace      Industries Association.                                   ____                                             Coalition on Human Needs,                                                  November 24, 2021.        Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the Coalition on Human       Needs, I am writing to strongly urge you to do everything in       your power to enact omnibus FY 2022 appropriations       legislation including all 12 subcommittee bills, and thank       you for your leadership towards this end. Our nation badly       needs the increased funding provided in the Senate and House       Appropriations Committee bills. We face many increased needs,       a great many exacerbated by the pandemic and its economic       dislocations. For more than a decade, funding levels for       vital human needs programs have shrunk, especially taking       inflation into account. If Congress fails to enact omnibus       appropriations legislation and instead defaults to a long-      term continuing resolution (CR) with flat funding, we will       seriously damage our capacity to respond to the multiple       public health and economic crises we face.        Members of the Coalition on Human Needs, including human       service provider organizations, faith groups, labor, civil       rights, policy experts and other advocates concerned with       meeting the needs of people with low incomes,       enthusiastically welcomed the funding levels provided in the       Biden FY 2022 budget and the House and Senate Appropriations       Committees. We have tracked nearly 200 human needs programs       over the past decade. Between FYs 2010 and 2020, we found       that two-thirds of these programs, covering health care,       housing, nutrition, social services, education, training, and       more, had lost ground, taking inflation into account. In the       past year, we have begun to rebuild. But the needs are also       growing.        We now face rising prices affecting necessities including       utilities, food, and rent. Flat funding from a prolonged CR       would fail our people by not providing needed increases in       programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance       Program (LIHEAP). The Senate Labor-Health and Human Services-      Education Subcommittee-introduced bill increases funding by       $175 million. This is too modest when taking into account       that natural gas heating costs are projected to rise by 30       percent this winter and heating oil is expected to rise by 43       percent; flat funding would be wholly inadequate. Nutrition       programs will also need funding increases because of rising       food prices. The Senate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee       proposal includes $576 million for home-delivered meals for       seniors, an increase of $300 million above the FY 2021       enacted level. Responding to a serious increase in people       experiencing homelessness, the Senate Transportation-Housing       and Urban Development Subcommittee-introduced bill would       increase Homelessness Assistance programs to $3.26 billion,       $260 million more than FY 2021. These funds would expand       services for homeless youth and people fleeing from domestic       violence, and would provide additional permanent housing for       chronically unhoused people. While the Senate Subcommittee       bill would cover current rental voucher program costs, the       House bill would expand rental assistance to 125,000       additional households. These increases are vitally needed.       For the first 11 months of this year, median one-bedroom       apartment rents rose 12.1 percent; for  [[Page S8903]]       two-bedroom units, the median increase was 13.2 percent. In       the previous two years, median rent increases were less than       1 percent. Flat funding for housing and homelessness programs       would be simply unacceptable.        We have for some time faced a substance use crisis, and       have reached 100,000 deaths from opioid overdoses already       this year, up from about 93,000 in 2020. The Senate funding       level for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration (SAMHSA) is $9.1 billion, $3.1 billion more       than funding in FY 2021. Without this substantial increase,       we will not be able to cope with the continuing rise in       opioid addiction.        The pandemic has markedly increased mental health problems.       From August 2020 to February 2021, the CDC reported an       increase in adults with anxiety or depressive disorders, from       36.4 percent to 41.5 percent, and reports rose of unmet       mental health care needs. The proposed SAMHSA funding levels       allow us to respond more adequately. The Senate Labor-HHS-      Education Subcommittee proposal would increase mental health       services overall to $2.97 billion, an increase of nearly $1.2       billion over FY 2021. In particular, the Senate Subcommittee       bill more than doubles funding for the Mental Health Block       Grant, to $1.58 billion for FY 2022. The House-passed funding       for Labor-HHS-Education makes a welcome increase in       Children's Mental Health funding, stopping the inflation-      driven erosion that caused a 14 percent reduction from FY       2010 to FY 2020. We must not return to flat funding when the       pandemic has adversely affected the mental health of millions       of children and adults.        Over the past decade, we allowed our public health capacity       to diminish, and as a consequence we were not ready to cope       with COVID-19. The Senate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee       appropriations bill increases the Centers for Disease Control       about $1.85 billion over the current year, allowing for the       agency to rebuild so that it can more effectively respond to       COVID-19 and future health threats.        We know our economy is hampered by a mismatch between jobs       available and people with the skills to fill those positions.       FY 2022 appropriations proposals include increases in       Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs (WIOA),       YouthBuild, Registered Apprenticeships, and Reintegration of       Ex-Offender programs, as well as a new National Youth       Employment Program. These will lead to jobs with higher pay       and broadly shared economic growth. These increases are       needed to overcome a ten-year 17 percent reduction in WIOA       programs and to move us forward.        There are too many important programs to list here. But we       do wish to underscore that children have experienced many       hardships during the pandemic, including unprecedented losses       in education and alarming increases in reports of households       with children sometimes or often not having enough to eat.       The historic increases proposed in Title I K-12 education for       students with low incomes and in special education funding       are urgently needed to help children overcome the educational       setbacks they have experienced. Title I spending rises by at       least $16.6 billion over FY 2021, and there will be a $2.6       billion increase in IDEA state grants for more than 7.6       million students with disabilities.        The FY 2022 appropriations bills drawn up in the House and/      or Senate include many important funding increases to help       families care for their children. Funding for the Women,       Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition program must accommodate       an increase in benefits that was extended through the end of       December in the current Continuing Resolution, and must not       be allowed to expire at that time. In addition to the mental       health, housing, nutrition, and education funding already       mentioned here, there are badly needed increases in child       care, Head Start, early learning programs, and child abuse       prevention and treatment programs. There are also urgently       needed increases in funds to care for unaccompanied migrant       children: at $4.9 billion, a $3.6 billion increase over FY       2021 in the Senate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee bill.        The nation's recovery depends on strengthening a host of       domestic programs that have been allowed to shrink for years,       not just to get to where they had been before, but to respond       to needs far greater because of the pandemic and its global       economic dislocations. A long-term continuing resolution       would be a severe failure to address these needs. We strongly       urge you to enact omnibus appropriations legislation       including all twelve bills as soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                                 Deborah Weinstein,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  November 10, 2021.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       On behalf of the millions of veterans our organizations       represent, we write to express serious concerns about reports       that the Senate is considering approving a full-year       continuing resolution to fund the federal government for the       remainder of fiscal year 2022, which would have significant       negative consequences for veterans, their families,       caregivers and survivors. Therefore, we are asking that you       work together to ensure that veterans programs, benefits and       medical services receive the full level of funding for fiscal       year 2022 that was approved with strong bipartisan support       (25 to 5) by the Senate Appropriations Committee in August.        As you know, Congress approved and the President signed a       short-term continuing resolution (Public Law 117-43) on       September 30th to fund the federal government through       December 3, 2021, extending funding at the levels previously       enacted in fiscal year 2021 appropriations legislation.       Funding for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care       and benefit payments for fiscal year 2022 was previously       approved in December 2020 as advance appropriations in       Division J (Military Construction and Veterans Affairs) of       the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 116-      260. However, the advance appropriations process only works       properly if funding levels are adjusted to address increased       demand for benefits and services as part of the following       year's regular appropriations process, as is necessary for       fiscal year 2022. Further, if Congress passes a full-year       continuing resolution, all other programs, services and       benefits would remain funded at fiscal year 2021 levels,       which would fall short of the anticipated needs.        For example, a full-year continuing resolution could result       in an estimated $7 billion shortfall in funding for mandatory       compensation and pension benefits, in large part due to an       increased number of benefit claims resulting from       congressional approval of new diseases related to Agent       Orange exposure for Vietnam veterans.        In addition, the time it takes to process these and other       claims for benefits would be significantly increased without       the $300 million increase for the Veterans Benefits       Administration approved by the Senate Appropriations       Committee. Similarly, reductions from the Committee-approved       levels for the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the National       Cemetery Administration would negatively impact veterans and       their survivors seeking their services and benefits.        Enacting a full-year continuing resolution would also       negatively hamper veterans' ability to receive timely medical       care absent the $3.3 billion increase for Veterans Medical       Community Care approved by the Senate Committee. VA's       critical Medical and Prosthetic Research programs would be       cut by $67 million and funding to support VA's health care       infrastructure would be cut $450 million below the levels       approved by the Committee if Congress passes a full-year       continuing resolution.        As leaders of the Senate, we call on you to reject       consideration of a full-year continuing resolution that would       reduce veterans' funding below what has already been approved       in an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the Senate       Appropriations Committee. Instead, we ask that you use your       influence to ensure that the Senate completes consideration       of the fiscal year 2022 appropriations so that veterans,       their families, caregivers and survivors have timely access       to all the benefits, services and medical care they have       earned.

Sharon Hodge,        Director for Policy and Government Affairs, Vietnam       Veterans of America.      Brian Dempsey,        Government Affairs Director, Wounded Warrior Project.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I will be very brief.   I will note that, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this  bill was negotiated on a bipartisan-bicameral basis to keep the  government open and operating until February 18.   I urge every Member to vote ``aye.'' We have to pass it tonight, but  I warn and remind every Senator: It is not a substitute for doing our  work. We have to use the next 2 months to negotiate and enact full-year  appropriations bills. I hope my Republican friends will come to the  table to negotiate toplines. The Democrats have made a fair offer, a  strong offer, and we need a response.   So I thank Vice Chairman Shelby for his cooperation and hard work on  this bill. I look forward to working with him, as I did earlier today,  and will continue to until we get an agreement on a topline and all 12  appropriations bills by February 18.   Let's get to work and show the country the Senate can do its work.   I yield the floor.                              Vote on H.R. 6119
