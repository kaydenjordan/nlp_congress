 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me just say while the Senator is on  the floor that I express my admiration once again for the distinguished  Senator from Utah, who is my good friend and in many ways is a mentor  as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I am privileged to be  a member of that committee and to work with him and, of course, on the  Judiciary Committee as well. I thank the Senator in particular for his  leadership on this resolution of disapproval, and I support his  position 100 percent.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    As we all know now, Mr. President, this Chamber will consider the  nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve as the next Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Yesterday I spoke a little bit about his qualifications, his  background, and his temperament. During the 20 hours of hearings we  held before the Judiciary Committee, I think people saw the real Neil  Gorsuch--somebody who, again, by virtue of his qualifications, his  education, his training, and his experience is supremely qualified to  serve on the Supreme Court. He did pass every single test with flying  colors, even as my colleagues and some activist groups have done their  best to find ways to object to what may be one of the most qualified  candidates for the Court in our Nation's history.   One argument we have heard from the opponents of the nominee in 3  days of grueling hearings was that he failed to convey his approach to  judging--how he would approach the job. I would like to point out that  that is simply not the case. Judge Gorsuch made clear that the text of  the statute, the text of the Constitution, and the text of a precedent  would guide his judging and would be the place where he starts in  deciding any case. As he has repeatedly written and stated publicly,  the job of a good judge is to understand what the law means and to  interpret what lawmakers have done.   I know some of our colleagues and some of the activist groups who are  critical of Judge Gorsuch are upset that he doesn't believe in a living  Constitution--in other words, that the Constitution, as written and  ratified by the States, does not mean what it says, and that judges  have a license to interpret the words in a way to pursue some other  purpose, some other agenda, political or personal or the like.   Judge Gorsuch rejects that approach, and rightly so. Indeed, how can  a judge claim to bear allegiance to the Constitution if he doesn't  actually start in interpreting the Constitution by reading the text of  the words? What would a judge decide on if not the text and the  original meaning?   To that effect, I received a letter from a friend of mine and an  expert in this area, Bryan Garner, last week. Bryan is a well-known  lawyer and writer and, among many impressive accomplishments, he is a  distinguished research professor of law at Southern  [[Page S2060]]  Methodist University in Dallas, TX. Bryan has written extensively on  judging, appellate advocacy, and the law generally. He was in  attendance at the hearings last week. As I said, he has written a  number of books, including with Judge Gorsuch, on judicial precedent,  and with Justice Scalia, on reading laws.   In a recent letter, Bryan echoed the same point made by both of these  men at different times--that adherence to the text is essential to our  system of government. He said: ``The very fact of having a written  constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.''   Now, that seems so obvious, but, apparently, it is not obvious to  some of the critics. He said: ``The very fact of having a written  constitution meant that we had fixed its meaning in permanent form.''  In other words, our Constitution is not meant to float on the whims of  judges over time, bound only by precedent. It is actually written down,  so that even judges have to start with the very text.   If we think about it, there is the independence that we have given to  the judiciary--lifetime tenure. They don't have to stand for election,  and they are not accountable to the voters or the people. The reason  why the Founders created such an important role for the judiciary is  because they believed there ought to be an umpire who calls balls and  strikes when Congress passes laws or when lawsuits are filed and who  could determine the fidelity of those laws to the text of the  Constitution, which had a fixed meaning.   Well, sometimes this is called originalism, but it is not a political  doctrine or an excuse to get certain outcomes. Mr. Garner makes the  point that although his personal politics are different, dramatically,  from those of Justice Scalia, those personal politics are irrelevant  because the job of a judge is to apply a fair reading of the law. If  you can't do that, then, maybe you ought to run for the Senate or  Congress and get involved in politics rather than judging, because a  failure to apply the law as fairly read is essential in any good judge.   Judges aren't given lifetime tenure--the sort of independence that  nobody else in our government is given--just to enact their own visions  of policy. Judge Gorsuch confirmed time and again that he will not do  that--that he will only interpret the law as he has throughout his  career as an independent judge, with faithfulness and fidelity to the  text and the original understanding of the Constitution.   The letter I have been quoting in part is here in my hand, and I ask  unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my  remarks.   Now, I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who have  indicated that adherence to originalism is a liability or who claim  that it is somehow a radical doctrine out of the mainstream, but that  is just a scare tactic. It is completely wrong. Let me remind my  colleagues that during her confirmation hearings, now-Justice Elena  Kagan told the same committee that ``we are all Originalists''--hardly  a radical position, if Justice Kagan and Judge Gorsuch agree with  originalism. It is certainly not a methodology of interpreting law that  should stir any concern.   Yesterday, some of our Democratic colleagues continued to reinforce  my view that they don't really have any legitimate objection and reason  to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch. This is about Judge Gorsuch. This is  not about President Trump. This is not about Merrick Garland. This is  not about anything else.   We will have a chance to vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch  for the U.S Supreme Court. That is the question that will be presented  to the Senate for an up-or-down vote. Any fairminded person would have  to conclude that he is an independent legal mind and that he will not  legislate from the bench. He has the intelligence, experience, and  character to be a good judge, as he has been for 10 years on the Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals out of Denver. He has an unflinching  commitment to upholding a faithful interpretation of the Constitution  and our laws. I look forward to confirming him next week.    The question for our Democratic friends is whether they are going to  launch the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in  the history of the United States. It really is unprecedented, what the  Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, has suggested--that for the first  time in the history of the Senate, a partisan filibuster will be used  to attempt to defeat the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice and to  deny the Senate the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote.   Now, just to be clear, there are two votes we are talking about. One  is the so-called cloture vote, where we close off debate. That takes 60  votes. Then, once that passes, it is clearly a majority vote, and 51  votes will carry the day.   But the Democratic leader has suggested that he would deny the Senate  the opportunity to get to that second up-or-down vote, and that is  simply unprecedented. It is unprecedented for a very good reason. To  believe that 60 votes would be required to confirm a nominee to the  U.S. Supreme Court would be to suggest that the Founding Fathers, when  the Constitution was written and when it was ratified, somehow believed  that the Senate rules were incorporated in the Constitution, when that  is clearly not the case--clearly not the case. The Constitution is a  separate document. The Senate rules are a different thing. But, again,  never have they been conflated to suggest that somehow, in order to  confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court, we need 60 votes.   I understand the pressure that our friend the Democratic leader is  under, because after this last election, he has now had to straddle two  competing camps within the Democratic Party--traditional Democrats  versus the Democrats lead by the wing of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth  Warren. I understand the pressures that he must feel and the reason why  he would do something that is unprecedented and suggest that we  filibuster this nomination.   We already know that some Members of his conference have said they  will agree to an up-or-down vote. Our friend from West Virginia,  Senator Manchin, has said he opposes the filibuster. Senator Leahy, the  former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said he is not  inclined to go along with it, either. Senator Cardin, our colleague and  friend from Maryland, has stopped short of agreeing with the minority  leader's strategy. Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota has said that she  believes the nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.   If the Democratic leader follows through, as I said, it would be  unprecedented. Never before has there been a successful partisan  filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. I would just say to our friends  across the aisle that time and again Democrats have accelerated the  arms race on judges, and every single time, it has come back to bite  them.   We remember in 2013, when Senator Harry Reid, then the majority  leader, broke the Senate rules in order to change the rules, in order  to lower the threshold for circuit court and district court  nominations. He did that because of the desire to pack the District of  Columbia Court of Appeals, because that was the court that had primary  jurisdiction over cases coming out of the Obama White House--its  regulations and the like. In order to get a court that would be more  likely to rubberstamp and approve of Obama policies, Senator Reid felt  it was imperative to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.  Unfortunately, he was able to do so with the votes of the Democrats  across the aisle--to break the Senate rules to change the rules for the  sole purpose of rubberstamping Obama administration policies.   The question before the Senate this time is very different. Those who  would break precedent are those who would filibuster a Supreme Court  nominee like Judge Gorsuch because it has never been done before. But I  would ask our Democratic colleagues this: If Judge Gorsuch is not  acceptable to them, is there ever going to be a nominee from a Trump  administration whom they would find acceptable?   They have tried to find fault with Judge Gorsuch, and they have  simply been unable to do so. So they keep moving the goalpost and  raising different issues because they, frankly, are desperate to find  some reason to justify this unprecedented filibuster.   But if they do--if Democrats block Judge Gorsuch from receiving an  up-or-  [[Page S2061]]  down vote--then, there is simply no Republican nominee to the U.S.  Supreme Court they won't filibuster. If Judge Gorsuch isn't good  enough, I dare say there will never be another nominee who is good  enough to allow an up-or-down vote if this unprecedented filibuster is  allowed to stand.   So I hope our colleagues will reconsider, and that, on cooler  reflection, the will not be driven by the radical elements in their own  party but rather by their good judgment and their sense of  responsibility to not only their constituents but to the Constitution  itself and to the important role that the Senate plays in the advice  and consent function to the nominee of the U.S. Supreme Court. I hope  they reconsider, and I hope that when the rollcall vote is held, our  colleagues will provide the 60 votes we need to get cloture, so we can  have that up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      Law Prose,                                         Dallas, TX, March 25, 2017.      Senator John Cornyn,      U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cornyn: It was an eerie feeling for me this       week, sitting behind my friend and coauthor Judge Neil M.       Gorsuch as he was being vetted to replace my late friend and       coauthor, Justice Antonin Scalia. As you know, I've written       lengthy books with both men, and I know their legal       philosophies pretty darned well.        One aspect of their approach to judging--``originalism,''       as it's called--has attracted polemicists to use the label as       a scare tactic. So much demagoguery surrounds the word that       some clarification is in order.        People might wonder why Justice Scalia would write a       prescriptive book on judging (Reading Law) with someone who       had declared himself to favor same-sex marriage, to be       ardently pro-choice, to disfavor prayer in public schools,       and to be hostile to the Second Amendment--so hostile, in       fact, that he would like to see it repealed altogether. Yes,       I'd favor serious gun-control measures in this country.        My private beliefs on these points, however, would be       irrelevant if I were up for a judgeship because       methodologically I'm an originalist: I wouldn't be enacting       my own visions of wise policy--that's not what a good judge       does--but instead I'd be applying a ``fair reading'' to the       the statutory or constitutional words before me. Although I       deplore the Second Amendment's right to bear arms, I think       the Supreme Court's Heller decision was correct: the       constitutional Framers meant there to be a personal (though       not unlimited) right to own guns. I wish it weren't so.        Only if I were a ``pragmatist'' judge or a ``changing       constitutionalist'' would these private views become       important. Then I wouldn't be ``interpreting'' a document.       Instead, I'd be declaring new policies that have no       discernible foundation in the Constitution itself. I'd be       looking within my heart and soul to consider what I believed       to be fundamentally important. There I might discover new       rights that people hadn't seen before. I might take on the       mantle of philosopher-king: whenever reformers couldn't get a       constitutional amendment through, they could come to my       court. Perhaps four of my colleagues and I could amend the       Constitution for them: we'd declare a new meaning and find a       new fight as part of our never-ending Constitutional       Convention.        That's what would happen if I were a ``pragmatist'' (it's a       euphemism) or a ``changing constitutionalist'' (the euphemism       is ``living constitutionalist'').        So you can see why methods of judging have caused the       confirmation process to become so heavily politicized. In       Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I remarked: ``The descent       into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely       traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erode       society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no       agreed-on meaning. Nontextual interpretation, which makes       `statesmen' of judges, promotes the shifting of political       blame from political organs of government (the executive and       the legislature) to the judiciary.''        We went on to observe that ``the consequence is the       politicizing of judges (and hence of the process of selecting       them) and a decline of faith in democratic institutions.''        In a New York Times op-ed two days ago, a law professor       from Louisiana had the temerity to say that ``Justice Scalia       failed to realize that textualism is self-undermining.'' His       support for that slander? ``Nowhere does the Constitution       explicitly state that textualism, no less than originalism or       any other method, is the correct theory of constitutional       interpretation.''        This is just silly. Nowhere in Shakespeare is it said that       future generations may well need a glossary to understand       some of the words--or that the best understanding of the       words will be their Elizabethan understanding. For example,       few people who read the word leasing in Shakespeare would       understand it, as his contemporaries did, to mean ``a lie or       falsehood.''        Although there was no name for originalism in the 18th       century, the idea was well-enough understood. The political       philosopher Emmerich de Vattel--whose influence on Benjamin       Franklin, George Washington, and other Founders was well       known and ``timely,'' according to Franklin, since it reached       them about 1775--wrote in his Law of Nations: ``The       interpretation of every act, and of every treaty, ought . . .       to be made according to certain rules proper to determine the       sense of them, such as the parties concerned must naturally       have understood, when the act was prepared and accepted.''        Vattel added: `When an ancient act is to be interpreted, we       should then know the common use of the terms, at the time       when it was written.''        That was the settled view of written legal instruments,       whether statutes or written constitutions. In 1796, Justice       James Iredell of the Supreme Court wrote: `We are too apt, in       estimating a law passed at a remote period, to combine in our       consideration, all the subsequent events which have had an       influence upon it, instead of confining ourselves (which we       ought to do) to the existing circumstances at the time of its       passing.''        Perhaps, you might think, all these statements relate only       to statutes and not to constitutions. Just seven years later,       in the seminal case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John       Marshall applied the same principle to the U.S. Constitution.       He emphasized the notion that the Constitution, aside from       what ought to be infrequent amendment, is fundamental and       unchanging: ``That the people have an original right to       establish, for their future government, such principles as,       in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness,       is the basis, on which the whole American fabric has been       erected.'' It's an original right to fix the future       government. He added that this original right is ``a very       great exertion'' that should not ``be frequently repeated.''       Then, in this closely reasoned passage, he says that ``the       principles . . . so established are deemed fundamental'' and       ``are designed to be permanent.''        Permanent--not waxing and waning according to political       expediencies of the moment.        That's the essence of originalism. Marshall and Iredell and       Vattel were hardly alone. Other writers of the period agreed.       In 1821, James Madison, one of the architects of the       Constitution and author of the Bill of Rights, correctly       stated the gist of originalism: ``Can it be of less       consequence that the meaning of a constitution should be       fixed and known, than that the meaning of a law should be so?       Can, indeed, a law be fixed in its meaning and operation,       unless the constitution be so?''        Elsewhere, Madison wrote: ``What a metamorphosis would be       produced in the Code of the law if all its ancient       phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense.'' He       further insisted that if ``the sense in which the       Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation . . . be       not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for       a faithful exercise of its powers.''        The very fact of having a written constitution meant that       we had fixed its meaning in permanent form. That wasn't just       the prevalent notion among the founders--it was the only       notion of which any contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous       trace can be found.        Some imprecise observers confuse the concept of originalism       with the word originalism--and so conclude that the concept,       like the word, was born ``in 1985 [when] Ronald Reagan's       attorney general at the time, Edwin Meese, elevated       originalism to a legal and political movement.'' It may well       be that the term originalism didn't come into common usage       until the 1980s, but that is simply because before then there       was no need for the term. Originalism is what philologists       call a ``retronym''--a term devised to describe what used to       be an entire genus but has since become merely one species of       the genus. For example, the term land line didn't exist in       the telecommunications field until wireless technology was       invented. Until then, all voice telecommunication was through       land lines, so the term was unnecessary.        Likewise, giving text its original meaning was long the       standard legal practice. It wasn't until the 1960s that other       ``theories'' of interpretation came into common usage. Only       then did it become necessary to coin a word to denote the       traditional practice.        Only by sheer, bald-faced casuistry can it be argued, as it       was earlier this week in the New York Times, that ``true       originalism--genuinely following the founders' intent--      requires us moderns to interpret constitutional language in       light of our own, not their, moral and linguistic norms.''       This assertion comes, of course, from the same writer who       asserts that ``Justice Scalia also failed to realize--or at       least admit--that textualism and originalism rarely determine       a unique outcome.''        These calumnies don't square with the facts. In the preface       to Reading Law, Justice Scalia and I plainly wrote:       ``Textualism will not relieve judges of all doubts and       misgivings about their interpretations. Judging is inherently       difficult, and language notoriously slippery. But textualism       will provide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater       predictability and greater respect for the rule of law.''        Judge Gorsuch said as much during his Judiciary Committee       hearings this week. He demonstrated an astonishing command of       the law, a erudition worn lightly, a calm but tenacious       dedication to the scruple of judicial ethics, a thoroughly       likable demeanor,  [[Page S2062]]       and admirable endurance. I trust that all fair-minded       Senators will vote for him.            Sincerely,      Bryan A. Garner,        Editor in Chief, Black's Law Dictionary; President of       LawProse Inc.; Distinguished Research Professor of Law,       Southern Methodist University.     Mr. President, I see our friend from West Virginia and  others here, so I yield the floor.
