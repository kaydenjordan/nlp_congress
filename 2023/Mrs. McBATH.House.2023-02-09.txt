 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dortch is the National Chairman of 100  Black Men of America, Incorporated, and his life and career have truly  been exceptional.   Whether serving our government, consulting major American businesses,  or giving back through philanthropic endeavors, Thomas Dortch, Jr., has  excelled at the highest levels.   As a staff member for Senator Sam Nunn, he became the first African  American in history to become chief administrator for a United States  Senator.   As a speaker and mentor, his voice was always in high demand,  including for our very own Congressional Black Caucus.   As the founder of the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame, he  created a space for our country to celebrate the achievements of  graduates of our Nation's historically Black colleges and universities  and ensure that we continue to protect and invest in  educational opportunities for Black Americans.    During Black History Month, it is good and proper that we celebrate  the legacy of one man who has done so much for our community.   On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and the United States  House of Representatives, we send our deepest love and appreciation for  all that he has done.   Thank you, Mr. Dortch.                            ____________________
