 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Norcross, my co-chairman of  the Congressional Building Trades Caucus, to be able to discuss this.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this amendment offered by  my friend from Arizona. His amendment would change dramatically the  methodology used to determine wage rates paid to construction workers  across America.   While this proposal may appear to be reasonable at first blush, it  would dramatically depart from the current practice and would result in  massive pay cuts for working families.   Unlike the current system, the methodology would not take into  consideration the total value of all wages and benefits into account.  It excludes the cost of pensions, healthcare, and, vitally, training  that we need to have.   So what we are trying to say, Mr. Chairman, is the full benefit must  be considered, and it is not in this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, as someone who began in the construction industry in  1965, 52 years--after 52 years in this business, I understand how the  Davis-Bacon Act works and how it works across the country.   So let's not forget, these wage protections are not just for union  workers but for all construction workers. It ensures that the local  workers can make a fair living on projects in their community. This  amendment, unfortunately--as well intended as it might be--would  undermine that. I urge a ``no'' vote.
