 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues to express my disappointment in  how this bill came together, without regular order and ignoring input  from really any Republicans. This is not the way to get things done in  divided government or signed into law, and the statement that the White  House submitted opposing the bill makes that very clear.   I am disappointed because we had the opportunity to do things the  right way in the committee through bipartisanship. But unfortunately,  the majority set aside our tradition of bipartisanship in favor of a  messaging bill and election year politics. Instead of working through  the rough issues and reporting a bill that we could all be proud of,  the majority took the easy road and cobbled together a wish list bill.  They drafted it behind closed doors, didn't release it for members to  see until the very last minute, and so just now, in fact, they had to  introduce a new manager's amendment in the final hour to make the  corrections and add the new language.   We Republicans offered a lot of amendments to try and improve the  bill, but the Rules Committee did not allow such things to happen. Our  amendments to invest in technological innovation and clean energy will  not even get a debate. My amendment, to reauthorize the Nation's  pipeline safety program and strengthen our workforce of pipeline safety  inspectors, was also rejected. How can we be opposed to pipeline  safety?   I have a number of concerns about the underlying bill, and many of  the Democratic amendments which I think are likely to pass, but I share  the concern that H.R. 4447 will lead to higher energy costs and  discourage innovation. This bill is going to lead to fewer choices for  consumers when it comes to home heating, appliances, and energy  providers.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself another 10 seconds.   Madam Speaker, I am also alarmed by the provisions that will  encourage frivolous lawsuits, lead to permitting delays and even more  Federal mandates and regulations.   So as we rebuild after the COVID pandemic, we should stay focused on  reducing barriers to growth rather than creating more hurdles as this  bill does.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the top Republican on the Environment  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).     Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time each side has  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I have two remaining speakers, so I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the top Republican on the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, Republicans do support clean energy, but we oppose  wasteful government spending and top-down policies that make energy  more expensive, reduce consumer choice, and threaten our energy  security.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy from the Office of the President of the United States  recommending a veto. The letter states: ``H.R. 4447 would lead to  higher energy costs and discourage innovation and entrepreneurship''  and ``fails on several other measures.''                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 4447--Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act--Rep. O'Halleran, D-                           AZ, and 9 cosponsors         The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4447. The       Administration supports clean energy, job development, and       the innovation economy and adheres to a bottom-up energy       philosophy that promotes free-markets, funds scientific       research, and honors the choices of producers and consumers.       This bill, however, would implement a top-down approach that       would undermine the Administration's deregulatory agenda and       empower the government to select favored solutions while       reinstating big-government policies and programs.        H.R. 4447 would lead to higher energy costs and discourage       innovation and entrepreneurship. This legislation would       bypass well-established processes and procedures and would       impose substantial, unwarranted costs on Federal, State, and       local agencies and other key stakeholders in both public and       private sectors. It would do so by setting rigid energy       savings and water consumption reduction targets for Federal       agencies, requiring State and local governments to establish       strict building codes that are not grounded in available       technologies, and mandating a rigorous transition from       hydrofluorocarbon use in the private heating and cooling       sector.        H.R. 4447 also fails on several other measures. Its       proposed creation of new workforce development, training, and       other related programs is unnecessary and would lead to       greater fragmentation of the workforce system and duplication       of efforts between Federal agencies. To support the       substantial costs of these programs, the bill would authorize       billions in new annual spending. It would also create a       ``green bank'' that would subsidize projects similar to well-      known failures like Solyndra. It ignores the importance of       permitting reform while endorsing more government control and       mandates on goods and products without consideration of the       cost to consumers. It would also set up new mandates and       regulations that would undo the Administration's significant       progress in lowering emissions and cleaning our air and       water. Finally, H.R. 4447 would interfere with how we have       been designing our own energy and environment destiny free       from the reins of the Paris Climate Accord and international       agreements or organizations that ignore the clear lessons       that have led to American energy independence.        Since January 2017, the United States has experienced a       remarkable turnaround in its energy fortunes. In a few short       years, our Nation has achieved energy independence and become       a net energy exporter and a world energy powerhouse. We have       increased exports of United States Liquefied Natural Gas       (LNG) by nearly five-fold and issued 20 long-term       authorizations for LNG exports to non-free trade agreement       countries. The United States is the number one producer of       oil in the world and has maintained its status as the top       producer of nuclear power and the top producer of natural       gas, as well as the world's second-leading generator of wind       and solar power. Crucially, while dominating in energy       production, the United States continues to lead the world in       reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Americans       now have greater access to energy that is abundant,       affordable, clean, and reliable, and the Administration looks       forward to continuing our successful approach to build on       these achievements.        If H.R. 4447 were presented to the President, his advisors       would recommend that he veto the bill.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Association of Home Builders in opposition to the bill due to  the expansion of Federal building codes without meaningful provisions  to safeguard housing affordability.                                               National Association                                                of Home Builders,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       more than 140,000 members of the National Association of Home       Builders (NAHB), I am writing to express strong opposition to       H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. Any       expansion of the federal government's authority in the code       development process without meaningful provisions to       safeguard housing affordability is invasive, unnecessary, and       unwise. NAHB has designated opposition to H.R. 4447, the       Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act. as a key vote.        H.R. 4447 undermines the independence of the consensus-      based code development process by expanding the federal       government's role and authority. This legislation mandates       that the Department of Energy (DOE) establish national energy       savings targets for residential construction. After the       consensus codes-writing bodies approve a new model code, DOE       is mandated to submit proposals directly to the code       developer, absent of stakeholder input, if DOE deems the       federal target has not been met by the model code. H.R.       4447's Washington-knows-best regime fails to meaningfully       factor in housing affordability, and it avoids the critical       checks and balances that are conducted by the code       development stakeholders. This top-down approach denies the       consensus bodies the freedom of decision-making, rendering       the code development process irrelevant and superfluous.        Further, H.R. 4447 mandates a new regulatory and reporting       regime for states to justify their decision to modify their       building codes. The bill creates additional burdens by       demanding that states that seek access to parts of a $200       million grant program must provide notice of whether they       have met the bill's compliance mandates or justify why they       cannot comply--a requirement that must be met every two       years. This burdensome process significantly limits the       ability of states and local governments to focus on adopting       newer codes if they are constantly required to demonstrate       compliance with this legislation.        NAHB has long supported the development and implementation       of reasonable, practical, and cost-effective building codes       and standards. NAHB works as a partner with all levels of       government to encourage energy efficiency; however, we       strongly oppose federal mandates that are not cost-effective       and jeopardize housing affordability. Failure to consider the       true economic costs of required energy-use reductions in       model energy codes and establish reasonable payback periods       for these investments will result in fewer families being       able to achieve the American dream of homeownership.        For these reasons, NAHB is designating a key vote in       opposition to H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and       Innovation Act.            Sincerely,                                                James W. Tobin III.  [[Page H4873]]         Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
