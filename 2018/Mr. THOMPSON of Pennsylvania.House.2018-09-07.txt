 Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks the start  of the 10th annual Allegheny River and Watershed Cleanup, which is a  weeklong effort in Warren County to keep the Allegheny River healthy  and clean.   The Allegheny River is one of the Nation's most beautiful and clean  waters. For more than 10 years, the waterway has been designated one of  the Nation's wild and scenic rivers. It is also home to seven islands  protected under America's National Wilderness Preservation System.   Every year, hundreds of people visit the river to enjoy its beauty  and bounty. In 2017, 317 volunteers donated roughly 2,536 hours of  their time while removing 5,350 pounds of metal, 94 tires, and 35 cubic  feet of trash from the Allegheny and the Conewango Creek.   Adults and children participate in the cleanup. They walk along the  riverbanks or use their canoes and kayaks to remove garbage found in or  along the Allegheny River and its tributaries.   Mr. Speaker, the Allegheny River watershed is and continues to be an  important recreational, ecological, and economic asset to Warren  County. I commend all those who participate in this outstanding event.                            ____________________
