 Mr. President, today our colleagues on the Foreign  Relations Committee will vote to report the President's choice for the  next Secretary of State.   It is really hard to imagine someone more thoroughly qualified than  Mike Pompeo. His career is a success story on every single level. He  graduated first in his class from West Point, served as a U.S. Army  officer, and attended Harvard Law School. Then came success in  business, and then Mike's neighbors elected him to Congress in 2010.   That impressive resume explains why, a little more than a year ago, a  large bipartisan majority of Senators confirmed Mike as CIA Director.  His qualifications were perfectly obvious, and, by all accounts, his  track record at the CIA shows that vote of confidence was exactly the  right decision. He has demonstrated mastery of the daily briefings he  both receives and delivers. His high-quality counsel on sensitive  matters has won the confidence not only of our national clandestine  service but also of the Commander in Chief, and he has returned our CIA  to the aggressive gathering of foreign intelligence. Along the way, he  has built a reputation for listening to all points of view, trusting  career staff, treating everyone fairly, and acting decisively.   In Mike Pompeo, the United States will have a chief diplomat who will  enjoy the total confidence of the President and is uniquely qualified  to reinvigorate our Foreign Service and represent our interests abroad.  It is hard to imagine a better nominee for this mission, at this  moment, than Mike Pompeo. I look forward to upholding the tradition of  this body and voting to confirm him this week.   The Senate will also vote later this afternoon to advance the  nomination of Kyle Duncan of Louisiana to serve on the Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals. Mr. Duncan's legal credentials show that the  President has made another outstanding choice.   With degrees from LSU and Columbia under his belt, he built an  impressive record in litigation, rising to serve as appellate chief in  the Louisiana office of attorney general.   His accomplishments also extend to private practice, where his work  earned the respect of his colleagues and peers, including his opponents  in court.   A few weeks ago, a law professor and litigator who sparred with Kyle  Duncan in a high-profile case wrote:         Kyle Duncan is a magnificent nominee for the Fifth Circuit.       . . . His confirmation should be supported by all who value       judges committed to fairness and scrupulous application of       the law.    A bipartisan group of current and former State solicitors general  wrote to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to praise his  nomination. Here is what they said:         As frequent advocates in the U.S. Courts of Appeals, we are       well-acquainted with the qualifications and characteristics       that make good judges, including intellect, integrity, legal       experience, and temperament, all of which Mr. Duncan       possesses in ample quantities.    They went on to say:         We came to know him as a highly skilled lawyer with an       easygoing demeanor, and as someone we could routinely turn to       for advice and interest on issues of mutual interest. Even       though we have worked for state Attorneys General of       different political stripes, we all agree that Kyle Duncan       has the personal and professional qualities that should       typify the federal judiciary.    No wonder the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the  [[Page S2334]]  Federal Judiciary awarded Mr. Duncan its highest rating of ``well  qualified.''   I urge every one of our colleagues to take his credentials,  experience, and bipartisan support into account. Let's vote to advance  the Duncan nomination this afternoon.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2730         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
