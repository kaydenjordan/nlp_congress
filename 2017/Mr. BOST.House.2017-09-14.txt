 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Shawnee Community  College, located in Ullin, Illinois, for its 50th anniversary.   For half a century, Shawnee College has provided opportunities for  quality higher education, community education, training, and services  that are accessible, affordable, and promote lifelong learning. The  college is cutting edge and provides training programs that incorporate  the most recent technologies to meet the ever-changing needs of  students and the local economy.   I visited the community college last month and met with the faculty  and their directors, and their passion is clear.   Congratulations to Shawnee College President Dr. Peggy Bradford,  faculty, staff, and students on 50 years of excellence. I know that  more than 50 years from now they will still be working and providing  for the students of southern Illinois.                            ____________________
