 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Del Rio Border Patrol Sector Chief Austin Skero, who is retiring from  Border Patrol at the end of July after a more than 30-year career in  law enforcement.   Chief Skero has honorably served 26 years with Customs and Border  Protection, beginning his career in 1995 in the Rio Grande Valley  sector. Throughout his time with CBP, he has served Border Patrol in  various roles across the Nation, from Washington, D.C., to Grand Forks,  North Dakota.   Chief Skero has led the Del Rio sector as chief since July 2020. He  oversees 250 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, supervising 2,000 Border  Patrol employees, 9 CBP stations, and 5 traffic checkpoints, and  supporting 47 counties in Texas.   Chief Skero's mission as sector chief has been especially challenging  this year. Del Rio currently is the eye of the storm as we tackle this  southern border crisis. Over the last year, Chief Skero has led Del  Rio Border Patrol agents through one of the largest spikes in migrant  traffic in United States history.    This has been no easy task. Del Rio is the second most trafficked  sector on the U.S.-Mexico border. Agents are apprehending an average of  a thousand migrants per day, some who surrender willingly and others  who try their hardest to avoid being caught.   Last month alone, Chief Skero's sector saw over 30,000 migrant  apprehensions, a 700 percent increase from the previous year. In Del  Rio, over 700 human smuggling cases have been prosecuted, and sex  offender apprehensions are up 1,400 percent.   Apprehensions on trains in Uvalde are up 900 percent, and it is  estimated that cartels make $25 million a week in the Del Rio sector  alone simply by trafficking people.   When agents are not in the field securing our borders, their  dedicated work to ensure our migrants are protected has not gone  unnoticed. Using the sector's limited resources to deal with many  dimensions of the crisis has shown exemplary leadership from Chief  Skero. Chief Skero has met and surpassed those expectations.   He has had the responsibility of briefing political figures from  every corner of the Nation and every party on what is happening at our  southern border.   I am incredibly grateful for Chief Skero's leadership, especially  during this historic and difficult time for our border communities and  our Border Patrol agents. His hard work and commitment have not gone  unnoticed.   Chief Skero has received several awards and commendations throughout  his career, including Border Patrol's highest award for heroism and  valor, the Newton-Azrak Award. While we will miss his direction and  guidance, I know his retirement is more than well-earned.   Chief Skero has lived a life driven by service to our community. The  Del Rio border sector, our border communities, Texas, and our country  are safer because of his leadership and work at the southern border.   Angel and I wish him and his wife, Chandra, all the best as they  enter this next phase of their life.   I thank Chief Skero personally for all the direction and guidance he  has given in this very difficult time. He has been at the forefront of  this effort, at the  [[Page H3913]]  forefront of this storm, and I am so grateful for the Border Patrol  leading this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Chief Skero a wonderful retirement. It is well- deserved.                            ____________________
