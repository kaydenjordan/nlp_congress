 Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce and praise today as  guest chaplain Pastor Bryant Ali.   Pastor Ali has been my friend for almost 50 years. He has been the  ``pastor in the hood,'' as we call him, for 26 years at the New  Psalmist Worship Center in Newark, New Jersey, a center he founded to  bring the power of the Lord to those who have lost their way.   He is a renowned author, community activist, counselor, teacher, and  preacher in my district. His story is one that should inspire us all.  Pastor Ali received his spiritual calling as a homeless man struggling  with chemical addiction. He conquered those demons through the power of  the Lord. He started preaching and pursued his calling.   Today, he has a doctoral degree in holistic theology. He serves as  the president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Newark and  Vicinity, and he is a spiritual counselor for the Newark Anti-Violence  Coalition and serves on the board of the Newark Community Health  Centers.   He is an outstanding clergyman, an incredible leader in my community,  and a true inspiration. I am very proud to have him say a prayer for us  today.   My fellow Members, I would like to present the senior pastor of New  Psalmist Worship Center, the Honorable Dr. Bryant Ali, who did an  incredible job for us today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor my dear friend, Ms.  Gladys Barker Grauer, the ``Mother of Newark Arts'' for more than 70  years, after  [[Page H7781]]  her passing recently at the age of 96. She was one of Newark's most  dedicated artists and art supporters who leaves a legacy of great  contributions behind.   Fifty years ago, she opened the first art gallery in Newark, the Aard  Studio Gallery. It was a place dedicated to art and encouraging artists  of color to learn and express their unique talents. Through this  gallery, Gladys helped inspire and launch the careers of African  American artists across the city.   Thanks to Gladys' efforts, the Newark Museum held the first exhibit  of local artists, called Emerging and Established, in 1983.   Gladys is one of the founding members of the Newark Arts Council,  today known as Newark Arts. She even received the 2019 Lifetime  Achievement Award from the Women's Caucus for Arts.   Her art has been displayed locally, nationally, and even  internationally. When in Newark, visitors can see one of Gladys' five  murals, called Music Unites Us All, on the PSE&G Fairmount Heights Art  Wall.   Gladys has been a blessing to our cultural scene and to me personally  as a great and valued friend and friend of all of her children. Gladys'  life reminds us of the value of art in society, and she will be sorely  missed.                            ____________________
