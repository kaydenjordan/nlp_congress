 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, first let me say that I think Senator  Cornyn's legislation is very constructive. I fully support it. I think  it would result in lower costs for consumers. It is very commendable. I  think we should pass it. I am sympathetic with the idea of requiring  greater transparency on healthcare costs generally, but I have  significant policy concerns and process concerns with the proposal from  the Senator from Illinois.   The policy concern, broadly, is that what his legislation would do is  it would single out one industry and require a mandate that in their  direct-to-consumer advertising, they provide systematically misleading  information to consumers. It doesn't strike me, obviously, as a good  idea to mislead people, including in this context.   Why do I say it is misleading? It is because the legislation requires  the list price or the wholesale acquisition price of a drug to be the  price that is put in the ad, despite the fact that almost no one ever  pays either of those prices. There are huge rebates that are built into  the system.   We can have a good debate about whether it is a good model by which  [[Page S6522]]  the government has created all of these perversities in our healthcare  delivery system, but that is what it is. The truth and the reality is  almost no one pays either the list or the wholesale acquisition price.  Think about it. If you are on Medicaid, you pay zero. If you are on  Medicare, you often pay zero--usually, nearly zero. If you have private  insurance, it varies enormously from zero to something significantly  different, but almost no one pays the price that the Senator from  Illinois would require to be posted in all direct-to-consumer  advertising.   Think about some of the unintended consequences. The number that  would have to be in the ad is way higher than what almost anyone  actually pays. Think of what could happen. I can imagine senior  citizens sitting there watching an ad. Maybe they see a medicine they  actually would benefit from, and then at the end there is some huge  number that does not reflect--it doesn't come close to reflecting what  the actual cost would be, but it is a big number so that a senior  citizen would understandably say: Gosh, I can't afford that. I guess I  can't pursue that therapy, even though they might need that. I am sure  that is not the intended consequence of this legislation, but I am  pretty sure it would happen.   It is also peculiar to me that the authors of this legislation choose  to single out a small fraction of the healthcare industry to impose  this mandate. Prescription drug spending is about 10 percent of  healthcare. Hospitals are about 32 percent, but I haven't seen that we  are going to impose this. If you look at the rate of price increases in  various sectors of healthcare, you see that actually prescription  drugs, over the last 20 years--their increase in prices is considerably  less than hospital services and considerably less than medical care  services.   Then, of course, we have other sectors in the economy altogether. Are  we going to put mandates on colleges, for instance? The rate of tuition  increase in colleges is much greater than the rate of increase of  prescription drugs in recent years. I haven't heard a proposal yet, but  maybe one is coming that would require this of other industries as  well.   If I didn't know better, I would think it seems part of a theme to  vilify the industry that has developed the therapies that allow us to  live longer, healthier, and save lives. Most importantly, maybe it will  not lower costs. It is not going to lower costs for consumers. The only  way we are going to do that is if we better align the incentives of the  consumer and the person paying.   In contrast, by the way, the Finance Committee and HELP Committee  reported out legislation that actually would lower out-of-pocket costs  for prescription drugs. We have Senator Cornyn's legislation that I  think absolutely would lower the cost of consumer prescription drugs.  Yet that is not what is on the floor today from the Senator from  Illinois.   Now, despite my policy concerns--and they are serious--I actually  think we ought to debate these things. We ought to put this kind of  legislation on the floor. We ought to have a debate. We ought to have a  vote, but this is complicated, and it is fraud. We should not be trying  to just pass this by unanimous consent. This legislation has not gone  through committee, and contrary to my colleague from Illinois--this  actual piece of legislation has never had a vote as a freestanding  matter. A version of it that is different from what is being offered  today was buried in a larger legislation which passed. That is not the  same as scrutinizing this policy, subjecting it to amendments, and  deciding on it. That is what I think we ought to do.   Unlike my colleagues on the other side who have been consistently  preventing us from taking up legislation, such as the approps bills  they have not allowed us to get on to or the SECURE Act, on which I  offered a unanimous consent process for us to take up and process, I  think we ought to consider this legislation, even though I don't think  I would support the final product.   What I suggest we do is let's move on to the Defense appropriations  bill. Arguably, the most fundamental responsibility of Congress is to  fund our national defense. Let's make in order as the first amendment  after the managers' amendment the amendment of the Senator from  Illinois that he has just described. I don't support it, but I support  his right to have a debate and have a vote. Let's go on to an  appropriations bill and let's make his amendment in order as the first  amendment. We can debate it; we can vote it; and we will all live with  the consequences. I think that is what we are here for. I think the  purpose of the Senate is to take on these issues, put them on  the floor, have a debate, and have a vote. I am willing to live with  the outcome of that.    Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from Illinois modify his  request and that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 132, S. 1416. I further ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn and that the  Cornyn amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and finally,  that following disposition of S. 1416, the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 2740, and following the offering of a  substitute amendment by Senator Shelby or his designee, the first  amendment in order be an amendment offered by Senator Durbin or Senator  Grassley, the text of which is identical to S. 1437, as amended, which  is at the desk.    Will the Senator yield?    I object.    Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy  of one of our Nation's most treasured educators and performers and a  native Pennsylvanian, Mister Fred Rogers. Many are recognizing today as  World Kindness Day and are performing acts of kindness toward their  loved ones, neighbors, and even strangers. Perhaps no American embodies  the spirit of kindness more than Fred Rogers.   Affectionately known by children and adults alike as ``Mister  Rogers,'' Fred McFeely Rogers was born in Latrobe, PA on March 20,  1928. From an early age, Fred Rogers demonstrated an interest in  learning, making art through creative expression, and serving other. He  graduated with a degree in music composition from Rollins College in  Winter Park FL., in 1951 and earned a degree in divinity from the  Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in 1962. A year later, he became an  ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church.   Mister Rogers began his television career shortly after college,  working on the sets of NBC in New York City. He then moved back to  Southwestern Pennsylvania to work for the first conmmunity-owned,  public television station in the country, Pittsburgh's WQED. He gained  a firsthand view of the transformative power of television and the  impact that educational programs could have on adults and children. At  WQED, Mister Rogers worked with Josie Carey on a program called ``The  Children's Corner'', where many of his now-familiar characters were  first given life. Additionally, he sought the expertise of Dr. Margaret  McFarland, the director of the Arsenal Family and Children's Center in  Pittsburgh, to integrate best teaching practices into his work.   In 1963, Rogers appeared on camera for the first time to host a  children's program called ``Misterogers''. The program was filmed by  the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto and aired until 1967.  Rogers returned to Pittsburgh and WQED, where he created and filmed  ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''. By 1968, the Public Broadcasting  Service was broadcasting Mister Rogers to thousands of households  throughout the country.   For three decades, Mister Rogers brought love, kindness, generosity,  grace, laughter, and cheer into the lives of countless children and  their families. His lessons and performances on ``Mister Rogers'  Neighborhood'' taught children about respect, safety, perseverance,  civility, and caring for others. He did not shy away from issues that  face almost every child, including intolerance, disagreement, and  bullying. Because he could connect with children in a way few adults  could, Mister Rogers helped children to cope and understand difficult  emotional issues like anger, death, and divorce. Mister Rogers was a  friend to all children and played an important role in the lives of  many by reminding them of their self-worth.   Mister Rogers was bestowed with numerous accolades, including the  Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was awarded by President George W.  Bush in 2002. Since his death on February 27, 2003, scores of people  have paid tribute to Mister Rogers' life and legacy. This year,  Pennsylvania celebrated the first 1-4-3 Day--the number of letters in  the word ``I love you'', as Mister Rogers would note--in Rogers' honor.  Last month, the city of Nashville, TN, proclaimed November as Thank  You, Mister Rogers Month. The arts industry has payed tribute to  Rogers' body of work through collaborative music projects, biographies,  and feature films. The outpouring of support is a testament to Rogers'  impact on the Nation. Even today, millions of children continue to  benefit from Mister Rogers' work through programs like the cartoon  ``Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,'' which is made and distributed by Fred  Rogers Productions.   Fred Rogers will be remembered as a trailblazer in television, master  educator, model citizen, and most notably, an inspiration to children  and communities across the Nation. His legacy lives on through his art  and can be found in acts of kindness being done in every neighborhood  across the country.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  life of Fred Rogers, a friendly neighbor and model citizen for whom  every day was beautiful.                            ____________________
