 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding time  and for his leadership in the entire group of conferees on bringing  this tax cuts and jobs bill to the floor.   I thank President Trump for working with us every step of the way to  bring us to a historic moment where we are actually going to provide  tax relief to hardworking families.   There are those on the other side who would say: Keep all the money  in Washington, stunt economic growth, continue to let America be  noncompetitive where we see jobs go overseas over and over again--large  companies, thousands of jobs at a time moving to foreign countries-- because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized  world.   Well, Mr. Speaker, it is time for that to end, and we do end that in  this bill. We finally make our country competitive again so we can  bring those jobs back.   Why deny opportunity for so many people who want a chance at the  American Dream?   In our bill, Mr. Speaker, we cut every single tax rate and make it  lower. That is more money in the pockets of hardworking families. On  average, families are going to see over $2,000 more back in their  paychecks every year. That is real money, when you look at, right now,  the average savings for families is $400 in their checking account.  This is real money to help people have better opportunities to go put  more money in their kids' college tuition accounts.    When you look at what this means, it is not only good for economic  growth, creating jobs, and rebuilding our middle class, but it is  historic in the simplification where over 90 percent of  [[Page H10206]]  American families will actually be able to do their taxes on a  postcard. Just think of how simplified that makes the Code.   The last time this was done was in 1986. And when Ronald Reagan was  signing that bill, he talked about how hard it was and how many times  people said it couldn't happen. In fact, Ronald Reagan read a quote  from a headline, and he said: ``The impossible became the inevitable.''   Today, Mr. Speaker, we make that impossible the inevitable again and  restore that hope and opportunity for so many families who just want a  chance at the American Dream. We give them that.   Let's pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act today. Get it on President  Trump's desk so we can finally see this economy going again. What a  great Christmas present this is going to be to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 694, ``Yea'' on  rollcall No. 695, and ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 696.                            ____________________
