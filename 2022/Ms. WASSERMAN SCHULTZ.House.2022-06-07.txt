 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. And I congratulate him on this incredible work product and a  remarkable career.   I rise today in support of H.R. 7776, the Water Resources Development  Act. This bill will advance the economic interests of South Florida.   After more than 20 years of work, the Port Everglades deepening and  widening project will enable safe passage of next-generation cruise and  cargo ships, and it is estimated to create 1,500 good, permanent jobs  when it is finished.   This bill authorizes an additional $269 million in Federal funding  for Port  [[Page H5294]]  Everglades to complete the project, protect our coral reefs from  disruption, and begin construction on an overdue new Coast Guard  station.   I came to Congress as a young mom, and I remember telling my children  about the potential effects of climate change. Now, in 2022, we know  that the perils of a warming planet are no longer just predictions.   We have over 1,000 miles of levees and canals, 150 water control  structures, and 16 major pump stations providing flood protection for  11 million residents in central and South Florida alone.   A 2009 study identified 18 water control structures in Miami-Dade and  Broward Counties alone that are within 6 inches of failure.   I urge passage of this important bill, and I appreciate the  opportunity to speak in favor of it.
