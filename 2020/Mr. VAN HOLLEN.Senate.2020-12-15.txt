 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a  tenacious entrepreneur, visionary radio personality, and powerful  advocate for the African-American community, Cathy Hughes. This year,  her pioneering radio company, Urban One, celebrated 40 years on the  air. Cathy Hughes has left an indelible mark on the State of Maryland  and inspired millions of listeners across the country.   This titan of the airwaves began her extraordinary career in Omaha,  NE, where she worked for a local radio station, KOWH. But it was when  she moved to Washington, DC, in 1971 to pursue a job at the Howard  University School of Communications that her career took off. While  working at Howard, she got involved in the university's radio program  as a station manager. In her first year on the job, she increased the  station's revenue twelvefold.   Cathy Hughes has always aimed high, and when she learned that the  local DC radio station WOL was up for sale, she seized the opportunity.  After being denied a loan 32 times, she finally received the bank  financing she needed. So she purchased WOL, founded her own media  company, Radio One, and quickly soared to new heights. Cathy Hughes  revolutionized radio by rebuilding WOL from the ground up, literally,  and brought on grassroots volunteers from the neighborhood to develop  her station's headquarters on H Street and 4th Northeast, just a short  walk from the U.S. Capitol. Her innovative broadcasts captured the  attention of the African-American community and attracted a wide  audience of devoted listeners.   Although she got her start in Washington, DC, Cathy Hughes has become  a champion for Maryland. When her company first expanded out of  Washington, its first stop was Baltimore. And her flagship venture,  which was renamed Urban One in 2017, is now headquartered in Silver  Spring. She has cultivated strong roots in Anne Arundel County and has  been living in Pasadena for 20 years. Today, Urban One's broadcasts  reach households across Maryland and provide a platform for honest  conversation on the issues that matter to our State. Cathy Hughes has  given back time and time again to the communities that raised her up by  hiring locally and employing countless Marylanders. That tradition of  uplifting others has remained a hallmark of her career. Her company,  which now houses two new multimedia ventures, CLEO TV and TV One, both  stationed in Maryland, has created 1,500 jobs.   In the 40 years since purchasing WOL, Cathy Hughes has never stopped  overcoming barriers. In 1999, she became the first African-American  woman to chair the board of a publicly held corporation. She headed the  first African-American-run company to succeed in multiple radio markets  simultaneously. Cathy Hughes made history again as the first woman to  own a radio station ranked No. 1. Her trailblazing multimedia  enterprise now reaches 82 percent of the African-American community and  has cultivated a devoted weekly following of 15 million listeners.   Speaking of Cathy Hughes' inspiring career, Reverend Al Sharpton  said, ``She took the `mute' button off of Black America.'' Her legacy  has been defined by a commitment to speaking up for those who have long  been silent in the radio arena. While she has already lived a storied  life and achieved enormous success, Cathy Hughes hasn't slowed down.  Her recent efforts to highlight local Black businesses struggling to  weather the storm of this pandemic speaks to the depth of her lifelong  passion for shining the spotlight on others. While her name has already  been inscribed on the aptly renamed Cathy Hughes School for  Communications at Howard University where she once worked, her story is  still being written.                            ____________________
