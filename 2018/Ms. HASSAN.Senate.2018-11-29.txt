 Mr. President, this month, I am proud to recognize  as our Granite Stater of the Month an individual who has gone to great  lengths to serve his community, Portsmouth police officer Thompson E.  Potter III of Epping. After filling in at Portsmouth Middle School as a  school resource officer, he was inspired to launch a fundraising  campaign to provide the funds for six boys from traditionally  underserved backgrounds to attend summer camp.   Officer Potter said that he attributes the YMCA camp he attended as a  boy with helping instill in him the values of respect and  responsibility, and putting him on a path to success. He also credits  the camp with raising his self-esteem, and he believes that other young  men could benefit from that same type of experience.   His goal was to raise $5,000 to send five boys to the YMCA camp, and  donations immediately began coming in. As Officer Potter put it, the  whole community worked to ``help take care of these boys,'' with  Portsmouth Middle School staff and parents, friends, businesses, and  other community members supporting the effort.   Ultimately, Officer Potter raised $13,000, which was enough to send  six boys to camp and outfit them with all of the gear they would need.   Officer Potter intends to continue his efforts next summer, with the  goal of sending five boys and five girls to camp. He says that he wants  to give these students something to look forward to and give them a  foundation to build upon.   For his commitment to his community, the young people of Portsmouth,  and the better future that these young people will build, I am proud to  recognize Officer Potter as the November 2018 Granite Stater of the  Month.                            ____________________
