 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since President Trump's draconian FY 2018 budget was released last  year, Democrats have warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget  agreement was needed to adequately invest in American families and  communities. Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head  Start, job training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of  inadequate funding, at best.   Instead of engaging with Democrats to reach a budget agreement, the  majority is seeking to advance a full year of funding for only the  Department of Defense, busting budget caps, while punting every other  Federal service and investment to an uncertain future.   Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being  completely run by a Republican government can't keep the lights on more  than weeks at a time. How did we get here?   Democrats will not go along with any plan that neglects critical  national security and domestic needs. If this bill were to become law,  the majority would have no workable plan to make the investments that  are necessary for priorities, including biomedical research,  infrastructure projects, Pell Grants, homeland security, assistance for  local communities, veterans health, opioid funding, job training, the  FBI, and other Federal law enforcement and more.   This is not a serious bill. We know that it will be quickly rejected  by the Senate. It is the furthest possible cry from regular order that  the majority so frequently discusses yet rarely follows. It is nothing  more than a political ploy that will place us on the brink of another  shutdown.                                time  1730    It is well past time to increase budget caps and enact responsible  spending bills. The majority displays a lack of urgency regarding  reaching a budget agreement and enacting appropriations law, choosing  instead to advance partisan measures that fail to lift unmanageable  budget caps for both defense and nondefense.   Republicans must abandon these partisan short-term bills and work  with Democrats to fund the entirety of government for the remainder of  the fiscal year to serve the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development,  and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this continuing  resolution. I cannot support a bill that flies in the face of  responsible governing. This is pure incompetence.   How many times are we going to do this? This is our fifth short-term  spending bill since September. How many times will we punt our  priorities, lurching from one self-inflicted wound to another?   That is exactly what the continuing resolution represents: a failure  to govern. It is shameful that, yet again, we neglect our core  obligation as a Congress, which is to fund government programs. We  should be voting on new top-line spending levels for 2018, that  alleviate sequestration from both nondefense and defense spending.   We should have spent the last few months fulfilling our  responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan bills to fund  programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable, support  evidence-based scientific research, and help working people get the  skills they need to find good jobs and get good wages.   Instead, the majority forced through their tax scam for millionaires  and billionaires. They became the first party to ever control both  Chambers of Congress and the White House, and, yes, they shut down the  government. And today, the President of the United States says that he  supports a government shutdown.   The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the  American people. Instead of working with Democrats to set budget  numbers and ensure parity, equal for defense spending and nondefense  spending, they have put the government on autopilot.                                time  1800    They put services and investments that are critical to our families  and to our communities at grave risk from apprenticeships to education  for students with disabilities, childcare, after-school programs that  help working families make ends meet, and financial aid for students  who are attending college. Instead, they are forcing through another  continuing resolution, this time cutting almost $3 billion from the  Prevention Fund over the next 10 years on top of the $750 million that  they cut in December.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut an  additional 1 minute.   Ms. DeLAURO. We are talking about cuts to programs that improve our  public health immunization infrastructure at a time when the flu is  rampant in this country, as well as cuts to lead poisoning prevention  programs that seek to prevent and ultimately eliminate childhood lead  poisoning.   Programs like these and dozens of others in the Prevention Fund save  billions of taxpayer dollars by preventing illness and disease before  they occur.   You cut the Prevention Fund and you cause millions of Americans to  suffer for no reason. You pit community health centers against the  Prevention Fund.   Take the money, the $1\1/2\ trillion that you give to the richest  people in this country: the millionaires, the billionaires, and the  richest corporations; don't take it from children's health, don't take  it from the healthcare centers, and don't take it from the Prevention  Fund. It is unacceptable, because here we are talking about people's  lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Reject this continuing resolution.  It fails to meet our obligations to the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation, a misguided  bill that ignores the urgent needs of the American people.   The Federal Government's fiscal year started October 1, 2017--128  days ago. Instead of using that time to get their work done,  Republicans have focused solely on partisan politics. When it comes to  the essential responsibility of funding the Federal Government, the  Republicans can't be bothered.   Now we are asked, today, to vote for a bill that funds the Pentagon  for the rest of the year while funding our schools and our hospitals  for just 43 days.   Mr. Speaker, our national security begins at home with investments in  the future that keep our families and our communities safe, strong, and  moving forward. This bill ignores those needs. It provides no certainty  for our law enforcement professionals, no long-term funding for urgent  repairs to our crumbling infrastructure, and no confidence for  investments in lifesaving medical research. It doesn't even provide a  full year of funding for veterans' healthcare.   While it is encouraging that Republicans are finally reauthorizing  vital healthcare programs like our community health centers, paying for  these programs with cuts to the CDC's Prevention and Public Health  Fund, which is currently providing lifesaving vaccines in this severe  flu season, is the height of irresponsibility.   Discord and delay is no way to run a government, but under Republican  control, that is exactly what we are getting.   Mr. Speaker, unlike the President, I do not want a government  shutdown. We need a budget agreement that keeps our government open,  protects our national security, and meets our commitments to  hardworking families. So let's stop playing games, get to our work, and  get to it now.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the ranking member of the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution which, yet again, is a complete and total abdication of our  responsibilities as Members of Congress.   For the fifth time so far this fiscal year, Republicans are asking us  to fund the government for just another flip of the calendar. The last  time Republicans dragged us down this path of budgetary incompetence,  we had the first ever complete government shutdown when one party held  the House, Senate, and the White House. Yet here we are again, left  with this ludicrous approach of funding the U.S. Government month to  month while ignoring so many of the pressing issues Americans want us  to address.   Today we have heard Republicans pay endless lip service to their  devotion to military spending--and that  [[Page H894]]  funding is certainly vital--but what Republicans have not mentioned is  that this latest stopgap gimmick is going to rob from crucial  nondefense budgets that also keep Americans safe. That means veterans,  homeland security, counterterrorism, and State Department programs will  be neglected and ignored.   That is why Democrats are asking for a simple compromise to raise the  spending caps that are unreasonable and uncompromising. That is because  we all want a strong national defense, but we also need equal increases  in our domestic budget so that hardworking families can feel safe and  financially secure.   We also want Republicans to join us in confronting the dire shortfall  at the VA so no veteran is denied care upon returning home.   We want Republicans to work with us to ensure urgently needed  recovery funds go to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and all areas impacted by wildfires.                                time  1815    We want Republicans to truly help us fight this opioid scourge,  protect America's pensions, and do what the vast majority of Americans  want us to do: pass a clean Dream Act.   Don't tell me we don't have the funds to support those needs. This  Congress just gave a huge handout to billionaires and giant  corporations that exploded the deficit by $1.5 trillion.   But this cynically crafted continuing resolution fails to address  those real needs, the needs of the people who actually sent us here to  stand up for them. We must end this cycle of budgetary neglect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is the latest example of Republicans being completely incapable  of governing. We must finish our work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
