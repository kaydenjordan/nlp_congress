 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2211) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  promulgate a consumer product safety rule for free-standing clothing  storage units to protect children from tip-over related death or  injury, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2211         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tip-overs of Unstable,       Risky Dressers on Youth Act'' or the ``STURDY Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD TO PROTECT AGAINST                     TIP-OVER OF CLOTHING STORAGE UNITS.         (a) Clothing Storage Unit Defined.--In this section, the       term ``clothing storage unit'' means any free-standing       furniture item manufactured in the United States or imported       for use in the United States that is intended for the storage       of clothing, typical of bedroom furniture.        (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard Required.--        (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (c)(1),       not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall--        (A) in consultation with representatives of consumer       groups, clothing storage unit manufacturers, craft or       handmade furniture manufacturers, and independent child       product engineers and experts, examine and assess the       effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety       standards for clothing storage units; and        (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United       States Code, promulgate a final consumer product safety       standard for clothing storage units to protect children from       tip-over-related death or injury that includes--        (i) tests that simulate the weight of children up to 60       pounds;        (ii) objective, repeatable, and measurable tests that       simulate real world use and account for any impact on       clothing storage unit stability that may result from       placement on carpeted surfaces, drawers with items in them,       multiple open drawers, or dynamic force;        (iii) testing of all clothing storage units, including       those under 30 inches in height; and        (iv) warning requirements based on ASTM F2057-17, or its       successor at the time of enactment, provided that the       Consumer Product Safety Commission shall strengthen the       requirements of ASTM F2057-17, or its successor, if       reasonably necessary to protect children from tip-over-      related death or injury.        (2) Treatment of standard.--A consumer product safety       standard promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be treated as       a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of       the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).        (c) Subsequent Rulemaking.--        (1) In general.--At any time subsequent to the publication       of a consumer product safety standard under subsection       (b)(1), the Commission may initiate a rulemaking, in       accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code to       modify the requirements of the consumer product safety       standard described in subsection (b)(1) if reasonably       necessary to protect children from tip-over-related death or       injury.        (2) Revision of rule.--If, after the date of the enactment       of this Act, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       revises its Clinical Growth Charts, the consumer product       safety standard described in subsection (b)(1) shall , on the       date that is 180 days after such revision, be revised to       include tests that simulate the weight of children up to the       95th percentile weight of children 72 months in age, as       depicted in the revised Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention Clinical Growth Charts, unless the Commission       determines the modification is not reasonably necessary to       protect children from tip-over-related death or injury.        (3) Treatment of rules.--Any rule promulgated under       paragraph (1) or revision made pursuant to paragraph (2)       shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2211.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a very proud and grateful person who has  been a consumer advocate all of my life.   Today, Congressman Long, you and I are going to be dealing with bills  that may not always get the top headlines, but they save lives.   When I say grateful, I am so grateful to our ranking member,  Congresswoman Rodgers, and for all the bipartisan support that we have  had on these bills. It means so much to me.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2211, the Stop Tip-overs of Unstable  Risky Dressers on Youth Act, which is known as the STURDY Act.   I introduced this legislation with Representatives Jerry McNerney,  Darren Soto, and   Bobby Rush. This legislation advanced out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee on July 17, 2019, by voice vote, meaning  unanimously, bipartisanly.   According to data collected by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission, a child is injured from a tip-over every 17 minutes. Every  10 days, a child dies from one of these tip-overs. Particularly deadly  are tip-overs of clothing storage units, such as dressers.   Since 2000, these clothing units have killed more than 200 children  in the United States. Victims tend to be under the age of 6. At this  age, children are mobile and curious. They like to climb on furniture,  play in the drawers, or stand in the drawers and reach for items on top  of units. Tragedy can come in just minutes. Just after a child awakes  from a nap or a night's sleep, they are likely to engage in this kind  of activity.   Tens of millions of dressers have been recalled in recent years.  Unfortunately, children continue to die from furniture tip-overs. That  is because the current industry furniture stability standard is simply  too weak. It does not cover shorter clothing storage units that have  also been known to kill children, and industry tests don't cover common  hazard patterns. Moreover, the standard is only voluntary.   That is why it is critical that we pass the STURDY Act, which would  require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a strong  and mandatory safety standard that is effective at preventing furniture  tip-overs.   I especially thank the families of victims, the people who have come  with pictures of their children or their loved ones to talk about how  important this bill is, how hard it is for them to talk about the  terrible loss of life in their families. It is those people who have  really told the story of how important it is for us to act today.   I appreciate the willingness, as I said before, of our ranking member  and all the Republicans to work with me to bring this bill to the  floor. I call on all of my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, first, let me extend my condolences to  the friend of Mr. Long's family.   This is really poignant, that Mr. Long is carrying this bill today on  the floor of the House of Representatives. Hopefully, none of us see  such an accident again.   Mr. Speaker, I include three letters for the Record: a letter from 20  national organizations and more than 50 State and local organizations  that represent pediatricians and consumers throughout the United  States, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Consumer  Federation of America, Consumer Reports, and Kids In Danger, among many  others, urging strong support of the STURDY Act; a letter from Parents  Against Tip-Overs, parents of actual children who have died, also  urging strong support by Members of the STURDY Act; and a letter from  Consumer Reports, also urging strong support by our colleagues for the  STURDY Act.                                                 September 11, 2019.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to       children's health and safety, we write to express our strong       support for three bills as they move to the House floor.       These bills would improve protections against preventable       sleep-related deaths, as well as injuries and deaths from       preventable furniture tip-overs. We urge you to support these       bills to protect children from injuries and deaths.        The Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2019 (H.R. 3172) would ban       infant inclined sleep products, such as the recently recalled       Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper, which have been linked to       the deaths of at least 50 infants. While there have been four       recent recalls related to this product type, similar unsafe       products of this type remain on the market. These products       are deadly, and their design is inherently unsafe and       incompatible with expert safe sleep recommendations,       including from the American Academy of Pediatrics. This       legislation would help prevent more families from       experiencing the tragedy of losing a child by banning the       products' manufacture, import, and sale.        The Safe Cribs Act of 2019 (H.R. 3170) would ban crib       bumper pads. Bumper pads have led to dozens of infant       suffocation deaths and do not offer protection to babies.       These products are also inconsistent with expert safe sleep       recommendations. Maryland, Ohio, New York State, Chicago,       Illinois, and Watchung, New Jersey have taken action to       protect babies. If H.R. 3170 becomes law, all babies in the       Unites States would be similarly protected. This legislation       would help prevent more families from experiencing the       tragedy of losing a child to crib bumper pads by banning       their manufacture, import, and sale altogether.        The STURDY Act (H.R. 2211) would direct the U.S. Consumer       Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create a mandatory       clothing storage unit standard to help prevent furniture tip-      overs. According to the CPSC, one child dies every ten days       from a tip-over. Stronger product testing and safety       requirements could prevent these fatalities. This bill is       critically important because it would establish a strong       mandatory standard for furniture stability. The STURDY Act       would require the CPSC to create a mandatory rule that would:       cover all clothing storage units, including those 30 inches       in height or shorter; require testing to simulate the weights       of children up to 72 months old; require testing measures to       account for scenarios involving carpeting, loaded drawers,       multiple open drawers, and the dynamic force of a climbing       child; mandate strong warning requirements; and require the       CPSC to issue the mandatory standard within one year of       enactment. To protect children from furniture tip-overs, we       need a strong mandatory standard and the STURDY Act includes       those critically needed provisions.        These bills offer a vital opportunity to protect children       from preventable injuries and deaths. We urge you to support       these child health and safety bills, and to vote ``yes'' on       them as they move to the House floor.

Dear Representative: As a parent group directly impacted by       the dangers of unstable furniture, Parents Against Tip-overs       is writing to express our strong support for H.R. 2211, the       STURDY Act, as it moves to the House floor. This bill is       desperately needed,  [[Page H7722]]       as it would reduce injuries and deaths from preventable       furniture tip-overs. Furniture tip-over is not a partisan       issue, but one of safety, and we urge you to support this       bill to protect your most vulnerable constituents, the       children.        One of our founding members, Crystal Ellis, had the       opportunity to testify in front of the Consumer Protection       Subcommittee about the STURDY Act, on what would have been       her son, Camden's 7th birthday. He was tragically killed in a       furniture tip-over incident that happened just two days       before his second birthday. All of our children deserve to be       here and would have been here, had a strong mandatory       standard, that takes into account real world use, would have       been put into place sooner. The industry has been working on       a standard for almost two decades with no significant change       in the data. Furniture manufacturers insist that they need       more data. Their data, as Crystal explained in her testimony,       is our dead and injured children. We do not need more data.       If after 19 years there is not an adequate voluntary standard       in place, it's unlikely there will ever be an effective       furniture safety standard that will reduce injuries and       deaths to children without the STURDY Act becoming law. The       industry clearly won't make this happen without direction       from Congress. We need your help. If this law existed 14       years ago, all of the PAT children would still be alive       today. The STURDY Act will save lives and the time to put it       in place is now.        The STURDY Act (H.R. 2211) would direct the U.S. Consumer       Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create a mandatory       clothing storage unit standard to help prevent furniture tip-      overs. According to the CPSC, one child dies every ten days       from a tip-over. Stronger product testing and safety       requirements could prevent these fatalities. This bill is       critically important because it would establish a strong       mandatory standard for furniture stability. The STURDY Act       would require the CPSC to create a mandatory rule that would:       cover all clothing storage units, including those 30 inches       in height or shorter; require testing to simulate the weights       of children up to 72 months old; require testing measures to       account for scenarios involving carpeting, loaded drawers,       multiple open drawers, and the dynamic force of a climbing       child; mandate strong warning requirements; and require the       CPSC to issue the mandatory standard within one year of       enactment. To protect children from furniture tip-overs, we       need a strong mandatory standard and the STURDY Act includes       those critically needed provisions.        This bill offers you, as the voice of parents and children       in the House of Representatives, a vital opportunity to       protect children from preventable injuries and deaths from       furniture tip-overs. We respectfully urge you to support the       STURDY Act and to vote ``yes'' on it as it moves to the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                     Crystal Ellis,      Parents Against Tip-overs Founding Member.                                   ____                                                 Consumer Reports,                                                 September 17, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumer Reports, the independent,       non-profit member organization, urges you to vote yes on H.R.       2211, H.R. 1618, and H.R. 806, three bills that would help       protect consumers from product safety hazards in their homes.       CR testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee       in support of these bills in June, and urges their passage       today for the reasons below.                          h.r. 2211, the STURDY act         Consumer Reports strongly supports H.R. 2211, the ``Stop       Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers on Youth Act,'' or the       STURDY Act, and urges its swift passage. The bill would       require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to       establish a strong mandatory safety standard to improve the       stability of dressers and similar clothing storage furniture       and help prevent deaths and injuries resulting from when they       tip over onto children. Long a hidden hazard in the home,       tip-overs send thousands of people to the emergency room       annually. Dressers and other clothing storage units are       particularly lethal, accounting for at least 206 reported       deaths since the year 2000, with most of the victims being       children younger than age 6.        CR has found that the most effective and most widely touted       tip-over prevention strategy available today--anchoring a       dresser to the wall using brackets and straps--is not an easy       fix for the majority of consumers. Our nationally       representative survey last year of 1,502 U.S. adults found       that only 27% of Americans had anchored furniture in their       homes, and among Americans with kids under age 6 at home, 40%       anchored their furniture. Fundamentally, because a child's       life should not rely on consumer skill at anchoring a dresser       to a wall, CR has called on the furniture industry to       consistently produce dressers and other clothing storage       units that are designed to be more stable and that better       resist tipping over onto children.        Over the past two years, CR has conducted extensive       research, analysis of incident and injury data, and       comparative testing of a cross-section of dressers in the       marketplace. Based on our investigation, we found that the       industry's voluntary standard leaves too many children at       risk. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible for       dressers at all price points to pass a more rigorous test. CR       bought 42 dressers for evaluation, and put them through a       series of three progressively tougher stability tests. While       13 dressers failed all but the first of the tests, 20       dressers passed all the testing, underscoring that       manufacturers are capable of successfully designing more       stable dressers. The failures reinforce why a stronger       standard is necessary to protect consumers. The 20 dressers       that passed all our tests cost various amounts, and were       representative of all price points in the market.        In light of the unreasonable risk of death or injury to       children and the findings of our investigation, CR and others       have been advocating for the CPSC to develop and implement a       strong mandatory safety standard with performance       requirements for the stability of dressers and other clothing       storage units. While both Republican and Democratic CPSC       commissioners have expressed support for measures to       strengthen the current safety framework around furniture tip-      overs, the agency has so far failed to act, and commissioners       have recognized that CPSC rulemaking under its Consumer       Product Safety Act Section 7 and 9 authority is likely to       take several years, if not a full decade, to complete. To       account for the weight of children under age 6 and the       feasibility demonstrated by CR's test results, CR has said       the standard should, at a minimum, include a loaded stability       test of 60 pounds. We also have said that it is critical for       the standard to be mandatory, not voluntary, for several       reasons, including because:        Under the current system of safety oversight, consumers       essentially must place their trust in manufacturers that they       will produce a reasonably stable dresser;        Wall anchors and other tip-over restraint devices, while       important, are no substitute for adequate stability       performance testing;        A mandatory standard is justified under the Consumer       Product Safety Act--with the CPSC able to find that such a       rule is reasonably necessary and in the public interest;        CR's testing shows that manufacturers are capable of       incorporating appropriate design changes to their products       that yield adequate stability, and of offering units for sale       to consumers that are affordable and do not sacrifice       utility; and        Such a standard would allow the CPSC to enforce       requirements, including performance standards, and more       readily gain industry cooperation for recalls; historically,       companies have not carried out tip-over-related dresser       recalls unless they face overwhelming CPSC and public       pressure, or their product is linked to a death or failed       CPSC stability test.        Enactment of the STURDY Act would help ensure the fastest       possible implementation of a strong stability standard, and       the reduced delay could save children's lives. In addition to       CR, the bill has the support of Parents Against Tip-Overs and       a broad coalition of 75 pediatrician, safety, and consumer       groups. A bipartisan majority of CPSC commissioners also has       expressed support for the STURDY Act and enactment of a       legislative solution that would permit the CPSC to take       faster action to help prevent tip-overs than the promulgation       of a rule under its traditional rulemaking authority and       procedures.        The hazard to children of furniture tip-overs has been       insufficiently addressed by both the furniture industry and       the CPSC for years. Congress, today, has the chance to       finally force a more protective stability standard to take       effect. We urge members to seize this opportunity for       leadership on behalf of child safety and pass H.R. 2211, the       STURDY Act, without delay.     h.r. 1618, the nicholas and zachary burt carbon monoxide poisoning                               prevention act         Consumer Reports supports H.R. 1618, the Nicholas and       Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of       2019. According to the CDC, during 2010-2015, a total of       2,244 deaths resulted from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO)       poisoning, with 393 of those deaths occurring in 2015. CR       often stresses the importance of installing and maintaining       CO detectors, and offers a buying guide and ratings to give       consumers comparative information about different products       that CR has tested. To help keep consumers safe, CR also has       published stories about how to ensure that smoke and carbon       monoxide detectors function properly.        H.R. 1618 would establish a grant program for CO poisoning       prevention, administered by the CPSC. The grants would help       push states to require that up-to-date carbon monoxide       detectors be installed in all dwelling units and numerous       other facilities with the capacity to hold a large number of       people, and encourage states to develop a strategy to protect       vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, or low-      income households. With hundreds of people dying each year       from carbon monoxide poisoning, it is appropriate to       establish a modest CPSC-administered grant program to promote       the installation of CO detectors, especially for vulnerable       populations. This grant program can be an important part of a       broader, multi-pronged strategy to significantly reduce       injuries and deaths associated with carbon monoxide       poisoning, and Congress should pass the bill.               h.r. 806, the portable fuel container safety act         Consumer Reports supports H.R. 806, the Portable Fuel       Container Safety Act of 2019. According to National Fire       Protection Association estimates, fire departments responded       to an average of 160,910 fires per year in the 2007-2011       period that started with ignition of a flammable or       combustible liquid, resulting in an estimated 454 civilian  [[Page H7723]]       deaths, 3,910 civilian injuries, and $1.5 billion in direct       property damage per year. Manufacturers and safety experts       have identified a portion of the death and injury toll to       address through product design: incidents involving flame       jetting from portable fuel containers intended for reuse by       consumers.        Despite the fact that people should never pour fuel such as       gasoline, kerosene, or diesel over a flame or use such fuel       for fire-starting purposes, people do--creating a foreseeable       scenario that this Act would help address. The Portable Fuel       Container Safety Act would require flame mitigation devices,       or flame arrestors, to prevent flame from entering these       containers and igniting the gases inside. This requirement is       consistent with a new voluntary standard recently finalized       by ASTM International that the CPSC could decide to treat as       a mandatory standard under the bill if the agency determines       that it meets the bill's minimum conditions.        The new ASTM standard represents a step forward for safety,       and all portable fuel containers intended for reuse by       consumers should conform to its provisions. Congress should       pass H.R. 806 to ensure this standard or a similar standard       becomes mandatory. Consumers should have assurance that any       new portable fuel container they may buy--which they or       someone else may use or misuse--will contain an effective       flame mitigation device, and that the CPSC can readily take       action if a manufacturer fails to follow the law.                                  conclusion         Consumer Reports thanks all members of the House of       Representatives for their consideration of these important       bills to improve safety around the home for millions of       people nationwide. We urge you to vote yes on H.R. 2211, H.R.       1618, and H.R. 806, and look forward to working together in       the future to ensure a safe marketplace for all consumers.            Sincerely,                                                   William Wallace,                                   Manager, Home and Safety Policy.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support  H.R. 2211. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1618) to encourage States to require the installation of  residential carbon monoxide detectors in homes, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1618         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Nicholas and Zachary Burt       Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced       by burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon       monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious       health condition that could result in death.        (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor       vehicles and the abnormal operation of fuel-burning       appliances, such as furnaces, water heaters, portable       generators, and stoves, kills more than 400 people each year       and sends more than 15,000 to hospital emergency rooms for       treatment.        (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing carbon       monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential       homes and other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       Congress should promote the purchase and installation of       carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling       units nationwide in order to promote the health and public       safety of citizens throughout the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1618.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1618, the Nicholas and Zachary Burt  Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2019. This important  bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representatives Annie Kuster  and Buddy Carter.   This bill advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on July  17, 2019, by voice vote, unanimous.   Carbon monoxide--colorless, odorless, tasteless--is a silent killer.  More than 400 people die and approximately 50,000 people visit  emergency rooms every year in the United States from carbon monoxide  poisoning.   The tragedy is that these deaths and injuries are preventable. All  that is needed is the installation of carbon monoxide detectors.  However, many people remain unaware of the importance of carbon  monoxide detectors or don't know how to install or maintain them  properly.                                time  1615    This legislation aims to change that. It will assist States in  educating the public on the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and  the proper use of carbon monoxide detectors.   It will also provide States with grants so States can purchase and  install carbon monoxide detectors in the homes of elderly and low- income citizens, as well as in educational facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all my colleagues to support this commonsense  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                               COmmittee on House Administration,                                 Washington, DC, September 13, 2019.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you regarding H.R.       1618, the ``Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide       Poisoning Prevention Act of 2019.'' This measure, introduced       on March 7, 2019, was referred to your committee as well as       the Committee on House Administration.        The Committee on House Administration agrees to waive       further consideration of H.R. 1618. The Committee does so       with the understanding that by waiving further consideration       of this bill it does not waive any future jurisdictional       claims over similar measures.        I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter and a copy       of your response in the Congressional Record during       consideration of H.R. 1618 on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 16, 2019.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chair, Committee on House Administration,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairperson Lofgren: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 1618 Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Act of       2019 from further consideration, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        As introduced, H.R. 1618, includes language related to the       Government Publishing Office. I understand such language was       included by bill sponsors in H.R. 1618 and previous versions       of this legislation in an effort to comply with a House CUTGO       rule that was in effect during prior Congresses.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 1618 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the chief sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Long for his work on this  legislation. It was really a pleasure to work with him on these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close as well, but I want to say, once in a  while we will read in the paper of a family that fell victim to carbon  monoxide poisoning, but mostly this is one by one by one, a couple  people here, a couple people there, and it doesn't make the headlines  as a problem. Yet we heard the numbers, the astonishing numbers of  people who fall victim--sometimes, and many times, fatally, not  always--to carbon monoxide poisoning.   Again, this is something that is absolutely preventable, and so I am  very grateful and hopeful that all our colleagues will support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 806) to require compliant flame mitigation devices to be  used on portable fuel containers for flammable liquid fuels, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 806         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(d) Treatment of Voluntary Standard for Purpose of       Enforcement.--If the Commission determines that a voluntary       standard meets the conditions described in subsection (c),       the requirements of such voluntary standard shall be treated       as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning       on the date which is the later of--        (1) 180 days after publication of the Commission's       determination under subsection (c); or        (2) the effective date contained in the voluntary standard.        (e) Revision of Voluntary Standard.--        (1) Notice to commission.--If the requirements of a       voluntary standard that meet the conditions of subsection (c)       are subsequently  [[Page H7728]]       revised, the organization that revised the standard shall       notify the Commission after the final approval of the       revision.        (2) Effective date of revision.--Not later than 180 days       after the Commission is notified of a revised voluntary       standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later date as       the Commission determines appropriate), such revised       voluntary standard shall become enforceable as a consumer       product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the       Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), in place of the       prior version, unless within 90 days after receiving the       notice the Commission determines that the revised voluntary       standard does not meet the requirements described in       subsection (c).        (f) Future Rulemaking.--The Commission, at any time after       publication of the consumer product safety rule required by       subsection (a), a voluntary standard is treated as a consumer       product safety rule under subsection (d), or a revision is       enforceable as a consumer product safety rule under       subsection (e) may initiate a rulemaking in accordance with       section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to modify the       requirements or to include any additional provision that the       Commission determines is reasonably necessary to protect the       public against flame jetting from a portable fuel container.       Any rule promulgated under this subsection shall be treated       as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).        (g) Action Required.--        (1) Education campaign.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall undertake       a campaign to educate consumers about the dangers associated       with using or storing portable fuel containers for flammable       liquids near an open flame or any other source of ignition.        (2) Summary of actions.--Not later than 2 years after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to       Congress a summary of actions taken by the Commission in such       campaign.        (h) Portable Fuel Container Defined.--In this section, the       term ``portable fuel container'' means any container or       vessel (including any spout, cap, and other closure mechanism       or component of such container or vessel or any retrofit or       aftermarket spout or component intended or reasonably       anticipated to be for use with such container)--        (1) intended for flammable liquid fuels with a flash point       less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit, including gasoline,       kerosene, diesel, ethanol, methanol, denatured alcohol, or       biofuels;        (2) that is a consumer product with a capacity of 5 gallons       or less; and        (3) that the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know       is used by consumers for transporting, storing, and       dispensing flammable liquid fuels.        (i) Rule of Construction.--This section may not be       interpreted to conflict with the Children's Gasoline Burn       Prevention Act (Public Law 110-278; 122 Stat. 2602).       SEC. 3. CHILDREN'S GASOLINE BURN PREVENTION ACT.         (a) Amendment.--Section 2(c) of the Children's Gasoline       Burn Prevention Act (15 U.S.C. 2056 note; Public Law 110-278)       is amended by inserting after ``for use by consumers'' the       following: ``and any receptacle for gasoline, kerosene, or       diesel fuel, including any spout, cap, and other closure       mechanism and component of such receptacle or any retrofit or       aftermarket spout or component intended or reasonably       anticipated to be for use with such receptacle, produced or       distributed for sale to or use by consumers for transport of,       or refueling of internal combustion engines with, gasoline,       kerosene, or diesel fuel''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect 6 months after the date of enactment of       this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 806.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 806, the Portable Fuel  Container Safety Act of 2019.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by Representative   Mike  Thompson and   David Joyce, a bipartisan cosponsorship. It was advanced  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on July 17, 2019, by voice  vote.   Portable fuel containers are used for many everyday purposes by  adults and kids alike. For example, we might see them used to transport  or store fuel for the lawnmower or the backyard fire pit, and your son  or daughter might use them in their high school chemistry class.   What many users don't realize is that these containers are highly  explosive. Each year, they send thousands of people to the emergency  room, including with third-degree burns.   The explosions that they make, known as flame jetting, occur when  flammable vapors escape from the open nozzle and are ignited.   These explosions, however, are preventable. A small piece of mesh,  known as a flame arrester, can be added to the container's spout to  eliminate the conditions that create explosions, and they cost just  pennies. There is no reason they shouldn't be standard in all portable  fuel containers.   The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act will make sure that all  portable fuel containers have flame mitigation devices, and it will  save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my colleagues who introduced this bill.  I also want to thank Margrett Lewis, who has witnessed firsthand the  horrors of such an explosion and who has been such a fierce advocate  for many years.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), who really  brought this bill to the attention of our committee and subcommittee  and garnered the support that is needed to make sure that death,  disfigurement, and tragedy don't occur because of these products.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the sponsors of this  bill and Congressman Long for his participation. It means so much to  me. I thank him for his help and his friendship.   I want to say that the story of Margrett and her daughter--her  daughter has had countless surgeries as a consequence. She is one of  the people who survived, but her life has been transformed forever, and  we can prevent this with this legislation.   I want to give a special shout-out to the committee staff and the  subcommittee staff on the Democratic side, as well as on the Republican  side. I want to thank sincerely my staff in my office for all of their  help on this bill. This is another one of those that will definitely be  improving and saving the lives of so many Americans and ridding our  country of this danger.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
