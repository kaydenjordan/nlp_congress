 Mr. Speaker, Congress established Alaska Native  Settlement Trusts in 1988 to provide permanent health, education, and  welfare benefits to Alaska Natives, who are among the most economically  disadvantaged populations in the United States.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Tax Code has, in many cases, impeded  the creation and funding of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts. As a  result, Alaska Native Settlement Trusts have not been able to function  in the manner Congress originally intended to provide benefits for  Alaska Natives. To remedy some of these tax issues, I have sponsored  H.R. 3524, which permits an Alaska Native corporation to deduct  contributions to their settlement trust.   The provisions of H.R. 3524 were not included in H.R. 1, and the tax  bill also adversely increases Alaska Native Settlement Trust tax rates  from 10 percent to 12 percent. This would make it more difficult for  Alaska Native Settlement Trusts to provide long-term benefits to Alaska  Natives.   Mr. Speaker, I request that the provisions of H.R. 3524 be included  in the final conference report that results from the conference  committee.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for those  remarks. He has been great to work with. His staff has been  outstanding. I thank him for his commitment to working on the inclusion  of H.R. 3524 and maintaining existing rates in law with regard to  Alaska Native Settlement Trusts, and, more generally, for his support  of the Alaska Native community.
