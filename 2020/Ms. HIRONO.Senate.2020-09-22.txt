 Madam President, this past Friday, our Nation lost a  giant of a jurist and a champion of gender equality, workers' rights,  voting rights, and civil rights. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood  the critical importance of the Supreme Court in safeguarding our  constitutional individual rights.   About 2 years ago, I was sitting next to Justice Ginsburg at a  dinner, and we were talking about the concerns we had about a very  divided Supreme Court. She shared her concerns that we would see many  more 5-to-4 decisions coming in the future, decisions that would roll  back civil rights' protections, workers' rights, individual rights,  efforts to address climate change, and, clearly, a woman's right to  choose--decisions that would harm everyday Americans.   As someone who had been on the Court for more than a quarter of a  century, Justice Ginsburg had understood the dangers of partisan split  decisions. She had spent more than two decades standing up for gender  equality, voting rights, workers' rights, and civil rights. She was  often also a key vote in upholding critical rights for everyday  Americans, such as clean air and clean water protections.   Within a few years of joining the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg had  written a landmark opinion in a 7-to-1 decision that had struck down  the Virginia Military Institute's traditional male-only admissions  policy. She had spoken for nearly the entire Court when she had written  that the differential treatment of men and women ``may not be used . .  . to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority  of women.''   More recently, Justice Ginsburg's powerful voice had led dissents  against partisan 5-to-4 decisions.   In 2007, she led the dissent in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber  Co., where the bare 5-to-4 majority of the Court had undermined the  plain language ability to bring gender pay discrimination claims.  Justice Ginsburg took the rare step of reading her dissent from the  bench, saying: ``In our view, the court does not comprehend, or is  indifferent to, the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay  discrimination.''   I was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives when the  Ledbetter decision came down, and I was appalled that a bare majority  of the Court interpreted the relevant statute in a way that it had not  been intended. Justice Ginsburg invited the Congress to fix the statute  to make its intent clearer. At that time, Representative George Miller,  the chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, on which I  served, then led the way to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and  it was the first bill that President Obama signed into law in 2009.   In 2013, Justice Ginsburg wrote a scathing dissent in the 5-to-4  decision of Shelby County v. Holder, where a bare majority of the Court  once again gutted the Voting Rights Act. She wrote then: ``Throwing out  preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop  discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a  rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Immediately after Shelby County, as should have been expected, many  States passed voter suppression laws that made it much more difficult  for communities of color to vote. That was the intention of those laws  that these States passed. These voter suppression efforts are ongoing  even as we speak, and they will have a negative impact--a really  negative impact--on the 2020 election.   In 2018, she rebuked the 5-to-4 majority in Epic Systems Corp. v.  Lewis, which allowed companies to force their workers to arbitrate  their claims one by one instead of seeking collective action in court.  Why one by one? Because the employer thought all of these employees are  not going to fight us one by one by one.   In calling the majority's decision egregiously wrong, Justice  Ginsburg noted: ``The inevitable result of today's decision will be the  underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the  well-being of vulnerable workers.''   In fact, Epic Systems was one of the cases I brought up with Justice  Ginsburg when I sat next to her at dinner. I said that it was a  horrible decision, and she said: ``And I wrote the dissent.''   To honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy, we should honor her final wish  not to be replaced until a new President is installed. In fact, that is  the rule the Senate Republicans made up in 2016. About 1 hour after  Justice Scalia died on February 13, 2016, Senator McConnell announced  an unprecedented new rule--that the American people should have a voice  in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this  vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President. Then, for  the next 11 months, Senator McConnell blocked President Obama from  replacing Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. That vacancy existed for  almost a year.  [[Page S5757]]    Back then, it didn't take much for other Republicans to join Senator  McConnell. In fact, the rumor was that the majority leader had his  Republican colleagues all lined up to side with him before he even  announced the so-called McConnell rule. That was then. This is now.   Now that the tables are turned and we have a Republican President  instead of a Democratic one, Senator McConnell and his Republican  colleagues are going back on their word. Within hours of Justice  Ginsburg's death, Senator McConnell vowed: ``President Trump's Supreme  Court nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.''  This is what is known as a 180-degree turn--or talking out of both  sides of your mouth. Of course, he is not the only one.   In 2016, Senator Gardner said: ``I think the next president ought to  choose the Supreme Court nominee, and I think it is only fair to the  nominee themselves, and I think that is only fair to the integrity of  the Supreme Court.'' Yet, after Justice Ginsburg's passing, Senator  Gardner flip-flopped, indicating that, if President Trump nominates  someone he likes, he will vote to confirm.   In 2016, Senator Tillis came to the Senate Chamber to declare: ``It  is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of  our Republic not to launch our Nation into a partisan, divisive  confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are  casting their ballots to elect our next President.''   But it took Senator Tillis fewer than 24 hours after Justice  Ginsburg's death to go back on his word and commit to supporting the  ``conservative jurist President Trump will nominate.''   In 2016, Senator Graham repeatedly stated: ``The election cycle is  well under way and the precedent of the Senate is not to confirm a  nominee at this stage of the process.''   He even doubled down on his promise, claiming: ``I want you to use my  words against me. . . . If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a  vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey  Graham said let's let the next President, whoever it might be, make  that nomination.''   Then, a week after Justice Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford testified before  the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Graham said plainly to Jeffrey  Goldberg of The Atlantic: ``If an opening comes''--of course he was  talking about a Supreme Court opening--``If an opening comes in the  last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process is  started, we'll wait for the next election.''   When my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee did what  Senator Graham asked--that we hold him to his word; we wrote a letter  to him to stick by his word--he refused. He indicated that he would  ``proceed expeditiously to process any nomination made by President  Trump to fill'' Justice Ginsburg's vacancy.   There are other Republican Senators who stood up with Senator  McConnell in 2016 and now have changed their tune, including Senators  Perdue, Ernst, Barrasso, and Cornyn.   The question that American people should ask is, How can you trust  people who don't keep their word?   This is an urgent question for the millions of Americans who will  lose their healthcare and reproductive freedoms if President Trump and  Majority Leader McConnell are successful in stealing yet another  Supreme Court seat.   The threat this nominee poses to the Affordable Care Act is not some  esoteric debate we are having. It is not theoretical. On November 10,  the Supreme Court will hear yet another partisan challenge to the ACA.   I have no doubt that Donald Trump and the majority leader want a new  Justice in place to strike down the ACA, depriving millions of  Americans of their health insurance, including millions with  preexisting conditions.   The more than 6 million Americans who have tested positive for COVID- 19 will likely be deemed to have a preexisting condition. Add them to  the Americans who will be devastated if the ACA is struck down by the  Trump nominee. Our healthcare is on the line with the next nominee,  regardless of who the nominee is.   Note that the Republicans are saying that every single Judiciary  Republican is going to vote for the nominee, and we don't even know who  the nominee is. Well, obviously, it doesn't matter who the nominee is.  It will be someone who is expected to strike down the ACA.   After all, repealing the ACA has long been No. 1 on the President's  and Republicans' hit list. But getting rid of the ACA is not the only  thing the President is after.   The President's nominee will also oppose abortion rights. So that is  next on their hit list.   Let me be clear. The future of Roe v. Wade is on the line. The future  of a woman being able to control her own body is on the line.   With so much at stake with this nomination, the millions of Americans  who revered Justice Ginsburg are not just going to sit by and do  nothing while my Republican colleagues try to steal yet another Supreme  Court seat. In fact, they are showing up in droves in front of the  Supreme Court to show their support for all that Justice Ginsburg stood  for.   They are going to fight back, and you can be assured I will be right  there fighting back with them. They aren't going to fall for the  trumped-up justifications, explanations, and pretexts that Senate  Republicans are using to go back on their word. And I am confident that  in 6 weeks' time, the American people will hold them accountable.   I yield the floor.    M. President, in 2018, Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano erupted,  destroying upwards of 700 homes, including a home purchased by a  veteran using the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program. When this veteran went  to replace the home he had lost by once again using the Home Loan  Guaranty Program, he found that he would be forced to pay significantly  higher fees for using the program a second time.   Our Nation's veterans should not be penalized for losing their homes  to natural disasters and it is for this reason that I come to the floor  today to introduce the Veteran Home Loan Disaster Recovery Act of 2020.   Congress has established a variety of programs in pursuit of both  thanking our Nation's veterans and ensuring that they are able to live  comfortable lives after their service has ended. One of these programs  is the VA Home Loan Guaranty program, which provides eligible veterans  the opportunity to access mortgages backed by the Department of  Veterans Affairs. Under the program the VA guarantees a portion of a  home loan from a private lender allowing the veteran borrower to  receive favorable mortgage terms.   Participants in this program are required to pay a funding fee in  place of closing cost and that fee increases based on various factors,  including whether this is a veteran's first time using the program or  if they have previously had a VA Home Loan. For those who have used the  loan before, the fee is higher, regardless of the circumstances that  led to their needing to purchase a home through the program, including  if their previous home was destroyed by a natural disaster.   The Veteran Home Loan Disaster Recovery Act of 2020 would exempt  program participants from the subsequent loan funding fee increase if  they lost their first home to a natural disaster, allowing them to  access a lower rate as if they were a first-time participant in the  program.   According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in 2019,  there were 101 Presidentially-declared disasters across the Nation. So  far in 2020, there have been 92 major disaster declarations alone.  Right now, wildfires rage in different parts of the Nation, and we are  in the midst of hurricane season in both the Atlantic and Pacific  Oceans.   As we continue to experience raging wildfires, volcanic eruptions,  and massive hurricanes, it is critical that we ensure that we work to  limit the ripple effects from these disasters. Giving veterans the  ability to replace homes lost through no fault of their own is one step  in that direction.                            ____________________
