 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my  district's leading industries that continues to grow and provide good- paying jobs to hardworking Americans.   According to the World Steel Association, more than 6 million people  work in the steel industry across the Nation. In Mississippi County,  Arkansas, thousands of men and women are employed at steel mills and  are some of the highest paid workers in my district.   The steel industry is the backbone of our Nation's infrastructure  whether it is used to build roads, freight rail,  [[Page H209]]  schools, or even green energy projects. Steel is at the heart of it  all, and its growth will only continue.   In 2017 alone, the American Steel and Iron Institute found that the  industry was responsible for $520 billion in economic output, and that  number continues to rise.   Recently, U.S. Steel announced the biggest capital investment in the  history of Arkansas right in my district, bringing with it 900 new  jobs.   As the chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I will fight for  policies that support the growth of the steel industry and promote  exports of American steel. I am committed to working with the industry  to get our steel on the market at home and across the globe.                            ____________________
