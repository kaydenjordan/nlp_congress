 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this historic  legislation that I was proud to coauthor. It has been more than 55  years since the Land and Water Conservation Fund was enacted to  establish recreation and conservation opportunities. Now is the time to  ensure that LWCF is fully and permanently funded.   This bill will create jobs and boost local economies that are  currently facing significant financial hardships due to the COVID-19  pandemic.   It also provides urgent funding of $9.5 billion to fix broken park  infrastructure and failing facilities. The bill supports parks in every  State so hikers and anglers alike can visit and enjoy nature across our  beautiful country. This is desperately needed now for our communities'  emotional and physical well-being.   Mr. Speaker, we need to protect and preserve our lands, and this bill  does that at no expense to our taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to vote  for this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, great women and great men  have served in Congress, walking these Halls and casting votes on this  very floor. One of the greatest was our friend, John Lewis.   A civil rights icon, responsible at a young age for lasting progress  and remarkable courage in the face of violence and injustice. He was  the conscience of our Congress. The room quieted and people listened  when he spoke. It was a true honor to serve with him in the House and,  for me, on the Ways and Means Committee.   It was surreal to walk with him over the Pettus Bridge in Selma on  the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. And constituents thank me to  this day for inviting him to my district.   Our great country is better because of John Lewis, and we should all  work to be just a little more like John Lewis.   John, we miss you. Rest in peace, my friend.                            ____________________
