 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Buffalo  Bills assistant athletic trainer Denny Kellington for his heroic  actions saving the life of Bills safety Damar Hamlin during the Bills'  January 2 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals.   Kellington graduated from Oklahoma State in 2000 and spent time  working for the Denver Broncos, Ohio State, and even working for  upstate New York's very own Syracuse University.   After Hamlin collapsed, Kellington jumped into action and began  performing CPR, continuing this lifesaving treatment for 9 minutes,  saving Hamlin's life and opening the door for his speedy recovery.   Mr. Speaker, Denny Kellington is a hero. All of New York's 24th  District, the Bills Mafia, and America are forever grateful for his  heroism and leadership during a truly terrifying moment.   Due to his valiant actions, I support the calls for the National  Football League to make Denny Kellington the first athletic trainer to  be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.   There is power in prayer, and we are so grateful for Damar's  promising recovery.   Go Bills.                            ____________________
