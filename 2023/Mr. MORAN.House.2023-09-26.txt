 Mr. Speaker, today, I speak in support of the Protecting  Hunting Heritage and Education Act. This bill would amend the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act so that it explicitly states that school programs that  train students ``in archery, hunting, or other shooting sports'' are  eligible for Federal funding.   Currently, the Department of Education, under the Biden  administration, has misinterpreted the phrase ``training in the use of  a dangerous weapon'' so that classes for archery or hunting safety are  being deemed as a violation of Federal law. This simply makes no sense.   If we use the Department of Education's wrongheaded and broad way of  interpreting the definition of a ``weapon,'' then culinary classes  might be next on the exclusion list since knives are used in those  classes.   This bill would correct the Department of Education's misguided  interpretation under the current statute by clarifying that archery and  hunting courses are not teaching the training and the use of dangerous  weapons and schools that choose to teach such courses cannot be  stripped of their Federal funding.   I have been involved in classes that teach hunting and archery  through organizations like the Boy Scouts, and I know firsthand that  they teach and reinforce skills like responsibility, self-reliance,  preparation, and attention to detail. They build self-esteem in young  men and women and also reinforce the ideas of conservation and  stewardship of our natural resources and instill a love and  appreciation for the world that God created.   These classes also teach safety and responsibility relating to rifles  and bows and arrows. All of these are skills and characteristics that  we want in our children. Why misinterpret statutes to prevent classes  that reinforce these skills and characteristics in our youth?   I proudly support the Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act  and urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage to return  local control to our school districts and to make right what is now  currently wrong.                                time  1700
