 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that prior to  the vote, I be able to complete my remarks, followed by Senator Inhofe,  followed by Senator Reed.    Mr. President, I am pleased that today we will finally  move to a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2022. Thanks to the Democrats' focus on their reckless Build Back  Better tax-and-spending spree, consideration of the NDAA, one of the  most important bills we consider every year, was delayed for months.   Of course, once we finally got onto the bill, Democrats rushed the  process. Senators of both parties filed a total of 1,000 amendments on  this bill, but not one--not a single one--of those amendments received  a vote on the Senate floor.   But at least we are finally here set to pass this critical  legislation. I am pleased the Republicans were able to strengthen this  bill in committee and in the so-called preconference negotiations. This  includes removing troublesome provisions like red-flag laws that would  summarily suspend the Second Amendment rights of our men and women in  uniform.   Thanks in large part to Republican efforts, the final bill is $25  billion above President Biden's inadequate budget request.  [[Page S9172]]    We have made a lot of progress over the past several years on  rebuilding our military, which, I might add, after years of  underfunding and budgetary uncertainty, combined with heavy operational  demands, had been left underequipped, undermanned, and underprepared to  meet the threats of the 21st century. The situation had gotten so bad  that in 2018, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission  released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point  where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia  or China--an especially chilling warning considering the mounting  destabilization from both of these countries today. The Commission  noted that we would be especially vulnerable if we were ever called on  to fight a war on two fronts.   But, as I said, over the past several years, we made a lot of  progress on restoring military readiness. Unfortunately, President  Biden's inadequate budget request threatened to undo some of that  progress. So I am pleased--very pleased--that, thanks in large part to  Republican efforts, Democrats and Republicans have agreed on a final  number that will continue our reinvestment in our military so that our  men and women in uniform will have the resources they need to address  the threats of the 21st century.   With both China and Russia flexing their military power and the  growing danger of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is  critically important that we ensure that our Nation is always prepared  to defend itself and our vital national interests, whatever the threat.   On the subject of Ukraine, I am very pleased the final bill we will  vote on today includes an additional $50 million in military assistance  for Ukraine. Ukraine has spent years dealing with a Russian invasion  that threatens to push further into its sovereign territory, and we  should be supporting the efforts of this free nation to defend itself  from Russian aggression.   I am particularly proud to announce that this year's NDAA contains  the necessary funding to continue essential preparation for the B-21  mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.   We found out in June of this year that Ellsworth had officially been  named ``Main Operating Base 1'' for the future B-21 bomber, home of the  Raider. This designation not only means Ellsworth will be the first  base to host the B-21 Raider but will also host the formal training  unit and the first operational squadron. The stealth B-21 bomber will  eventually replace the Air Force's B-1s, which have been a proven  workhorse within Global Strike Command but must be divested to free up  capacity and resources for an even more agile and capable bomber fleet.   Once operational, the B-21 Raider will be a critical part of our  Nation's long-range strike capabilities and nuclear deterrent well into  the future. I am incredibly proud that South Dakota and Ellsworth were  chosen to serve as the first operating base for the B-21s.   When I first came to the Senate, the outlook for Ellsworth wasn't so  rosy. I had barely arrived here in the Senate when Ellsworth was placed  on the base realignment and closure, or BRAC, list. It was an all-hands  effort by the congressional delegation and Ellsworth and State and  community leaders to make the case to the Bush administration and BRAC  Commission to remove Ellsworth from the closure list.   Many thought that South Dakota might not have the clout to make this  stand, that we didn't wield enough influence. We were only given about  a 12-percent chance of pulling through, but we were determined that we  weren't going to lose Ellsworth. We stood our ground, and we won the  day. Ellsworth was removed from the BRAC list that August, and we got  right to work on building up the base so that we would never again find  ourselves in the same position.   In 2007, we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at  Ellsworth, and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its  command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers. In 2015, a decade-long  mission paid off with the quadrupling of the training airspace for the  base. The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training  airspace in the continental United States and can be used for large- force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across this country. It  is also well-suited for B-21 training, which is undoubtedly one of the  reasons Ellsworth was chosen as the first home of the Raider.   I am committed to ensuring that Ellsworth has everything it needs for  its new mission so that it can continue to serve as one of our Nation's  essential military assets for decades to come. To that end, I worked to  ensure that this year's National Defense Authorization Act contain not  only full funding for B-21 development but full funding for the first  of many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B- 21 mission at Ellsworth, including a low observable coating and  restoration facility, a wash rack and maintenance hangar, expanding the  flight simulator facility, and more. It is imperative that these and  follow-on military construction projects at Ellsworth stay on pace to  ensure the B-21, once fielded, can begin operations alongside the  current B-1 mission at Ellsworth to enable a smooth transition from one  mission to the next.   The National Defense Authorization Act also ensures adequate support  for our B-1s in South Dakota and in Texas and deployed on Bomber Task  Force missions so that they have the resources they need until they are  replaced by the B-21s.   I will continue to do everything I can here in Congress to support  our B-1s at Ellsworth and advance the B-21 mission.   Providing for our Nation's defense is one of our most serious  responsibilities as Members of Congress. We have an obligation to  ensure that our Nation is prepared to meet any threat, whether the  danger comes from terrorism, rogue states, or major powers. We have an  obligation to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the  resources they need to confront the threats that we ask them to face.   I am frustrated that it took us so long to move to consideration of  this year's National Defense Authorization Act, but I am happy we did  at least manage to secure a solid piece of legislation, and I look  forward to voting for this bill later today.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Wyoming (Ms. Lummis).
