 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Buck,  for his leadership on this issue. This is quite a somewhat disturbing  issue, I think, to all of us, Republicans and Democrats.   For the last 2 years, Americans have often been led to believe that  anything they see and hear that does not comport with the stance of the  Biden administration is somehow ``misinformation,'' whether it is  criticism of COVID mandates, the fact that our border is not secure, or  the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop.   Thanks to the Twitter files, we know that social media companies  actively exploited their ideology and suppressed speech with which they  disagreed. Nice, in America.   Two years ago, two of our Democrat colleagues sent letters to every  cable and satellite provider calling conservative news channels FOX  News, Newsmax, and One America News purveyors of disinformation and  asked specifically: ``Are you planning to carry FOX News, Newsmax, both  now and beyond any contract renewal date? If so, why?''   Last year, DIRECTV announced that it was deplatforming One America  News and just last week they deplatformed Newsmax.   Over a million DIRECTV subscribers in Pennsylvania, hundreds of  thousands in my district, no longer have access to Newsmax through  their TV. Dozens and dozens of my constituents have written or called  my office to voice their concern and anger about DIRECTV's actions to  deplatform Newsmax. This is unacceptable.   The Committee on Oversight and Accountability will be, I very much  hope and will be supporting, investigating private companies that have  circumvented the First Amendment for ideological purposes, and this   investigation should not be limited to social media platforms alone.
