 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a  looming crisis facing our country. This one is a man-made crisis, one  born out of cruel political calculations.   Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the threat of some of our Republican  colleagues to refuse to raise the debt ceiling next year, unless their  most extreme demands are met, and they have made clear what those  demands are.   They believe this threat is how they can finally force cuts to the  Social Security benefits that millions of Americans have earned. This  threat is how they are going try to raise the retirement age. This is  how they want to force cuts to Medicare.   They are prepared to force a default and create catastrophic  consequences for our economy and America's standing in the world, so  they can slash Social Security and Medicare.   We can't let that happen. We must address the debt ceiling. The  consequences if we don't act are too grave.   To all of my colleagues, we must not hold Social Security and  Medicare hostage. We must address the debt ceiling as soon as possible.                            ____________________
