 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a more secure  future for offshore wind and for Massachusetts' leadership in this  growing clean energy sector.   The removal of the proposed crewing amendment is a win for offshore  wind and for Massachusetts. I am proud to have fought on behalf of  clean energy independence and my district's economic development.   However, we should not replay this saga every Congress. With  Republicans taking the gavel, I am ready to work across the aisle and  with dissenting voices in my own party to negotiate a permanent  solution that advances offshore wind and anchors American jobs at home.   I look forward to working on a bipartisan compromise to support  domestic mariners and shipbuilders and to safeguard our clean energy  future.                            ____________________
