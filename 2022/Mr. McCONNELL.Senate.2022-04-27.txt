 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I, along with others, had the  opportunity to say goodbye to Madeleine Albright this morning--a truly  remarkable life: first woman Secretary of State, a remarkable diplomat,  and a friend. We had an opportunity to bond over an issue I am about to  discuss: the people of Burma and the plight that they have had to  endure over the years. Regretfully, as her life came to an end, things  did not go in the right direction in Burma--at least not yet. I know  she would not have given up hope; nor have I.    Mr. President, Louisville, KY, makes its mark on  American life as the host of the Kentucky Derby, the producer of the  iconic Louisville Slugger baseball bat, and a place to sample America's  signature spirit, bourbon. Many Americans may not know that my hometown  leaves its fingerprints on their lives in another way: as the home of  the world's largest automated package handling facility, the UPS  Worldport.   This massive warehouse--at 5.2 million square feet, it is larger than  the Mall of America--sorts millions of packages every day, speedily  shipping them to consumers across the globe. It serves as the keystone  of the vast UPS supply chain, linking consumers to businesses all over  the country. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the  retirement of one of the key figures in the Worldport's development,  UPS Airlines president Brendan Canavan.   To many, the UPS Worldport might seem like something out of a science  fiction movie. Standing in the facility, you would be struck by the  sheer scale of thousands of packages whirring about on a complicated  system of conveyor belts, scanners, and lifts. This enormous warehouse  sorts the average package in just 13 minutes. Human hands only touch  packages twice. It is an amazing feat of modern technology and supply  chain efficiency.   It would take an extraordinarily visionary business leader to have  planned and executed such a facility. Its scale and complexity are  almost too vast to fathom. But Brendan Canavan moved to Louisville in  2004 and did just that. In only a few years, he helped turn Louisville  into a global supply chain hub and brought new levels of speed to the  process.   Brendan knows so much about UPS's operations because he has performed  many of them himself. While in college in his hometown of Philadelphia,  he worked as a UPS loader and driver. He later stepped into management  roles around the country, coming into leadership positions just as  computer technology began to take a greater role in the supply chain  logistics industry.  [[Page S2186]]    As a rising star in the company, Brendan was tasked with the  development of Louisville's Worldport facility in 2004. He came to our  city and quickly got to work developing the warehouse, which now  processes roughly 300 flights of UPS shipments every single day. For  his outstanding work developing the Worldport, he was rewarded with  greater and greater roles in UPS's leadership structure.   By 2014, Brendan had ascended to the presidency of UPS Airlines. In  that role, he oversaw nearly 300 individual airplanes and thousands of  pilots, operating all over the world at all hours of the day. As the  coordinator of such a vast organization, he ensured his company  maintained its technological prowess, allowing UPS to keep up with the  ever-changing demands of its global consumers.   Two years ago, Brendan faced a challenge unlike any UPS had ever  seen: the coronavirus pandemic. Across the world, airports shut down  and supply chains became hopelessly gnarled. Still, Brendan wielded his  decades of on-the-ground experience to hold UPS's systems together,  continuing to perform vital services even in the face of seemingly  insurmountable challenges.   Now, after what must have been some of the most difficult years of  his career, Brendan is taking a step back to spend more time with his  family and devote extra energy to volunteering. His desire to aid  others has not diminished one bit, and he continues to make a mark on  Louisville.   I want to thank Brendan for his decades of service to our country,  his outstanding leadership at UPS, and his hard work to make Louisville  a capital of global supply chain logistics. On behalf of the Senate, I  share my congratulations with Brendan on his extraordinary career and  wish him the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
