 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary  efforts of Bob Weismantle and the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter  862 Honor Guard in their remembrance of Commander Doyle Lynn of  Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania.   Commander Lynn served our country as a U.S. Navy pilot. On May 27,  1965, while flying a combat mission in Vietnam, Commander Lynn's plane  was shot down by the enemy.   Following this tragedy, Commander Lynn was deemed missing in action.  Fifty-three years later, Bob Weismantle and fellow Vietnam veterans  requested that Hopewell Township in Beaver County install a street sign  to commemorate their missing comrade.   Today, this honor was rightfully bestowed. The Commander Doyle Lynn  street sign is proudly mounted on West Wade Street.   The care and dedication shown by Bob and the Vietnam Veterans of  America Chapter 862 for their missing brother-in-arms speaks volumes to  their character and the loyalty that our veterans have for one another.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all our veterans for their selfless sacrifice  defending our country.   May God bless Commander Doyle Lynn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
