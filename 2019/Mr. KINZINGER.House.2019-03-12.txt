 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 156, which I  was proud to cosponsor, calling for justice in the 2015 murder of  Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.   On the evening of Friday, February 27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov was shot  in the back and killed by cowards just outside of the Kremlin in  Moscow.   Mr. Nemtsov was an important figure in Russia because he stood up to  Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation as he called for democracy in  a country dominated by oppression.   Before his assassination, Mr. Nemtsov was planning to run for  President in 2018 against Vladimir Putin. One can only think of what  Russia's future could have been today with Mr. Nemtsov as its leader.   Since that day in February 2015, suspects have been charged and  sentenced for murder, but we still don't have all the answers or truly  know why Mr. Nemtsov was killed. However, we do know that there has  never been any questioning of additional suspects or any investigation  into evidence that the convicted gunman was a member of a Russian unit  that was stationed and backed by Chechen dictator and thug Ramzan  Kadyrov.   Furthermore, Russia continues to put up roadblocks to outside  investigators from the European Union and the OSCE to prevent more  investigations into the sequence of events that fateful night. Four  years after his murder, Boris Nemtsov and his family are still without  answers or the justice that they deserve.   The House resolution uses the voice of Congress to hold his killers  and their accomplices accountable. Specifically, this resolution  condemns the Putin regime for targeting political opponents and using  the Russian Government to cover up the murder of Mr. Nemtsov. It also  calls on the U.S. Government to use its capabilities to identify those  who support the murderers and to impose strict sanctions for their  actions.   Last February, on the anniversary of his death, we saw a fitting  tribute to Mr. Nemtsov's calls for freedom and democracy when the  street in front of the Russian Embassy here in Washington was renamed  the Boris Nemtsov Plaza. We can take another important step towards  justice by passing this important resolution.   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for bringing  this up in such a bipartisan way.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H2660]]    Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to thank Chairman Engel and the  ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for offering up this important resolution  which seeks justice for Boris Nemtsov's brutal murder.   At a time when we are seeing the Russian people protesting tighter  restrictions on their access to the internet, we should not forget the  brave leadership of Mr. Nemtsov, a man who stood up to the oppressors  in Russia and advocated bravely for freedom. We should honor his memory  by continuing to seek justice for his assassination.   It is also important to note, Madam Speaker, the strong bipartisan  showing in this Chamber of, really, any Russian resolution that comes  up because we are united, as the prior speaker said, with the Russian  people in fighting oppression, as we have for so long and we will  continue to do.   I urge all Members to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today with the majority, also in strong support  of H.R. 596, the Crimea Annexation Non-recognition Act. I am proud to  cosponsor this legislation, which clearly states that America will not  recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.   Ukraine continues to face significant challenges from Russia, from  their meddling, and from their aggression. In Congress, we know the  true intentions of Vladimir Putin when it comes to Ukraine. Vladimir  Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin are tearing Europe apart.   Russian-backed separatists continue their shelling of Ukrainian  military positions in Eastern Ukraine, which has killed civilians in  many areas.   Additionally, Russia recently violated Ukraine sovereignty and  territorial integrity when it fired upon and captured three Ukrainian  vessels and 24 sailors. Russia continues to hold these sailors on bogus  charges that they violated Russian borders, even though the Kerch  Strait is determined to be neutral waters.                                time  1245    While Russia maintains that Ukrainian soldiers were threatening the  construction of the Crimean bridge, which is currently under  construction between the territory of Russia and Crimea, we know this  is fake news from Putin and his thugs.   We need to continue to send a strong message to the Russians that the  United States does not and will not  [[Page H2661]]  recognize their claim of sovereignty over Crimea, not now and not ever.   I commend Secretary Pompeo for making the Crimea Declaration last  July that articulated this policy of the United States, and I believe  Congress should have a voice in this as well.   Madam Speaker, the bill is simple. It states that the policy of the  United States Government is to never recognize sovereignty over Crimea,  and it prohibits all U.S. Government agencies from taking any action  with respect to acknowledging that Russia has any claims over the  territory.   As Vladimir Putin seeks to impose his iron-fisted will over former  Soviet republics, we must continue to stand with our allies to counter  that aggression.   I commend the work of my friend from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) and my  friend from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for their leadership on this issue. By  reaffirming congressional support for Ukraine's territorial integrity  and by holding Russia accountable for its continued violation of  Ukraine sovereignty, I believe we will continue to stand with Ukraine  legislatively and most effectively from here and into the future.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs  and the primary cosponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am prepared  to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 27, 2019, statement  by Secretary Pompeo on Crimea and Ukraine.                          U.S. Department of State                         Office of the Spokesperson                 [For Immediate Release--February 27, 2019]                       Statement by Secretary Pompeo                              Crimea is Ukraine         Five years ago, Russia's occupation of Ukraine's Crimean       peninsula fueled an escalation of Russian aggression. Russia       attempted to upend the international order, undermined basic       human freedoms, and weakened our common security. The world       has not forgotten the cynical lies Russia employed to justify       its aggression and mask its attempted annexation of Ukrainian       territory. Russia's use of force against a peaceful neighbor       must not be tolerated by reputable states. The United States       reiterates its unwavering position: Crimea is Ukraine and       must be returned to Ukraine's control.        The United States remains gravely concerned by the       worsening repression by Russia's occupation regime in Crimea.       During the past five years, Russian occupation authorities       have engaged in an array of abuses in a campaign to eliminate       all opposition to its control over Crimea. As part of this       campaign, Russia has arbitrarily detained and wrongfully       convicted individuals for peaceful opposition to the       occupation, and in some cases has forcibly transferred these       individuals from occupied Crimea to Russia. The United States       calls on Russia to release all of the Ukrainians, including       members of the Crimean Tatar community, it has imprisoned in       retaliation for their peaceful dissent. This includes Oleh       Sentsov, Oleksandr Kolchenko, Volodymyr Balukh, Ruslan       Zeytullayev, and approximately 70 others. We call on Russia       to cease all its abuses immediately, to end its occupation of       Crimea, and, in the meantime, to comply with its obligations       under international law, including the law of occupation.        In the Crimea Declaration of July 25, 2018, the United       States reaffirmed its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's       claims of sovereignty over Crimea. The United States also       condemns Russia's illegal actions in Crimea and its continued       aggression against Ukraine. The United States will maintain       respective sanctions against Russia until the Russian       government returns control of Crimea to Ukraine and fully       implements the Minsk agreements. The United States reiterates       its unbending support for Ukraine's sovereignty and       territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized       borders, including its territorial waters.     Madam Speaker, the Secretary writes: ``In the Crimea  Declaration of July 25, 2018, the United States reaffirmed its refusal  to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over Crimea. The  United States also condemns Russia's illegal actions in Crimea and its  continued aggression against Ukraine. The United States will maintain  respective sanctions against Russia until the Russian Government  returns control of Crimea to Ukraine and fully implements the Minsk  agreements. The United States reiterates its unbending support for  Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its  internationally recognized borders, including its territorial waters.''   Madam Speaker, in our history, we have always seen the impact that  our Nation has on others. When we stand up, we help them achieve a  better tomorrow. We must continue to help Ukraine achieve that better  future for its citizens, particularly one that is free from Russian  aggression.   Recently, we sent the USS Donald Cook to transit through the Kerch  Strait as a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Actions like these, and  support for this bill, will further send the message to Vladimir Putin  that the U.S. will never waver in our support for those who seek to  push back against Russian oppression and coerced influence.   This is a great bill that shows the unity between Republicans and  Democrats in this House, the legislative body, and the administration.  I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
