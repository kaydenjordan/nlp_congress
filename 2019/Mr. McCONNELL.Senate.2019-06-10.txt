 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on Friday, the entire country got  some really good news: President Trump and his administration secured  an agreement with the Government of Mexico. Our neighbors to the south  will be doing more to secure their own borders and to control the flow  of people through Mexico. These stepped-up efforts should help relieve  some of the extraordinary pressure on the U.S.-Mexico border.   This was an important step in tackling the unacceptable and  unsustainable crisis--the crisis that continues to roil our southern  border. Mexico has an important role to play in solving the ongoing  security and humanitarian nightmare.   Americans were also happy to hear the President's announcement that,  as a result of this progress, our own families and businesses will not  need to absorb the cost of higher tariffs on imports from Mexico. This  would have been a step backward for the U.S. economy generally, a new  obstacle for many of our manufacturers and small businesses, and a pain  that families back home tell me often would hurt them directly.   At its best, the U.S.-Mexico friendship should combine strong mutual  efforts on security with a strong and prosperous trading relationship.  I am glad that is the direction we seem to be headed.   So this was an important step, but as my Republican colleagues and I  have been sounding the alarm for months, the magnitude of this border  crisis means that more will obviously be necessary.   Our U.S. processing facilities are badly strained beyond capacity as  record numbers of individuals and families continue to pour through.   The men and women of Customs and Border Protection and our other  agencies on the border are juggling too much, making do with too little  and having to triage resources away from other important priorities so  they can keep up even the most basic security functions and provide  even the bare minimum humanitarian assistance.   The administration is working overtime on this. Now our Mexican  friends are stepping up as well. In short, about the only important  players who are still refusing to take action are my  [[Page S3276]]  Democratic friends right here in Congress.   Democrats in the House and the Senate have had no shortage of  rhetoric on the subject. They are very focused on sounding concerned  about this but thus far have stood in the way of any action.   It is not rocket science. The agencies on the border that are  confronting this unprecedented crush of people need more resources.  They have explained that to Congress as clearly as possible.   There is nothing remotely partisan about this. A few weeks ago, even  the New York Times editorial board wrote:         As resources are strained and the system buckles, the       misery grows. Something needs to be done. Soon.    That is the New York Times. Just yesterday, they followed up with  another piece: ``When Will Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at  the Border?''   So for those scoring at home, President Trump and the New York Times  editorial board are actually on the same side. It seems like everyone  across the country understands that we should provide this funding-- everyone except Democrats here in Washington who have become so  addicted to picking political fights with the Trump administration that  they are letting even their most basic responsibilities slip.   Well, I will have a lot more to say on this subject in the days  ahead. I think everyone understands quite well that my friends across  the aisle are not personal fans of the President. We got that.   I would suggest it is time to get over it. The security of the United  States and the humanitarian conditions on our border cannot afford to  go underfunded any longer just because Democrats cannot bring  themselves to give this White House anything it asks for.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consideration of S. Res.  240, submitted earlier today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
