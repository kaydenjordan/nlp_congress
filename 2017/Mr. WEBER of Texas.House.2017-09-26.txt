 Mr. Speaker, in all my years, I have seen a lot  of storms, a lot of hurricanes, a lot of floods, a lot of tropical  depressions, a lot of rains in Texas. We have a whole variety of  weather in Texas and a lot of just about every calamity weather-wise  you can think of. I have seen nothing come close to Hurricane Harvey.  In 24 hours, we went from Tropical Storm Harvey to Category 4 Hurricane  Harvey.   As with most hurricanes, there was no rhyme or reason for the  destruction and the ensuing devastation. Harvey's bands of rains sat on  southeast Texas with a vengeance and for days on end, and the situation  turned quickly from bad to worse.   Mr. Speaker, we got 51 to 53 inches of rain in 3 to 4 days. That part  of Texas' annual rainfall is about 53 inches a year. We got a whole  year's worth of rainfall in under a week's time. Our great first  responders, our volunteers, risked their lives time and time again to  save others.   When the Nation saw that we needed help, the boats and the people  just kept coming. We got the Cajun Navy from Louisiana; 100 guys with  their own boats came to help us. They did things we didn't think were  possible, so I coined a new phrase, ``Cajuneering.'' They came in and  really helped us. We saw neighbors and strangers alike step up to help  each other. That is the Texas way.   When the Nation saw that we needed help, people came pouring in. More  [[Page H7524]]  than that, it is not just the Texas way, it is the American way. No  matter our creed, our color, our religion or background, we are all  united and we work together. Harvey may have brought the downpour, but  Texans and Americans brought the outpour.   Texas 14 is arguably ground zero for flooding and devastation. My  district, from Brazoria County to Jefferson County, the enormity and  the severity of Harvey, sadly, is on full display.   Entire neighborhoods were underwater. How do you recover from that?  Your family and your house is underwater, your cars are underwater,  your furniture, and, sadly, even some of your most prized and precious  heirlooms, family photos and pictures and albums, how do you overcome  that?   Well, I will tell you, by working together. Everyone back home in our  great State knows someone who needs help, and everyone back home is  doing their part to help that person in need.   In all the devastation and destruction, the hope and determination  shared among Texans was absolutely remarkable. Harvey may have deluged  our State with rain and with water, but he certainly did not dampen our  spirit.   One month ago today, Harvey made landfall between Port Aransas and  Port O'Connor, the eye of the hurricane. A few days later, Harvey swung  back into the Gulf and made landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana.  We literally had a 3-day weather event. Harvey came on shore there by  Rockport-Corpus Christi. We got the bands of rain coming up in the  hurricane as he came ashore. He then went up north and stayed around  for a day or two dumping rain on all of our rivers and streams upstream  from us and our watersheds. Then he came back down to southeast Texas,  down on the coast, and he worked right over, as I said, in Louisiana.  Then after Harvey came Hurricane Irma; after Irma came Jose; and after  Jose came Maria. It has been a historic time.   As of Sunday, September 24--let this sink in--817,758 people are  registered for disaster assistance. FEMA has distributed $502.6 million  in housing assistance and $160.2 million in other assistance. In the  one month since Harvey, the first of a series of hurricanes, FEMA has  completed 239,612 inspections. Almost 22,000 people are living in  hotels because they have no home to return to. That number doesn't even  include those who are staying with family and friends.   The Small Business Administration has approved $509.4 million.  Homeowners have received, to date, $467.3 million in loans. Businesses  have received $42 million in loans. Earlier this month, we passed out  of this Chamber, with overwhelming bipartisan support, a $15 billion  relief bill. Two or three more of those bills, at a minimum, are  expected.   Folks, the monetary damages are adding up to over $150 billion, with  a ``B.''                                time  1700    There are five business recovery centers in Texas. There are 41  disaster recovery centers. Over 30-something Texas counties were named  in the disaster declaration.   Folks, these are just numbers. They are mind-boggling. You can see  the pictures here beside me. Those numbers don't really tell the whole  story. Let me tell you: behind those numbers are people; behind those  numbers are families; behind those numbers are homes, livelihoods, and  businesses. The lives of our great Texans are behind those numbers. Our  people are hurting, but they will not let a hurricane keep them down.   Wrapped up in all of the devastation is a bunch of heroes and first  responders. I have already talked about the Cajun Navy. I can talk  about the States that sent firefighters and first responders from all  over this great country of ours. So behind the devastation is a bunch  of American heroes. Behind that devastation is a bunch of love, people  doing things for others that just makes your heart feel good. Behind  that devastation is a bunch of hope that we really are one Nation under  God, with liberty and justice and help and mercy for all. Behind that  devastation is a bunch of Americans.   Hurricane Harvey reminded us of our deepest, truest American values.  United we can accomplish just about anything.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to open up the floor for some of my  colleagues. As I said earlier, our great 14th Congressional District  is, arguably, ground zero for flooding and devastation, but I have a  lot more colleagues here on the floor with us that all have a story to  tell.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the  distinguished chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.  Chairman McCaul has worked closely with FEMA and many of our first  responders. His district saw quite a bit of water as well, and I  appreciate his direct involvement and his willingness to be there.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for his  remarks. I certainly appreciate him and his involvement.   My next friend, Beto O'Rourke, from across the aisle, has seen plenty  of Texas action here. Earlier this year, he had a bipartisan trip with  Will Hurd. On Facebook, we got to watch that and participate in that. I  thank him for doing that. That was a great event. And even though his  district may not have seen any water as a result of Harvey--in fact, we  would have loved to send him some to El Paso, quite frankly--he is a  Texan, he gets it, and he has been there working with us every step of  the way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke), my  good friend.    Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke. And, by the way,  happy birthday.    At this time, I recognize my good friend, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    I thank you, Dr. Babin. The enormity of this  storm and the debt of gratitude that we owe our first responders cannot  be overstated.  [[Page H7527]]    My good friend, Judge Ted Poe, saw plenty of it up in his district,  but he took it in stride, as he always does with any challenge because  he is a Texan and he is a fighter. And, Judge, that is just the way it  is.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Poe. He is exactly  correct. Harvey cannot dampen our spirit or those of our neighbors and  all of our first responders, those who came and helped.   Texas saw the first of four hurricanes this month. Think about that.  Puerto Rico has seen the last two hurricanes. Maria did a number on the  island. They are in need of so many things, but one thing is certain  that they are not in need of: they have a leader here in Washington,  D.C. She has got their back, and I am proud to yield to my good friend,  Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Thank you, Mr. Weber, for  allowing me to speak in these Special Orders, and actually speaking  about hurricanes.   Mr. Speaker and Members, last week, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico,  and  [[Page H7528]]  it is by far the worst hurricane to do so in the last century. It came  at a time when Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and most of the  Caribbean were beginning to recover from the impact of Hurricane Irma  just 10 days earlier.   Keep in mind, also, that even before the winds and waves of Irma and  Maria began to lash at the shores, Puerto Rico was already in a dire  economic shape. We are still engaged in lifesaving operations,  searching for and helping people who are in the greatest danger.   Maria snapped the island's communication towers, and gathering  information from many communities has been nearly impossible at this  time, especially in the rural center of the island, where the winds  were ferocious and landslides have occurred.   This hurricane has been a disaster of unprecedented proportions. The  images that you have been seeing on TV are dramatic but don't even  begin to tell the magnitude of this catastrophe and the human suffering  that you can only truly experience by being on the ground. In every  way, Maria is on the same level of Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey,  but with one major difference: Puerto Rico is an island, which makes it  almost impossible to get aid and disaster relief resources in, as they  can only come by sea or air. The people are basically stuck there with  no place to go.   Currently, Puerto Rico's electric grid is completely down. Roads and  bridges have been washed away, leaving many communities without  communication. A crucial dam has burst, forcing the evacuation of  thousands of people. Hospitals are crippled and operating on power  generators, but the logistics of transporting the diesel needed to run  them is extremely difficult. Thousands of homes, buildings, and  businesses have been destroyed. Water and food are in short supply.  People are waiting in line for up to 6 hours just to purchase $20 worth  of gasoline. Commercial flights to and from the island are almost  nonexistent, with thousands of people on airline wait-lists just to  leave. Most banks cannot operate, and people don't have easy access to  cash, which they need desperately because credit cards are not being  used on the island because we don't have power.    Maria flattened 80 percent of the island's agriculture, and Puerto  Rico's tourism industry has been crushed. For most of the island's  residents, the hurricane can best be described as apocalyptic. Congress  must approve an aid package that is proportional with the level of  devastation. We need tangible relief that addresses the island's  immediate needs. Without help, there will be a massive exodus to the  U.S. mainland, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis will only get worse.   The residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens. They are not  different from every person sitting in this Chamber. But unlike  everyone else, Congress has 100 percent control over the land where we  live. This is a job for the Federal Government, particularly this  Congress, to authorize and appropriate the money needed to rebuild the  island. This is a dire time for the island, and, therefore, our Nation.  The U.S. has an abiding national interest in the recovery and  prosperity of Puerto Rico and its 3.4 million U.S. citizens who are  facing very tough economic times, even before this latest blow.   I have heard from many of you, many of my colleagues, even the Vice  President today, and I am deeply grateful for all the prayers and  support.   I also want to thank the Trump administration for their unwavering  collaboration with the Puerto Rico National Guard. More than 10,000  people were deployed helping the island to restore the power grid. It  will take more than 6 months to get power on the island again.   I hope this House can keep us in your prayers, but also to approve  the package that is going to be needed in October, and I know we will  respond. That was the claim that President Trump made today, and the  Vice President. I was just in a meeting with them. I want to thank the  Speaker of the House for his leadership allowing the waiver to the cost  sharing of FEMA on the island.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon  for her remarks.   My good friend from the Southwest, Blake Farenthold, is going to come  and address us. Blake represents the area where Harvey actually made  landfall and brought Category 4 winds and storm surges. As Congressman  Farenthold knows, I understand the devastation that that brings. My  heart goes out to them, and, Blake, please come share with us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Farenthold for  his comments. The 27th District of Texas is blessed to have him.   A little background: On Friday, August 25, some of the outer bands of  Harvey were beginning to brush the Gulf  [[Page H7529]]  Coast. Texans do what we always do to prepare for a storm. We bought  the essentials. We prepped the house. We tightened things up. We  watched the news. We were as ready for the rain, we thought, as we  would ever be.   But what happened, in my 64 years on God's green Earth, is unlike  anything I have ever seen before like this. And I am no stranger to the  area. I have lived in a 20-mile radius almost my entire life. I hope I  have got a lot more to go yet.   We didn't see the sun for 4 days. Over 50 inches of rain, as reported  by the weather forecasters on TV news, fell from the sky. Actually, it  was about 60 inches in District 4--7, rather, in Jefferson County.   Evacuation orders, mandatory and voluntary, were posted. City after  city started posting the notices. Roads were flooded. Some of them had  hip-deep water, some of them more.   Now, I am a Texan, kind of like Judge Poe said. Two things apply to  me, especially apply to me as a Texan: number one, I am stubborn, and,  number two, I have one of those pickup trucks he talked about;  although, I don't have a half-ton truck. I have got a Ford F-350 4- wheel drive truck, and I can go through almost waist-deep water.   Starting Saturday, my bride and I began traveling Texas 14, checking  on people. We went first to Brazoria County and met with their EOC,  emergency operations center. We went to the Hitchcock shelter. We met  with volunteers in those shelters. We met with people from the La  Marque Police Department, all over, our first responders.   Our first responders worked endless hours and hours. I tell you what,  it was heartwarming; and I tell you what, Mr. Speaker, you have never  seen anything like that.   From Bay Area Church to the families from League City and Dickinson  that sought shelter, we were there with them. At Victory Lakes, we saw  much of the same thing in the school there at Victory Lakes and League  City.   At Friendswood High School, I met with evacuees, responders, doctors  who had come in from other States to be there to help. These are just a  handful of the shelters that popped up. These shelters and the  volunteers provided a dry place with warm food and warm, friendly  smiles, understanding smiles, to hundreds of families in need. That is  no exaggeration.   Homes that never came close to flooding were taking on water. Roads  turned into rivers. Evacuations and rescues were happening everywhere  you looked around.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Farenthold).    I thank the gentleman for that.   You know, we were moving throughout our district, as I was  describing. Folks, the sound of a helicopter will never be the same for  us. We saw Coast Guard helicopters. We saw Army, Marine helicopters.  The Marines arrived in Friendswood.   The sun made a brief appearance on Tuesday evening. I found myself on  I-45 in Dickinson passing out water on the overpass there, where the  water was about 4 feet deep in the intersection.   Things kept turning from bad to worse. I was honored to meet with EOC  leaders from Brazoria, Dickinson, Galveston, and Beaumont.   On Tuesday, August 29, in Friendswood, Texas, the Marines arrived.  Thank God for our great Marines.   On Friday, August 31, Beaumont lost water. My bride and I drove  almost 7 hours, having to take back road after back road to deliver  three pallets of bottled water. My good friend Dwight Sullivan and his  wife, Misty, accompanied us with another pallet of water.    We got to Beaumont. I want to gave Mayor Becky Ames of Beaumont a  shout-out. She never wavered. She was a stalwart.   Will Crenshaw from Beaumont, Dragon Products, they got in gear and  they put a workaround on the water system, laid temporary pipes, got  them power, got pumps and got Beaumont some water.   That is just the short version of the first week of Harvey.   The sun finally started to shine again, but the water did not recede  overnight. We took many flyovers to assess the damage. President Trump  came in. Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz, Speaker Ryan, and leader Kevin  McCarthy were among the many who visited.   Help came from far and wide: New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota. I  could go down the list of State after State after State, all Americans,  all wanting to help. And, of course, Louisiana and the Cajun Navy we  talked about.   Between the Cajun Navy, our Texans, our fellow Americans, there were  many countless heroes who haven't been named and many haven't even been  thanked at all. So to all of them, I want to say thank you. Thank you  from the bottom of my heart for the lives you have saved. I witnessed  some of the evacuations. Thank you for your heroism. I just can't tell  you enough, thank you on behalf of us.   We saws doctors send supplies. We saw hospitals pay for things that  normally they would charge for. We saw cattle and horses wading through  water. We saw businesses open up their doors and help people. We saw a  mother and daughter who took hundreds of evacuees into a Texas City  hotel for a home-cooked meal of spaghetti, salad, fresh fruit, and  dessert.   You were heroes, Lakewood Church, who did open their doors and  provided transportation for the congregants of Beth Yeshurun synagogue.   You heroes were the citizens who saw the incredible effort of your  local officials, and you raised money for them to begin recovering for  their own homes and their belongings.   The heroes were the young men, hoping to attend the Naval Academy one  day, who jumped in that jon boat and went door to door to help.   You were the people who were scared to death in the face of disaster,  and yet you put on a brave face and you waded in, unabashed.   You were the people who lost everything, and your first thought was:  I need to get back to help my community.   You heroes were the first responders who worked around the clock.  Beaumont, alone, received 12,022 911 calls. Let that sink in. That's  one city, 12,000 911 calls.   Well, we are going to have more meetings. We are going to be meeting  with city officials, State officials. We will be meeting with Houston  Mayor Sylvester Turner, who, by the way, tomorrow is his birthday. We  want to thank Mayor Sylvester Turner, County Judge Ed Emmett, County  Judge Matt Sebesta, County Judge Mark Henry, all great heroes.   God bless our heroes. God bless Texas, our great Nation, and all of  those who went beyond and above.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
