 Madam Speaker, in 2006, Congress authorized the  Department of Homeland Security to regulate security practices at  chemical facilities to reduce the risk of terrorists triggering an  intentional release or stealing chemicals for use in an attack  elsewhere.   CFATS, as it is known, requires certain facilities, whose possession  of chemicals above certain levels present high levels of security risk,  to assess their vulnerabilities and implement security measures to  minimize terrorism risks posed by these vulnerabilities.    On July 27, this Thursday, the statutory authority for the CFATS  program  [[Page H3933]]  is scheduled to sunset. As I said previously at a Homeland Security  markup of this legislation, I will support this legislation to cleanly  extend the program for an additional 2 years, but I am disappointed  that it is such a short authorization period.   Companies of all sizes invest millions of dollars into CFATS  compliance, and they deserve the certainty of knowing what the long- term standards for compliance will be as they look to reinvest money  into technologies and infrastructure.   It is important to note that these facilities fall under a variety of  sectors critical to our communities, including energy and utilities,  food production, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, laboratories, and  more.   I will support this legislation today to cleanly extend the program,  but I hope that this body can work towards a long-term reauthorization  in the future. It is clear that the threats that gave rise to CFATS  persist today, and we must take these threats seriously.   In addition, it is also important to note that industry is asking for  this authorization, which is unlike some of the other regulatory  overreach that we see from the administration today. What we are  talking about is industry asking to work with government.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4470.
