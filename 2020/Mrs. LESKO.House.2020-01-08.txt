 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scanlon for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 535, the bill before us today, lays out an  aggressive, antiscience regulatory framework for addressing  perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS,  under several environmental statutes, including the Safe Drinking Water  Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act, also known as CERCLA; the Clean Air Act; and the Toxic  Substances Control Act.   This is an unprecedented way of conducting science, counteracting  decades of U.S. environmental policy and likely compromising public  safety, public health, environmental protection, and national defense  efforts.   This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to  designate all perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemical compounds as  hazardous substances within 1 year of enactment of this bill. Since the  enactment of CERCLA, Congress has never--let me repeat, never-- statutorily mandated a substance's designation. That designation shall  be left to the regulatory process, allowing for notice, public input,  and scientific review and analysis.   Designation as a hazardous substance under CERCLA triggers a wide  variety of notifications and response actions. For example, a release  of the designated hazardous substance chemical may require the polluter  to notify the entire populace in the area and/or government entities  and may trigger cleanup/abatement requirements.   Small communities are not going to be able to afford it. It also  attaches strict and retroactive liability without a liability shield  for innocent parties that acted according to the law.   Not only does this bill mandate the designation of the entire class  of PFAS chemicals as hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act,  but it also designates the entire PFAS class under CERCLA. That kind of  designation under CERCLA, coupled with the other features of this bill,  would amount to a de facto ban of all PFAS, including the many  lifesaving products that incorporate PFAS.   However, I don't hear my Democratic colleagues here talking about the  PFAS chemicals that are helping people. For instance, the type of PFAS  used in the device in this poster next to me is made by Gore of Gore- Tex fame. The device plugs a hole in a baby's heart. Again, these  devices help save the lives of babies born with holes in their hearts.  If EPA is forced to designate the entire class of PFAS as hazardous  material, think about how many parents will have to think twice and may  suddenly feel conflicted in giving their babies lifesaving surgery  using devices like this or similar medical devices.   We cannot classify an entire class as hazardous when, in fact, there  are only some bad actors.   Gore's medical products division is centered in Flagstaff, Arizona. I  represent Arizona, and they have a campus in north Phoenix, which is in  my district. This campus has about 700 employees making medical  products. As a whole, Gore has approximately 2,300 employees in Arizona  engaged in the research, development, and manufacturing of medical  devices.   I had the opportunity to tour Gore and its medical products division,  where I got to see firsthand the creative, innovative, and technology- driven solutions they are cultivating to help cure medical conditions  for Americans. These are FDA- and scientifically approved medical  devices, yet this bill threatens them and threatens the American  people. However, H.R. 535, as amended, mandates multiple aggressive  actions based on a woefully incomplete scientific understanding of  health effects for this diverse class of more than 5,000 chemical  compounds.   We know that PFAS are chemicals used in numerous consumer products  and industrial processes. They are resistant to heat, oils, stains,  grease, and water. Those properties make them important to many  products and processes in commerce, such as firefighting foam,  cellphones, medical devices, Kevlar, semiconductors, solar panels, and  chlorine, and even in our own Department of Defense, including F-16s.   I have Luke Air Force Base in my district. They have trained F-16  pilots for years. Now, they are switching over the F-35s, but they  still train F-16s. This is important to our national defense.   The class of PFAS chemicals numbers more than 5,000. Of those, only  about 29 have developed scientific data and methods. That is 29 out of  5,000.   PFAS are a diverse family of chemicals, which includes a broad range  of substances with different physical, chemical, and toxicological  properties and uses. Hence, the hazard and risk profile of various PFAS  are very different.                                time  1230    It is neither scientifically accurate nor appropriate to group all  PFAS together or take a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach for this  wide range of substances.   We all want to ensure American citizens are not exposed to dangerous  chemicals. We want to do it sooner rather than later. However, my  Republican colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and  many integral stakeholders have grave doubts that the Comprehensive  Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly, known  as CERCLA, is the magic bullet for this problem. In fact, it may create  more problems than meet the eye.   This is why numerous letters have been sent to Members of Congress  from relevant stakeholders to urge Congress to oppose provisions that  would circumvent existing, well-established regulatory processes,  predetermine outcomes using inadequate scientific data, and potentially  inhibit effective cleanup of those PFAS that are of the greatest  concern.   Some of these stakeholders, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  Airlines for America, Airports Council International--North America,  American Chemistry Council, American Fuel and Petrochemical  Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, National Association of  Manufacturers, and more, are the folks dealing with the repercussions  of what we do here in this Chamber. They are the ones representing  hundreds of thousands of jobs  [[Page H25]]  in all 50 States; yet, here we are telling the people who deal with  these issues daily that, no, we don't care what they think. We are  going to move ahead with a partisan and controversial alternative. We  will cost thousands of Americans their jobs in a rush process instead  of working together to do something meaningful.   The bill before us today creates an unrealistic condition that EPA  must require manufacturers and processors to test each chemical in the  entire PFAS class. This testing requirement applies to each of the  5,000 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a task that will be  enormously expensive and time consuming.   I agree, we need to prevent environmental contamination by these  substances. That is why we have. We have recently made huge steps and  taken big actions.   Just last month, we passed the fiscal 2020 National Defense  Authorization Act and various spending bills, where several PFAS  provisions were enacted into law. The laws we passed together on a  bipartisan basis will start making a difference in communities  immediately.   They required substantial reporting and public disclosures, created  grants for drinking water treatment, authorized PFAS research and  detection programs, phased out PFAS in firefighting foam used by the  Department of Defense, and required cooperative cleanup agreements  between the Department of Defense and States for Department of Defense  facilities with PFAS contamination.   The bill signed into law reflected a bicameral compromise and omitted  language from the House's version, H.R. 2500, that would have required  the EPA to designate PFAS as hazardous substances.   We need, here, a consistent and credible approach to regulating these  chemicals that leverages existing frameworks to access the potential  risks associated with PFAS. Our actions should be based on existing  administrative procedures and sound science.   However, last night, when we were reviewing this bill in the Rules  Committee, of which I am a member, I heard numerous times from my  Democratic colleagues that they do not trust the EPA, that they do not  trust their workforce, apparently.   This baffles me. In fiscal year 2019, the EPA employed 14,172  individuals. These thousands of individuals go to work each and every  day to work for EPA's mission. The mission of the EPA is to protect  human health and the environment.   EPA has developed a PFAS Action Plan to address PFAS issues across  multiple environmental mediums. As part of the plan, the Agency, among  other things, has issued interim recommendations for addressing  groundwater contaminated with PFOA and PFOS under Federal cleanup  programs, sent to the Office of Management and Budget for interagency  review a proposed drinking water regulatory determination for PFOA and  PFOS, and is working through the regulatory development process for  listing the PFOA and PFOS as ``hazardous substances'' under CERCLA.  Clearly, action is happening.   However, we need to be working together more. To quote the National  Association of Manufacturers: ``Congressional action should enable and  encourage the appropriate agencies to carry out the risk-based approach  established in existing U.S. environmental law and policy. Congress  should prioritize the cleanup of contaminated sites to protect  communities. Congress should also provide oversight to ensure a  coordinated and timely government response and appropriate the funding  necessary to support sound scientific research and the management,  mitigation, and ongoing monitoring of specific PFAS''--not all PFAS.   However, this bill cannot pass the Senate and cannot become law--and  my Democratic colleagues know that--while the bipartisan Senate-passed  language, as included in the Senate version of the NDAA, could be  signed into law.   The Republican-supported substitute amendment that was introduced in  committee markup consisted of the Senate-passed language on PFAS. It  would still require the EPA to issue regulations covering PFAS, require  the EPA to issue drinking water regulations covering PFAS, and require  the EPA to use appropriate science in issuing these regulations. It  would eliminate the CERCLA/Superfund provisions contained in this bill  because the Senate will not pass them.   Why can we not pass something that could help improve countless lives  and that we know that the Senate will take on and pass?   We should be promoting a consistent, comprehensive approach for  assessing and regulating specific PFAS that takes into account existing  regulatory frameworks. If Congress acts in this area, it should utilize  these frameworks to ensure consistent, science-based regulatory  approaches, transparency, broad stakeholder input, and enforceable  regulations. That is the way we can get something meaningfully passed  through both Chambers and signed into law.    We need to pass a bill that would encourage innovation and production  of new chemicals to replace existing chemicals in commerce, not  disincentivize it, which this bill does.   We need to ensure our constituents are not exposed to dangerous  chemicals.   We need to do our constitutional role in overseeing Federal agencies;  however, we should not be doing so in a way that would make regulation  impractical, eliminate the use of medical-saving devices, or tie the  hands of the Department of Defense.   So let's work together. Let's make some progress that could actually  pass both Chambers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to consider an amendment offered by my colleague, Representative  Shimkus,  [[Page H28]]  that was not made in order. The alternative could actually pass the  Senate and could, therefore, become law and help people.   Isn't that our goal?   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment strikes section 2 through  section 18 of the bill and replaces it with a provision mandating the  cleanup of PFOA and PFOS contamination at Department of Defense  facilities, section 2, and a provision mandating that EPA establish  national primary drinking water regulations for PFOA and PFOS within 2  years, as well as expedite the setting of such regulations for other  PFAS chemicals, section 3.   H.R. 535 requires aggressive regulatory responses to the diverse  class of PFAS chemicals with little regard to science or risk  assessment. This is an unprecedented way of conducting science,  counteracting decades of U.S. environmental policy, and likely  compromising public safety, public health, and environmental  protection.   This alternative that I am proposing simply takes away some of the  more problematic provisions and gives H.R. 535 a plausible way to  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I emphasize to my friends across the aisle that we should  be bringing legislation to this floor that showcases how we can work  together and how we can protect the public from scientifically proven  unsafe chemicals. However, this package does not.   I hope my colleagues will come to the table and work with the entire  Chamber so we can do more on this important issue, so we can actually  have a bill that could be signed into law, and so we can truly help  Americans.   If my Democratic colleagues truly want to save lives and protect the  public, they will stop pushing through partisan bills like this one  that they know will not be heard in the Senate and, instead, actually  work with Republicans on reasonable legislation to get something done  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
