 Mr. Speaker, I know I, and many of my colleagues, share  concern about a Federal regulatory code that has become so bloated with  redundant, ineffective, and unnecessary rules that the sheer bulk of it  threatens to suffocate American economic recovery and long-term  prosperity.   The Bureau of Land Management's rule to reduce venting and flaring  from existing oil and natural gas operations is one such example of  duplicative and unnecessary regulation. Aside from the fact that the  authority to regulate air quality does not rest with the BLM, we  certainly don't need the BLM rule in addition to the EPA methane rule  and State regulations, which our colleagues on the other side have  noted and lauded that have come out of the State of Colorado.   For all of the costs this rule would impose on industry, the supposed  benefits of the rule would be emission reductions in the neighborhood  of less than one one-hundredth of a percent of global greenhouse  emissions. That is the definition of an ineffectual rule.   Methane is a marketable resource, and the oil and gas industry would  prefer to economically capture and sell that resource, rather than vent  or flare it, which is a necessary safety procedure in the absence of  other viable options.   Instead of using its authority to take actions that would effectively  facilitate capture versus venting or flaring, like processing pipeline  right-of-way permits in a timely manner, the agency has once again  issued a rule that unnecessarily burdens energy development.   There are cost-effective strategies available that will achieve  emission reductions, and it is those strategies that we should focus  our efforts on, rather than duplicative regulations.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
