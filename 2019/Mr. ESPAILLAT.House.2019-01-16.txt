 Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment and  want to thank Ms. Jayapal for allowing me time to speak in support.   As she outlined, this amendment would restrict the Department of  Homeland Security from using any emergency funds from being  reprogrammed to add beds at immigration detention centers.   Last year, during the historic hurricane season that ravaged Puerto  Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and parts of Texas, the White House  brazenly shifted millions of dollars slated for recovery to Immigration  and Customs Enforcement in order to fund the immoral detention of  refugees and other immigrants as part of its horrible zero tolerance  policy.   Throughout the Gulf Coast, but especially in Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.  Businesses must reopen, power infrastructure needs to be restored and  made more resilient, and communities must be rebuilt, yet President  Trump is threatening to declare a phony national emergency so he can  take these critical funds and put them toward a useless, medieval wall  and other components of his cruel immigration policies.   I am happy to support this amendment, Madam Chair.
