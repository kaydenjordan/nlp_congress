 Mr. President, today I have introduced the Encouraging  Americans to Save Act (EASA). This legislation makes common sense  reforms to the saver's tax credit by making the credit refundable and  restructuring it as a government matching contribution that is directly  deposited into a worker's retirement savings account. This bill would  offer matching contributions for the first time to millions of middle  and lower income individuals not covered by an employer-sponsored  retirement plan, including those who save through an IRA under a State  or local government savings program--such as OregonSaves. The  government match is also available to middle and lower income savers  who participate in an employer-sponsored plan. The government match  provided by the bill would both encourage saving and help middle and  low income earners build assets by providing an immediate, meaningful  return on their personal contributions. The legislation would also  require the Treasury Department to reestablish the Obama  administration's MyRA program, as IRAs established under that program  would serve as the default account to hold government matching  contributions in case a saver's retirement plan or IRA is unable to  accept the government  [[Page S7054]]  matching contribution. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN:   S. 3637. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch  Act to establish a program for the procurement of domestically grown  unprocessed fruits and vegetables to provide healthier school meals,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Local School  Foods Expansion Act to establish a permanent program that will provide  schools with locally-grown, unprocessed fruits and vegetables.   Hunger is a huge problem in Oregon, and this pain has a huge impact  in schools. In Oregon, one in four children experience food insecurity  and they face a great challenge keeping up with learning on empty  stomachs. I have supported Federal school lunch programs for many  years, and I strongly believe that the best programs rely on local  producers and make an effort to ensure lunches are healthy and  nutritious.   The Local School Foods Expansion Act is a common sense approach to  child nutrition that empowers children while strengthening the local  economy and contributing to vibrant communities. The bill amends the  National School Lunch Program to make permanent a program that  increases opportunities for lunch programs to procure locally-grown,  unprocessed fruits and vegetables. The bill directs the Secretary of  Agriculture to expand the very successful pilot procurement programs to  at least 15 States, and contains a mandatory appropriation of nine  million dollars in each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023.   No child should be hungry in school, and it's critical that their  meals contain nutritious fruits and vegetables. At the same time, we  must work to maintain domestic production of fruits and vegetables by  ensuring that hardworking farmers have a fair and reliable market for  their produce. The Local School Foods Expansion Act tackles both  objectives by providing hungry kids with local, unprocessed fruits and  vegetables.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record as follows:                                  S. 3637         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
