 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 76.   We all want to make sure that America's students get the education  they deserve in the college they pay for that education or the higher  education institution. By advancing this legislation today, the  majority of this Chamber seeks to turn back the clock on borrower  defense, leading to dangerous consequences for students, those repaying  their loans, and the American taxpayer.   The Obama-era rule, which the majority seeks to return us to, was  marked by regulatory chaos, excessive punishments, and ridiculous  costs. The Obama rule had no clarity and sought to forgive student  loans on a massive scale, regardless of the cost to the taxpayers.    Estimates put the total cost of the loan forgiveness giveaway at $40  billion. It also excessively punished schools with harsh penalties,  sometimes leading to their closure, ending access to another avenue for  higher education for some current and prospective students. That is why  the 2019 Trump administration issued the new Borrower Defense  Institutional Accountability rule.   The new rule currently in effect provides:   Regulatory clarity for all institutions;   Affords due process to both students and institutions;   Narrowly tailors relief to actual harm;   Holds all institutions accountable for misrepresentation;   Provides students with more options to continue their education  should their school close; and   Allows for faster relief by allowing institution-level arbitration.   Importantly, the 2019 rule is estimated to save taxpayers $11 billion  from the 2016 Obama rule.   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot afford to return to the outdated,  costly, and confusing Obama-era rule the majority seeks to return to  effect today.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, 47 years ago, the Supreme Court of the  United States incorrectly decided Roe v. Wade. Since then, the rights  of States to determine whether or not they will provide unborn children  the same right to life and liberty as those outside the womb has been  eliminated.   Since then, 61 million American children have been killed without a  say and without due process. Since then, the Supreme Court has  effectively tied the hands of those with compassion by depriving States  the ability to protect life.   Justice Antonin Scalia, in his dissent in Planned Parenthood of  Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, saw the harm in this, saying: ``By  foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue  arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all  participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and  an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule  instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs  and intensifies the anguish.''   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree with the late Justice Scalia more.                            ____________________
