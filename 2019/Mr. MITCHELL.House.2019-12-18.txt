 Madam Speaker, today, the House of Representatives  votes on two Articles of Impeachment for President Trump.   Members, and all Americans, must recognize that impeachment was  intended to be a safety valve, rarely used, only when a President acts  in such an immoral and blatantly unlawful manner as to threaten the  very basis of our Republic.   As we cast votes on these articles, the future tone of this House and  politics in this Nation must be carefully considered. The issue is not  whether we agree with or like the President's rhetoric, political  tactics, use of Twitter, policy choices, or his political rallies. One  of our Founders, Alexander Hamilton, warned of the risks of impeachment  becoming a solely partisan act in the Federalist Papers.   This impeachment inquiry and these articles clearly do not heed that  warning. These proceedings are weaponizing impeachment, making it  another election tool.   I have carefully examined the evidence presented throughout the  inquiry and, contrary to some, considered our history, our founding  documents, and our future. It is clear, President Trump's actions, as  described in these articles, do not constitute treason, bribery, or  high crimes and misdemeanors. You simply don't like him.   I will be voting ``no'' on these articles and will hope, someday, we  return to serving the needs of the American people.                                time  1345
