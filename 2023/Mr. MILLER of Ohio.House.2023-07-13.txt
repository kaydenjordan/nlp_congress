 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work  of the Ohio Narcotics Intelligence Center, or ONIC. I had the pleasure  of meeting their team to learn about how their research and advocacy is  creating a safer Ohio.   ONIC's team of criminal intelligence analysts and computer forensic  specialists assist law enforcement agencies and drug task forces. They  provide educational outreach on dangerous counterfeit prescriptions,  fentanyl, and cryptocurrency scams. Additionally, ONIC works with  community organizations like RecoveryOhio on programs for law  enforcement to comprehensibly combat the narcotic crisis.   Recently, ONIC hosted a Law Enforcement Drug Summit where criminal  justice professionals learned about drug trends and reduction  strategies. Furthermore, this month they will host their inaugural  BRIDGE Day to make connections from law enforcement to prevention,  treatment, and recovery centers in all 88 Ohio counties.   ONIC's programs provide invaluable support and education to the brave  men and women in law enforcement who lay down their lives to keep our  communities safe. I am thankful for their work addressing the narcotics  epidemic and look forward to continued partnership as we work toward a  safer northeast Ohio.                            ____________________
