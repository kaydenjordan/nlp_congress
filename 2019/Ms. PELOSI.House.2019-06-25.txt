 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  [[Page H5151]]    Madam Speaker, let me first salute Chairwoman Nita Lowey,  Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and  all of the appropriators--also the ranking member--for their relentless  good-faith work on a strong bill that protects vulnerable children,  keeps America safe, and honors our values.   Madam Speaker, when people ask me, what are the three most important  issues facing the Congress? I always say the same thing: children,  children, children.   Today, we have the opportunity to help the children. We are ensuring  that children have food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical  care. We are providing access to legal assistance. And we are  protecting families because families belong together.   Right now, children need their families. Right now, little children  are enduring trauma and terror. Many are living in squalor at Border  Patrol stations. Some are sleeping on the cold ground without warm  blankets or hot meals. Kids as young as 7 and 8 years old are watching  over infants because there is no one else there to care for them.   As one little girl caring for two infants said, I need comfort, too.  I am bigger than they are, but I am a child, too.   Today, we found out that the administration is sending children back  to a station in Clint, Texas, from where, just days earlier, those  children had been removed after enduring weeks without a shower or a  change of clothes. When visiting these children, one lawyer reported,  the children are locked in their cells. They said they can't bring  themselves to play because they are trying to stay alive in there.   And yet, last week, the Trump Department of Justice argued in court  that the government should not have to provide children in custody with  soap, toothbrushes, or beds.   This situation is child abuse. It is an atrocity that violates every  value we have, not only as Americans, but as moral beings. Today,  sadly, our values are being undermined by the President's failed  policies which has intensified the situation of heartbreak and horror  on the border, which challenges the conscience of America.   Today, our legislation is a vote against the cruel attitude toward  children of this administration. This bill does not fund the  administration's failed mass detention policy. Instead, it funds  effective, humane alternatives to detention that have a proven record  of success. This legislation secures limits on how the money is spent  and how the administration treats children. And it creates strong  oversight by Congress so that we can protect children and ensure this  crisis never occurs again.   This legislation also helps address the root causes of this  situation. It reverses the administration's senseless decision to block  the humanitarian funding that Congress had already appropriated for the  Northern Triangle countries, where many of these refugees are coming  from. And it ensures that the funding is used by these countries to  curb migration, improve border security, and prevent human smuggling  and drug trafficking, in addition to combating corruption, reducing  poverty, and promoting growth. That is what the agenda is about.   A recent trip by some of our colleagues, led by Chairman Eliot Engel,  Chairman Jerry Nadler, and other Members to the Northern Triangle, saw  the effective use of those funds. And while they were there, exercising  oversight and seeing the effective use of those funds, at that very  moment, the President reversed the policy.   We are launching a $200 million pilot initiative to improve the  Customs and Border Protection's processing system, based on a proposal  from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.   The evangelical community, Madam Speaker, a while back when there was  another Muslim ban, we were not in the majority, but we did have a  hearing where many people came. National security experts, diplomats,  everyone came. People of faith-based organizations came to object to  the President's Muslim ban. And, at that time, representatives of the  evangelical community of America--this is not an individual, but a  representative of the evangelicals in America--stated that America's  refugee resettlement program is the crown jewel of America's  humanitarianism.   We must protect and strengthen this pillar of our immigration system  and our democracy. Families belong together. And as we face the  challenges presented by the President's policy, we must help immigrants  know their rights. Immigrants must know their rights. Families belong  together.   Every Member of this body has a sacred moral obligation to protect  the human rights and the lives of vulnerable families, no matter who  they are and from where they came. They all are God's children. They  have a spark of divinity within them that we must respect. And we must  remember our own spark of divinity as we view these children and our  responsibilities to them.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote for the children, the  children, the children.                                time  1945
