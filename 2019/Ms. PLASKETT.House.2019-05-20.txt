 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to co-anchor the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. For the  next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American  people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans.   Tonight, we will discuss and honor the legacy of Judge Damon J. Keith  from Detroit, Michigan, and discuss, as well, this administration's,  President Trump's, recent attempts to roll back safety net programs.   Damon Keith, a Federal judge in the Midwest whose rulings championed  equality and civil rights, notably in a landmark Supreme Court decision  striking down Nixon administration wiretapping in domestic security  cases without a court order, died April 28 of this year in Detroit,  Michigan. He was 96 years old.   In one of the Federal judiciary's longest and most prolific careers,  Judge Keith was a fountainhead of regional rulings with national  implications. He attacked racial segregation in education, housing, and  employment; conservative efforts to limit African American voting; and  after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, secret hearings to  deport hundreds of immigrants deemed suspicious.   Judge Keith's tenure spanned more than a half century, first as  President Lyndon B. Johnson's choice for a district court judgeship in  Detroit, with jurisdiction in eastern Michigan, and then as President  Jimmy Carter's selection for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals,  presiding in Cincinnati over cases arising in Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan,  and Tennessee.   In a blistering 2016 dissent in an Ohio case that restricted early  and absentee voting, Judge Keith, even in the later years, worked  tirelessly and accused two circuit court colleagues of scorning African  American voters and the memory of Black people slain in the struggle  for voting rights.   In a, frankly, emotional rebuke, he incorporated into his opinion  photographs and biographies of 36 such victims, including the Reverend  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ``By denying the most vulnerable the right  to vote, the majority shuts minorities out of our political process. .  . . The unfettered right to vote is the bedrock of a free and  democratic society. Without it, such a society cannot stand.''   One of America's oldest Federal jurists, Mr. Keith served in the  segregated Army in World War II, cleaned bathrooms at the Detroit News,  attended historically Black undergraduate and law schools, and  witnessed deadly riots in Detroit in 1967.                                time  1945    My colleagues are here with me today to discuss his legacy and the  work of Judge Keith, not just for African Americans, but for the  American people.   I am happy to be coanchored in the CBC Special Order by my friend and  colleague from Nevada,   Steven Horsford.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams), my colleague.    I yield to the gentleman from Nevada.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), the Congressman and my good friend, whom I have the honor  to serve with on the Ways and Means Committee. He is fighting for the  people of his district in Philadelphia.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from  Philadelphia who always stands  [[Page H4001]]  up for the rights of the working class of those in cities and elsewhere  who are struggling, the working poor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him so much for the work he is doing and for  trying to maintain working neighborhoods in our many cities that are,  through so much of these rule changes, so much of these executive  orders, the ones who are being most affected.                                time  2000    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  who is from the city of Newark, New Jersey, our good friend, my good  friend, and champion as well, of those in the urban areas, as well as  to others. He has recently taken on issues related to healthcare.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, you can see we have had a lively  discussion in recognition of Federal Judge Damon Keith. I would like  include in the Record an article on his obituary from The New York  Times dated April 28 of 2019.                 [From the New York Times, April 28, 2019]     Damon Keith, Federal Judge Who Championed Civil Rights, Dies at 96                          (By Robert D. McFadden)         Damon Keith, a federal judge in the Midwest whose rulings       championed equality and civil rights, notably in a landmark       Supreme Court decision striking down Nixon administration       wiretapping in domestic security cases without a court order,       died on Sunday in Detroit. He was 96.        His death was confirmed by his daughter, Debbie Keith.        In one of the federal judiciary's longest and most prolific       careers, Judge Keith, a Democrat, was a fountainhead of       regional rulings with national implications. He attacked       racial segregation in education, housing and employment;       conservative efforts to limit African-American voting; and,       after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, secret       hearings to deport hundreds of immigrants deemed suspicious.        Judge Keith's tenure spanned more than a half-century,       first as President Lyndon B. Johnson's choice for a district       court judgeship in Detroit, with jurisdiction in Eastern       Michigan (1967-1977), then as President Jimmy Carter's       selection for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, presiding       in Cincinnati over cases arising in Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan       and Tennessee.        In a blistering 2016 dissent in an Ohio case that       restricted early and absentee voting, Judge Keith accused two       Circuit Court colleagues of scorning African-American voters       and the memory of black people slain in the struggle for       voting rights. In a frankly emotional rebuke, he incorporated       into his opinion photographs and biographies of 36 such       victims, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.        ``By denying the most vulnerable the right to vote, the       majority shuts minorities out of our political process,'' he       wrote. ``The unfettered right to vote is the bedrock of a       free and democratic society. Without it, such a society       cannot stand.''        One of America's oldest federal jurists, Mr. Keith served       in the segregated Army in World War II, cleaned bathrooms at       The Detroit News, attended historically black undergraduate       and law schools and witnessed deadly riots in Detroit in       1967.        In the most prominent case of his tenure, Judge Keith       ordered the Nixon Justice Department in 1971 to halt       wiretapping without court orders in its zeal to prosecute       radicals accused of conspiring to bomb a Central Intelligence       Agency office in Ann Arbor, Mich.  [[Page H4002]]       As grounds, he cited the Constitution's Fourth Amendment       freedoms from ``unreasonable searches and seizures.''        After the Sixth Circuit Court upheld Judge Keith's       decision, the Nixon administration appealed to the Supreme       Court. At stake, potentially, were warrantless wiretaps in       many prosecutions that Attorney General John N. Mitchell had       brought against antiwar activists and other opponents of       administration policies.        The high court, by 8-0, rejected the government's claim of       constitutional authority to protect the nation from internal       subversion by wiretapping ``dangerous'' radicals without       court warrants. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who wrote the       opinion, leaned heavily on the threat to free speech that he       saw in the unbridled government wiretapping of dissenters.        The American Civil Liberties Union said: ``If this claim       had been upheld, there would have been virtually no limits to       the range of governmental intrusion on the liberty that would       have been implicitly authorized once the government invoked       the talisman of `national security.' ''        In another case, the Supreme Court declined to review Judge       Keith's order to bus 8,700 of 23,000 students to desegregate       public schools in Pontiac, Mich. His 1971 order, one of the       first of its kind in the North, led to extensive busing,       attacks on school buses, death threats against the judge and       the convictions of Ku Klux Klansmen for dynamiting 10 school       buses.        But five years after Pontiac's busing began, The New York       Times reported that bitter feelings that had all but       paralyzed the school district had faded, and that busing had       become a fact of life. ``Both blacks and whites are learning       to understand each other better, to fear and distrust each       other less, and to see individuals as individuals,'' the       report said.        In 1973, a year before Nixon resigned in the Watergate       scandal, Judge Keith ordered the government to disclose       whether it had used sabotage, agents provocateurs and ``other       espionage activities,'' including a burglary at a law office,       to make its case against militants known as the Weathermen.       They were accused of plotting a campaign of bombing and       terrorism.        Later, government lawyers appeared in Judge Keith's court       and withdrew their case against the Weathermen rather than       undergo a hearing on how their evidence had been obtained.       Defense lawyers said the Nixon administration had plotted its       own campaign of domestic intelligence-gathering operations,       including breaking and entering and wiretapping to foster a       ``malicious prosecution.''        In 1979, Judge Keith and the Sixth Circuit upheld the       Detroit Police Department's affirmative action program. A       lieutenants and sergeants group had sued to overturn the       five-year-old program, saying that white officers had been       unjustly passed over for promotion. But Judge Keith wrote       that promotion tests had been slanted against blacks, and       that affirmative action ``undoes years of discrimination.''        And in 2002, the Sixth Circuit Court held that the Bush       administration had violated the First Amendment freedoms of       speech and the press by conducting hundreds of secret       hearings to deport immigrants suspected of ties to terrorism.       Other courts issued contradictory rulings, and the secret       hearings went on for some time. But the case yielded one of       Judge Keith's more memorable opinions.        ``Democracy dies behind closed doors,'' he wrote.        Damon Jerome Keith was born in Detroit on July 4, 1922, the       youngest of six children of Perry and Annie (Williams) Keith,       who had migrated from Georgia. Mr. Keith worked at the Ford       Motor Company's River Rouge plant for $5 a day. Damon and his       siblings, Luther, Perry, Napoleon, Marie and Annie, grew up       in poverty. For a time during the Depression, the family       received welfare assistance.        Mr. Keith graduated from Northwestern High School in 1939.       At West Virginia State College, he waited on tables and       cleaned a chapel and the college president's house to pay his       way. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1943. Drafted into the       wartime Army, he served in Europe in a black unit largely       assigned to kitchen duties. He was discharged as a sergeant       in 1946.        He received his juris doctor in 1949 at the Howard       University Law School, where his mentors included Thurgood       Marshall, the future first black justice of the Supreme       Court, and William Hastie, the nation's first black federal       judge. Mr. Keith received a master of laws degree at Wayne       State University in 1956.        In 1953, he married Rachel Boone, a prominent doctor in       Detroit. She died in 2007. Besides his daughter Debbie,       survivors include two other daughters, Cecile Keith Brown and       Gilda Keith, and two granddaughters.        In 1964, Mr. Keith helped founded one of Detroit's first       African-American law firms and was named co-chairman of the       Michigan Civil Rights Commission. Three years later, he       became a federal judge. He was chief judge for Eastern       Michigan from 1975 to 1977, when he joined the Sixth Circuit       Court. In 1995, he assumed senior status on the appellate       court, with a reduced caseload.        A lifelong Detroit resident, Mr. Keith received some 40       honorary doctorates and was showered with honors, including       the Spingarn Medal of the N.A.A.C.P. and the federal       judiciary's Edward J. Devitt Award.        He was the subject of a 2016 Jesse Nesser documentary,       ``Walk with Me: The Trials of Damon J. Keith.'' One       highlight: When he was 69, one of the nation's most       distinguished jurists and national chairman of a       Williamsburg, Va., judicial conference on the Constitution's       Bicentennial, he stepped outside the hotel during a break--      and was taken for a parking attendant.        ``A white man drove up,'' he told a crowd screening the       film at Howard University, ``and said, `Boy, park my car.' ''     Mr. Speaker, in looking at those things that this  Federal judge fought for while he was alive, I think it is a great  segue into the other discussion that the Congressional Black Caucus has  been engaged in in this hour, and that is poverty. Many of the  communities that this judge was fighting for were poor communities.   Unfortunately, at this day and age, it is still primarily people of  color who disproportionately are affected by poverty. But the Trump  administration is on the verge of making an end run around Congress  now, attempting to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  by fiat.   The latest effort was a proposed rule that would open for public  comments until April 10. This rule would restrict SNAP eligibility by  limiting States' flexibility to help the jobless or underemployed  workers in struggling regions. By the administration's own estimate,  enacting this rule would substantially increase hunger and hardship,  stripping at least 755,000 Americans of food assistance, though other  estimates suggest it could be as much as 1 million individuals and cut  SNAP by $15 billion, slashing more than 178,000 jobs over the coming  decade.   In the last Congress, Republicans and Democrats had a long,  protracted conference on the farm bill, much of it related to SNAP.  Much of it was because of discussions about ensuring that there is a  safety net for those who regularly without it would go hungry.   We see that this administration did not want to take what Congress  ruled on--what the President even signed--and is now, through his own  executive order, attempting to change the law. The administration's  most recent attempt to cut SNAP comes on the heels of President Donald  Trump's failed attempt to achieve similar SNAP cuts in that farm bill;  cuts that Congress rejected on a bipartisan basis.   This proposed rule is not just cruel. It is also bad policy. Making  people hungrier will not help them find work any faster. It will only  kick underemployment and unemployment workers when they are down.   Most working-age SNAP participants who are not receiving disability  benefits are working, but they are often in unstable jobs with volatile  schedules, low wages, making them especially likely to being affected  by the rule.   I want to talk about how this is going to affect rural communities.  In 2010, the U.S. Census found that 22 percent of the population in the  Virgin Islands lives in poverty. Fifty percent of those living under  the poverty level were families led by single mothers. The  Congressional Research Service discovered that on average, children  living in female-headed families were more likely to live in poverty  than children living in two-parent households.   Given that 76 percent of rural adults report that good jobs are  scarce in their area, it is not as if they are not looking. The jobs  are simply not there. Rural communities like mine in the Virgin Islands  will be among the hardest hit by the President's proposed rule, as it  will tie States' hands and remove the flexibility they need to help  residents of high unemployment areas put food on the table.   Indeed, while the urban areas experienced a net gain of 3.6 million  jobs from 2007 to 2015, rural areas lost 400,000 jobs during that same  time, meaning that many rural areas have struggled to recover still  from the Great Recession.   Moreover, rural populations already face additional barriers to work.  For example, lack of access to broadband is impeding the growth of  rural economies, hampering total employment growth, and the opening of  new businesses. Additionally, rural economies have less industrial  diversity than urban areas and, in some communities, in particular, the  departure of a central employer has led to tremendous job loss.  [[Page H4003]]    In the Virgin Islands, one of the world's largest refineries based in  the Virgin Islands on St. Croix shut down in 2012, driving a decrease  in jobs. At the time of the shutdown, the unemployment skyrocketed to  18 percent. In the same year, refined petroleum exports for the U.S.  plummeted by 90 percent.   Given these challenges, States need more flexibility, not less, in  order to decide how best to protect and invest in rural areas, as the  administration's economic policies have not decreased the widening  urban and rural divide. I believe that my coanchor, as well, has  examples how poverty is affecting Americans; not just African  Americans.                                time  2015    The purpose of the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour is  not solely to talk about African Americans but to really champion the  issues of those Americans who do not often have a voice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford) to  discuss this further.    Mr. Speaker, I have to tell the gentleman that his  remarks  [[Page H4004]]  were very enlightening and thoughtful. The logic of this administration  and what they are thinking just does not make sense. In the end, it is  going to cost us more. As you said, how is denying 1 million children  lunch benefiting us as a country?    Mr. Speaker, if you want to be calculating about it,  how is it helpful to us in the long run?   If you don't want to do it out of Christian goodness, out of the  depths of humanity, then think about the long-term ramifications. Think  about what it does to us to have 1 million children not being fed  properly, not being able to think in a classroom, to be able to  function, and to be able to do their work.   What will that do to us 10 years from now?   How many dropouts will there be?   How many young people will be unable to function, to be able to read  and write, and to be able to find a job?   That will cost us, I am sure, entirely more money.    In the last Congress, and again in this one, I am a  member of the Agriculture Committee. I recall that when that farm bill  initially was presented, the ranking member at that time and now the  chair, Collin Peterson, and many of the Democrats were aghast that we  weren't going to have hearings, that there wasn't going to be a markup,  and that there wasn't going to be discussion on the farm bill which  contains essential nutrition programs in there. It wasn't until it got  to the Senate that we were able to have in conference a discussion  about SNAP because the Republicans over here decided that that was not  important. They didn't want to fund it, they didn't want to take care  of children, and they didn't want to take care of families of those  with disabilities and of veterans who rely on SNAP programs, on  supplemental nutrition programs. It wasn't until we got to conference  that that happened.   The President signed the farm bill, and lo and behold, here comes the  boomerang where he is trying to ram this through by executive order and  by proposed rule changes to the law.   People in this law it doesn't just affect, and if you are not  interested in families that are single-parent families, female-run  families, African American families, what about those veterans who are  affected?   What about those with disabilities?   The proposed rule purports to apply only to able-bodied adults  without dependents. But what people are unaware of is that under the  rule, 11 million people with disabilities who receive SNAP assistance  could lose that assistance under the rule as people who face limited  work capacity due to disability or poor health are regularly  misclassified as able-bodied for the purpose of SNAP.                                time  2030    That means those individuals between the ages of 18 and 59 who have  at least one physical, functional, or working limitation and are not  counted as disabled under SNAP may, in fact, be affected. So this is  cutting across so many individuals.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr.  Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, when the gentleman talks about the working  poor, I think about those individuals in the Virgin Islands where we  have limited jobs. Many of these individuals have jobs in government.   You have an individual who is the head of a house, a husband-and-wife  house, making $20,000--three children, a wife--trying to make ends meet  off that kind of salary. They qualify, as we now have it functioning,  for assistance for their family--for Medicaid, in some instances. But  this administration is trying to take that away.   Are they going to take it away from those people who are doing what  they say they are supposed to do? They are out there working as best  they can. They are trying to take care of their families. This Congress  has provided a safety net to them, and now we are going to strip that  away.   This is untenable, and this has to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of Mr. Horsford the timeframe that  individuals have to send a letter to their Member of Congress, to send  a letter to this administration to let them know what their thoughts  are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, I think people don't understand that SNAP  benefits represent $1.40 per person, per meal--$1.40. I can't get a cup  of coffee in Washington, D.C., with $1.40, but that is the benefit we  are giving per person, per meal, for SNAP benefits.  [[Page H4005]]    We should not be talking about cuts to SNAP. We should be talking  about how to increase this benefit to the American people, to American  children, to our elders, to veterans who are relying on this.   Something must be done. As the Congressional Black Caucus, we are  here to raise the alarm.   Raising the Federal minimum wage would save, even if we raised it to  $12 an hour, $53 billion over the next 10 years, nearly four times as  much as the proposed rule, by ensuring that workers earn more so that  they are better able to afford food, instead of punishing labor market  struggles with hunger, as the gentleman said.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford) for  any additional thoughts he may have as we close out this Special Order  hour, and I thank the American people for listening.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
