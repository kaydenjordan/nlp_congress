 Mr. President.    Mr. President, I have a real concern for our economy,  for the future of what is happening right now, and a lot of it wraps  around the vaccine mandates that are being laid down by President  Biden.   On September 9, President Biden had announced: I am losing patience  with the American people, and it is time for you to get vaccinated.   And he laid down a rule on every Federal worker, every Federal  contractor, everyone in the military, and everyone who is in a private  business with 100 employees or more. He created a new mandate.   He literally reached into union shops and changed their collective  bargaining agreement unilaterally and said: The President's going to  add a new feature in your collective bargaining agreement, and it is  going to be that you are going to have a vaccine or you are going to be  fired.   He told every police officer; he told every firefighter; he told  every doctor, every nurse; he told every member of the military, no  matter how many badges they wear or how many decorations they received:  You will be fired if you don't follow my instructions.   It didn't matter if they were frontline workers. It didn't matter if  they laid their lives on the line all of last year. It didn't matter.  He declared to them: You will be fired if you don't follow my  instructions.   He made it very, very clear: If you have already had COVID and  recovered and have natural immunity, I don't care.   If your personal doctor has told you not to--his perspective in what  is coming down is, if the CDC from Washington, DC, says it's OK, it  doesn't matter what your personal doctor says.   While he said you can have a religious accommodation, so far, as I  checked in with the military services, no one has been given a military  or religious accommodation. And across the Federal workforce, I have  yet to hear a soul getting a religious accommodation.   The words are: ``We are going to pay attention to your local  doctor.''   The reality has been totally different. And we have pushed in every  way possible against this administration, and will continue to do that  not because it is unjust, not because, quite frankly, I think the  vaccine is the wrong thing to do--I think it is the right thing to do-- but the mandate is absolutely the wrong thing to do.   Americans have a lot of different reasons to not take a vaccine.  Allow Americans to be Americans.   I have a friend of mine who, by the way, is a liberal Democrat. Yes,  I have liberal Democrat friends. He called me and said his son has had  long-term COVID. Eight months he has been in recovery from COVID. He  does not want to have the vaccine not knowing how his body will react  to that. This week, he will lose his job because the President of the  United States told him he is losing his patience.   That is not right.                           Build Back Better Agenda    Mr. President, on a separate but related subject, we continue to be  able to walk toward a $2 trillion proposal coming down. We hear the  House is taking it up even in the next 24 to 48 hours. Of course, we  heard that over and over again lately.   There has been a real concern about what is happening in the economy  because of rising inflation. Oklahomans are paying $175 more a month  right now for their basic utilities, groceries, and gasoline--$175 more  a month that they are paying because of the rising inflation that has  happened this year.   That inflation, you can take it right back to the middle of March,  when a $2 trillion package was passed in this body on a straight  partisan vote that everyone on this side of the aisle was saying: Don't  do this. This will cause rising inflation.   And it was done anyway.   As simple as I can state it, it was if you add a lot of extra money  and you discourage people from working, you will get fewer products and  more buyers. It is not hard to be able to see what is going to happen  as a result of that.   Larry Summers, who used to be my Democratic colleagues' favorite  economist--he was the National Economic Council director to President  Obama--has been a very outspoken progressive economist. He wrote in  February, challenging this body not to do that $2 trillion package,  saying this:         There is the risk of inflation expectations rising sharply.       Stimulus measures of the magnitude contemplated are steps       into the unknown. For credibility, they need to be       accompanied by clear statements that the consequences will be       monitored closely.    At that same time in February, he said:         Based on the proposal that's out there, there will be an       individual that normally has $22,000 worth of normal income       in a year that will move to $30,000 in benefits for the year,       and that will cause problems.    And, boy, has it. Employment all over the country has had all kinds  of chaotic moments where employers are trying to hire employees and  they are making more on benefits than they are at work, and it has  caused all sorts of chaos across our economy.   It is interesting, several progressive economists in March of this  year, right after the bill passed, made general statements, like: ``A  relief plan is different than a stimulus.''   It doesn't matter. It is not a stimulus. It is a relief plan, so we  can spend as much as we want.   This was my favorite--one of the economists came out and said: ``The  risk of generalized overheating in the goods market appears low . . .  ''   ``The risk of generalized overheating in the goods market appears low  . . . '' That was the statement of the economists in March of this  year.   Yet the reality is, this year, there is a backup at the Port of Long  Beach and people can't get supplies all over the country, and exactly  what was forecast in February and March is occurring in our economy  right now.   Larry Summers again identified it this way. He made the statement:         The pandemic had punched a $20 billion hole in Americans'       monthly wage income [and] Biden [has] proposed filling it       with $100 billion.    He said:         I know the bathtub has been too empty, but one has to think       about what the capacity of the bathtub is and how much water       we're trying to flow into it.    What do I mean by that?   That $2 trillion package that was in March caused all the economic  issues of this year. It has caused all the inflation, all the  challenges in employment across our economy and across our workforce.   It is now being followed up, apparently, by another $2 trillion  proposal that is coming in the coming days. If we had giant inflation  with the last one--by the way, with the highest inflation rate since  1982. If we had that inflation from that $2 trillion package, what is  going to happen when you put another $2 trillion on top of the last $2  trillion in this economy?   The simple fact is, quoting Larry Summers, we don't know what will  happen. We are literally taking ``steps into the unknown.'' But I can  tell you, it is not hard to predict.   That is just the economic issues.   As I look at this package--it is hard to be able to look at the  package that is being proposed. I have heard quite a few folks back in  Oklahoma on the weekend say to me: What all is in this $2 trillion  package that a couple weeks ago was at $3.5 trillion? Now we hear it is  $2 trillion. What actually is in it?   And I smile at them and say: I am not sure yet. I hear bits and  pieces.   To tell you how much it is moving around, last week, when it was  released to the public, it was 2,400 pages. By this morning, it was  1,700 pages. But wait. Now this afternoon, it is 2,000 pages long. That  is in a week. It has moved from 2,400 pages to 1,700 pages, to 2,000  pages, as the proposal continues to be able to change over and over  again.   It is incredibly difficult to be able to track what all is in it, but  we can track some things that are in it.   There is a massive hole that is holding for immigration, as we have  now seen three different major proposals on immigration on how to be  able to give amnesty to the largest number of people. Several have  already been knocked down by the Parliamentarian, but it seems to come  back again just to try  [[Page S7708]]  to find a new way to be able to do amnesty for as many people that are  here illegally present in our country as possible. That seems to be a  piece of this economic proposal that is out there.   We do know in this proposal that it finds as many ways as possible to  be able to fund gaps in Hyde funding.   Now, what is that?   Using Federal dollars to be able to pay for abortions in our  country--an agreement that has been in our country since 1976--that we  have strong disagreements on a child's life.   I happen to believe that a child is a child is a child, and every  child is valuable, no matter how small they are. Many of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle don't believe children are valuable  until they can see them. They have to be born before they are  valuable. I believe there is no difference in a child in the womb than  a child outside the womb other than time.    This bill is full of areas to go around the Hyde rules to start  allowing the funding with Federal dollars to pay for the taking of  human life.   I am disappointed how obsessed my Democrat colleagues seem to be  about finding new ways to pay for the taking of human life of children.  That has not been so, even as recently as 2 years ago.   Quite frankly, Senator Biden was outspoken about protecting the Hyde  protections. Now, President Biden and this body seem to be focused on  how many ways we can increase abortions in America.   There are a lot of energy aspects in this: the new tax on natural  gas, where just 5 or 6 years ago, we called the ``bridge fuel to the  future'' to be able to reduce carbon. Now, natural gas is receiving  punishment in this in brandnew taxes.   There is a block on production from the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge. Some of my Democratic colleagues celebrate, saying: ``We are  going to cut off anything from Alaska and protect that region,'' which  is remarkable to me. We are now buying more oil from Russia than we are  from Alaska, right now--twice as much, in fact, more oil from Russia  than we are from Alaska.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an area 19.3 million square  acres--19.3 million acres. That is about half the size of my home State  of Oklahoma. That is an enormously large area. And in that area, there  are 2,000 acres that would actually be set aside for oil production. So  to put it in perspective, ANWR is half the size of my State of  Oklahoma, and the oil production area that will be needed is a third of  the size of the airport that I fly out of, the Will Rogers airport in  Oklahoma City.   If you took a third of the size of the airport, that is the size of,  actually, the oil production area that will be needed in an area half  the size of my entire State. Yet that is being blocked in this bill.   We will see the price of energy go up, but we will see a new benefit  for electric vehicles that are here. For even very, very wealthy  Americans, they will get a benefit of $12,500 on new luxury vehicles  that they want to be able to purchase, as long as they are electric.   There are direct attacks on the school choice in this bill that  actually goes after any kind of private institution or faith-based  institution. It says that you will get funding for a secular government  school for one level, but if you are in a faith-based school, it is a  different level or none at all.   If you are in a pre-K program or a childcare program--and in many  rural communities all across our State, when you come to Oklahoma, in  many rural communities, the pre-K program and the childcare program is  run from a local church. Oh, but they won't be allowed to be able to be  a provider in this. You have to be a secular provider because religious  institutions are being blocked out by this bill.   It does supersize the IRS, though. It adds $79 billion to the IRS to  increase audits--$79 billion. To give you a perspective of how big that  is, the normal IRS budget for a year is $12 billion. Yet this bill  gives an additional $79 billion to the IRS to be able to increase  audits. And if anyone has a belief those audits are only going to  connect to people that make $400,000 or more, I have a bridge to sell  you.   I have to tell you, as I read through the bill--and it does take some  time, and it is difficult to be able to get through it because it is  changing so much--I am amazed at some of the things that are in it that  have been slipped through this: $350 million are sent to unions to  provide for electronic voting systems for unions--$350 million. There  are $4.28 billion being set aside for training activities in industry  sectors and occupations for climate resilience. There are whole  sections in this bill, as I go through it, that are set aside for  specific areas: $20 million for State, local, and Tribal governments to  mitigate online services to the dot-gov internet domain. To be able to  help cities go to the dot-gov internet domain, there is $20 million  that is set aside.   And there are some set aside for even some of my colleagues who are  here today on the floor: $49 million carve-out for Native Hawaiian  climate resilience programs in the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations.   It depends on the State that you are in and the perspective that you  are in, but as I go through this bill and start identifying the  programs, I hear broad descriptions of different programs, and I hear  all these different sales of what is in it. But when you read through  the bill, when you go through the details of the bill, this is the kind  of stuff that you find.   Oh, by the way, one last piece in this ever-changing bill, just  within the last hour and a half, they have added a new section of the  bill over in the House side. It is a bill dealing with State and local  tax deductions that will help the wealthiest Americans get a bigger tax  cut. Yes, I did say that correctly. Currently, for Americans who are in  high-taxed States, they can only deduct $10,000 of their State and  local taxes, only $10,000 off their State and local taxes that they can  actually deduct from their Federal tax.   The new proposal that just came out in the last hour from the House  of Representatives increases that to $72,500 in deductions off your  State and local taxes. That will be a great tax benefit to the  wealthiest Americans--$72,500.   All that we are asking is, Show us what the real bill is. Let  Americans be able to see the real bill. Have the transparency and the  ability to be able to actually track through what this will mean day to  day, what this will mean to our economy, because we have seen what $2  trillion did to our economy this March--what is another $2 trillion  going to mean on top of all of that coming up this fall?   I think we are walking into the unknown, except this time, I think we  do know what is about to happen to our economy. We need to see this  bill and stop this bill before it damages our economy even more than we  have already been damaged.   I yield the floor.
