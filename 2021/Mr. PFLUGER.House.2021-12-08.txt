 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the horrific  genocide that Communist China is committing against Uyghurs and other  ethnic and religious minorities.   Right now, over one million Uyghurs are enslaved by the People's  Republic of China in the Xinjiang region, where they are subjected to  horrific human rights atrocities like forced sterilization and  abortions, slave labor, and even execution.   Communist China is actively attempting to wipe out an entire people  group, and the United States must not allow it.   A few months ago, I--and other members of the Foreign Affairs  Committee--heard directly from Ms. Tursunay Ziyawudun, a survivor of a  CCP's concentration camp. She told us harrowing stories of the horrific  atrocities she suffered through.   It was absolutely heartbreaking. I cannot imagine my wife or  daughters being subjected to an environment like that.   Today's resolution sends the message directly from the United States  to the Chinese government, that they must immediately end their ongoing  crimes.   I applaud Republican Leader McCaul and Chairman Meeks for their work  to address this heartbreaking atrocity.
