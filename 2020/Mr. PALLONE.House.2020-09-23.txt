 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1129, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4447) to establish an energy storage and microgrid  grant and technical assistance program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and  Innovation Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Clean Economy Jobs and  Innovation Act. This bill is a comprehensive package that will spur  clean energy innovation, electrify our transportation sector, make  homes and businesses more energy efficient, and modernize our electric  grid.   The Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act presents practical and  achievable clean energy policies that are possible for us to achieve  this year. This legislation lays the groundwork for important and  comprehensive future climate policy.   The main goal of this energy package is to move provisions we believe  have a chance at becoming law this Congress after negotiations with the  Senate. Senators Murkowski and Manchin, who lead the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee, have been working on their own energy  package in the Senate.   H.R. 4447 sets new energy efficiency standards for buildings and  funds grants to local communities for more efficient schools, homes,  and municipal buildings. This is an inexpensive way to save energy and  reduce electricity bills for homeowners and businesses, and it has  broad support.   This legislation also supports the development and deployment of  clean, renewable, and distributed resources, like solar and wind  energy, which are crucial to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels.  It also supports the transmission projects needed to move clean energy  around the country.   Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the clean energy sector was booming.  Last year, clean energy jobs grew at twice the rate of overall jobs,  and as of January, more than 3 million Americans were employed in these  jobs. It is critical that the clean energy industry recover this same  momentum to secure America's clean energy leadership.   These investments will result in new, good-paying American jobs all  across the country. Every million dollars invested in clean energy and  energy efficiency produces seven to eight jobs. That is roughly three  times as many as investment in fossil fuels.   The transition to a clean energy future also depends upon upgrading  our transportation infrastructure to support and encourage the adoption  of electric vehicles, or EVs. This legislation invests more than $36  billion to help speed up the electrification of our transportation  sector and make EVs an option for more communities. It also authorizes  funding for clean school buses, electric vehicle charging equipment,  and other zero-emission vehicle programs.   Madam Speaker, this legislation also addresses environmental justice  by establishing and reauthorizing grant programs for impacted  communities to better participate in the environmental decisions in  their backyards. It also increases information sharing so communities  can be better informed about the risks in their neighborhoods. And it  updates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to increase opportunities for  legal relief. This is a critical start to addressing the  disproportionate burden faced by environmental justice communities  around the Nation.   Finally, Madam Speaker, this legislation includes a critical  bipartisan provision that phases out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, a  super pollutant.   It has strong support on both sides of the aisle, including  environmental and public health groups, the entire heating and cooling  industry, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of  Manufacturers. It is one of the most important steps we can take now to  create manufacturing jobs and boost our competitiveness while  protecting our environment.   I close by thanking the Energy Subcommittee Chairman Rush for his  leadership in moving many of the bills included in this package through  the Energy and Commerce Committee, many with strong bipartisan support.  I also thank Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Chairman Grijalva for  their critical contributions to this package and also Representative    Tom O'Halleran for being the bill's lead sponsor.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation that will modernize our energy system, create jobs, and  take positive steps toward addressing the climate crisis.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of             Representatives,                                Washington, DC, September 15, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing you concerning H.R.       4447, the ``Expanding Access to Sustainable Energy Act of       2019,'' which was referred to the Committee on Energy and       Commerce and then to the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology (``Science Committee'') on September 20, 2019.        As a result of our consultation, I agree to work       cooperatively on H.R. 4447 and in order to expedite       consideration of the bill the Science Committee will waive       formal consideration of this legislation. However, this is       not a waiver of any future jurisdictional claims by the       Science Committee over the  [[Page H4866]]       subject matter contained in H.R. 4447 or similar legislation.       I also request that you support my request to name members of       the Science Committee to any conference committee to consider       this legislation.        Additionally, thank you for your assurances to include a       copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the       committee report for H.R. 4447 and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____           Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of             Representatives,                                Washington, DC, September 15, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 4447, the Expanding Access to Sustainable Energy Act of       2019, from further consideration, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 4447 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko), who is the chairman of the Environment and  Climate Change Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the chair of our Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader, who has prioritized this  bill and shepherded it to the floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who chairs the Select Committee on Climate Crisis  and is also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains on each  side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), also a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the Energy and Commerce portion of this debate.   I find it strange, Madam Speaker, that the Republicans pose as the  defenders of fiscal responsibility and lowering the deficit when they  have what I consider a dismal track record on that issue.   In 2017, they rushed through a tax bill that only rewarded the  wealthiest while drowning our children's future in a sea of debt.   What do Republicans do when they create deficits by cutting taxes  without paying for it? They propose cuts to existing programs and  reject funding for initiatives that benefit everyday Americans.   To be clear, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill  would add a whopping zero dollars to the deficit. I stress that again:  zero dollars to the deficit.   But if the Republicans are so intent on talking about costs, they  ought to look at the cost of climate inaction and the economic harm of  letting our competitors lead the global clean energy technology race.  By the end of the century, lost wages from climate-related damages will  reach $155 billion; mortality from extreme temperatures will surpass  $140 billion; and coastal property damage will approach $120 billion.  All told, the U.S. economy could lose more than 10 percent of its GDP.   The economic benefits of action, in contrast, are significant:  limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will yield more than $20  trillion in global economic benefits annually in the same timeframe.   The bill before us lays a strong foundation for reaching these  scientifically set climate targets. Meanwhile, House Republicans are  using tired gimmicks to argue about a deficit they created, a claim the  CBO has thoroughly debunked. If we continue to entertain these tried  and true delay tactics, we are going to lose the global clean energy  race and ensure the worst effects of climate change. We will saddle our  economy and generations to come with the cost of extreme weather and  reduce economic productivity. This is already happening, Madam Speaker.   But if we reduce our carbon pollution and invest in clean energy  technologies, then we can both protect our environment and grow our  economy. We can lead the world in energy innovation and lead our allies  in addressing the climate crisis.                                time  1730    Now, it has been 13 years since Congress last passed major energy  legislation. Since then, the world has changed. Our energy needs have  evolved. Technologies have matured, and the need for climate action has  become urgent. The policies that govern how we produce, transport,  store, and use energy are outdated. Our energy infrastructure is in  desperate need of modernization, and Federal investments in energy- related research, development and deployment aren't meeting the needs  of the 21st century. We need to transition to a clean, low-carbon  economy, and that requires major investments and reforms to U.S. energy  policy.   Madam Speaker, this bill, the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act,  includes a broad suite of measures to enable that transition in a way  that creates jobs, reduces pollution and unleashes American innovation.   The scope of the legislation--I know there have been comments about  the size of the bill--the scope of this bill reflects our commitment to  delivering ambitious and long overdue upgrades to our Nation's energy  system.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, given what we are faced with  today, please, this is why both sides of the aisle should support the  underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
