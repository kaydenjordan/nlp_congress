 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, just 75 days ago today, the Democratic  House passed the Heroes Act. The Heroes Act was a comprehensive and I  think very bold bill that addressed the very real needs that face this  country as we struggle to contain the coronavirus.   During the 75 days that passed, we Democrats pressed the Republican  leadership to take up the Heroes Act in the Senate, and for 75 days, we  have been told no. The point was simple:  [[Page S4566]]  Bring it up, vote for it or against it, amend it if you want, but let's  have some real action.   For 75 days we have watched the virus spread. We saw the death toll  rise as President Trump stood by, denying the severity of the crisis,  attacking the science, and assuring the American public that the virus  would just go away on its own. For 75 days we watched as critical  deadlines bore down on us for programs that offered a lifeline to the  American people, including the expiration of Federal unemployment  benefits and a moratorium on evictions.   This week, on Monday, after 73 days of waiting, Senate Republicans  finally unveiled their proposals to address the coronavirus pandemic,  and even some Republicans have said it is disjointed and in disarray.  One has to ask, what has been done all this time?   Instead of one bill, it is a collection of eight different pieces of  legislation, introduced by eight different Members. Instead of a  cohesive package to address the needs of the American people and to get  the virus under control, their proposals prioritize corporations over  people. They put business interests ahead of society.   It is unclear whether the White House has blessed this package. It is  even less clear whether it has the support of the majority of  Republicans in this body. One thing that is clear: The priorities are  completely misplaced.   My friends on the other side of the aisle seem to think they can fix  our Nation's problems by simply forcing a reopening of the economy,  forcing people back into the workplace, and forcing children back to  school as if the virus isn't still spreading like wildfire. It is a  terrible approach and would make us less safe.   Everybody wants to get the economy on track. We want schools to  reopen, and we want to return to the workplace. But the only way to  accomplish that is to contain the virus, slow the spread. That is the  only thing that will give people the confidence to emerge from their  homes and reengage in society and our economy. To do that, there are  certain things we have to do.   We have to have quick and efficient testing and contact tracing. We  need a vaccine, but we will have to have a way to mass-produce that  vaccine, once we have it, to the people. We need to support unemployed  Americans until we get through this crisis. We need to keep people from  being evicted and losing their homes. We need to create safe working  environments and safe learning environments for our children. Where  children must learn from home with parents working from home, we need  to make investments in the infrastructure they need to be successful.   The Republican bill fails on all these points. It has insufficient  funding for testing and contact tracing. It has insufficient funding  for a mass-vaccine campaign once we have a vaccine. It underfunds  education programs. It uses the money as a stick to force school  districts to open even if the locality and public health agencies say  it is not safe. It fails to provide much needed investment in broadband  and internet access for rural areas to allow for distance learning  where it is needed.   One teacher said to me: If you force us to open, what happens when a  week after it opens, two children and two teachers have COVID-19? The  school closes down for a period of time. Let's be realistic.   There is no increase for SNAP benefits even though more people are  going hungry today in America. There is no new funding for State and  local governments that are laying off teachers and healthcare workers  and first responders as revenues dry up.   The Republican proposal inexplicably cuts Federal unemployment  benefits to millions of workers. They insist this incentivizes people  to go back to work. Where are they going to work? Where are the jobs?  People want to work, but jobs are hard to come by. All this does is  make more people destitute, put people more at risk of not being able  to put food on the table or pay the rent.   To show why this proposal is a nonstarter, let me share a few stories  from Vermonters who have written or called or come into my office as I  have been around Vermont this past weekend.   One man wrote to me because he is concerned he will be evicted from  his home in the next few days. He has been out of work since March,  only able to survive because of the Federal unemployment benefits in  the CARES Act, which in this bill have been callously stripped away.  His wife is taking classes at the local community college in the hopes  of one day getting a better job. In just a few short days, they could  face eviction because they can't afford to make their $750 rent  payment. Instead of inching ever closer to achieving the American  dream, that dream is being snatched away through no fault of their own.  Homelessness is now a real possibility for them.    He writes:         I hope that you and your fellow Senators can find a       solution as soon as possible, because we are all affected by       what happens in the Capitol.    He is right. Whatever is done here affects him and his family and all  other families. What are the solutions being proposed? Unemployment  benefits slashed, no rental assistance, and the expiration of the  eviction moratorium. When is the last time anyone in this room  struggled to make rent? Who are we to tell this man he does not deserve  continued help from his government in the middle of a pandemic?   Another voter contacted me over the fate of her 98-year-old mother.  Since March, her mother and the other residents of her nursing home  have been confined to their rooms, unable to join each other for dinner  and unable to participate in activities. The nursing home staff lack  the necessary personal protective equipment and testing capability. She  has not been able to even hug her own mother since the pandemic  started.   She writes:         We can't just have a single-state or single-country       response to this pandemic. We must all work together to take       action now to support the most vulnerable members of our       society.    I couldn't agree more. We need to work together. We need to protect  the most vulnerable among us. We need to prioritize the most urgent of  needs, but the Republican proposal doesn't do that.   Across our country, children are going hungry because their parents  are out of work and the cost of food is on the rise. The Republican  proposal includes nothing for SNAP and nothing for child nutrition. But  there are multibillion-dollar giveaways to the defense industry.  Republicans say they want 5 years of immunity for large corporations so  they will not be sued if they force their workers back to work if they  get sick, but they have no money in there for the protection of those  workers. They protect the owners of the company who probably don't even  come in the company. They protect them but not the workers in the  company.   They take money to replace money that the White House basically took  away to build a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay. Then, when I saw  this in the proposal, here was $1.7 billion for an FBI building that  was going to be built either in Virginia or Maryland--$1.7 billion to  protect the aging building and prop it up. Why? Because if it were  gone, somebody might build a hotel there. There would be potential  competition with Donald Trump's hotel across the street. They are going  to put $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money in there to protect his hotel  from any competition, but there is no money in it to ensure people can  safely vote in our upcoming elections. What is going on? This is  ``Alice in Wonderland.''   In the absence of a President who takes this virus seriously or is  able to lead this country through the crisis, the American public needs  Congress to step up. The Republican proposal fails to do this. It  leaves people behind and our country and our economy even more  vulnerable.   Let's stop playing partisan games and offering solutions only one  party can get behind. Let's get something we can all get behind. Let's  start bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on a bill that can be sent to  the President by the end of next week. Let's make priorities of those  programs that help us contain this virus and help us protect the  vulnerable families like those I have seen the past several days in  Vermont--a bill that puts us on the right track to reopening our  economy.   Frankly, the American people can't wait any longer. The Vermonters  who call and write into my office and stop me in the street to talk  with me, they are pleading for help. They can't wait  [[Page S4567]]  any longer. And to do nothing--to do nothing is an abdication of our  sworn responsibility to serve our constituents.   But to advance this patchwork series of bills offered by the  Republican majority is worse. It is a disservice to the thousands of  Americans who have died and the millions of Americans who have  contracted this virus and the hundreds of millions of Americans who are  looking to their government to do something so they can have their  country back.   I yield the floor.
