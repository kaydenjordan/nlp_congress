 Mr. President, this coming Sunday, mothers and other  special women who are mother figures and caregivers for our children  across the country will be honored for the important work they do to  nuture the next generation.   Many moms will receive cards and flowers. Some will enjoy breakfast  in bed or dinner out. A few lucky ones might get plaster handprints or  handmade mugs--I love those. These gifts, no matter what they are, will  be treasured because when it comes right down to it, all moms really  want are a couple of things. They want their children to be happy, and  they want their children to be healthy.   Unfortunately, thanks to this administration's continuing attacks on  our healthcare, a lot of mothers can no longer count on that. Just ask  Rachel whose daughter Alice was born in Detroit with a heart condition  called Shone's complex. When Alice was only 1 day old, she had her  first open heart surgery. Think about that. She was 1 day old. Four  years later, she has an artificial heart valve, a love of dancing, and  the biggest grin you have ever seen. She also has what the insurance  companies call a preexisting condition. She will have to take heart  medication for the rest of her life.   Alice's mom, Rachel, writes:         Her hospital stays and medications cost well over a million       dollars--closer to two million. Without the (Affordable Care       Act), our family would be bankrupt, worrying about how to pay       for her life-saving medications.    No mom should have to worry about going bankrupt because her child  was born with a heart condition. It could happen to any of us. No  family should go broke paying for the medication that is keeping their  child alive. Alice deserves better, and Alice's mom deserves better  too.   I have said it before, and I will say it over and over again:  Healthcare is personal. It is not political. We should be working  across the aisle to expand access to care, improve quality, reduce  costs, and we should be doing something to resolve the maternal and  infant mortality crisis that is happening right now in the United  States of America so Mother's Day is a day of joy instead of a day of  sorrow.   Instead, we find ourselves fighting an administration that will not  stop trying to take away the protections that  [[Page S2735]]  people like Alice count on and that thousands, millions across the  country count on. In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice last month  agreed with a Federal judge in Texas who said the entire Affordable  Care Act must be struck down, and that includes coverage for those with  preexisting conditions.   Not to be outdone, the Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution  out of committee that includes repeal of the Affordable Care Act with  no replacement. What would that mean for Michigan families? Our Healthy  Michigan Program that provides healthcare to more than 650,000  Michiganders, gone. Children staying on their parents insurance until  age 26, gone. Lower drug prices for seniors, gone. Protections for  people with preexisting conditions, gone. That would be horrible news  for Alice and every other Michigan child born with a heart condition or  any other health challenge.   So what is the Republican alternative to the ACA? They don't have  one, but don't worry. President Trump says Republicans will unveil a  ``really great'' healthcare plan after the 2020 election--after the  2020 election.   In the meantime, the Affordable Care Act could be struck down in the  courts, with the support of the Trump administration, and Alice and her  mom could really be out of luck.   In honor of Mother's Day, here is what we should be doing together.  We should reaffirm the Affordable Care Act's protections for Alice and  all people with preexisting conditions. We should, once again,  guarantee that every insurance plan covers prenatal and maternity  care--by the way, instead of the junk plans the administration is  approving right now that don't cover prenatal and maternity care. We  should also strengthen healthcare for moms and babies through the  Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, which cover about  half of the births in our country.   A few years ago, the Finance Committee reported out a bipartisan bill  that I led with Senator Grassley. It was called the Quality Care for  Moms and Babies Act. This bill would create a set of maternal and  infant quality care measures in the Children's Health Insurance Program  and Medicaid. The goal is simple: improving maternal and infant health  outcomes.   It is amazing that we don't have uniform quality health standards  across the country. The Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act will help  make sure that every mom gets the best pregnancy care possible and  every baby gets a healthy start. That is what we should be passing.   In America today, that is, unfortunately, not the case. Our maternal  mortality rate is climbing. African-American women are three times more  likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than are other American  women, and our infant mortality rate ranks a shameful 32 among the  world's 35 wealthiest nations--32 out of 35 in our great country.   We need to change this so more moms and their children will enjoy a  happy Mother's Day. Moms like Rachel shouldn't be spending their  Mother's Day worrying about what will happen to their children if the  Republicans succeed in undoing the Affordable Care Act.   In thinking back on Alice's diagnosis, Rachel said:         I cannot express how stressful and gut-wrenching a time       this was for my family. I am thankful every day for the       Affordable Care Act.    Moms deserve more than flowers and a card. They deserve the peace of  mind that comes from knowing their children are born as healthy as  possible and will have the healthcare coverage they need. Our moms gave  us life. This Mother's Day, let's pay it forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
