 Mr. Speaker, last week, I hid in an office for hours,  terrified to open the door because I did not know if a rioter was on  the other side ready to attack, kidnap, or murder me. But my  experiences were just the tip of the iceberg. The U.S. Capitol was  targeted, besieged, and ransacked on January 6 by a murderous mob  holding a noose for Vice President Pence and targeting Speaker Pelosi.  Their rampage resulted in destruction and five people dead.   We were attacked by terrorists, but this time the terrorists were  radicalized right here in the United States. Worse, they were  radicalized by the President, who intentionally lied to his supporters  that the election was stolen and then told them when to come to D.C.,  where to protest, and whom to direct their anger at.   The need to remove this President could not be more urgent. He is too  dangerous to remain in office. Donald Trump must be held accountable.  He must be impeached.
