 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a trusted  leader in Lubbock County and a man I am blessed to call a dear friend,  Sheriff Kelly Rowe.   Sheriff Rowe was recently elected by his peers to be president of the  Sheriff's Association of Texas. I can think of no better Texas lawman  to represent the character and noble calling of the law enforcement  profession, and the central tenet of a free society, law and order,  than Kelly Rowe.   Sheriff Rowe served in the United States Army and the Texas National  Guard. He has been part of the Sheriff's Department since 1999, but he  has been our sheriff for the last decade.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, law enforcement in Texas is under  tremendous strain as they work to protect our citizens and secure our  southern border, which is in complete chaos as a result of our Federal  Government's failure to defend our country and our President's failure  to uphold the laws of the land. As unprecedented numbers of crime,  drugs, and gangs pour through our open border, our law enforcement  officers have never been more important to the safety of our  neighborhoods and our families. Sheriff Rowe is a leader among his  colleagues and the Lone Star State is safer and stronger as a result of  his service.    Mr. Speaker, I also thank his lovely wife, Nola, and their family for  sharing Kelly selflessly with our communities. Law enforcement, as you  know, is a family commitment. It is a family sacrifice.   So congratulations to Sheriff Rowe on this great honor. We are  incredibly grateful for his service. We are extremely proud of his  leadership contributions to West Texas and beyond.   God bless the men and women in blue. God bless America. And go West  Texas.                          Congratulating Bryan Mudd     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bryan Mudd  on 20 years of service at KAMC, which is a local television station  there in Lubbock. Bryan's dedication to keeping the citizens of Lubbock  and the surrounding area informed about what is happening at home and  across this country has been invaluable to West Texas.   Bryan and his wife, Sherry, are both servant leaders who go above and  beyond their work to give of their time and talents to support many  causes and multiple non-profits in our community. And I know their  fellow West Texans and I am deeply grateful for their efforts.   I have always appreciated Bryan and his commitment to excellence in  journalism and his unwavering dedication to bringing timely, fair, and  balanced news to the people of West Texas.  [[Page H6184]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Bryan and his family in our  Nation's capital.   God bless Bryan, my dear friend. Congrats, and go West Texas.                            ____________________
