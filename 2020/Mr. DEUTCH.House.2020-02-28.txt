 Madam Speaker, we can't let disputes over dollars and  cents diminish the hope for more smiles and laughter from sweet  children like Jordan Ogman.   This week, I visited 4-year-old Jordan to bring attention to the  fight to save his life from a rare genetic disorder, TECPR2.   Jordan's parents, David and Stacey, refused to view his diagnosis as  a tragedy. They are inspired by his laugh, by his beautiful smile, and  by his love for his family--especially his sister, Kira. They are ready  to fight for him.   The Ogman family is counting on Congress to do what is right. This  Rare Disease Week, the 30 million Americans living with 1 of over 7,000  rare diseases are counting on Congress to invest in the research that  can give them hope.   Jordan's mom says: ``He is a warrior. He is resilient and bright, and  we are fighting every minute to save his life.''   Congress needs to be there to fight alongside the Ogman family and  every American family battling a rare disease.   Jordan, you keep fighting.   My colleagues, let's join this fight together.                            ____________________
