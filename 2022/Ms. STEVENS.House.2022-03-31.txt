 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong and enthusiastic support of  moving forward to conference the America COMPETES Act of 2022 with the  Senate.   For those watching back at home, a conference committee is a joint  committee between the House and Senate, a temporary ad hoc  configuration to negotiate elements of a bill; and it is, frankly, the  best of legislative action; Congress working for the American people,  debating through democracy and deliberation to produce an end result.   As a Member of Congress, I often ask myself, I often pose the  question, what will drive our economy for the next 10 years, 20 years,  30 years? What is our moonshot of the next 50 years? What can I do  today to ensure that my neighbors in southeast Michigan are on a strong  path to a successful future? What are the technologies and research  investments that we can make today to ensure the success of the Nation  for all of us?   The legislation that we are moving to conference today, the America  COMPETES Act, tackles those big questions and secures our competitive  edge for generations to come. This bill is an investment in our people.  It reflects our ability to reach higher, to think deeper, and to invent  solutions to not only today's problems but solutions for tomorrow's  opportunities.   Americans are known for their hustle, for their ingenuity. My job,  our job in Congress is to connect people to the tools to unlock a good  life, to connected opportunity for everyone. And, frankly, the tools of  the future are in this bill.   The COMPETES Act turbocharges America's scientific research and  technological leadership while strengthening America's economic and  national security at home and abroad. Even more, this bold investment  in innovation ensures our top scientific minds have the tools to rise  to the challenge of our climate crisis, from clean energy technologies  to emissions measurement.   Not only does this bill look to the future, but it also mends the  acute stressors that we are all feeling today due to our years of  Federal underinvestment in science and innovation. A conference  committee to discuss this, my friends, the America COMPETES Act tackles  our supply chain vulnerabilities to make more goods in America and  surges production of American-made semiconductors, chips, that which we  invented here in this Nation, and in the 1990s were producing 40  percent of a crucial component in everything from cars to computers to  medical devices. And the American people are ready; ready for  investments that will spur innovative solutions to create jobs across  the Nation, support American manufacturing, and build a strong and  diverse STEM workforce ready to address the challenges we face as a  Nation.                                time  1600    During President Biden's State of the Union Address, he called on  Congress to get our innovation package to him for his signature. So we  should be proud--I certainly am--to be here as we move to take the next  step in this process. There is, frankly, no time to waste in getting  the COMPETES Act to the President's desk.   As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology, I  am so proud of the range of bipartisan Science, Space, and Technology  Committee provisions that have long been championed that are included  in this package.   I am especially proud of the NIST for the Future Act, my legislation.  This critical investment in NIST will ensure the agency and its  employees have the resources they require to be a key part of  bolstering our American technology enterprise: a resilient supply  chain, small and midsize manufacturers being brought to the table to  deliver for America, and the American workforce that compels them.   Since Michigan's 11th District sent me to Congress, I have been  laser-focused on bringing innovation economy  [[Page H4048]]  solutions not only to folks in southeastern Michigan but also,  obviously, all across the United States.   We built a transformative piece of legislation from the ground up.  The ranking member is right--bipartisan years of work on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee to do such legislation. We heard from  the science community. We heard from industry. We heard from academia.  We heard from other stakeholders. They all told us the same thing:  Don't leave Americans behind. Don't leave anyone behind based on  geography or demographics. Bring the scientific research enterprise to  all.   We are here, and we are here with a lot of hardworking people from  the Science, Space, and Technology Committee staff. We have not had a  conference committee since 2018, albeit for NDAA. Many people have not  been able to be privy to such an action, and they deserve our  gratitude. These are the folks writing the text late into the night  based on our corrections, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  staff who work so hard and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  members.   The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and  innovation, and it is long overdue that we restore Federal support for  these vital initiatives, that we invest now and lead the world.   The House's and Senate's approaches may certainly have some  differences, but we seek the same goal: to deliver for this Nation.   I am very confident that we will have a very productive conference  process and hope to get the America COMPETES Act to President Biden's  desk for signature very soon.   The U.S. has endless potential to compete globally in science and  innovation. The America COMPETES Act provides the critical resources  and tools we need to achieve that.   I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout conference to  invest in America's most valuable resource, the talent of our people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the ranking member, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), has given us a motion to instruct, a negotiation  that we will pursue in the conference to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pallone).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for  reminding us about the importance of legacy chips and the MTB. I also  thank the previous gentlewoman from California for reminding us about  Manufacturing USA, which was probably started under the Obama  administration.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks).    Madam Speaker, we are lucky to have such a chair of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs here in the Congress.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman from Arkansas reminds  us, I am proud that Michigan is the destination where the combustion  engine was invented and innovated, and very proud to be the destination  where our workers are manifesting and innovating electric vehicles.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I join the ranking member in being optimistic because  we are in a conference committee negotiating the America COMPETES Act,  we will get this CHIPS legislation done. Proudly, I have led 29  Democrats and 29 Republicans in endorsing the CHIPS Act legislation, so  it will be bipartisan. It will get done for the American people, and we  will solve some of our supply chain woes.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.   We have heard today, Madam Speaker, a commitment to act, a commitment  to move into a conference, a commitment to get the America COMPETES Act  done for the United States, CHIPS Act funding, investment in scientific  research, and more. This is an exciting moment in this Chamber.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
