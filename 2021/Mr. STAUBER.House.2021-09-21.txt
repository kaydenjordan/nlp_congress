 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition  to the Democrats' abortion on demand until birth act, because as a  father of four and foster parent, I am reminded each day that every  life is precious and must be protected.   For me, a huge part of my pro-life story is my son Isaac. Isaac was  born with Down syndrome, and he brings so much joy to our family. That  is why it breaks my heart that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are promoting this legislation that would allow for  discriminatory abortions on the basis of sex, race, and disability.   It is disgraceful that there are people in this very Chamber who  don't believe that children like my son deserve the right to life. To  perform abortion violence on defenseless babies is unthinkable, and it  is especially horrifying that this legislation would allow abortion up  until the moment of birth.   This is not the direction our country should be headed, and 80  percent of Americans agree. I will be voting against the Democrats'  abortion on demand until birth act because this legislation is nothing  less than barbaric.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do  the same.                            ____________________
