 Mr. Speaker, I want to start by first recognizing  one of our own, who has been a superb representative for Puerto Rico in  these very difficult times. You rarely see somebody with the talent,  the energy of the representative of Puerto Rico here in Congress. Miss  Gonzalez-Colon has been, frankly, a hero, and I just wanted to mention  that, because she has really made all of us understand the situation,  and she has done so with great dignity and great passion and great  brilliance. I just had to say that.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman for being incredibly  accessible and engaged. Florida has gotten hit rather hard, as you  know. This bill totals $36.5 billion. $18.67 billion of that goes  directly to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, and it also ensures that our  National Flood Insurance Program has the resources that it needs to pay  the claims, also an important grant food and aid loan eligibility to  Puerto Rico, which is crucial.   So far, Mr. Speaker, Florida has received $740 million for assistance  for individuals through FEMA, and is working through over 608,000  applicants. Think about that.   As we continue to recover, again, I look forward to continue working  with the chairman, who has been phenomenal.   Specifically, we are going to have to deal with the agricultural  impact of this storm, and again, particularly on the citrus industry,  that has been devastated by this storm.   This is an important bill. It is an important bill. I want to thank  the chairman for bringing it up so quickly. We must pass it. I look  forward to working with Chairman Frelinghuysen and with all our  colleagues through this process, because we are going to need more  assistance as the days and the months go.   So this is an important bill. I urge your support.
