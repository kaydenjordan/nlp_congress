 Madam Speaker, unfortunately, this bill is  necessary because we have a radical and unhinged leftwing activist  group of individuals that also have been encouraged by the slow-walking  Democratic Party in hopes of intimidation being used to influence the  courts. That is why we are here today.   We have assassination attempts on Judge Kavanaugh. We have fire  bombings of women's resource centers and healthcare facilities. We have  U.S. Senators, sitting U.S. Senators, encouraging violence against the  children and families of Supreme Court Justices.   Ever since the leak took place some 6 weeks ago, there have been at  least 14 coordinated attacks on women's pregnancy care facilities, and  Democratic leadership has endorsed and encouraged physical threats to  their political opposition. This is totally unacceptable. It is un- American.   The unhinged left is not the party that empowers women. If that were  true, they would not be trying to destroy women's resource centers, nor  would they be trying to attack and intimidate those who work there.  They would not be threatening the life of and encouraging violence  toward the children of the fourth woman to serve on the United States  Supreme Court.   The protests that have been taking place outside the Justices' homes  this past month are unacceptable, and Democratic leadership has refused  to condemn the threats of violence.   One great example of this is, despite the law and the prohibition  against such protests, Jen Psaki, while she was White House press  secretary, stated: ``. . . we certainly continue to encourage that  outside of judges' homes, and that is the President's position.''   This is the position of the Democratic Party: intimidation and fear.  Now it is getting out of control. It is about time the Democrats are  coming to admit it. I encourage my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana  for your leadership on this issue and for all the members of the House  Freedom Caucus who stand for the issues that are both constitutional  and extremely important to the American citizens.   All of us, all of us, all of us have been shocked over and over to  see the unspeakable acts of violence, mass shootings and the like that  have taken place in recent years and are rising in intensity and  frequency. We see the heart-wrenching situations that these tragedies  create in families and communities, and we see the rippling effect that  they have in our Nation as a whole.   But far too often when these types of things happen, the reaction has  become predictable from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  from the media, from others who immediately jump to conclusions,  politicize the tragedies, and transfer to an agenda that includes  disarming law-abiding citizens and stripping away our constitutionally  protected Second Amendment.                                time  2000    Stricter regulation is not the issue--it is not the answer. Stripping  away constitutional rights of American citizens is not the answer to  these problems.   When considering how to deal with issues like mass shootings, we need  to dig down to the root cause. This is just common sense. We have a  major problem, let's get to the cause of the problem.   Firearms are just a tool, and like with any tool, the tool is only as  effective or ineffective as the one operating the tool. I am not a  violent person, that is why I don't have violent guns. The guns are not  the problem. The person is the problem.   If you have a violent person--as has already been stated tonight--a  violent person is going to commit violent acts. What is our response  here--let's not go after the person, let's not deal with the cause,  let's go after the tool, the instrument that was used. That does not  solve the problem.   If we are ever going to deal with issues like mass shootings, and a  host of other issues of that nature, then we have got to look at the  problem, which is the shooter. We, in this country right now, we are a  Nation in deep moral and spiritual crisis.   Among other things, we are watching our values in the family unit  deteriorate right under our nose. Just today in a hearing in the  Oversight Committee where the Democrats were yet again offering one  piece of legislation after another that continues to deteriorate and  dismantle the most critical unit in this country--that is the family  unit.   Mr. Speaker, I would challenge anyone to take a deeper look at those  who have committed such violent, heinous crimes that we have watched  and see what their family life was like, what their spiritual life was  like, and we will start finding some of the issues here that must be  addressed.   Yet, we have so many attempts right now to address all the wrong  things.
