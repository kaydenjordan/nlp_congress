 Madam President, I would like to take a few moments to  acknowledge my friend, Mayor Bob Butler of Marion, IL. Since April 16,  1963, the people of Marion have known Bob Butler as mayor. Think about  this. During Bob Butler's span as mayor, there have been 11 U.S.  Presidents and 10 Illinois Governors. Mayor Butler is the second  longest serving active mayor in the country and is believed to be the  longest serving mayor of Illinois. That is quite an accomplishment.   Prior to becoming mayor, Bob Butler served in the U.S. Army Counter  Intelligence Corps after the wars in Japan and Korea. Service was in  his blood, so it came as no surprise when Bob decided to run for mayor.  Known for his straight-shooting, old-school style, Bob outlined his  simple approach to governance during his first campaign: ``It's up to  the mayor to study each problem as it arises, determine in his own mind  what is best to do for all the people. I think the mayor of any town  has got to stand on his own two feet and make up his mind without being  dictated to by any individual or group. I think also when a man is  elected mayor, the people are entitled to know where he stands. He  ought to be able to tell the people. If a matter requires a `yes' or  `no' answer, he should say `yes' or `no.'''   Southern Illinois' newspaper of record, the Southern Illinoisan,  endorsed Butler's candidacy, saying: ``Marion voters will choose  Tuesday between orderly, progressive city government or a continuation  of the present slap-dash regime . . . Butler, in short, offers an  excellent alternative . . . He has our wholehearted support.'' Bob  Butler won by 687 votes and never looked back. He won the next 13  mayoral elections in Marion.   During Mayor Butler's first council meeting, an entire block on the  city square caught fire. The new council took office and shortly  thereafter adjourned to help fight the fire. The fire shined a light on  many of Marion's problems, inadequate firefighting resources and water  supply, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Mayor Butler  inherited a city in financial crisis. Marion needed more people. Why?  Because more people meant more money from the State. Mayor Butler got  to work and, due to his leadership, turned Marion around.   Mayor Butler transformed Marion and southern Illinois through good  old-fashioned hard work. Over the years, Mayor Butler's agenda helped  turn Marion into a regional powerhouse along Interstate 57. During his  tenure, Marion's population has grown nearly 92 percent. According to  Mayor Butler, the secret to Marion's success was simply ``A strong  business community and a strong city working together [that] produced  great results.'' He is absolutely right.   Anyone who knows Mayor Butler knows that he is an avid reader. He is  on record saying that his favorite political book is a three-part novel  by Rafael Sabatini, ``Scaramouche.'' It opens with this line: ``He was  born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad.''   With his 91st birthday approaching next week, I want to thank Mayor  Butler for his extraordinary commitment to the people of Marion and his  work to help his community and the world be just a little less mad. I  wish him and his family all the best in their next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me say at the outset that what we are  trying to achieve is fund the military and critical agencies of our  government immediately and to do it with a budget, to do it with  appropriations bills. I have to use that term and remind you, yes, we  used to have appropriations bills in the U.S. Senate--not anymore. We  deal with continuing resolutions, we lurch from week to week, day to  day, month to month, and as the Secretary of Defense has told us, we  are not doing the men and women of the military any favors with this  kind of approach. Make no mistake about it, the Democrats are soundly  behind national security, and we want to fund them properly rather than  the way they have been funded to this date.   Let me address another issue that has been raised--and my name has  been mentioned by my friend from Texas. It has been said on the floor  tonight that there is no urgency. Where's the urgency when it comes to  DACA? Where is the urgency when it comes to Dreamers? If you want to  know the urgency, look into the Gallery behind me. Look at the people  who have gathered here late this night, who are following every word  that we are debating. Why are they here if there is no urgency?   There is an urgency. There is an urgency in their lives because of  the uncertainty of tomorrow--whether tomorrow will mean deportation for  themselves and their families, whether they will be able to work,  complete school, have a life in America. Yes, there is a real urgency,  and let me tell you what we have done about that urgency.   A group of us--three Democrats and three Republican Senators--sat  down 4 months ago to answer President Trump's challenge to replace  DACA. Was there a meeting of a committee in this Senate on the same  subject? There was one public hearing, but no bill, no markup, nothing.  The activity really came from and evolved from the six of us working  together--three Democrats and three Republicans. We reached an  agreement. It wasn't easy. Ask the Senators involved on your side of  the aisle or on our side of the aisle. We have presented it to the  Senate, we have defended it over the last several weeks, and I want to  thank the additional four Republican Senators who have joined us in  this effort to finally enact a bipartisan solution to this. So to say  that we have done nothing and we have so much time--let me tell you,  there is a sense of urgency here.   Just this week, when the Secretary of DHS testified before the  Judiciary Committee, she conceded the fact that the President does not  have authority to extend this deadline of March 5, that we are going  back and forth in court as to whether there will be any protection for  these young people whatsoever, and she acknowledged that her Department  has said that it will take them 6 months to write the regulations once  we pass the law that will affect their lives and the lives of hundreds  of thousands.   You know how I feel about this issue. Some of you have presided over  the Senate, have seen the presentations we have made over the years. I  have brought 107 photographs to the floor so that people could see the  urgency and need for this issue now. It is sad; it is unfortunate that  those who stand on the floor tonight continue to characterize these as  illegal immigrants--illegal immigrants. Children, toddlers, infants  brought to the United States, who have lived their whole lives here and  are simply asking for a chance to be part of our future, are being  swept away as illegal immigrants. They are more than that. They are the  sons and daughters of America who want to be part of our future. They  are people who inspire me every day. They are folks who guarantee us  that the American Dream will be alive for another generation because  they are willing to work for it, to study for it, and to fight for it.  This is worth our attention.   We have produced this bipartisan measure. A lot of hard work went  into it. We would simply ask that the Senate take up the measure that  we produced or produce a better one, and the leadership has refused.  That is part of the reason we find ourselves at this moment, but I want  to assure you, it is an urgent matter. Their lives matter too.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The majority leader.                     Orders for Friday, January 19, 2018    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m., Friday,  January 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to concur in the  House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 195.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Maine.
