 Madam Speaker, rising inflation is continuing to harm  families and communities across the country.   Americans are paying 30 percent more to heat their homes this winter  and 11 percent more for their electricity bills. The Central Valley gas  prices are nearly $5 per gallon. The cost of housing is rising, and  grocery bills are historically high.   Madam Speaker, Americans are paying more just to keep food on their  table. Meanwhile, the House majority and the administration continue to  add to this problem with reckless, out-of-control spending by  implementing irresponsible and shortsighted economic policies.   These spending packages will hurt our economy by drastically  increasing our record-high inflation rates and will continue to cripple  generations to come by passing on more debt to our future Americans.   I urge my colleagues in the majority to act urgently and work across  the aisle to address this out-of-control inflation.                            ____________________
