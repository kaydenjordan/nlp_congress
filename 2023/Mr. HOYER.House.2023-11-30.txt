 Mr. Speaker, we have less than 3 weeks scheduled in the  remainder of this year for us to act.   We have less than 3 weeks to secure aid for Israel and Ukraine before  we return to our districts in December.   They cannot afford that time. Each day we wait, winter grows colder  in Ukraine. Each day we sit on our hands, American and Israeli hostages  in Gaza become more fearful that they have been forgotten, as do their  families.   Each day we idle, our allies sacrifice more lives in their fight  against tyranny and terror. Each day we fail to act, America's  reputation as the world's greatest defender of freedom and democracy  decays.   Inaction suggests to our friends and foes alike that our Congress  chooses doubt over determination, reluctance over resolve, and  contention over conviction. We embolden those assaulting democracy in  Israel, Ukraine, and elsewhere to set their sights on the rest of the  free world, including our own shores.   We must not project uncertainty in our willingness to oppose despots  and international terrorists. Securing this supplemental aid without  condition and without delay needs to be this House's priority.   I have served in Congress for over 42 years, including 28 years in  the leadership. In that time, I have seen Democrats and Republicans  work together to defend democracy and further freedom.   Earlier this year, I went with former Speaker McCarthy to meet with  Israeli leaders to reaffirm our vital U.S.-Israel relationship. I  worked with him to preserve the overwhelming bipartisan support our  Congress has had for Israel for the past 75 years, just as I did with  past Republican leaders.   Now, Mr. Speaker, we come together in solidarity as Vladimir Putin  threatens freedom, democracy, international law, and the lives of  Ukrainians.   A few years ago, I stood with Republicans in Kyiv's Independence  Square to lay wreaths for the prodemocracy protesters who were gunned  down there during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Republicans also  joined me on my codel to Ukraine's border just last year.   When I met with President Zelenskyy and House leaders on both sides  of the aisle in September in this House, we expressed our unanimous  commitment to Ukraine's cause, to America's cause, to freedom's cause.   We saw that same bipartisanship on the House floor in recent weeks  when some 75 percent of us voted to approve additional funding for  Ukraine. All seven times, perhaps eight times if you count a couple of  bills, that issue came up for consideration, 75 percent of us voted for  Ukraine's funding.   We ought to act on the strong consensus that exists in this body to  deliver aid for Israel and Ukraine now, today, perhaps tomorrow, but  certainly very soon.   Neither dysfunction nor disagreement ought to undermine that effort.  Victory is our objective; delay is our enemy.   I have spoken with Israeli and Ukrainian leaders. I have met with  officials from NATO partners and other allies. I have talked with the  families of American hostages held captive by Hamas and Gaza. Their  question is the same: Is America still willing to pay the price of  freedom? Our answer, Mr. Speaker, and the answer of America must be  yes. Now.   We must send a deafening message to our friends and to the enemies of  freedom and democracy. We will defend our allies and our shared values,  not only in the next few days, but in all the days to come.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. It is time to act without condition.  Ukraine needs us, Israel needs us, and freedom, democracy, and  international law need us.   Let us act now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is a time of sadness, of wrenching pain,  of anger, and of determination.   It is my solemn duty, Mr. Speaker, to speak on this floor today about  a courageous, talented, and generous young man, Itay Chen. His family  is in the gallery. I had the opportunity to speak to them just a few  minutes ago. As any family would be, knowing that their child is at  great risk and not knowing his present welfare, they are grieving but  determined.   Itay is an American-Israeli dual citizen bravely serving his nation  in the IDF.   That is probably incorrect. This is his nation. IDF is the land of  his forebears and of his ancestors and a land that offers sanctuary and  safety to the Jewish people who have been savaged, hated, killed, and  maligned for millennia.   On October 7, Itay was taken hostage during Hamas' brutal criminal  and savage attack on Israel and on innocent civilians in the land that  is not contested by anybody.   Itay is only 19 years old. Mr. Speaker, I have not met Itay, though I  hope to do so in person in the near future. However, I met with his  father, Ruby, who is with us in the gallery today, as I said, and his  mother, Hagit, is joining us, as well.   Mr. Speaker, everything I have heard about their son has only  reinforced my resolve to help bring Itay home and the other hostages  home, as well.   Itay was raised in New York City, the city in which I was born, Mr.  Speaker. He was always a precocious kid and a kindhearted young man.  Like his dad, he is an avid lover of basketball. Unlike his dad,  however, he is a diehard Lakers fan. So, there is a little conflict in  the family, but that has not affected the deep love and concern that  his family has for Itay.   I want to assure them, Mr. Speaker, that is shared by the 435 Members  of this body. It is not a partisan issue but a human issue.   Itay may not have inherited his father's basketball loyalties, Mr.  Speaker, but he did inherit his New York grit. Itay also developed a  calling for service at a very young age, participating in Boy Scouts  and serving his community. That commitment to serving others drove Itay  to join the IDF.   I know his experience in captivity, as awful as it is. Very frankly,  Mr. Speaker, the Red Cross has seen the horror of how these hostages  are being kept, and they ought to tell the world that truth.  Nevertheless, we know that his experience will not break his generous  spirit nor his dedication to the sacred Jewish principle of tikkun  olam, repairing the world and doing good so that others may do better.   His parents, Ruby and Hagit; his brothers, Roy and Alon; and the rest  of his family and friends continue to show tremendous resilience and  courage. We can do no less in the Congress, no less in the White House,  and no less in America than make sure we bring this American home alive  and healthy.   I think, Mr. Speaker, how I would feel if one of my three daughters  or one of my three grandchildren or one of my four great-grandchildren  were in some tunnel or crevice illegally and criminally. I would do  everything I could to get them back, and we must do everything to get  back not only Itay but all those pictures that we will see of innocent  people killed, maimed, and taken hostage by a criminal group we call  Hamas.   I want Itay and his loved ones to know that we are going to make sure  this Congress does everything it can to bring him and the other  hostages home as quickly as possible. Mr. Speaker, as a symbol of that  promise, I am wearing a dog tag that Ruby gave me just weeks ago.   Until they return safely to our shores, we will continue to stand  strong with their families. Their grief is our grief. Their hope is our  hope, and that hope grows with every hostage released. It will not end  until they are all home, safe in the arms of their families and loved  ones.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for taking this  Special Order and for yielding to me.
