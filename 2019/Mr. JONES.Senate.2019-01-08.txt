 Mr. President, first of all, let me say how much I  appreciate my colleagues on the floor--particularly, Senator Bennet's  comments--and the passion that everyone has shown for the people in  this country and why we are here for the people that we represent,  whether they voted for us or not. That is not the issue. We are here to  represent all the people, and I really appreciate those incredible  words from my colleagues and, particularly, the passion shown by  Senator Bennet.   I am rising today to give my voice to the thousands of Alabamians who  are also suffering as a result of this government shutdown. It is not  just the folks who are employed but those who are affected by this  shutdown by whatever means necessary.   There are people who are not employed by the government who are also  affected. In the midst of all the political posturing that we have  seen, the costly government shutdown has hurt over 5,100 Alabama  workers, their families, and the people who rely on them to do their  job. Thousands more are contractors who will not get backpay. Unlike  the Federal workers, who traditionally get backpay, these contractors  who are not working now because there is no work to be had with the  Federal Government will not get backpay from their employers.   Our Coast Guard employees, who aren't paid through the Department of  Defense budget that passed last year, don't know whether their paycheck  will come or not. By the way, it is the Coast Guard who is interdicting  so much of the illegal drugs that are attempting to come into this  country. It is not the southern border. It is the Coast Guard, which we  are putting at risk, that is doing the best job of interdicting the  illegal drugs that are attempting to come into this country.   These folks pay the price of this shutdown while this political drama  that we have seen in Washington, DC, drags on and on--on cable TV, on  Twitter, and on other social media platforms. These folks are hard- working Alabamians who keep our airports safe. They protect our  communities. They monitor our prisons.   We have three Federal prisons in Alabama. Three of the workers in the  Aliceville prison were on CNN today talking about the effects on them  and their community in Aliceville, AL. These are people who support our  national defense, like folks in Redstone Arsenal and at all of the  military bases in our State. They support the aerospace programs in our  State. These are the folks who are getting hurt. Many of these people  are veterans who have gone on to serve their country a second time by  working in Federal service.   Most of these folks support strong border security. I venture to  guess that all of them support strong border security. Some will  support the wall, as the President has described it, but they don't  agree with--they don't support--shutting down the Government of the  United States of America in a way to just get that wall or that border  security done. They do not support that at the expense of their  communities and their families.    Over the past 18 days or so since this shutdown, I have heard from  any number of my constituents. They call the office here in Washington,  and they call the offices in Huntsville, in Mobile, in Birmingham, and  in Montgomery. They talk about how they are hurting already because of  the shutdown.   One constituent who wrote to me is a small business owner in North  Alabama, near Huntsville, whose 30-plus employees have provided very  important, continuous support for NASA programs for the past 7 years.  As their work gets delayed or stopped altogether, these folks don't  know whether they are going to have jobs. If their work stops, those  employees are going to need jobs, and they are going to start looking  for other jobs. In the economy that we have now, in which unemployment  is low, people are looking for workers, and they are going to find  those jobs. So his business may get shut down.   There is a military spouse who also works for the Federal Government  whose husband is deployed to Afghanistan right now. She also wrote to  me and urged an end to this shutdown. She said that while she supports  the wall, she doesn't believe that Federal employees should be used as  bargaining chips just to get it done. She said that a lapse in funding  would be devastating for her job and that her family needs the  paychecks to cover these bills. This is a family that is already living  under stress with its having a husband and father in Afghanistan. This  family doesn't need the extra stress.   On behalf of her family of four in Smiths Station, AL, another mother  wrote to me about her family's lapse in healthcare coverage since the  shutdown because the employees at a Federal health insurance agency,  GEHA, have been furloughed. Her family's change in coverage was never  fully processed by the end of the year. So it lapsed and was canceled  as of December 31. The family members are now facing important medical  decisions--appointments, prescriptions, refills in the next few weeks-- but don't know if they are going to have the insurance to cover it.   The administration announced today that the deadline for farmers to  receive their subsidies, because of the administration's trade  policies, will be extended, which all sounds really great. It sounds  all good and well. We are going to extend it. We are going to put a  bandaid on this for our farmers. These farmers have been hit hard by  the trade war that this administration has started, which I have talked  about on the floor of the Senate on any number of occasions and around  my State.   To ease that pain, a few months ago the administration decided to  allocate $12 billion as almost a bailout. Now, these farmers really  don't want these handouts. They want their markets. Yet, to ease their  pain, to its credit, the administration came up with $12 billion to  ease that pain. Less than half of that amount--roughly, about $5.2  billion in payments--was made before the Department of Agriculture's  local offices were closed. While extending that deadline sounds very  good and is, simply, putting a bandaid over the wound, the fact is that  until we get this government open, farmers who did not get their  payments in before this shutdown are going to have a problem.   Another problem with the shutdown is that they can't depend on the  Federal Government any more than they can depend on the weather. These  farmers are at risk every season, every year, of things that are out of  their control. What they don't need is a government that they cannot  depend on, and that is what we have right now. They are out of luck at  a time at which they need it the most, as they are starting to plan for  their spring planting and summer planting--their loans, their crops,  buying the seed--as Senator Bennet talked about a few moments ago.   There is one constituent who wrote me a really heartbreaking letter  about the impact of losing her SNAP benefits after January 31 if the  shutdown continues. She is living on a razor's edge financially and  depends on Social Security disability benefits and SNAP dollars to  survive. It is not a lot of money on a monthly basis. It is such a  small amount of money that folks in this body and folks in the House  and, certainly, the folks in the administration wouldn't think twice  about it. It is probably less than they spend at Starbucks every  morning, but, for her, it is an incredibly important part of her life,  and we have to make sure that we do everything not to let her down.  [[Page S61]]    I did see, just before I came over here, that the administration has  said that we are going to extend it. We are going to make sure that  SNAP benefits are paid in February. Again, that is great and sounds  wonderful, but it is a bandaid. Sooner or later, if we don't end up  doing something about this shutdown, that bandaid is going to be ripped  off, and these folks are going to be left in the cold once again.   We need to remember--and I think this gets lost sometimes in the talk  about this shutdown--that this is not just about the paychecks and the  direct benefits that people in this country receive from the Federal  Government. It also affects all of those people in our communities who  serve those who work for the government--those who take in their  grocery money and take in their utility money and take in their gas  money. It is going to affect those people. It is going to affect car  dealers, and it is going to affect local businesses. It is just like  the folks at the prison in Aliceville said today, which is that sooner  or later, if they don't have money to spend around Aliceville, it is  going to affect that community. This touches so many people in this  country that we need not lose sight of that.   The letters and calls and voice mails are pouring in every day as  this shutdown continues. More and more Americans face the increasing  consequences of the impasse that we see here in Washington, DC. There  is, simply put, no excuse for it. We can and must do better. We can and  must find the common ground that so many of us talk about. Every day,  over and over, we talk about finding common ground, but we have to  practice what we preach in terms of finding that common ground.   This past year, I talked to a number of my constituents back home who  had gone through a number of issues. I talked to a lot of people who  asked me to support the wall. They stopped me over the holidays, and I  would always stop and talk to them. They were always very respectful,  unlike with some things that happen in our political discourse today.  These people were always very respectful, and we had nice  conversations. When I asked them what they were talking about, they  said that I needed to vote for a wall.   They said: We just need border security, Senator. We need border  security.   This gave me the opportunity to say: I completely agree.   Unfortunately, the so-called ``wall'' that we keep hearing about,  primarily on Twitter, has really become just a metaphor to support a  secure border. To oppose it is to oppose a secure border. That makes no  sense. What is getting lost in this debate is that every Member of this  body wants secure borders. Every Member of this body and every Member  of the House wants border security measures that will keep our  communities safe. We might have disagreements about the best way to  make sure our borders are secure, and we might have disagreements on  what border security will look like, but it doesn't mean that we want  open borders as I keep hearing from the administration. That is a  preposterous statement.   In fact, in the last Congress, we had one of the President's nominees  before us for the head of ICE. He used to work on the border. He was  there. He controlled it. He was the head of border security.   I asked him in the hearing: Have you ever heard one politician--have  you ever heard anybody in Washington, DC--say that he is for open  borders?   He said: No, sir, not at all.   We have to get away from that political posturing so that we can find  the common ground that is necessary to move this forward. The fact of  the matter is that we have found common ground. We have found that  common ground right here in this body.   Last February, in the midst of bipartisan talks on more comprehensive  immigration reform, a number of senior administration officials came to  the Senate and briefed Members on the situation at the border. They  outlined how an infusion of money in the context of a larger piece of  legislation could improve security and conditions for asylum seekers  and on the border. In the wake of that presentation--if I recall  correctly, they proposed a $25 billion price tag for border security-- Republicans and Democrats alike, which was a majority of the U.S.  Senate, voted to include that $25 billion in border security funding  over the next decade. That was a bipartisan effort.   Over the course of the last spring and early summer, the U.S. Senate  Appropriations Committee--led by my colleague from Alabama, Senator  Shelby, and by Senator Leahy, the ranking member--passed a bipartisan  Homeland Security funding bill by a vote of 25 to 5. It did that in  June of this year. It included $1.6 billion in border security funding,  which was on top of the $1.3 billion, I think, that was funded last  year. What has started this whole process today is the administration's  demand of a blank check of $5.6 billion for a wall as the price to  reopen the government. That is, simply, not how our government should  work.   Now, candidly and in all fairness, in recent days, we have gone from  an argument that was just, simply, about dollars and cents on both  sides of the aisle--5.6 versus 1.6 or 1.3--to where we have now seen  the administration begin to slowly roll out how it would actually spend  that money. There was no plan in the beginning. It was just ``send us  $5.6 billion.'' We are learning about that plan via Twitter and on the  TV talk shows, not the way this body is used to getting information  from the administration--through a budget process or through some  proposal about which you can ask questions and can vet.   If the administration is serious about border security--and it should  be serious about border security, just like the Senate of the United  States and the House of Representatives of the United States should be  serious about border security--we should reopen the rest of the  government. Officials should also come back to the Hill, like they did  in February, and brief Members of both parties in Congress about what  is needed and of exactly the new border security money and how it will  be spent.   This week, the House has been voting on a series--or will be voting  on a series--of funding bills that the Senate has already passed, many  by a vote of 92 to 6. Think about that. As I travel around the State, I  tell people all the time what I saw last year--my first year--which is  that there is so much more bipartisanship in this body that you don't  see just by watching C-SPAN and listening to dueling press conferences.  There is a lot of it that goes on, and we passed those bills by 92 to  6.   These bills will ensure that the Federal employees and contractors  can go back to work and can get paid, that food assistance and housing  vouchers can go forward, that vital research can be done, that our  parks and museums can reopen, that our airports are safe, and that our  prisons are monitored. Instead of handing political appointees a 10- percent raise, it will ensure that we will pay the Coast Guard, whose  members continue to serve throughout this shutdown without knowing if  their next paychecks are going to come.   I am literally sad to say--and I really hope people will take this  into account, especially the folks who have been here for a long time-- that in my first year here, my first year in the Senate, this is the  third government shutdown that we have seen. We should be embarrassed  about that, and the administration should be embarrassed about that. At  every opportunity, I have voted to keep the government open. I can't  say that I would do it every time, because it will depend on the  circumstances, but, thus far, I have done all I can to keep this  government open.   The American people are frustrated and disheartened by the  dysfunction and empty rhetoric that they hear out of this town, but we  have to remember that the Senate of the United States has done its job  and done so in a deliberative and bipartisan way. No one on either side  of the political aisle should lose sight of that.    We came together and found common ground, and we should insist that  the President of the United States not only acknowledge that but honor  that, get this government up and running, and let's sit down to  continue to discuss the plans for the border security that we all know  is necessary and we would like.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
