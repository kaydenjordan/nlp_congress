 Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, I had the  pleasure of standing in the Oval Office with President Trump as he  signed my bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for  the 21st Century Act into law.   I was proud to see this bill become law, but I was even more proud to  see it pass with such overwhelming bipartisan support. Not a single  Member of Congress in either Chamber voted against it.   The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Act is the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and  Technical Education Act since 2006.   COVID-19 has underscored just how much the Nation depends on a  skilled and trained workforce. That is why I am pleased to cosponsor  the Skills Renewal Act. This legislation will support individuals who  have become unemployed as a result of the pandemic with a $4,000 skills  training credit and will support career and technical education  opportunities such as apprenticeships and certificate programs.   Career and technical education invests in America's most valuable  resource, our people, and provides the tools necessary to pursue high- skill, high-wage, family-sustaining careers.
