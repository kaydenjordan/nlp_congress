 Mr. President, I want to begin this morning by  congratulating the South Dakota State University football team on an  incredible win Saturday in Brookings, SD. I happened to be on hand for  this great event.   Thanks to their great performance in Saturday's game, which included  five scores in their first five possessions, the Jackrabbits are headed  to the FCS National Championship for the second time in three seasons.   Saturday's win is the latest in a banner season for the Jacks, who  have gone 13 and 1 and won the Missouri Valley Conference to become the  No. 1 seed in the FCS playoffs.   Of course, Saturday's game would not have been possible without the  men and women who worked to clear the roads around Brookings, and the  volunteers and staff who cleared the field and seats after a major  snowstorm last week.   When the game got underway, temperatures were in the single digits,  not including the windchill. When you add in the windchill, it was well  below zero.   I am grateful for the hard work of all the staff who made it  possible, which allowed, by the way, literally thousands of people-- thousands of Jacks fans, like me--to be there to cheer on our team.  Remarkably, in spite of the conditions, there was a great crowd on hand  to see this historic win.   I am looking forward to rooting for the Jacks next month when they  take on the North Dakota State University Bison in the championship  game in Frisco, TX, where, hopefully, it will be a little warmer than 9  degrees.
