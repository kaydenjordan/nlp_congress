 Mr. Speaker, Friday marked 6 months since the tax  reform bill was signed into law. Since that time, we have seen  increased paychecks, greater investment, and new job opportunities  across the country.   My colleagues and I on the House Ways and Means Committee talked  about how best to overhaul our Tax Code. Our goal was always the same:  to get our economy booming again.   In Washington State, where I am from, we are already seeing this boom  and the positive impacts of tax reform: employee bonuses, savings on  utilities, increased wages, and 401(k) matches.   They are people like a young woman in Seattle, for example, who was  able to afford a new car, thanks to some extra money in her paycheck  each month; or, the mother from Woodinville, Washington, who has been  helping her son, daughter-in-law, and grandchild make ends meet while  they were living paycheck to paycheck. With tax reform, her son is now  taking home more money, which helps them provide for their family much  easier.   Tax reform is not only resulting in more take-home pay, but it is  making a difference in the workplace, too. Companies are creating new  retail and manufacturing jobs and increasing wages and benefits. The  Boeing Company is increasing investments in workforce development,  facilities and infrastructure improvements for employees, and  charitable giving.    But it is not just the employees of big companies who are seeing the  benefits. Our local, family-owned businesses are seeing lots of good  come from this new Tax Code.   Another example is a delivery driver from Kent, Washington, who works  for one of these small, local companies. He shared that just 2 weeks  after the tax reform bill passed, his boss gave everyone in that  company a raise.   These are encouraging stories from real people living real lives  across Washington State. They are hardworking people who see  substantial benefits, thanks to tax reform.                        Respect and Love Your Neighbor     Mr. Speaker, I want to change topics just for a moment,  if I can, and address an issue that is invading all across the country  and our communities.   I was in law enforcement for 33 years before I came to Congress, and  my job  [[Page H5656]]  was to keep people safe and bring people together. I see that as my job  here in Congress. This is my 14th and last year. I am not running for  re-election.   Some people in this body call themselves leaders. A title does not  make you a leader, Mr. Speaker. It is the actions that make you a  leader. I believe that true leaders lead from the heart. I believe that  leaders have the heart of a servant. I believe that when I got elected  to this office, my job was to serve the people of the Eighth District  of Washington and to put their needs before my needs.   Mr. Kelly here and I are friends. He comes to work every day putting  my needs before his. I do the same. We formed a friendship, a bond, and  we want to be honest with each other. Honesty is okay. But honesty is a  moment in time. We need integrity and consistent honesty.   Servanthood and integrity is what this country should be built upon,  that is what leaders are, not calling for each one of us to say, you  are not welcome here anytime, anyplace, anywhere. That is not  leadership. That is division.   Leadership, heart of the servant, integrity. That creates a team that  we all want to be a part of. That gives this country the opportunity to  be the leader of the world. You can each do that across this country,  Mr. Speaker--we can all do that--by being leaders in our community.  Beginning in the White House. Beginning from that Oval Office, speak  with civility. Beginning here in Congress, speak with civility. If you  are a member of a State legislature, speak with civility. Serve with  the heart of a servant.   Mr. Speaker, it is simple: respect and love your neighbor.                            ____________________
