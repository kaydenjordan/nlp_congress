 Madam Speaker, on September 1 of 1980, inflation was at  almost 13 percent. On that day, then Governor Ronald Reagan said:  ``Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you  lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses  his.'' Unfortunately, today is looking a lot like 1980, and the Carter  and the Biden Presidencies share far too much in common.                                time  1045    President Biden has unnecessarily spent trillions of dollars, spiking  inflation into a 40-year high of 8.6 percent. As a result of this  inflation, American households will pay an additional $7,620 as they  buy gas, food, and other things over the next 12 months--$7,620  annually.   Since Biden became President, real wages are down 4.2 percent while  mortgage rates have doubled, have gone up 2.4 points. Our economy  shrank 1.4 percent last quarter, and many economists now agree that  these signs point to an imminent recession.   The President now points to the Federal Reserve to get him out of the  inflation mess that he created. Today, I will point out what that may  mean and talk about the challenge that the Fed faces to rein in  inflation.   I have a chart here with me that compares the Federal funds rate,  which is its benchmark interest rate, and inflation rates over the past  60 years. If you look at the chart, you will see two lines on the graph  showing inflation and the Fed rate. Each time that the Fed looked to  reduce inflation, they increased the interest rate, and they have  increased the interest rate each time above the current inflation rate.   So, for example, in the early 1980s, which I mentioned earlier,  following President Carter's era of stagflation, the Fed raised rates  to a record high of over 16.5 percent to reverse what was 13 percent  inflation at that time. So once again, this would suggest that for the  Fed to do its job and rein in inflation, it will need to increase  interest rates above our current rate of inflation.   So far this year, the Feds have raised the Federal fund rate three  times, most recently with a .75--or \3/4\ percent--increase, which is  the highest increase since 1994, but the Federal funds rate still only  sits between 1.5 and 1\3/4\ percent.   Current rates are 1\3/4\ percent, and again, inflation is 8.6 percent  and climbing. This suggests that the Fed has a long way to go in  raising interest rates, and has a lot of work to do ahead. What isn't  shown in this chart--and sometimes I am not sure if the Biden  administration understands--are the consequences that come with raising  rates.   Our economy will slow down, and it will be harder for Americans to  start small businesses and to purchase homes. We are already seeing  that happening. The cost of living will increase, and Americans will  see hard times. This did not have to happen.   President Biden overinflated an already recovering economy by  spending trillions on the American Rescue Plan, which included market- distorting policies that unnecessarily subsidized demand while  restricting supplies by paying people to stay home.   Now, as I said, the President is relying on the Fed to fix it but,  unfortunately, it is the American people who will be paying the  consequences.                            ____________________
