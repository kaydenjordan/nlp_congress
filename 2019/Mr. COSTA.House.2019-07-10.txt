 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the United  States Women's National Soccer Team on their World Cup victory in  France.   For weeks, America's women's soccer team has captivated the  imagination  [[Page H5309]]  and the enthusiasm of not only America's soccer world, but much of that  throughout the entire globe.   Their performance over the past few weeks leaves no doubt that they  are the best team in the world, but their victory Sunday is a stinging  reminder that members of the team are being paid much less than their  male counterparts.   With four World Cup titles, four Olympic Gold Medals, and a long  history of dominance, they are the most successful team in the history  of women's soccer--more successful on the world stage than the United  States men's, their counterparts.   And what we are really talking about here is an issue that has been  out there for many years, and that is equal pay for equal work. The  highest paid male soccer player makes $200,000 more than the highest  paid female player.   Over the past 3 years, the women's team generated more revenue and  higher TV ratings than their men's counterpart.   The gap is a stark reminder of the persistent and frustrating reality  that women's sports are undervalued and their stars, simply, are  underpaid. That is a fact.   But it is not just the playing field where the women's work is  undervalued; it is also in the workforce. In the United States, women  who work full-time still earn only 80 cents, on the average, for every  dollar earned by a man. Today's wage gap robs women of over $400,000  over the course of their working lives.   So equal pay for equal work is really, I think, an incredible value  that we must pursue in this Congress. It is the fair thing. It is the  right thing to do.   In March, I joined my colleagues to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act,  which will give women tools they need to fight pay discrimination, and  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pay attention to the strong  support for the bill and to ensure that, in fact, we follow up and get  it to the President's desk.   Also, in March, the U.S. soccer team sued for equal pay, alleging  gender discrimination, with the men's team supporting their efforts.  This really goes back to title IX that was started decades ago to  ensure that, in our collegiate sports, women could have the same access  to the same sporting programs throughout our universities.   Now, this week, we are going to see parades in New York and in Los  Angeles celebrating this great world championship, this victory. But  shortly after the final whistle on Sunday solidified these women's  efforts in history books, celebratory cheers in the crowd quickly  erupted into chants of ``equal pay, equal pay,'' showing their support,  as well, for which a groundswell, I believe, is developing.   It is time, therefore, that we end pay disparity on the playing field  and in the workplace once and for all.   Congratulations to the United States Women's National Soccer Team. Go  USA and equal pay.                          In Honor of Gene Haagenson     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to recognize and honor the  career of Gene Haagenson on his retirement.   A successful television news reporter for four decades, Gene spent  the past 27 years covering stories throughout my home in the San  Joaquin Valley for KFSN TV, Channel 30. He had the pleasure of working  with so many of us over the years.   An adept, smart reporter, he is known and respected for not only his  fair reporting, hard-hitting questions, and the embodiment of a true  professional, he did his homework. He knew what he was talking about.   Gene's professionalism, his commitment to fair and balanced reporting  will be missed, but he leaves a robust foundation for future  journalists to build upon. He is a mentor, and he is a teacher.   I wish him the very best with his family and his grandchildren in his  new exciting phase of life.   But I will encourage him, as I have before, that he use all these  skills that he has honed over the years and teach, teach in our  colleges and universities, the future journalists of America, to ensure  that we have a vibrant, fair, and free press that is the cornerstone of  our democracy. Gene has a lot more to give, and I hope he does so.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Gene  Haagenson for his achievements, his outstanding commitment to Fresno,  the San Joaquin Valley, and to our country, for always--always-- standing for a free and fair press.                            ____________________
