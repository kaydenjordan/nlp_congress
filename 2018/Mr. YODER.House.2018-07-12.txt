 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Danish Khan and  Stephen Lowe from Blue Valley Southwest High School, who became the  first Kansas team to win the National Speech and Debate Association's  national tournament.   Their tireless work over the past year paved the way for them to win  this 5-day tournament, which is the largest academic competition in the  world. Danish and Stephen debated government funding and regulation of  education, a few topics that we continue to debate here in Congress.   In high school, I, too, was on the debate team and went to State.  Although I never won a tournament quite this size, I still use what I  learned there today while debating important issues before Congress.   Danish and Stephen's amazing accomplishment speaks volumes about  their talents, as well as our amazing schools in the Third District of  Kansas and the teachers they have, including their debate coach, Jared  Zuckerman.   Mr. Speaker, these students are our future leaders, and we can expect  great things. Good luck to Danish and Stephen as they continue their  debate careers in college. I look forward to seeing what other amazing  accomplishments Third District students of Kansas will make as well.                            ____________________
