 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--I appreciate  Senator Cotton joining me on the floor and his work with Senator  McConnell on this.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the following  nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 660, 661, 663, 739, 740, 741, 742,  804, 805, and 859; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc  without intervening action or debate; the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in  the Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    I thank Senator Cotton for working together on this. These  nominations are very important to our States. I heard Senator McConnell  earlier talking about crime on the streets, and getting these people in  place is really important. It has been 473 days since the 6 million  people in the Northern District of Ohio last had a permanent U.S.  attorney.   The pandemic is causing an alarming rise in violent crime, especially  gun crimes. The Northern District is no exception. The U.S. Attorney's  Office has experienced its highest caseload in 30 years by filing a  record 846 indictments in 2021. Even before the pandemic, the district  had a staggering caseload. Last year, there were 170 homicides in the  city I live in, the city of Cleveland--another 30-year record--not to  mention the surge in carjackings. Filling this important law  enforcement position to keep our community safe is essential.   I hear from police officers in desperate need of help. They need more  resources, whether it is bulletproof vests to support local law  enforcement, operations training to engage with those they serve, or  getting U.S. marshals and U.S. attorneys on the job. Today, with  Senator Cotton, we are able to do that.   We have an extremely qualified nominee ready and eager to serve.  Marisa Darden is a seasoned prosecutor with extensive experience as the  lead attorney in both criminal and civil cases. No one has any  objections to her. Nobody has any doubt about her accomplishments and  capacity to excel in this job. She was assistant U.S. attorney in the  Northern District and was recognized for her work on several complex  legal cases. She received the National High Intensity Drug Trafficking  Area Award for Outstanding Opioid Investigative Effort. She received  the Award for Outstanding Investigative Effort--a different one--in  2019. She has significant management experience and a record of strong  leadership.   Federal Judge Benita Pearson said:         You can be assured Ms. Darden will fiercely enforce the law       while treating all--attorneys, staff, the accused, and the       community--with respect and appropriate sensitivity.    Former Acting U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman, a Republican--the last  confirmed U.S. attorney in the Northern District--described her as an  attorney ``of outstanding ability and unquestioned integrity.''   First Assistant Federal Public Defender Jacqueline Johnson wrote her  first recommendation for a U.S. attorney in 38 years of practice-- imagine that. She said that she ``possesses the intellect, vision,  temperament, and judgment needed to lead [this] office.''   DEA Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin echoed those comments,  saying that ``she is one of the best he has encountered.''   It is because of these qualifications that Senator Portman has joined  me in supporting Ms. Darden's nomination.   Her confirmation would be historic, making her the first African- American woman to serve as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of  Ohio.   Today, we come together to get qualified and talented law enforcement  professionals on the job. I thank Senator Cotton for his cooperation on  this, and I thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Baldwin, for her work.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank both her and Senator Cotton for  their service to our country.
