 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2030, the  Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan. My State is one of the four  upper division States, and Utah gets 22 percent of its total water  supply from the Colorado River.   The water is not only the lifeblood for farmers and ranchers in  eastern Utah. It also supplies culinary water to the Wasatch Front, a  fast-growing urban area where most of the State's residents live.  [[Page H3115]]    Since the year 2000, the Colorado River Basin and the State of Utah  have been in severe drought. We don't know whether this drought will  continue or, due to climate change, may permanently alter the river as  a source of water. In the meantime, demand for water continues to rise.   Both Lake Powell and Lake Mead appear to be operating as designed,  but both are at uncomfortably low levels. Congress must act promptly on  this legislation so that the new agreement can be implemented and water  conservation efforts can get underway.   The Upper Basin Drought Contingency Plan is aimed at protecting upper  basin water supplies by keeping Lake Powell from falling below a  specified critical elevation. Taking steps now to avoid that just makes  sense and helps ensure that hydropower needs, water delivery, and  protections for endangered species continue in compliance with the  Colorado River Compact.   I strongly support this bipartisan, collaborative measure that builds  on past efforts to decrease stress on basin water supplies and lets  States and water users drive the decision, rather than have the Federal  Government make unilateral water delivery cutbacks.   I thank Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member   Rob Bishop, my Utah  colleague, for bringing this legislation to the floor promptly. It has  the backing of Utah's four House Members, and it is supported by the  State of Utah.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing it signed into law.
