 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank  Congressman Jason Smith for his work as the ranking Republican on the  Budget Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I know the Democrats in the House are excited because  all their work has even transpired all the way to Nevada, because now  the socialist Democratic wing of the party has taken over there as  well.   From H.R. 1 to voting to defund the police, House Democrats have  abandoned any pretense of unity. They passed three major bills in one  month with zero bipartisan support.    Today, they plan to pass another. Like the others, it represents a  missed opportunity for Congress to focus on the real needs of the  American people. At $1.9 trillion in new spending, the so-called  American Rescue Plan is the most expensive single bill in American  history.   Let's put that number in context, Mr. Speaker. If you put it in  today's numbers, World War II cost our government $4.8 trillion. But if  we pass this bill, our country's total relief, COVID relief, spending  will now total $5.5 trillion. This so-called relief bill will end up  costing every hardworking taxpayer in America more than $5,000 each.  You send the government your tax dollars, but you only get a fraction  of what you pay for, at the very best.   You know, we warn people on the internet about email scams. It is  like one of those emails where you get a promise you will get millions  of dollars, but first you have to wire them some money. That is exactly  what is happening here today.   This is the reality of the bill before us. It showers money on  special interests, but spends less than 9 percent on actually defeating  the virus. But it gives San Francisco $600 million, essentially wiping  out 92 percent of their budget deficit.   Think about that: 9 percent on the virus. But, Mr. Speaker, San  Francisco, the home to our Speaker, gets to wipe out 92 percent of  their budget deficit.   Where does that money come from?  [[Page H1266]]    Well, every American is now going to pay more than $5,000 so we can  send it to San Francisco and give them 92 percent of their budget  deficit. Interesting how socialism works.   In both the House and the Senate, the only bipartisan vote has been  against this. And after five relief bills, it is on track to be the  first passed by strictly party lines.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard people across the country say this bill  today is costly, corrupt, and liberal. Now even the Biden White House  agrees: It is very liberal. They called this the most progressive piece  of legislation in history.   For those who are watching, progressive means socialism, the same  party that runs here, and now the Democratic Party of Nevada is the  socialist Democratic Party.   So let's be clear. This isn't a rescue bill. It isn't a relief bill.  It is a laundry list of left-wing priorities that predate the pandemic  and do not meet the needs of American families. No wonder even House  Democrats have said they are embarrassed by what is in it. And just  this week, one of their own Members said, ``There is no question there  is some waste in there.'' But they will still vote for it anyway.   In fact, if you are a member of the swamp, you do pretty well under  this bill. But for the American people, it means serious problems  immediately on the horizon.   Consider this: Mr. Speaker, it will only be Democrats who vote for  this bill that will cause $36 billion in cuts to Medicare starting this  year. What they choose to do is cut Medicare to those who need it and  send $600 million to San Francisco to pay for 92 percent of their  budget deficit.   Or consider K-12 education. Democrats say they need $130 billion to  reopen schools, but their bill only allocates $6 billion to help  schools this fiscal year. Two-thirds of the total funding for education  won't even be spent until 2023 or later.   But don't worry, San Francisco will get their money now. The schools  need to wait. You have priorities.   Do Democrats expect schools to reopen 2 years from now?   I guess that is what they are saying with this bill. They have no  plan to get children back in the classroom full time.   This week marks the 1-year anniversary of school districts across the  country switching to school behind a screen. We still don't know the  full effects of this decision, but we do know keeping classrooms closed  has created an education and mental health problem for students and  parents. It has been a lost year for our children's education. And even  more devastating, one in four young adults has struggled with suicidal  thoughts.   Experience and scientific evidence say reopen schools now. It is  necessary and it is safe.   Mr. Speaker, the last time this bill was on the floor, we offered an  amendment to take that money for that subway just outside of San  Francisco and put that money for the children's mental health and  others. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, all the Democrats said was, no;  that subway by San Francisco was more important.   But, fortunately, we were able to remove that from the bill in the  Senate. But luckily here, all the Democrats were able to think the  priority is not children; it was San Francisco. But because Democrats  are following the demands of special interests, not science, they are  telling children to wait with no end in sight.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the Democrats on the other side  because they put their money where their mouth is. They are telling the  American public: First give me $5,000. I know you have to work harder,  but what I am going to do--because this is how socialism works, the  Democrats are now going to decide who should get that money. And you  know what? At least they give it to the people they respect the most.   So let's go through this. Compared to the subsidies for the swamp,  Democrats want to give Federal employees, who have not been laid off,  an extra $21,000 to help cope with virtual schooling. But if you are in  the private sector or if you have been laid off, you don't get any of  that. But what they want to do is take the money from you, give it to  any Federal employee, who gets a bonus of $21,000, even though they  have never been laid off work.   So if you are in Washington, in the swamp, you are part of the team.  If you are a hardworking taxpayer, sorry, you just send a bill. But if  you are in San Francisco, we are going to help pay for your deficit.                                time  1100    What does it say to the millions of mothers and fathers who had to  quit their job to take care of their kids at home or in school? Or  compare that to Title X. This bill will allow organizations like  Planned Parenthood to access $50 million.   You know, Mr. Speaker, for decades in this body we respected one  another's opinion. We created the Hyde amendment that said we would not  use taxpayer funds for abortion, but when there is a pandemic and a  socialist reign, we are going to charge you $5,000 regardless of how  you feel about it, and that is where the money is going to be spent.   Now, the Democrats believe schools should wait a couple years to get  their money, but not Planned Parenthood. We have to get that money  there quick.   Or compare it to how we fund States, Mr. Speaker. We have always had  a formula, but, Mr. Speaker, now that we are going to do the bill this  way where there is only one-party rule, we are going to change the  formula of how States can get their money.   So let's analyze that. Democrats claim States and local governments  need $350 billion.   Now, where do they get that number?   Well, if they read the headlines, it would confirm States are not in  financial distress. Nearly half saw an increase in revenue last year.  And some, even including my home State of California, they have a  budget surplus.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I understand in Washington they maybe don't  understand what the word ``surplus'' means; that means you have more  money, that you actually saved money. What California is going to get  is a windfall.   Remember, San Francisco is in California. Mr. Speaker, that just  happens to be the Speaker's district, as well. They have a $650 million  deficit.   Now, some of the challenges that San Francisco has--you see, if you  are in San Francisco and you are homeless, they will pay for your  alcohol and they will pay for your cannabis. So it costs more money. So  that is why you have a deficit.   But it is okay because we don't need to send the schools money today,  we can send that years from now, but we need to get San Francisco 92  percent of their deficit taken care of.   Now, we have a pandemic going on, and we are going to spend $1.9  trillion, but only 9 percent of that needs to go to COVID because San  Francisco needs a lot of money.   So what they have done now is they reward bad behavior. That is one  of the few places that is facing a shortfall. They are actually  punishing States that did it right. American taxpayers didn't vote for  this, but thanks to the blue State payout, they are. The bill rewards  bad behavior.   Now, President Biden, he hasn't had a press conference, but he did  say one time, and someone picked it up, ``Show me what to cut.''   Well, the Senate actually cut tens of billions of dollars in spending  from the Biden bill that the House passed.   Now, I feel bad, Mr. Speaker, because Speaker Pelosi at first had,  like, $112 million for that really important COVID subway just outside  of San Francisco. Now, before that bill was able to get to the floor  and the public found out about it--I guess it got good press because  they added more money to it--it got to $140 million.   Now, when it came to the floor here, there was a group of people-- well, Mr. Speaker, let's just say who it was, it was the Republicans,  they thought a better priority was to spend that $140 million for  children with mental health issues because we have watched study after  study of children being left out of school; suicide, obesity.   What about those children who have parents who don't work for the  Federal Government? They don't get a bonus. And some of those parents  had to quit their job to care for their children.   So Republicans thought--I know it is a small amount compared to $1.9  trillion--we thought, wouldn't that be a better use of the money? So we  offered  [[Page H1267]]  that on this floor, Mr. Speaker. But unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the  Democrats said ``no'' to that, that this subway was more important than  the children.   Well, luckily on the Senate side, they took that out. Whoa, Mr.  Speaker, the American public thought for one moment maybe the price  could get a little lower and that Americans wouldn't have to pay $5,000  a person. Maybe they saved a little money. No, no, no, no, no.   You see, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are in charge of the Senate, too,  so they now decided since they couldn't build a subway, they would just  plus that money up.   So where did they spend it? Well, Mr. Speaker, you have got to give  them credit. They took the same advice that the Democrats in the House  had. You see, they added an extra $25,000 bonus for State employees.  Let's just not reward the employees of the Federal Government that  haven't been laid off, let's reward the State employees who haven't  been laid off. They get a $25,000 bonus.   Isn't that amazing? I wonder where the money comes from?   Oh, yes, Mr. Speaker, it comes from the American people, the  hardworking taxpayers. You see, they all need to send the government  $5,000 so you can decide where to spend it. And if you are part of the  swamp, that is a pretty good reward. $25,000.   And then they added $15 billion for taxpayer-funded healthcare  subsidies that illegal immigrants are eligible for.   Now, you know this, Mr. Speaker, based upon your district and others,  you know what is happening down at the border. President Biden has  created a new border crisis. There are more people able to come in, not  being tested for COVID, but lo and behold, they are now going to get  subsidized healthcare. Luckily, we can spend more money on that, Mr.  Speaker. There is probably much more coming now with the Biden border  crisis.   But will this help the people get back to work? Nope.   Will this help students get back in the classroom? Nope.    But will it help vaccines get to those who want it? Nope.   But will it help take care of 92 percent of San Francisco's budget  deficit?   Oh, yes, it will. Yes, it will.   It just throws out money without accountability even though there are  a trillion dollars sitting there right now that have already been  appropriated that can go out to help.   Remember what Margaret Thatcher said, Mr. Speaker: ``The problem with  socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.'' You  have been doing a very good job of it so far.   There is still work to do to defeat the virus, but it is clear we are  nearing the final phase of the fight. For 12 terrible months, the  American worker has struggled through lockdowns, sacrificed through  closures, and suffered through mandates. They persevered through it  all. And now their government wants to take $5,000 more of it to make  sure a Federal employee that wasn't laid off, a State employee that  wasn't laid off gets bonuses. And lo and behold, we have got to make  sure San Francisco gets their deficit taken care of. Not in 2 years  like the schools, but today.   President Trump's Operation Warp Speed, previous bipartisan efforts  in Congress, and the American people worked tirelessly toward that  outcome. President Biden was set up for success both economically and  with vaccines, but in that short amount of time what have they been  able to accomplish down at the Biden administration? They have raised  our gasoline prices, so not only are you asking them to pay for this  bill, you are taking more out of their pocket, and at the same time by  a stroke of a pen he laid off millions of those workers.   Mr. Speaker, I know this for sure, I know where you serve, and I know  your passion for serving. I know the people in your district that are  getting laid off for the XL pipeline. I know that wasn't your wish. It  is harder to pay a bigger tax bill when you don't have a job.   It is even worse when that job was taken away by your President.   It is even worse when you go out to look for a new job and that same  President has changed the policy along the border, and now you are  competing with people who are not even Americans; and they are getting  subsidized healthcare because of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American public wants something different.  I believe they are proud of the fact we did something here that was  bipartisan.   I believe they were proud of the fact that because of Operation Warp  Speed we now have three vaccines.   I believe they were proud when we were energy independent.   I believe they were proud when they had more money in their pocket,  and they didn't have to pay so much for gasoline.   Mr. Speaker, socialism has destroyed many countries. I just watched  Venezuela offer new currency. What was it, a million, a billion dollars  is worth 50 cents today? How did it all start? I have watched socialism  grow in this country. I have watched it grow in this body. I see within  your own party you no longer even fear to say that you are Democrats  anymore, Mr. Speaker. You are socialist Democrats. That is the lead of  the Democratic party. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee isn't even registered as a Democrat. So what would you think  would be produced?   Mr. Speaker, whoever votes for this bill, I want you to look the  people in the eye. I want you to think about that hardworking taxpayer.  I want you to explain to them why only 9 percent goes to defeat COVID.  Why do they have to give $5,000, and you redistribute it to people who  weren't even laid off? You give bonuses to the things you care most  about.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard our Speaker say many times where you spend  your money shows your values. Well, she does represent San Francisco,  Mr. Speaker, but we don't. Ninety-two percent of the budget deficit of  San Francisco is going to be paid with this bill.   But for that parent out there who has been struggling for the last  year that has had to be the teacher, the tutor, the coach, the music  instructor, the recess participant, help is not on the way. Help is not  on the way.   For those who studied government and always thought working something  bipartisan would be positive, that is no longer the case.   For those who thought they could have a fair debate on the floor, you  take away even the offer to have an amendment. And when we do and we  prioritize the children of this Nation over a subway in a district not  far from our Speaker, the majority party walks in line.   Mr. Speaker, we are so much better than this. We proved it five other  times. What a difference it makes by a simple new control of a power  that people want.   Mr. Speaker, when you study history, there is a saying in a book  called ``The Prince'' by Machiavelli: ``Absolute power corrupts  absolutely.'' The first indication to know if it happens, take a look  at the vote. There will be a bipartisan vote against this bill.   You can wave to me. It is okay. I want you to wave to the American  public when they have to wave away $5,000, so a Federal employee that  never has been laid off gets $21,000 to deal with their children being  at home. Who is going to represent them? Who is going to be their  voice?   Mr. Speaker, I will promise you this: We will never stop listening to  those voices. We will never stop fighting for those voices. And there  will be a day that that will be the majority voice in this House.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I have not seen that this year.   History will not be kind about what transpires today, but I still  believe that America is a great hope for the future, that we are all  conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that we are all  equal.   But in this body it seems as though only one can have a voice, but  that will not last long and that will change shortly.
