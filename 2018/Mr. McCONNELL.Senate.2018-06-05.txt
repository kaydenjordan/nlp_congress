 Madam President, yesterday, the Senate advanced the  nomination of Robert Wier to serve on the Eastern District Court of  Kentucky by a vote of 90 to 1. This was a needless delay, but I look  forward to confirming this well-qualified nominee later this morning.   Next, the Senate will turn to Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., the  President's selection to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern  District of Texas. Mr. Rodriguez is a graduate of Yale and the  University of Texas. He earned recognition for his tireless efforts to  combat human trafficking. His peers praise his work ethic and his knack  for tackling complicated issues.   President Trump continues to send us impressive judicial nominees  with sterling qualifications. I would urge all of my colleagues to join  me in voting to promptly confirm this slate.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, Madam President, the Senate  took a major step forward on behalf of our national defense. After  years of harmful spending caps undermining the combat readiness of our  armed services, we brokered a 2-year spending agreement that included  the largest year-on-year increase in defense funding in 15 years. This  significant accomplishment laid out a roadmap to deliver on the  promises we make to our warfighters. Now it is time to take the next  step and authorize the programs that are most needed. That is why the  Senate will soon be turning to the John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act.   Each year, reviewing the President's budget request provides an  opportunity to hear directly from our Nation's military leaders about  their needs. Months of hearings and markups allow Congress to direct  resources and authorize programs, equipping our brave service men and  women to confront emerging challenges.   The Armed Services Committee should be commended for their earnest,  bipartisan work this year. The legislation they have produced is  strong.   Following our agreement that eliminated harmful and arbitrary caps on  defense spending, this legislation will add to the process of untying  our commanders' hands. It authorizes $716 billion for national defense,  enough for the Department of Defense to implement the national defense  strategy and replenish and modernize America's fighting forces--as long  as we meet our overall responsibility and pass the Defense  appropriations bill later this year.   This authorization would expand our capabilities on the sea and in  the air, provide long-term certainty and support for our All-Volunteer  Force, renew oversight efforts, streamline personnel management,  modernize acquisitions, and eliminate duplicative and wasteful  programs. It sends a clear message that we have our warfighters' backs.  How fitting, then, that it is named for our colleague, Senator McCain-- a stalwart champion for our service men and women if this Chamber has  ever seen one.   I look forward to discussing this legislation at length in the coming  days.                            ____________________     Now, on a final matter, Madam President, I spoke  yesterday about the new job opportunities flooding into the U.S.  economy. It is all thanks to the ingenuity of American workers and job  creators, with an assist from Republican policies.   Just this year, more than 1 million new jobs have been created, more  than 3 million new jobs since January of 2017. The unemployment rate  has sunk to 3.8 percent. It hasn't been that low in 18 years. In a big  shift from the deeply uneven Obama era, communities all across America  are getting in on the action. Rural areas led the whole Nation in  relative job creation last year. Let me say that again. Rural areas led  the whole Nation in relative job creation last year. Republicans are  proud of the historic tax reform and  [[Page S2974]]  dramatic regulatory reform that helped make that happen.   In addition to these nationwide policies, we are also delivering  targeted strategies to help the specific communities that have suffered  the most.   In many parts of the country, including my home State of Kentucky,  the Obama-era economic lag has intertwined with another major problem:  the opioid epidemic. By one estimate, in 2016, more than 2 million  Americans--2 million--were addicted to opioids.   This crisis that is shattering families and communities is not an  isolated medical issue. There is a reason experts describe many of  these fatalities as ``deaths of despair.'' It is, in part, a symptom of  declining opportunity and communities literally falling apart. Recent  studies suggest that opioid use increased the most in precisely the  communities where employment rates have fallen the most, particularly  in the manufacturing sector.   Complex problems demand comprehensive solutions, and that is exactly  what this Congress will continue to deliver. We are attacking this from  all angles. In a strong bipartisan fashion, we passed the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act to bolster  prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. I recently introduced the  CAREER Act to help recovering addicts find jobs and stable housing to  get back on their feet, and the Senate allocated billions in resources  for treatment and prevention on the frontlines.   The robust Federal response is helping our first responders and  professionals combat the dangers of abuse, but, as is always the case,  major challenges are rarely solved here in Washington. Congress can  provide resources and support to vulnerable communities, but often we  do the most good by getting government's foot off the brake and letting  American innovators get back to business.   For example, I recently heard some great news from one private sector  problem-solver in my home State of Kentucky. In my hometown, US  WorldMeds has spent the last 15 years working to bring relief to  millions of Americans touched by opioid addiction. They have been  working on introducing a medicine in the United States to help ease the  symptoms of withdrawal. Just last month, we got word that they have  received FDA approval. US WorldMeds' CEO, Breck Jones, believes this  nonnarcotic medicine can help more addicts kick the habit altogether.   I had the opportunity to visit US WorldMeds' facility last year. I  was so impressed by what I saw. Now that team can scale up their  efforts and begin getting their treatment into the hands of Americans  whose lives it could help transform--all of it made easier when  Washington offers targeted support where it is needed but mostly gets  out of the way of the innovators. Talk about a winning combination.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
