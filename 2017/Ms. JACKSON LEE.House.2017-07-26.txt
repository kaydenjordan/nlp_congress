 Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to briefly  explain Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22.   Before I begin, let me express my appreciation and thanks to my good  friends, Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz for their  hard and constructive work in shepherding this important legislation to  the floor.   Chairman Dent and I worked together constructively for many years on  the Homeland Security Committee and he has always distinguished himself  as one of the most bipartisan members of the House.   And Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz has for years been one of the  ablest Members of this body; I thank them both for their commitment to  the important work of ensuring that our veterans receive the care and  support they have earned from a grateful nation.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 makes a modest but important improvement  to the bill by increasing the amount of funding for the ``Supportive  Services for Veterans' Families'' account by $2 million, offset by a  reduction of $2.5 million to the $4 billion allocated to the VA's  ``Information Technology Systems'' account.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   The VA's ``Supportive Services for Veterans' Families'' Program helps  veterans; and their families, who may have fallen on hard times or hit  a rough patch in life and need a little help from the country they  selflessly risked their life to defend.   Homeless veterans or veterans facing homelessness who have minor age  children are in need of special programs that allow for housing that  welcomes children.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22 will enable this vital program to serve  more veterans' families in need of help by providing a bit more funding  for grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer  cooperatives that provide supportive services to very low-income  veteran families living in or transitioning to permanent housing.   The SSVF Program ensures that eligible veteran families receive the  outreach, case management, and assistance in obtaining VA and other  benefits.   These services may include health care, daily living, legal services,  fiduciary and payee services, personal financial planning, child care,  transportation, housing counseling.   The SSVF Program enables VA staff and local homeless service  providers to work together to effectively address the unique challenges  that make it difficult for some veterans and their families to remain  stably housed.   Many homeless veterans, including in my own state of Texas, lack  housing because they lost their job or could no longer afford rent;  many suffer from an untreated mental illness that keeps them from  working.   Every day the SSVF program makes a real difference in the lives of  real people.   Veterans like the Air Force veteran who, hoping to utilize the skills  he learned in the service, instead bounced from job to job after being  discharged and found himself sleeping at night on the cold cement under  a bridge in Chicago.   Through the Thresholds Veterans Project, funded through the SSVF,  this hero received steady community service support and eventually was  placed in his own studio apartment.   He now says, in his own words: ``I have a home. I enjoy bein'  inside.''   Veterans like the one in Texas who because he lost his job at a  manufacturing plant and was unable to pay the bills, was forced to seek  shelter for himself and his family at a homeless shelter.   Fortunately, the homeless shelter was a SSVF grantee and was able to  assist the veteran obtain employment and his family in securing  affordable low-cost housing.   There are thousands of similar success stories made possible by the  SSVF Program that I could share but all of them share a common theme:  they involve veterans who served their country proudly, fell down on  their luck, picked themselves back up, and found affordable and  sustainable housing for their families because of the assistance and  support made possible by the SSVF program.   Ensuring that veterans have a place of their own to call home is the  very least we can do.   I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit  ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness  in America.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 22.                         ``Heroism Knows no Gender''         Liz (Names and some identifying information have been       changed to protect confidentiality) is an Army Veteran and a       single mom. After losing her job, she struggled to pay the       rent and provide for her daughter. Liz's landlord said she       had always been an excellent tenant but his patience was       wearing thin as her rent arrears continued to increase.       Disheartened with a fruitless job search and unsure of where       else to turn, Liz came to the Veterans Outreach Center (VOC).       She was immediately connected with a Case Manager, an       Employment Specialist, an Accredited State Veterans Benefits       Counselor, and the SSVF team.        In order to avoid the immediate crisis of homelessness, the       Services To Enable Positive Solutions (S.T.E.P.S) program at       the VOC paid Liz's rent arrears, which had escalated to an       amount that was insurmountable. Within a few short days of       connecting with the team at VOC, Liz had a job interview that       resulted in full-time, meaningful employment. In less than a       week, she had a benefits review with an on-site counselor       from the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs during       which she applied for an increase in disability compensation.       The payment of Liz's back rent allowed her and her daughter       to keep a roof over their head. With a roof over their heads       and their living situation stabilized, Liz was able to focus       on her employment and securing her benefits, which are both       components of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) that will       help Liz sustain permanent housing in the future.        The VOC was able to stabilize Liz and her daughter while       concurrently providing the supportive services necessary for       her to maintain permanent housing. The temporary financial       assistance was delivered to the landlord in a timely,       efficient manner with the help of a S.T.E.P.S collaborative       partner. Through coordinated case management, the       aforementioned supportive services were provided quickly and       effectively. The longterm result of this effort is yet to be       determined, but at the 90-day benchmark, Liz has retained       both her job and her home. She has realized this goal       independently, without requesting any additional financial       assistance. Consequently, the VOC was able to better the       lives of a mom (a Veteran) and her child immeasurably through       SSVF funding.                 ``Your Unselfish Helping Hand Gave Us Hope''         Mariano Salas and his family were the first clients to       participate in Community Psychiatric Clinic's (CPC) SSVF       program. Both Mariano and his wife had lost their jobs and       they and their young daughter were facing homelessness. The       SSVF program secured their housing and helped stabilize their       lives. Here is Mariano's story in his own words:        ``I was on the brink of giving up completely. But       truthfully one thing I can say, no words express enough our       sincerest gratitude to you in assisting my family and I       during a very difficult hardship. Desperation, fear and       depression were daily emotions upon my family. But with your       unselfish helping hand, you gave us hope, peace, and great       big smiles on our faces. Your untiring assistance has given       us tremendous hope for a better future. SSVF gave us a boost       as we are working so hard to get decent paying jobs to       support our family and put food on our table. Today, instead       of focusing all our energies on fear of being homeless, we       are focusing our energy on securing a stable job and to       become self-sufficient. My wife is working now and I have       interviews lined up so we can support ourselves and manage       our daily living expenses. I am privileged and honored to       have been served by SSVF. Thank you SSVF and GOD BLESS YOU       ALL.''        With deepest gratitude,        Mariano Salas    Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain describe Jackson  Lee Amendment No. 25, which simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of  Veteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and  Outreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part  II, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code.   This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among  veterans in the United States does not increase.   I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member  Wasserman  Schultz for their hard work in shepherding this important legislation  to the floor.   I offer Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 because I believe reducing and  eliminating  [[Page H6421]]  homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives to protect  our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest priorities.   Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in  the United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who  have given so much to us.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 will help remind us of our obligation to  provide our veterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which  includes adequately funding for programs Veterans Administration  Supportive Housing (VASH) that provide case-management services,  adequate housing facilities, mental health support, and address other  areas that contribute to veteran homelessness.   VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program  for disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical  Centers provide referrals and case management while Public Housing  Agencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers.   Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I  believe that we could be doing much more for them.   Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male  and female) who are homeless on any given night.   And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some  point during the course of a year.   Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because  of their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal  living conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard  housing.   While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among  veterans remains a big challenge.   In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and  2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162.   We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on  the uniform and fought for us.   Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very  least we can do.   Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives.   In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided  by VASH.   I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and  within my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this  funding has positively impacted many communities across this country.   In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate  the issue of homelessness.   For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been  involved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing  Veterans and their families with access to affordable housing and  medical services that will help them get back on their feet.   Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue.   I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 25 and  commit ourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran  homelessness in America.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, in these difficult times, I want to thank  the chairman and ranking member, Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur of the subcommittee, for shepherding this legislation to the  floor, and for their efforts, and the commitment that we all have to  preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment increases funding for the DOE departmental  administration by $1 million, which should be used to enhance the  Department's Environmental Justice program activities.   The Environmental Justice program is an essential tool in the effort  to improve the lives of low-income and minority communities, as well as  the environment at large. Twenty years ago, this particular program was  established directing Federal agencies to identify and address the  disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental  effects of their actions on minority and low-income populations.   So we have engaged with Historically Black Colleges, minority-serving  institutions, Tribal colleges, and other organizations to improve and  develop the sustainability through developing  [[Page H6440]]  young people and faculty to work on these important issues.   The crisis in Flint, Michigan, teaches us how important it is that  minority groups and low-income communities are not placed at a  disadvantage when it comes to environmental threats and hazards like  lead in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika  virus. I particularly remember convening a Zika task force in Houston  to ensure that areas in my community, because of the sitting water and  a lot of heat, did not breed these mosquitos to create a devastating  condition in some of our communities.   This Environmental Justice program is extremely important, involving  community education and advisory projects, community capacity building  through technology, the Community Leaders Institute, but, more  importantly, it works on important research.   Mr. Chair, might I find out how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I want to make note of the fact that in  some of the universities that participate in this program, the chairs-- meaning the faculty chairs--are a team of world-class scholars,  researchers, and educators from 14 Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, one Hispanic-serving institution, who advance research,  enhance academics, promote partnerships, and effect outreach in the  environmental sciences.   Finally, the Minority Serving Institutions Program that includes a  wide array of institutions provides funding to minority-serving  institutions to advance scientific research, student internships,  faculty fellowships, and curriculum development.   Mr. Chair, the more we can invest in science and research, helping to  improve our environment--and let me make it very clear, in urban and  rural areas. This is not an urban program only. It is urban and rural  areas. The more we can help our communities be clean and  environmentally safe and secure, the more we create a better quality of  life for all people, no matter what their economic station in life or  where they live.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment increases funding for DOE departmental administration by  $1,000,000 which should be used to enhance the Department's  Environmental Justice program activities.   Mr. Chair, the Environmental Justice Program is an essential tool in  the effort to improve the lives of low income and minority communities  as well as the environment at large.   Twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued  Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   A healthy environment sustains a productive and healthy community  which fosters personal and economic growth.   Maintaining funds for environmental justice that go to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, Tribal  Colleges, and other organizations is imperative to protecting  sustainability and growth of the community and environment.   The funding of these programs is vital to ensuring that minority  groups are not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the  environment and the continued preservation of their homes.   The crisis in Flint, Michigan teaches us how important it that  minority groups and low-income communities are not placed at a  disadvantage when it comes to environment threats and hazards like lead  in drinking water or nesting areas for mosquitos carrying the Zika  virus.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Funds that would be awarded to this important cause would increase  youth involvement in STEM fields and also promote clean energy,  weatherization, clean-up, and asset revitalization. These improvements  would provide protection to our most vulnerable groups.   This program provides better access to technology for underserved  communities. Together, the Department of Energy and Department of  Agriculture have distributed over 5,000 computers to low income  populations.   The Community Leaders Institute is another vital component of the  Environmental Justice Program. It ensures that those in leadership  positions understand what is happening in their communities and can  therefore make informed decisions in regards to their communities.   In addition to promoting environmental sustainability, CLI also  brings important factors including public health and economic  development into the discussion for community leaders.   The CLI program has been expanded to better serve Native Americans  and Alaska Natives, which is a prime example of how various other  minority groups can be assisted as well.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The  DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   Since 2002, the Tribal Energy Program has also funded 175 energy  projects amounting to over $41.8 million in order to help tribes invest  in renewable sources of energy.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can provide clean  energy options to our most underserved communities and help improve  their environments, which will yield better health outcomes and greater  public awareness.   We must help our low income and minority communities and ensure  equality for those who are most vulnerable in our country.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support the Jackson Lee Amendment  for the Environmental Justice Program.   Mr. Chair, I ask my friends and my colleagues to support the Jackson  Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am going to take this opportunity  just to show this picture to my colleagues on the floor of the House  and the headline that says: ``Urban Flooding in Houston is on the  Rise.''   I clearly just used the city of Houston by coincidence, but I will  tell you that this is what we are facing, really, across America.   The opening sentence of the article says: ``Before you can fix a  problem, you need to know what's causing it.''   My amendment is just that. My amendment--as I thank Chairman Simpson  and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work on this legislation in doing  the best that we can under the circumstances of trying to preserve the  balance--speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers' investigations account by redirecting $3 million for  increased funding for postdisaster watershed assessment studies, like  the one that has been contemplated in many areas around the country.   As the Federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a  critical role in building, maintaining, and expanding the most critical  of the Nation's infrastructure.   When questioning the Army Corps of Engineers about a certain area in  my community covering a number of bayous, which we are called The Bayou  City--Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting  Bayou, and Clear Creek Bayou--it is the same all over the Nation: the  Army Corps of Engineers said they need to study the issue to know how  to best resolve it.   My amendment is just that. It is resources to be directed to ensure  that we are allowed to study issues so that we can focus the dollars  correctly as we attempt to work collaboratively with our local  communities.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I make this point:  such a study is certainly needed, given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in many parts around our Nation and in the  area in which I live.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12-hour period.   Let me be very mindful, this is not an earmark. It simply says that  we should have the resources to study these issues so that we can  direct moneys in the right way.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, let me conclude my remarks by  indicating that I believe this particular amendment will be helpful in  general to, in essence, provide funding for the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers' investigations account and ensuring that a postdisaster  watershed assessment can result.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Ms. Kaptur in particular. We have  spoken about this for probably over a 2-year period. I think the very  fact that my particular area can be cited as an example of what happens  when you have urban flooding is just an example.   Over this past summer, we know that we have had some serious loss of  life when rivers have overflowed or areas where water is and people  have been recreating have overflowed, and so the idea of saving lives  is part of my amendment as well.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers ``Investigations'' account by redirecting $3 million  for increased funding for post-disaster watershed assessment studies,  like the one that is being contemplated for the Houston/Harris County  metropolitan area.   As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a  critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding of the most  critical of the nation's infrastructure.   We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the  Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent.   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.   Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:  Sims Bayou, Greens Bayou, Brays Bayou, White Oak Bayou, Hunting Bayou,  and Clear Creek.   In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers  operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in  northwest Harris County.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased that the bill provides that the Secretary of  the Army may initiate up to six new study starts during fiscal year  2018, and that five of those studies are to consist of studies where  the majority of the benefits are derived from flood and storm damage  reduction or from navigation transportation savings.   I am optimistic that one of those new study starts will be the  Houston Regional Watershed Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility  study.   Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston  metropolitan area.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas  exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.   The areas that experience these historic rainfalls were west of I-45,  north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.   Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the  Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.   The purpose of the Houston Regional Watershed Assessment is to  identify risk reduction measures and optimize performance from a multi- objective systems performance perspective of the regional network of  nested and intermingled watersheds, reservoir dams, flood flow  conveyance channels, storm water detention basins, and related Flood  Risk Management (FRM) infrastructure.   Special emphases of the study, which covers 22 primary watersheds  within Harris County's 1,756 square miles, will be placed on extreme  flood events that exceed the system capacity resulting in impacts to  asset conditions/functions and loss of life.   Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were  flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400  homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.   The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at  $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be  well above $2 billion.   Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and  Harris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter  of national significance because the region is one of the nation's  major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  56.   I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in  shepherding this bill to the floor.                      [From the Houston Public Media]                  Urban Flooding in Houston Is on the Rise                           (By Marissa Cummings)         Before you can fix a problem, you need to know what's       causing it.  [[Page H6448]]         Dr. Sam Brody, Professor at A&M Galveston, is doing exactly       that.        He focuses on urban flooding and says Houston is the poster       child.        ``The bigger driver of this urban flood problem is human       development, it's the spread of impervious surfaces and I       calculated the Houston region increased its pavement by 25       percent over a 15 year period from 1996 to 2010,'' says       Brody.        He is also contributing to national research that will help       alleviate urban flooding across the U.S.        Stephen Costello, Houston's Flood Czar, agrees with Brody's       assessment.        Part of the solution he says is investing in innovative       infrastructure.        ``But there has to be a commitment on the part of the       community to invest in infrastructure,'' Costello says. ``And       that's what the voters should be looking at saying `OK, so       let's make sure we continue to invest in the infrastructure,'       and that's where the public needs to get involved.''        Although, we cannot stop flooding from happening, Costello       says we need to mitigate and reduce the risk.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I again thank the chairman and the  ranking member of the subcommittee for this very critical work.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers' construction account by redirecting $100 million  for increased funding for critical construction projects like those  projects that are current and future projects throughout the Nation.   As a Federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, and flood and storm damage reduction,  it is important that the Army Corps of Engineers and the construction  unit have the funding to focus its resources around the Nation again.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in the  building, maintaining, and expanding of the most critical of the  Nation's infrastructures.   The Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  has an important responsibility, and it is to ensure the safety of the  Nation's waterways.   Some of these waterways are in and around many of our States,  particularly in the State of Texas. Not only do we have a concept of  bayous, but, for example, we are surrounded in many parts by the Gulf.  We have an enormous amount of water in rivers, and the Army Corps of  Engineers is particularly important as it relates to flooding.   But we have seen flooding across America. So this particular  amendment is to ensure that resources are there as Americans face  unusual flooding that has been occurring over the last decades.   I will give you an example. During May 2015, in the Houston flood,  3,015 homes were flooded and eight people died. During the April 2016  Houston flood, 5,400 homes were flooded and eight deaths were recorded.  The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at $3  billion.   I want my colleagues to know that this amendment is not for a region  or an area. It is really to help the Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude by simply thanking the  committee and staff and, again, reminding individuals that we can save  lives through the work of the Army Corps of Engineers in stopping  flooding that impacts not only my region of the country, but really  across the country.   I conclude with one final statement: We in our community are entering  hurricane season. This will be a very important amendment as we enter  hurricane season all over the Nation.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers ``Construction'' account by redirecting $100 million  for increased funding for critical construction projects, like those  current and future projects proposed for the Houston/Harris County  metropolitan area.

The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.

Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston  metropolitan area, it is clear that much more needs to be done to  minimize the vulnerability of the nation's 4th largest metropolitan  area and economic engine from the flood damage.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas  exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.

Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the  Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.   Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were  flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400  homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.   The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at  $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be  well above $2 billion.   Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and  Harris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter  of national significance because the region is one of the nation's  major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  57.   I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in  shepherding this bill to the floor.   Mr. Chairman, I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a very simple  amendment that promotes STEM education, which is really a vital part of  the future of this Nation.   In particular, my amendment says: ``None of the funds made available  by this act for `Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Science' may be  used in contravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act.''   This amendment was approved and adopted just in the last session.  Twenty years ago, on February 11, we were directed to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   The Department of Energy ceased to provide equal access in these  opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including  minorities, Native Americans, and women.   Mr. Chairman, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college  students, but only 45 percent of undergraduates  [[Page H6456]]  are STEM degree holders. This large pool of untapped talent is a great  potential source of STEM professional, but it also deprives the United  States of its best minds to be able to help it in the 21st century.   As the Nation's demographics are shifting and now more children under  the age of 1 are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in  the number of minorities who seek system opportunities.   Mr. Chairman, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to  be solved. And perhaps one of these days, a minority engineer or  biologist will come up with some of the solutions.   As many have done in the past, the larger point is that we need more  STEM educators and more minorities to qualify them. My amendment turns  our importance to the importance of energy and science education  programs, funded in part by this bill, and will help to ensure that  members of unrepresented communities are not placed at a disadvantage  when it comes to environmental sustainability, preservation, and  health.                                time  2330    Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me take note of some of the colleagues  that I have had the privilege of being neighbors to. NASA's Johnson  Space Center is, if I might say, one of the neighbors of my community,  great respect for the astronauts; Major Bolden, who serves as head of  NASA; and Mae Jemison is my neighbor, the first African-American woman  who went into space. I want more of those individuals coming from our  Nation's schools, and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment  that will encourage those in low-income communities and minorities,  Native Americans, and others to join in and support the opportunities  for STEM education.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 58 simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for `Department of  Energy--Energy Programs--Science' be used in contravention of the  Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).''   This amendment was approved and adopted in identical form on April  29, 2015, during the 114th Congress as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the  Energy and Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2016.   Mr. Chair, twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton  issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify  and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these  opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including  minorities, Native Americans, and women.   Mr. Chair, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college  students, but only 45 percent of undergraduate STEM degree holders.   This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of  STEM professionals.   As the nation's demographics are shifting and now most children under  the age of one are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in  the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities.   I encourage Energy Secretary Perry to surpass the commitment of his  predecessors' toward increasing the nation's economic competitiveness  and enabling more of our people to realize their full potential.   Mr. Chair, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be  solved--and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist  will come-up with some of the solutions.   The larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more  minorities to qualify for them.   The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill  will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not  placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental  sustainability, preservation, and health.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.   The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase  diversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved  communities, and help improve their environments, which will yield  better health outcomes and greater public awareness.   But most importantly businesses will have more consumers to whom they  may engage in related commercial activities.   My amendment will help ensure that underrepresented communities are  able to participate and contribute equitably in the energy and  scientific future.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  58.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
