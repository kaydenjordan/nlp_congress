 Mr. President, I wish to recognize and  congratulate LTG Ronald L. Burgess, Jr., on his retirement as Auburn  University's executive vice president and express my gratitude for his  many contributions to our Nation and to the State of Alabama.

His military education includes the  Armor Officer Basic Course, the Military Intelligence Officers Advanced  Course, the Command and General Staff College, the Advanced Military  Studies Program, and the Air War College.   Early in his career, General Burgess's staff and command positions  included assignments in armor and military intelligence units in  Berlin, Germany, and at Fort Stewart and Fort Benning, GA, as well as  Fort Richardson, AK. Some of his key positions included assistant  executive officer to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence,  Washington, DC, in 1990, and battalion commander, 25th Infantry  Division (Light) at Schofield Barracks, HI, from 1993 to 1994.
