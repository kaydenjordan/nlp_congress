 Mr. President, as I have discussed all week, the war  in Ukraine has forced some of America's closest allies to sober up and  start investing more seriously in their own defense.   Germany is exhibit A. Yesterday, Germany's Government released a  comprehensive security strategy--another important step forward for a  key member of the transatlantic alliance--but, as I mentioned at the  Munich Security Conference, questions remain about whether the  encouraging changes in Germany will be sufficient or enduring.   Some of these questions are being answered. Germany's national  security strategy is an incremental shift. It is the product of a  rather divided government, like our own, reaching difficult consensus,  except with three different, sometimes internally divided political  parties rather than just two.   But just consider where our German allies were before Putin's  escalation. Europe's most powerful economy had let a major portion of  its military fall into literal disrepair. German military spending  reached barely halfway--halfway--to NATO's member target of 2 percent  of GDP. And the country's precarious reliance on Russian energy was  actually only increasing.   But as Ukraine dug in for a fight last February, Germany changed  course. In the last 18 months, Berlin has made major contributions of  key lethal capabilities to the Ukrainian cause and is on track to  provide even more. The new German security strategy is clear-eyed about  the Russian threat, and in light of hard-learned lessons, it  prioritizes reducing dependence on foreign energy and integrating  economic and security policy.   As Foreign Minister Baerbock put it this week:         We paid for every cubic metre of Russian gas twofold and       threefold with our national security.    None of us should want to make the same mistake when it comes to  Beijing, and in this regard, Germany's strategy indicates incremental  progress toward a more realistic understanding of the challenge a  revisionist power and systemic rival like China poses not only to  neighbors but to the West as well. Germany's governing coalition  continues to debate its approach to the PRC, and answers to how Germany  plans to manage it are still forthcoming.   The world will want to know how Germany will balance growing realism  about Beijing's behavior with its stated desire for economic  partnership with China. They will want to know what Germany is prepared  to do to assist vulnerable Asian countries that are the most threatened  by the PRC's military aggression, espionage, and economic or diplomatic  pressure. Of course, these same questions can still be asked about our  own government's approach to the PRC.   More broadly, I am encouraged that Germany's strategy explicitly  recognizes robust defense as a pillar--a pillar--of German security.   I have criticized Germany's slow pace of defense spending to meet  urgent needs, but I am encouraged by Germany's new Minister of Defense,  Boris Pistorius, who has a focus on rebuilding Germany's military and  cutting through its calcified military procurement bureaucracy. To be  successful, he will need cross-party political support and sustained  defense spending above 2 percent of Germany's GDP. This new strategy  does not necessarily guarantee such a commitment.   Ultimately, the biggest question for our German allies is whether  their strategy sufficiently defines the priorities of their government  and whether it provides the resources necessary to execute it. The very  same question still applies to America's own national security  strategy.
