 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353,  the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century  Act.   High school, community college, and trade school students in Houston  and Harris County, Texas deserve the opportunity to receive a high- quality career and technical education (CTE). CTE education is the  pathway for many in our community and throughout our great country to a  good paying job and the middle class.   High-quality CTE programs are critical for our nation's economy.  Nearly every sector of our economy, from refiners and shipbuilders  along the Houston Ship Channel to medical device manufacturers and  information technology firms, rely on skilled STEM-educated workers to  innovate and compete in the global marketplace.   For over thirty years, the federal government has provided direct  support to CTE programs nationwide through the Perkins Career and  Technical Education Act. Congress has not successfully reauthorized the  Perkins Act in 11 years, delaying the needed reforms and additional  resources our CTE students deserve.   Today's legislation delivers the reforms and resources that will help  improve our local career and technical education programs. The  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act  will provide states more flexibility in the use of federal resources in  response to changes in education and the economy and reduce  administrative burdens and simplify the process for states to apply for  federal resources. This legislation will increase federal investment in  CTE program by nine percent over the life of the authorization and  reward success and innovation in CTE program practices that have been  proven to best serve students and employers.   I ask all my colleagues to join in supporting this bipartisan  legislation that is broadly supported by job creators and educators  from across our great nation.    Mr. Speaker, we have a copy of the Senate  bill to repeal ObamaCare, and it is no wonder they didn't want us to  see it.   Like the mean-spirited bill passed by the House, it rips insurance  away from millions of Americans, rolls back key protections to patients  with preexisting conditions, and allows insurers to charge older people  five times more than others.   Despite the promises that the Senate bill will moderate the coverage  cuts in the House-passed bill, the Senate is not only retaining the  House bill's fundamental restructuring of the Medicaid program to a per  capita cap on Federal funding, but it is deepening the cuts on Medicaid  after a few years. This will inevitably lead to the rationing of  healthcare for 70 million Americans who are beneficiaries of Medicaid:  pregnant women, people in nursing homes, children, and people with  disabilities.   It is not even clear what policy goal this bill is trying to solve,  except for making insurance more expensive or unavailable for people  who really need it the most. It is almost hard to call this a  healthcare bill at all.   There were no hearings, no public debate, and after weeks of backroom  deals and operating in secrecy, we now have this terrible product that  the Senate plans to vote on next week.   I think the American people deserve better.                            ____________________
