 Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and our communities. These small businesses not  only employ friends and neighbors, but they showcase Idaho's creativity  and values. Idaho small businesses provide invaluable goods and  services and are an intrinsic element of the Gem State. These small  businesses deserve to be celebrated for the integral role they play in  our communities. I am proud to relaunch Support Local Gems, a statewide  initiative, on June 9, to encourage Idahoans to support the small  businesses that make the Gem State special. As a member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Love at First Bite Mercantile  as one of Idaho's Small Businesses of the Month for June 2023.   Love at First Bite opened its doors in Idaho Falls in 2009. Despite  the recession, Juli and Mike Richards took the opportunity to make  their dream a reality. By 2012, they had doubled in size and, in 2019,  were able to expand again. Love at First Bite began when Juli and her  daughter combined their chocolate and cupcake businesses but has since  grown to offer a wide variety of products. In addition to gourmet food  items, Love at First Bite is known for their line of specialty oils and  vinegars, specialty drinks, home decor, beauty products, and jewelry.   The Richards are active members of the community and regularly  contribute their sweet treats to community fundraisers and school  events. Each summer, Love at First Bite donates products to local  libraries as a tasty incentive for youth reading programs.   Congratulations to Juli and Mike Richards and all of the employees at  Love at First Bite Mercantile for being selected as an Idaho Small  Business of the Month for June 2023. You are an outstanding example of  what it means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State  proud, and I look  [[Page S2002]]  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
