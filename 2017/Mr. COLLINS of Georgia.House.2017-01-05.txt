 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 22 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 22         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 26) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United       States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive       branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint       resolution of approval is enacted into law. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the       Minority Leader or their respective designees. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 11) objecting to United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to       Israeli-Palestinian peace, and for other purposes. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 22, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H. Res. 11, a resolution regarding United Nations  Security Council Resolution 2334. It provides for 1 hour of debate on  H. Res. 11, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of  the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Additionally, this rule provides for consideration of legislation  that I introduced, H.R. 26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need  of Scrutiny, or REINS, Act. It makes in order 12 amendments from  Members on both sides of the aisle, and provides for 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the majority leader and the minority  leader.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee received testimony from the Judiciary  and Foreign Affairs Committees.   Mr. Speaker, the beginning of this new Congress is a time of hope and  a time to establish clear priorities and goals. This is a time to show  the American people that we, as their elected representatives, will  have the courage to stand on principles that made us worthy of their  trust. This rule provides for two pieces of legislation that represent  our commitment to the integrity and transparency of this institution.   H. Res. 11, introduced by Chairman Royce and cosponsored by Ranking  Member Engel, objects to United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace. It calls for the  resolution's repeal and makes clear that the current administration's  failure to veto the U.N. resolution violated longstanding U.S. policy  to protect Israel from such counterproductive U.N. resolutions.  Importantly, it also provides a foundation for the next administration  to take action to counteract the damaging effects of the U.N. Security  Council resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 11, yet it shouldn't be necessary.  President Obama's refusal to veto the U.N. Security Council's  resolution was a radical and dangerous departure from U.S. precedent.   Prior to this most recent Security Council resolution, President  Obama has exercised the veto power of the United States on every  resolution relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His failure to  do so this time jeopardizes and undermines our relationship with our  strongest ally in the Middle East, and it has the potential to undercut  the peace process.   I stood in this Chamber numerous times before and demanded support  for Israel, and I am going to do so here again today. I refuse to sit  idly by and watch misguided anti-Israel policies take root.   We have to take a stand. The administration's failure to act, to even  participate in the vote, was an act of cowardice. It can't be erased,  and we must take steps to address it. This resolution is a step in the  right direction.   As a new President is sworn in this month, I am hopeful that we, as  the House of Representatives, and the United States will reaffirm our  support  [[Page H114]]  of Israel and return to policies that strengthen the relationships  between our two nations.   Mr. Speaker, as the new Congress starts, we also must look at  domestic policies and how to grow our economy. We are going to do that  right here in the House by taking the lead on regulatory reform to help  lift the burden of an intrusive government by jump-starting the  economy.                                time  1245    As part of this effort, I introduced H.R. 26, the REINS Act. This  bill was originally authored and introduced by former Congressman Geoff  Davis in 2009. Last Congress, now-Senator Todd Young introduced the  bill in the House. This Congress, I am proud to carry the torch for  this commonsense legislation. I also thank Chairman Goodlatte and his  staff for all of their hard work on this bill.   Article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution grants  legislative powers to Congress--we read about that right here on the  floor this morning--but, for too long, Congress has ceded that power to  the executive branch, which has resulted in an onslaught of regulation.  This is a problem that we have seen under the administrations of both  parties, and Members on both sides of the aisle should be concerned.   In recent years, this problem has exploded. In 2015 alone, the  executive branch issued over 3,000 rules and regulations, and 76 of  these regulations were major regulations. Let me explain that.  Unelected bureaucrats, without input from the American people or their  Representatives in Congress, issued 76 major regulations that would  impact our economy by more than $100 million each in 1 year alone. The  consequences of these rules are massive. Even worse, we have seen this  administration promote regulations with burdens that far outweigh their  benefits. The REINS Act would require Federal agencies to submit major  rules to Congress for approval. Under this bill, major rules would have  to be accepted by both Chambers and signed by the President to become  effective.   This bill restores accountability to the legislative process and  ensures that lawmakers, not nameless bureaucrats, are the ones making  the laws, just like our Constitution outlines. We have seen the harm  that can come from an out-of-control regulatory regime. Right now,  hardworking Americans across the country are paying the price. In fact,  on average, each U.S. household is bearing an annual economic weight of  $15,000 in regulatory burdens. The oppressive costs of regulation,  coupled with the impact on jobs, demand action.   One regulation, put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency in  2015, would have cost my home State of Georgia over 11,000 jobs; and we  are all familiar with the waters of the United States rule, which,  essentially, asserted authority over all groundwater in the country. If  you have been to northeast Georgia, you know that water collects in  pools and puddles and streams at certain times of the year. If all of  that were to be regulated under this rule, it would be a disaster for  not only my district but for all of the country, but that is what this  administration has tried to do. That rule has been halted by a court,  but were it to go into effect, it would cut farmers, ranchers,  Realtors, and small businesses off at the knees.   With the number of major rules this administration has propagated, I  could far exceed my time in just illustrating the problems these  regulations can create; but, with the REINS Act, we have a chance to  carve out a better way in going forward. The American people elected  us, in this body, to represent them. The REINS Act allows their voices  to be heard more clearly.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't matter what party is in the executive  branch because the legislative branch is the one that makes and accepts  the bills, not the unelected bureaucrats. This bill creates a sensible  way to move forward with legislative business while better protecting  our economy from suffocating regulations that Americans never voted to  enact.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate my colleague's  concerns. I think it is interesting to note, though, that, if he were  concerned about a closed rule, there were many of us who were very  concerned about a closed voice from America at the U.N. Security  Council in not defending Israel.   Also, on the other subject here, when we look at this going forward,  there was a substitute that was actually offered in support of a  resolution that does take a stand against what happened. It was not  even mentioned in the substitute resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Byrne), a fellow member of the Rules Committee.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the  gentlewoman just got a chance to debate herself on the floor and to use  that freedom of speech. That is what this floor is for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Ross).    Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), who is a great new Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), who is another freshman  that we welcome to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), who is another new face that is  looking forward to making a difference here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who is the distinguished  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   It is amazing to me some of the stuff that I have just heard, Mr.  Speaker, just in the last few minutes. And I appreciate my friend  across the aisle, but the debate that we have been having here is  amazing. So that is something I want to talk about, but also something  that came up, just to take a few steps down the road.   It had been mentioned many times here on the floor today that a  unanimous vote by the Security Council in some way implies that it was  right or that it was proper. I am sorry, the groupthink of the United  Nations Security Council on this issue was wrong.   The one that was left silent was the beacon of freedom to the world,  the United States, and instead of engaging, instead of working as we  have in the past abstained or voted against, there have been times when  we actually, as my friend said a moment ago, Mr. Speaker, worked  together. When that did happen in the past, there were times in which  Israel and the U.S. worked together to soften or change, and we had, at  that point in time, something that--not liked, but something that could  be lived with. In this case, it was nothing Israel said. This is bad.  America turned its back.   Where was the voice? It was silent. Where was the voice? We voted  absent. That is not what the leader of the free world should do. That  is not what the leader of the free world should do to his closest ally  in the Middle East. That is why we are talking about this.   There are other things we can discuss today. There are other  discussions on two-state solutions on another case on the settlement,  but the bottom line here is that it goes deeper than the other issues.  The deeper part here is that we simply sat silent while the world  mocked and criticized our strongest ally, Mr. Speaker.   So don't talk to me about working together. I get it. But where was  the working together on this? It was absent. A unanimous vote,  especially of the United Nations Security Council, using that as your  justification, I think we need to talk.   But also, Mr. Speaker, when we come to the end, regulatory  environment, the REINS Act is simply saying: Congress, do what Congress  is supposed to do. Congress, work as the voice of the American people.  Work for the voice of helping companies start and create jobs. Work  with the American people to relegate them forward instead of moving  backward.   The REINS Act simply says: let's do our job here. Not the ones who  are closed off from input but the folks who are elected to come to this  place, to come to these hallowed halls and debate what we are talking  about today: debate the regulatory environment, debate the environment.  When we do that, then that is what we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
