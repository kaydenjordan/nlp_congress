 Mr. Speaker, while the American Rescue Plan is changing  the course of the pandemic and delivering relief for working families,  this is no time to build back the way things were. We, in the Virgin  Islands, can tell you that after suffering not one, but two Category 5  hurricanes in 2017. This is our moment to reimagine and rebuild a new  economy.   Let it be known, the American Jobs Plan is an investment in America,  that it will create millions of good jobs, rebuild our country's  infrastructure, and position the United States to outcompete China and  others.   Public domestic investment, as a share of the economy, has fallen by  more than 40 percent since the 1960s. The American Jobs Plan will  invest in America in a way we have not invested since we built the  interstate highways or won the Space Race.   The United States of America is the wealthiest country in the world,  yet we rank 13th when it comes to overall quality of our  infrastructure. After decades of disinvestment, our roads, bridges,  water systems are crumbling. Our electric grid is vulnerable to  catastrophic outages. Too many lack affordable, high speed internet,  and quality housing.   The past year has led to job losses and threaten economic security,  eroding more than 30 years of progress in women's labor force  participation. It has unmasked the fragility of our caregiving  infrastructure. And our Nation has fallen behind its biggest  competitors on research and development, manufacturing, and training.   It has never been more important for us to invest in strengthening  our infrastructure and competitiveness, and in creating the good-paying  union jobs of the future.   Like great projects of the past, the President's plan will unify and  mobilize our country to meet the great challenges of our time: the  climate crisis and ambitions of an autocratic China. It will invest in  Americans and deliver jobs and opportunities we all deserve.   But unlike past major investments, the plan also prioritizes  addressing longstanding and persistent racial injustice. The plan  targets 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure  investment to disadvantaged communities. The American Jobs and Family  Plan assists in creating equity and wealth creation in communities of  color, which helps all Americans.   The American Jobs and Family Plan will transform transportation  infrastructure, addressing historic inequities, and increasing  resilience. It will bring broadband coverage to 100 percent while  reducing costs, create jobs in renewable energy, revitalize our  schools, veterans' hospitals, and support our essential home care  workers.   The bill will strengthen financial security of working families  through an increase in funding for key nutrition initiatives: SNAP,  WIC, child nutrition, rural development, including broadband, rental,  and other housing initiatives, and access to healthcare.   This will ensure a clean, affordable, and secure energy future by  investing over $14 billion in clean energy and science, which will  create tens of thousands of good paying jobs. We will also make sure K- 12 educational institutions have the resources they need, with robust  investment in Title I and special education, Pell Grants, and other  financial assistance so students' success is not limited by their  income or their ZIP Code.   We will provide strong funding for minority-serving institutions,  like HBCUs, like in my own district, the University of the Virgin  Islands, along with Hispanic-serving institutions, and Tribally- controlled colleges and universities.    The American Jobs and Family Plan will honor our responsibility to  our veterans by supporting them with investments in veterans'  healthcare, including women's healthcare and mental health, combating  veterans' homelessness, creating economic opportunities, and rebuilding  military infrastructure.   House Democrats are supporting the Jobs and Family Plan, which will  advance justice and opportunity, secure opportunities for underserved  businesses, low-income communities, communities of color, rural  communities, and others too often left behind.   Democrats believe that we should invest in what we value as a Nation.  We are investing in the American people, American economy, and our  American values of opportunity, prosperity, and justice for all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Democrats are making sure that as a  nation we build back better to create more jobs, cut taxes, and lower  costs. President Biden's and congressional Democrats' economic plan to  build from the bottom up and the middle out is working. America is  getting back to work, and working families are seeing the results.   Jobs are coming back. Under President Biden's leadership in the past  6 months, the economy has gone from creating only 60,000 new jobs a  month to creating 60,000 jobs every 3 days. Wages are rising. American  workers are seeing long overdue pay raises, bringing home more money to  their families, and powering economic growth that comes from the bottom  up and the middle out.   Paychecks are growing.   The economy is growing. Thanks to Democrats' leadership, the economy  is growing faster than at any time in the last 40 years. Independent  projections from the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, and many others  all forecast America this year reaching the highest levels of growth in  nearly four decades; and small business optimism is back to pre- pandemic highs.                            ____________________
