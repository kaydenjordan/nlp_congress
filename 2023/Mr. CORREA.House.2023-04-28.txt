 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commemorate the fall of  Saigon, also known as Black April, on April 30.   Today, the Vietnamese-American community is comprised of  businessowners, teachers, police officers, and American soldiers. The  Little Saigon community exemplifies the American Dream and has always  stood for the land of opportunity.   This Sunday marks 47 years since Vietnamese refugees came to America.   Today, I ask my colleagues to remember the 58,000 American soldiers  who made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom of Vietnam.                            ____________________
