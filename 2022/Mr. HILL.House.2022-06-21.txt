 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern),  the chairman of our task force, and all of the members of the task  force, for coming together and showing the American people that  Congress can debate, analyze, think through, and consider what it takes  to balance our budget. Kevin Hern has delivered that leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the Republican Study  Committee's budget proposal for fiscal year 2023. I am proud to be a  contributing member of the Republican Study Committee.   This RSC budget would not only rein in reckless spending, but it  would also balance the Nation's budget over the next decade.    By making President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, this  budget would provide hardworking American families with immediate  relief, something we desperately need amid Joe Biden's highest  inflation in four decades.   This budget also works toward strengthening our national security,  starting with the crisis at our southwest border. Last month, Mr.  Speaker, Customs and Border Protection reported that 234,416 illegal  migrant encounters occurred along our border, the highest 1-month total  ever recorded. This budget would restore the Trump-era policies that  secured our border and kept our communities safe, preventing startling  statistics like that one I just noted.   This budget is sensible, it is realistic, and it is beneficial for  all of our American families.   I am pleased that two of my legislative items that I have placed  priority on in this Congress were included in this budget package: The  Price Stability Act and the Social Security Disability Insurance Return  to Work Act.   First, the Price Stability Act, which I was pleased to introduce  earlier this year alongside my good friend and colleague, Byron  Donalds, from Florida. At a time when the American people are currently  spending an additional $460 a month, Mr. Speaker, nearly $5,000 more  this year than people were spending last year to keep up with President  Biden's inflation, the rising cost of gas at the pump, and groceries at  the store, this bill would have the Federal Reserve focus on a single  mandate, that of price stability, concentrating on keeping prices down,  and preventing inflation from stealing from American families.   The second bill, the Social Security Disability Insurance Return to  Work Act, which I reintroduced this year, would restructure the Social  Security Administration's disability classification system to provide  further opportunities to individuals with disabilities who can and want  to get back to work. That is important, because too many people go on  our Social Security disability system and don't get back to the  workforce. This provides them financial incentives, training, and  opportunity to go back to work, something our workforce and our  employers desperately need. It gives dignity to those who can get back  into the workforce.                                time  1945    These policies would both reduce government spending while ensuring  that we put the needs of the American people first.   I thank the Republican Study Committee chairman,   Jim Banks, Task  Force Chairman Hern, for their hard work and leadership in developing  this budget. This commonsense legislative agenda combats inflation  while supporting a healthy economy. It works for the betterment of our  families long-term.   I am proud of the provisions that were included in the budget. I am  happy to express my support for the budget and for the work of the task  force.
