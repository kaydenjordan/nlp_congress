 Mr. Speaker, the Senate Republican majority  failed to pass their ACA repeal. This is a win for the people across  America who wrote letters, made phone calls, and organized communities  against this disastrous bill.   Mr. Speaker, millions of people rely on insurance expansion made  possible under the ACA. Our job is not to harm the people we serve but  to make their lives better.   Under every single Republican healthcare bill, millions of people  would lose health coverage. There are many steps we can take together.  Let us strengthen the risk pools, promote competition among insurers,  and require States to expand their Medicaid programs.   These steps will help lower premiums, increase choice, and allow  50,000 individuals in my district and millions of low-income Americans  across the country to get insurance.   My constituents are tired of the partisanship. I urge my friends on  the other side of the aisle to work with us and each other instead of  against each other so everyday Americans do not grow even more cynical  of our governing institutions.   While the failure of TrumpCare is welcome news, now is the time to  hold public hearings, bipartisan meetings, and work toward goals that  reduce premiums, deductibles, and healthcare costs for American people.   I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to build on  the ACA and improve the law.                            ____________________
