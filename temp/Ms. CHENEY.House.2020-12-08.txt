 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 4684,  the House version of which will be coming to the floor today to honor  former Thermopolis, Wyoming, Postmaster Robert Brown. We will be  renaming the U.S. Post Office located at 440 Arapahoe Street in  Thermopolis as the Robert L. Brown Post Office.   Bob Brown's career with the Postal Service spanned 44 years,  including 18 years as the postmaster. Brown and his wife, Jerry, who  was Senator Mike Enzi's first Sunday school teacher, are also the  parents of Senator John Barrasso's wife, Bobbi.   After graduating from Thermopolis High School, Brown was inducted  into the Army in 1944 and served in both the European and Pacific  theaters. In 1950, when he was in the National Guard, Brown deployed to  Korea, where he was a member of the 300th Armored Field Artillery  Battalion. Along with a unit citation, he received a combat infantry  badge and the Purple Heart.   After his service, Bob returned to Thermopolis and began working at  the post office. Decades of service to his community, to his State, and  to his country mean that it is absolutely fitting that the Thermopolis  Post Office should bear Bob's name, and I am proud to sponsor this  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider H.R. 6016,  designating the United States Postal Service facility in Arizona as the  Marc Lee Memorial Post Office Building. This is a fitting honor and  tribute to Petty Officer 2nd Class Marc Alan Lee for his heroic actions  during Operation Iraqi Freedom.   On August 2, 2006, while on patrol in Ramadi, Marc Lee fearlessly  exposed himself to direct enemy fire in order to protect the lives of  his teammates. He gave his life for his brothers and for our freedom.   He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his actions that day.  In the words of Jocko Willink, commander of Task Unit Bruiser, Marc's  unit in Iraq, Marc was ``one of those rare men, those true heroes, the  ones who rose above the rest of us to symbolize courage and faith and  selflessness and love.''   As we honor Marc Lee today, let us all recommit ourselves to  cherishing the freedom for which he died and to living lives worthy of  the sacrifice of all our men and women who have given their lives for  our liberty.   God bless Marc and his family, and God bless the United States of  America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this NDAA conference  report named after a true American patriot, our Armed Services  Committee Ranking Member Mac Thornberry, whom we will very much miss  and who has dedicated his career to serving this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Smith,  for his work on this bipartisan product.   Congress has no greater responsibility, Mr. Speaker, than providing  for the defense of our Nation.   At a time when the United States faces the most complex array of  threats in our history, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that our  servicemembers have the tools they need to deter and defeat our  adversaries.   The 2021 defense bill before us today makes critical progress towards  modernizing our military, supporting our military families, protecting  supply chains, and deterring Russia and China.   At this crucial moment when we have troops deployed overseas,  including those from Wyoming's 153rd, 187th, and 243rd Air National  Guard units, it is imperative that they have the full support of the  United States Congress behind them as they execute their missions.   Failure to pass this act would force hundreds of thousands of our men  and women in uniform and their families to endure cuts to their pay  right before the holidays. Over 250,000 military families would lose  their hazardous duty pay.   Given the sacrifices they make for all of us, our troops should never  have their livelihoods threatened by political battles in Washington,  D.C.   In addition to all that this NDAA does to support our troops, it also  builds on the Trump administration's successful efforts to counter the  Chinese Communist Party, including through provisions I authored that  require publication of the names of Chinese Communist military  companies operating in the United States.   It also includes my bipartisan provision seeking to reduce DOD's  dependence on China for critical rare earth minerals. States like  Wyoming are blessed with these resources, and we must rebuild our  Nation's capacity to mine and process rare earths here at home.   This legislation funds the modernization of our nuclear triad and  contains crucial provisions to strengthen our deterrence capability in  the Indo-Pacific.   American security requires that we maintain a military that is second  to none, that we arm our troops with the world's best equipment, and  that we provide for their families. Our men and women in uniform put  their lives on the line to defend our freedom. We owe them the tools to  do their job.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this year's NDAA, and I urge all  my colleagues to vote for it.
