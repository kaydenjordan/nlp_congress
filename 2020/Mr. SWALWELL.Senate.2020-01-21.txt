 You said Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one       meeting with President Trump in late August 2019, but the       President was not yet ready to approve the release of the       assistance. Do you remember that?         Yes, 266 and 268. But I am asking you: Did       that happen or did it not?         Yes. You testified to that. What was the       outcome of that meeting between Ambassador Bolton and       President Trump?         Did Ambassador Bolton inform you of any       reason for the ongoing hold that stemmed from this meeting?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Ambassador Bolton's efforts failed. By August 30,  OMB informed DOD that there was ``clear direction from POTUS to  continue to hold.'' What rationale did President Trump give Ambassador  Bolton and other senior officials for refusing to release the aid? Were  these reasons convincing to Ambassador Bolton, and did they reflect the  best interests of our national security or the President's personal  political interests?   Only Ambassador Bolton can tell us the answers. A fair trial in this  body would ensure that he testifies. The President does not want you to  hear Ambassador Bolton's testimony. Why is that? For all the obvious  reasons I have stated.   The President claims that he froze aid to Ukraine in the interest of  our  [[Page S426]]  national security. If that is true, why would he oppose testimony from  his own former National Security Advisor?   Make no mistake. President Trump had no legal grounds to block  Ambassador Bolton's testimony in this trial. Executive privilege is not  a spell that the President can cast to cover up evidence of his own  misconduct. It is a qualified privilege that protects senior advisers  performing official functions. Executive privilege is a shield, not a  sword. It cannot be used to block a witness who is willing to testify,  as Ambassador Bolton says he is.   As we know from the Nixon case in Watergate, the privilege also does  not prevent us from obtaining specific evidence of wrongdoing. The  Supreme Court unanimously rejected President Nixon's attempts to use  executive privilege to conceal incriminating tape recordings. All the  similar efforts by President Trump must also fail.   The President sometimes relies on a theory of absolute immunity that  says that he can order anybody in the executive branch not to testify  to the House or the Senate or to a court. Obviously, this is  ridiculous. It has been flatly rejected by every Federal court to  consider the idea. It is embarrassing that the President's counsel  would talk about this today.   Again, even if President Trump asserts that Ambassador Bolton is  absolutely immune from compelled testimony, the President has no  authority to block Ambassador Bolton from appearing here. As one court  recently explained, Presidents are not Kings, and they do not have  subjects whose destiny they are entitled to control.   This body should not act as if the President is a King. We will see,  with the next vote on this question, whether the Members of this body  want to protect the President against all investigation, against all  suspicion, against any crimes, or not.   The Framers of our Constitution were most concerned about abuse of  power where it affects national security. President Trump has been  impeached for placing his political interests ahead of our national  security. It is imperative, therefore, that we hear from the National  Security Advisor who witnessed the President's scheme from start to  finish. To be clear, the record, as it stands, fully supports both  Articles of Impeachment. It is beyond argument that President Trump  mounted a sustained pressure campaign to get Ukraine to announce  investigations that would benefit him politically and then tried to  cover it up. The President does not seriously deny any of these facts.   The only question left is this: Why is the President so intent on  concealing the evidence and blocking all documents and testimony here  today? Only guilty people try to hide the evidence.   Of course, all of this is relevant only if this here today is a fair  trial, only if you, the Senate, sitting as an impartial jury, do not  work with the accused to conceal the evidence from the American people.   We cannot be surprised that the President objects to calling  witnesses who would prove his guilt. That is who he is. He does not  want you to see evidence or hear testimony that details how he betrayed  his office and asked a foreign government to intervene in our election.  But we should be surprised that, here in the U.S. Senate, the greatest  deliberative body in the world, where we are expected to put our oath  of office ahead of political expediency, where we are expected to be  honest, where we are expected to protect the interests of the American  people--we should be surprised, shocked--that any Senator would vote to  block this witness or any relevant witness who might shed additional  light on the President's obvious misconduct.   The President is on trial in the Senate, but the Senate is on trial  in the eyes of the American people. Will you vote to allow all of the  relevant evidence to be presented here, or will you betray your pledge  to be an impartial juror? Will you bring Ambassador Bolton here? Will  you permit us to present you with the entire record of the President's  misconduct, or will you, instead, choose to be complicit in the  President's coverup?   So far, I am sad to say, I see a lot of Senators voting for a  coverup, voting to deny witnesses--an absolutely indefensible vote,  obviously a treacherous vote, a vote against an honest consideration of  the evidence against the President, a vote against an honest trial, a  vote against the United States.   A real trial, we know, has witnesses. We urge you to do your duty,  permit a fair trial. All the witnesses must be permitted. That is  elementary in American justice. Either you want the truth and you must  permit the witnesses, or you want a shameful coverup. History will  judge. So will the electorate.   Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the balance of our time--the managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, we  came here today to address the false case brought to you by the House  managers. We have been respectful of the Senate. We have made our  arguments to you.   You don't deserve and we don't deserve what just happened. Mr. Nadler  came up here and made false allegations against our team. He made false  allegations against all of you. He accused you of a coverup. He has  been making false allegations against the President. The only one who  should be embarrassed, Mr. Nadler, is you, for the way you have  addressed this body. This is the U.S. Senate. You are not in charge  here.   Now let me address the issue of Mr. Bolton. I have addressed it  before. They don't tell you that they didn't bother to call Mr. Bolton  themselves. They didn't subpoena him. Mr. Cooper wrote them a letter.  He said very clearly: If the House chooses not to pursue through  subpoena the testimony of Dr. Kupperman and Ambassador Bolton, let the  record be clear. That is the House's decision.   They didn't pursue Ambassador Bolton, and they withdrew the subpoena  to Mr. Kupperman. So, for them to come here now and demand that, before  we even start the arguments--they ask you to do something that they  refuse to do for themselves and then accuse you of a coverup when you  don't do it--it is ridiculous. Talk about out-of-control governing.   Now, let me read you a quote from Mr. Nadler not so long ago:         The effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will       of the voters. There must never be a narrowly voted       impeachment or an impeachment supported by one of our major       political parties and opposed by the other. Such an       impeachment would produce divisiveness and bitterness in our       politics for years to come and will call into question the       very legitimacy of our political institutions.    Well, you have just seen it for yourself. What happened, Mr. Nadler?  What happened?   The American people pay their salaries, and they are here to take  away their vote. They are here to take away their voice. They have come  here, and they have attacked every institution of our government. They  have attacked the President, the executive branch. They have attacked  the judicial branch. They say they don't have time for courts. They  have attacked the U.S. Senate, repeatedly. It is about time we bring  this power trip in for a landing.   President Trump is a man of his word. He made promises to the  American people, and he delivered--over and over and over again. And  they come here and say, with no evidence, spending the day complaining,  that they can't make their case, attacking a resolution that had 100  percent support in this body. And some of the people here supported it  at the time. It is a farce, and it should end.   Mr. Nadler, you owe an apology to the President of the United States  and his family. You owe an apology to the Senate. But, most of all, you  owe an apology to the American people.   Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Sekulow.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  chairman Nadler talked about treacherous, and at about 12:10 a.m.,  January 22, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in this body, on  the floor of this Senate, said ``executive privilege and other  nonsense.'' Now, think about that for a moment--``executive privilege  and other nonsense.''   Mr. Nadler, it is not nonsense. These are privileges recognized by  the Supreme Court of the United States. To shred the Constitution on  the floor of the Senate--to serve what purpose? The Senate is not on  trial. The Constitution doesn't allow what just took place.  [[Page S427]]    Look at what we have dealt with for the last now 13 hours. We,  hopefully, are closing the proceedings, but not on a very high note.   Only guilty people try to hide evidence? So, I guess, when President  Obama instructed his Attorney General to not give information, he was  guilty of a crime. That is the way it works, Mr. Nadler? Is that the  way you view the U.S. Constitution? Because that is not the way it was  written. That is not the way it is interpreted, and that is not the way  the American people should have to live.   I will tell you what is treacherous: To come to the floor of the  Senate and say ``executive privilege and other nonsense.''   Mr. Chief Justice, we yield the rest of our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The managers have 27 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the  President's counsel has no standing to talk about lying. He told this  body today--the President has told this body--and told the American  people repeatedly, for example, that the House of Representatives  refused to allow the President due process. I told you that it is  available--public document, November 26 letter from me, as chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, to the President, offering him due process,  offering witnesses, offering cross-examination.    A few days later, we received a letter from Mr. Cipollone on White  House stationery that said: No, we have no interest in appearing.   On the one hand, the House is condemned by the President for not  giving him due process after they rejected the offer of due process.  That letter rejecting it was December 1.   The President's counsel says that the House should have issued  subpoenas. We did issue subpoenas. The President, you may recall--you  should recall--said he would oppose all subpoenas, and he did. So many  of those subpoenas are still being fought in court--subpoenas issued  last April. So that is also untrue. It takes a heck of a lot of nerve  to criticize the House for not issuing subpoenas when the President  said he would oppose all subpoenas. We have issued a lot of subpoenas.  He opposes all of them, and they are tied up in court.   The President claims--and most Members of this body know better,  executive privilege, which is a limited privilege, which exists but not  as a shield, not as a shield against wrongdoing, as the Supreme Court  specifically said in the Nixon case in 1974. The President claims  absolute immunity. Mr. Cipollone wrote some of those letters, not only  saying the President but that nobody should testify that he doesn't  want, and then they have the nerve--and that is a violation of the  constitutional rights of the House of Representatives and the Senate  and of the American people represented through them.   It is an assertion of the kingly prerogative, a monarchical  prerogative. Only the President--only the President has rights, and the  people as represented in Congress cannot get information from the  executive branch at all. This body has committees. It has a 200-year  record of issuing subpoenas, of having the administration of the day  testify, of sometimes having subpoena fights, but no President has ever  claimed the right to stonewall Congress on everything, period. Congress  has no right to get information. The American people have no right to  get information. That, in fact, is article II of the impeachment that  we have voted.   It is beyond belief that the President claims monarchical powers--I  can do whatever I want under article II, says he--and then acts on  that, defies everything, defies the law to withhold aid from Ukraine,  defies the law in a dozen different directions all the time, and lies  about it all the time and says to Mr. Cipollone to lie about it. These  facts are undeniable--undeniable.   I reserve.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Cipollone, once again, complained that we did  not request John Bolton to testify in the House, but of course we did.  We did request his testimony, and he was a no-show.   When we talked to his counsel about subpoenaing his testimony, the  answer was: You give us a subpoena, and we will sue you. And, indeed,  that is what Mr. Bolton's attorney did with the subpoena for Dr.  Kupperman.   There was no willingness by Mr. Bolton to testify before the House.  He said he would sue us. What is the problem with his suing us? Their  Justice Department, under Bill Barr, is in court arguing--actually in  that very case involving Dr. Kupperman--that Dr. Kupperman can't sue  the administration and the Congress.   That is the same position that Congress has taken, the same position  the administration is taking but, apparently, not the same position  these lawyers are taking.   Here is the bigger problem with that. We subpoenaed Don McGahn, as I  told you earlier. You should know we subpoenaed Don McGahn in April of  2019. It is January of 2020. We still don't have a final decision from  the court requiring him to testify. In a couple of months, it will be 1  year since we issued that subpoena.   The President would like nothing more than for us to have to go  through 1 year or 2 years or 3 years of litigation to get any witness  to come before the House. The problem is, the President is trying to  cheat in this election. We don't have the luxury of waiting 1 year or 2  years or 3 years, when the very object of this scheme was to cheat in  the next election. It is not like that threat has gone away.   Just last month, the President's lawyer was in Ukraine still trying  to smear his opponent and still trying to get Ukraine to interfere in  our election. The President said, even while the impeachment  investigation was going on, when he was asked: What did you want in  that call with Zelensky, and his answer was: Well, if we are being  honest about it, Zelensky should do that investigation of the Bidens.   He hasn't stopped asking them to interfere. Do you think the  Ukrainians have any doubt about what he wants? One of the witnesses,  David Holmes, testified about the pressure that Ukraine feels. He made  a very important point: It isn't over. It is not like they don't want  anything else from the United States.   This effort to pressure Ukraine goes on to this day, with the  President's lawyer continuing the scheme, as we speak, with the  President inviting other nations to also involve themselves in our  election.   China--he wants to now investigate the Bidens. This is no intangible  threat to our elections. Within the last couple of weeks, it has been  reported that the Russians have tried to hack Burisma. Why do you think  they are hacking Burisma? Because, as Chairman Nadler says, everybody  seems to be interested in this one company out of hundreds of thousands  Ukrainian companies. It is a coincidence that the same company that the  President has been trying to smear Joe Biden over happens to be the  company the Russians are hacking.   Why would the Russians do that? If you look back to the last  election, the Russians hacked the DNC, and they started to leak  campaign documents in a drip, drip, drip, and the President was only  too happy--over 100 times in the last couple of months in the  campaign--to cite those Russian-hacked Russian documents, and now the  Russians are at it again.   This is no illusory threat to the independence of our elections. The  Russians are at it, as we speak. What does the President do? Is he  saying: Back off, Russia; I am not interested in your help; I don't  want foreign interference? No, he is saying: Come on in, China. He has  his guy in Ukraine continuing the scheme.   We can't wait a year or 2 years or 3 years, like we have had to wait  with Don McGahn, to get John Bolton in to testify to let you know that  this threat is ongoing.   Counsel also says: Well, this is just like Obama, right? This is just  like Obama, citing, I suppose, the Fast and Furious case. They don't  mention to you that in that investigation, the Obama administration  turned over tens of thousands of documents. They don't want you to know  about that. They say it is just like Obama.   When you find video of Barack Obama saying that under article II he  can do anything, then you can compare Barack Obama to Donald Trump.  When you find a video of Barack Obama saying: I am going to fight all  subpoenas, then you can compare Barack Obama to Donald Trump.  [[Page S428]]    And finally, Mr. Cipollone says, President Trump is a man of his  word. It is too late in the evening for me to go into that one, except  to say this. President Trump gave his word he would drain the swamp. He  said he would drain the swamp. What have we seen? We have seen his  personal lawyer go to jail, his campaign chairman go to jail, his  deputy campaign chairman convicted of a different crime, his  associates' associate, Lev Parnas, under indictment. The list goes and  on. That is, I guess, how you drain the swamp. You have all your people  go to jail.   I don't think that is really what was meant by that expression. For  the purposes of why we are here today, how does someone who promises to  drain the swamp coerce an ally of ours into doing a political  investigation? That is the swamp. That is not draining the swamp; that  is exporting the swamp.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think it is appropriate at this point for me to  admonish both the House managers and the President's counsel in equal  terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest  deliberative body.
