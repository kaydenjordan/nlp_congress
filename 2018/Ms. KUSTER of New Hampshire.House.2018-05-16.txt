 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak as a  cosponsor of the VA MISSION Act. I appreciate the work of Chairman Roe  and Ranking Member Walz in putting this bill together. This bill is  almost unanimously supported by the veterans service organization  community.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation because it will enact needed  reforms to the Veterans Choice Program and finally extend benefits to  family caregivers for veterans of all eras.   I am pleased that the committee retained provisions that Senator  Sullivan of Alaska and I fought for that would recognize the unique  access issues for States that lack a full-service VA hospital. While I  will continue to fight for improved and expanded facilities at our  Manchester, New Hampshire, VA Medical Center, it is important to  recognize that we have unique challenges in New Hampshire where we do  not have a full-service hospital.   I also want to speak to this: the provisions that expand the  caregiver benefits provided to post-9/11 veterans to veterans of all  eras are necessary and long overdue.    I have heard repeatedly from Granite State veterans of eras prior to  the global war on terror that the differences and benefits are simply  unfair. The way these benefits are currently structured essentially  pits veterans against veterans. That is unacceptable.   I thank Chairman Roe for working with us on finding a way forward for  family caregiver benefits. I am sure thousands of Granite State  veterans will agree.   While this bill embodies the kind of bipartisanship for which our  committee is well known, it is not perfect. As the ranking member of  the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I believe it is  important to acknowledge parts of the bill that will need continued  oversight. I remain committed to ensuring that the VA follows through  in a manner that befits the veterans they serve.   Number one, the asset infrastructure review portion of the bill is  promising, but I have concerns that it will be insufficient to  accomplish its goals. The VA is in desperate need of improved  facilities and a realignment of facilities to better serve veterans'  needs.   In my own State of New Hampshire, the veterans of the North Country  must rely on the Veterans Choice Program, rather than have ease of  access to services they would prefer. I am encouraged by the continued  work to improve our existing facilities, but Granite State veterans  need more, and I hope this bill will further empower the VA to expand  services in Manchester and across our State.   Recent experiences has shown that the VA's ability to accurately  assess the needs of the veterans' population is in doubt. I remain  committed to ensuring that the VA can paint an accurate picture of  veterans' needs, especially veterans living in rural America. Too  often, our veterans in rural America have seen promised infrastructure  expansion stripped away from them. I urge the veterans service  organizations community to continue to work with us to keep the VA  honest.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition  to H.R. 2 and to express my profound disappointment in the process that  has led us to where we are today.   As the first New Hampshire Representative to serve on the Agriculture  Committee in decades, I am humbled by the responsibility to fight for  New Hampshire's small family farms.   When we last considered the farm bill in 2014, I supported the  legislation because, while not perfect, that bill provided long-term  certitude to our Nation's farmers and represented a compromise between  Republicans and Democrats.   The farm bill has always been a bipartisan piece of legislation, but  the bill we vote on this week represents a complete departure from that  bipartisan process. Democrats were pushed away from the negotiating  table by an extreme ideological agenda that would increase food  insecurity for millions of Americans, slash mandatory spending on  critical rural development and conservation programs, and lead to  265,000 children losing access to free and reduced school lunch.
