 Mr. President, I wish to join the chorus here. This is a  big day, as Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer said, for our friend  and colleague Pat Leahy.   Pat and I have been working together a long time; this is our fourth  decade. As we were told, he just cast his 16,000th vote in the U.S.  Senate. I want to note that only three Senators have ever hit that  mark--Senator Robert Byrd, Senator Danny Inouye, and Senator Strom  Thurmond. And he is still going. Pat still has some time on his hands.  This is an extraordinary achievement, as we all know, here in the  Senate.   As I said, Pat and I have served together for more than three  decades. As Senators McConnell and Schumer said, he was first elected  at the age of 34, making him one of the youngest Senators here.   As we all know, last year we completed our work, working together,  before the Fourth of July recess, on the Appropriations Committee. We  are going to try to do it again this year, working together. I just  think, if we work together, as we have before--Pat and I have given and  taken from each other--it is good for the Senate.   I congratulate Senator Leahy again on this rare and remarkable  achievement--16,000 votes. It is a first. He currently ranks first in  seniority in the Senate--first, folks, in seniority. He is  [[Page S4878]]  our senior Senator. It has been nothing short of a privilege to serve  alongside him. He is an excellent colleague, he has been a class act. I  have enjoyed working with him and look forward to a few more years in  the future.   Pat.   (Applause.)
