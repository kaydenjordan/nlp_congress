 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my guest for  this year's State of the Union address, Massachusetts State  Representative Tommy Vitolo of the 15th Norfolk District.   Over the past year, we have strived with the Biden agenda to empower  States and localities to use Federal funds as they felt best when  securing historic relief to rebuild our economy coming out of the  pandemic. This strategy has worked because of great partners at the  State and local level like Representative Vitolo.   From the passage of the American Rescue Plan to the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, the Democratic agenda is helping people in  Massachusetts and beyond. Tommy was a key partner in helping to get  relief for essential workers, bringing attention to critical  transportation projects, and supporting job growth. I look forward to  hosting him as my virtual guest this evening, and to our continued  partnership delivering results to the Bay State with the Biden agenda.                            ____________________
