 Mr. President, as a fifth generation Montanan and avid  outdoorsman, I know how important public use of our public lands is to  Montanans. Many Montanans, including myself, have also had great  experiences hunting, fishing, or hiking on approved private lands as  well. Expanding access for sportsmen, improving habitat, and upholding  property rights are all priorities of mine, which is why I am  introducing the Voluntary Public Access Improvement Act. This bill  would reauthorize the Voluntary Public Access-Habitat Improvement  Program, a voluntary state-led program that expands public access by  incentivizing private landowners to allow the public on their property  for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreational activities while  protecting their private property rights. In Montana alone, over 70,000  acres of private lands have been voluntarily opened up for hunting and  increased public access, and the Voluntary Public Access Improvement  Act would help build on that success.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2243         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
