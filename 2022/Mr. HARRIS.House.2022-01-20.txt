 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the hope that after nearly  50 years, Roe v. Wade's attack on the most basic of human rights, the  right to life, will soon meet its end.   Why are we going to be marching tomorrow? We do it because we believe  that every person, born and unborn, deserves a chance at life. We march  to shed light on the incredible resources available to expectant  mothers who find themselves in desperate situations. We march to send a  message that humanity cannot sit by and quietly tolerate the deliberate  ending of human life.   Mr. Speaker, I am a physician, and I have helped thousands of women  deliver their babies over the course of my career. When I underwent my  training, I was taught that caring for expectant mothers meant caring  for two patients, not one. As you can see here, advances in ultrasound  technology have reinforced that training from decades ago. Mr. Speaker,  these are not blobs of tissue we are talking about. These are human  beings. The science is clear: From the moment of conception, new human  life enters the world with its own unique DNA, and in a matter of weeks  even a heartbeat.   Mr. Speaker, we march for an end to the human tragedy of abortion,  and I pray each day that we come closer to this righteous conclusion.
