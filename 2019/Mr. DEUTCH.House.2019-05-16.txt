 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment  be modified in the form I have placed at the desk.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, the amendment is a technical amendment to  address a drafting error so that it is conforming and so there will be  no problems going forward.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my Florida colleague, Representative Castor, for her  leadership in protecting access to high-quality healthcare in our State  and across the country and for her authorship of the ENROLL Act to help  more Americans shop for and sign up for health plans on healthcare.gov.   My amendment requires navigators to provide information in plain  language about the 10 essential health benefits that are a part of  every healthcare.gov plan: outpatient hospital care; emergency care;  hospitalization; pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care; mental health  and substance use disorder services; prescription medicines;  rehabilitative services; labs; preventive care; and pediatric care,  including dental and vision services.   It also requires navigators to help consumers understand their  protections under the Mental Health Parity Act. According to a survey  commissioned by the American Psychological Association, only 4 percent  of Americans were familiar with the mental health parity law as of  2014, and just 7 percent were aware of mental health parity more  broadly. Those numbers didn't change from the time of passage of the  Affordable Care Act in 2010 through the first years of enrollment in  2014.   Mental health parity means insurance companies can't discriminate  against Americans battling addiction in the opioid crisis. Parity means  insurance companies can't make it harder to get care for deadly eating  disorders than it is to get care for deadly cancer. Parity means we  treat mental healthcare like healthcare because that is exactly what it  is.   The Affordable Care Act's protections have saved lives and the  financial security of millions of Americans, including one family who  told me the story of their battle to treat their 19-year-old daughter's  eating disorder. Here is what they said:         Our daughter was a sophomore in college when she was       diagnosed with an eating disorder. She had to take several       leaves of absence from her studies to seek treatment. This       would not have been financially possible without the benefits       of the ACA. Had she left school for treatment before the       passage of the ACA, she would have been dropped from our       family insurance. But because of the ACA, she could continue       under our coverage.        It was this ongoing treatment that has allowed our daughter       to regain her health enough to graduate from college and       maintain full-time employment.    While it is clear that parity has made improvements, we still have so  much more to do.   This week, I heard from another family in my district about their  daughter's struggle to get coverage and treatment. In the cycle of  denials and arbitrarily reduced levels of care, her family was able to  use the parity law to fight for their daughter's life in the courts.   But that is not enough. Parity protections have opened doors to  better mental health and addiction treatment for so many Americans. As  we observe Mental Health Awareness Month, it is important to  acknowledge how far we have to go.   My amendment will help more Americans understand the benefits and  protections available to them and help them get the care they need.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is an important amendment so that  every American understands that mental health is health and that we  need to care as much about the health of our bodies from our shoulders  up as we do from our shoulders down. That is what people need to be  made aware of so they have the ability to fight for that access to  mental healthcare.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
