 Mr. Speaker, sadly, I rise today to honor a friend, Ms.  Kelly Kreeger, who lost her life this past summer on July 5.   Kelly was killed in a midair collision above the lake at Coeur  d'Alene, Idaho. She was, indeed, doing what she loved as a flier, as an  aviation enthusiast, and as a pilot.   Her loss is felt throughout our district by her friends, her family,  and even, very personally, our office. We have one of our offices at  the Auburn Airport, so our interactions with her and other aviators was  quite frequent.   Like many in Placer County in northern California, we are mourning  the loss of this friend, a patriot. She was such a good, genuine  person, whom I got to know personally through our many interactions.   She devoted much of her time to our community, to our veterans, and  it is through Kelly, of course, that I met and formed a friendship with  a great, great veteran, Colonel Bud Anderson, who is a World War II  triple ace fighter pilot. It was just this summer she organized an  event for him at his home to honor him for his birthday.   I am very grateful to Kelly for the introduction to Colonel Anderson,  of course, a man I am honored to call my friend as well.   She frequently staffed and organized the events in the community for  Colonel Bud that were certainly befitting his World War II  accomplishments. They had a street naming for him near the airfield,  just so many ways that he was to be honored properly. What a great man  he is, and so their association was certainly a natural one.   My staff and I are blessed, of course, to be part of the many events  that Kelly was famous for. Included were several P-51 Mustang flyovers,  which anybody who loves aircraft loves those; the Never Forget series;  road dedications, as I mentioned, at the Auburn Airport named for  Colonel Bud; birthday parties for Colonel Bud; and, of course, honoring  the men and women of World War II, the Greatest Generation.   Whenever Kelly would call, you knew that something wonderful was  about to happen that she had planned. It was the sort of thing that  could make you stand up a little taller and get your red, white, and  blue out.   Kelly, of course, being a great patriot, loved the United States of  America, from her American flag cowgirl boots to the infectious smile  she shared with all she met. Indeed, that captures who she is right  there in that photo. You wouldn't hardly see her without a smile,  especially when she was taking part in her much-greater-than-a-hobby  love for aircraft, aviation, and the people and the veterans  associated.   As I mentioned, it was my privilege to be part of the Flag Day Parade  for Colonel Bud in Auburn as well. She brought together children,  Jeeps, classic cars, and even a flyover to bring Colonel Bud that much  more joy.   During this time of pandemic when everybody is shut in, of course, we  all shared that same joy. It brought a sense of community, a sense of  remembering who America is, even though we have all been pent up for  all this time that, indeed, this virus is temporary and we will be  together as a community once again.   Our Nation and its people are strong, and nothing will stop us from  celebrating our heroes. Kelly embodied that.   Kelly was known to like loud, fast cars, indeed, after my own heart  there as well. She was able to rebuild an engine herself and was not  afraid of any hard work.   She is survived by her mother, Nancy, and two sisters; her brother,  David; many nieces and nephews; and her lifelong best friend, Vicki.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members please join me in prayers for Kelly's  family and friends in this difficult time. Join with my office as we  personally feel this pain of her loss.   At this time, we just ask blessings on Kelly and those closest to  her. God bless her.   We will never forget you.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate National Small  Business Week, which recognizes the contributions small business owners  and entrepreneurs make to our great society.   More than half of Americans either own or work for a small business,  and they create nearly two out of three  [[Page H4652]]  jobs in the U.S. every year. Unfortunately, our small businesses have  been through the wringer this year. With coronavirus and overreaching  government regulations, especially in States like California, now more  than ever they are relying on us to help them through this difficult  time.   If we want to get America's economy back on track to be the greatest  in the world, it starts with support for our small businesses. They are  the key to propelling America's prosperity forward.                            ____________________
