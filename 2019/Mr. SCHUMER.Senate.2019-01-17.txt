 First, I want to echo the words of my colleague, our  great ranking member of Health and Human Services, Senator Murray.   Now, look, folks. As the Trump shutdown drags into its 27th day, the  pain inflicted on our country, our citizens, and our economy grows. The  Council of Economic Advisers said the shutdown would hurt our economy  twice as much  [[Page S288]]  as originally projected. Experts are predicting it could wipe out the  entire first quarter of economic growth.   At airports, an understaffed TSA means longer and longer lines.  Yesterday, the executive vice president of the National Air Traffic  Controllers Association said that flying ``is less safe today than a  month ago, absolutely.''   Hundreds of thousands of public servants are suffering. I can give a  list of a long number. President Trump, this shutdown--your shutdown-- has gone on too long. Why is President Trump punishing folks like so  many of my constituents who have nothing to do with disagreements about  borders?   If you sense exasperation in my tone, you are right. We Democrats are  exasperated. All we want to do is reopen the government. We are happy  to debate border security with the President and our Republican  colleagues--happy to. But let's reopen the government.   My Republican friends here, both the President and Leader McConnell,  are ignoring the overwhelming will of the American people. We urge our  colleagues to think about this. We know that President Trump is not  interested in ending the shutdown. Leader McConnell knows he has the  power to end the shutdown. The only reason we are in this prolonged  stalemate is that my friend the Republican leader refuses to take up  any legislation to reopen government. We should do it now.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I yield back our time.    We spent the past few days debating the resolution of  disapproval of the Treasury Department's plan to relax sanctions on  Russia. We have made clear that Treasury's plan is insufficient and  lets Putin and his cronies off the hook. We have made clear that  Putin's malign activities around the globe have not abated. We have  made clear that there is no reason to relieve sanctions on one of our  chief adversaries when there has been no reconciliation and in exchange  for nothing.   Earlier this week, 10 brave Republicans joined us on the motion to  proceed and again on cloture, but it was not enough for passage. So  many other Republicans who have campaigned that Democrats are not tough  enough on Putin, when they had a chance to be tough on Putin, ran for  the exits. I just want to let my colleagues know that the House was  different and in this case far more courageous.   The House passed the same resolution of disapproval 362 to 53.  Republicans by more than a 2-to-1 ratio--more than 2 to 1--voted to not  allow the loosening of sanctions on Deripaska's Rusal, as 136 of them  joined with the unanimous--unanimous--support of House Democrats to  pass the resolution.   So two votes--two small votes--stand in the way of passage here in  the Senate. Let the overwhelming bipartisan House vote be a message to  my Republican friends in the Senate. We should pass this resolution. We  should not let Putin get his way simply because Donald Trump has always  wanted him to--too often.   So I am going to shortly reconsider the resolution before it expires  tonight at midnight. I strongly urge my friend the leader not to block  the request and give Republican Senators a chance to change their minds  on this incredibly important motion.  [[Page S289]]    So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 14, H.J. Res. 30; that the joint  resolution be considered read for a third time and the Senate vote on  passage with a 60-vote affirmative threshold, with no intervening  action or debate; and that if the joint resolution fails to achieve 60  votes for passage, it be returned to the calendar.
