 Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the  150th anniversary of the founding of Tangipahoa Parish in my home State  of Louisiana. It is a parish filled with hard-working and patriotic  citizens who work day in and day out to better our State and our  Nation.   Tangipahoa Parish is located in the section of the State known as the  Florida Parishes. The word Tangipahoa means ``those who gather corn''  and refers to a sub-Tribe of Native Americans called the Acolapissa.  The parish is 823 square miles, with the Mississippi State line serving  as its northern border and Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain at its  southern border.   This part of our State is rich with history. The Natives used this  area as part of a route to travel between Mobile and Pensacola and  through Pass Manchac to Illinois and the Great Lakes. The Acolapissa  Tribe also led Bienville and Iberville through Manchac, where they  named two nearby lakes ``Maurepas'' and ``Pontchartrain'' to honor the  French finance ministers who supported the New World colony, which  Bienville named New Orleans.   The French and Spanish controlled their Louisiana territory for some  time. However, the British controlled the Florida Parishes. The  Louisiana Purchase gave Louisiana to the United States, but the Florida  Parishes were not a part of the purchase. It was an international  boundary between the Spanish and the United States until 1812 when  Louisiana was named a State.   In the mid-1800s, the railroad industry brought development into the  area. However, people felt inconvenienced by the distance they had to  travel to conduct business in the nearby parishes. To solve this,  citizens carved out their own parish from the four surrounding  parishes. The boundaries were solidified by law in 1869, which created  Tangipahoa Parish.   Tangipahoa Parish is home to the State's third largest public  university, Southeastern Louisiana University. It is also known for its  many festivals, including the Strawberry Festival, the Sicilian  Heritage Festival, the Italian Festival, and the Oyster Festival. The  pop icon Britney Spears is from the town of Kentwood, in Tangipahoa  Parish.   Happy 150th anniversary to Tangipahoa Parish. You are etched in our  colorful and rich history. Thank you for all of your contributions to  our beautiful State that we are fortunate to call home.  [[Page S3359]]                                ____________________
