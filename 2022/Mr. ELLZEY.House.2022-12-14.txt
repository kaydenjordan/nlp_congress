 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this special order.    Madam Speaker, thanks for sticking around.   In July, I addressed the House floor with my version of a speech my  childhood pastor would give every Sunday called ``Joys and Concerns.''  During this, he would highlight some of the remarkable things that  members of the church were doing and some of their many  accomplishments. He would also take this time to bring up prayer  requests to unite as a congregation and to pray for our community and  those in need.   During my last speech, I followed his example, and I was able to  bring attention to dozens of outstanding people living in Tarrant,  Ellis, and Navarro Counties.   I also asked those in this Chamber and across our Nation to join in  prayer to help many who were struggling.   Since that day, of course, a lot has happened, and my office has sent  out hundreds of recognition letters across my district. Many  constituents have written to my office to express their own joy or  concern.   So, today, I come before the House of Representatives to, once again,  follow in my pastor's footsteps and do my own version of ``Joys and  Concerns.''   I think it is only fitting to start with those who give so much to us  each and every day. October 28 is the day we set aside each year to  celebrate and thank our first responders.   My district, District 6 of Texas, has 20 police departments, 13 fire  departments, and 3 sheriff's offices, currently. In the new district,  it will go to nine sheriff's offices.   Life as we know it would not be possible without the dedication that  the brave men and women who serve in these departments exhibit each  day.   It would take hours to list off each officer who serves us, and while  I do not have time to do that today, nor would anybody want me to, I  want to take a moment and recognize the leaders of each department.    Thank you to Chief Joe Wiser from Waxahachie, Carl Smith from  Midlothian, Garland Wolf from Red Oak PD, Chief Dustin Munn from Ennis  PD, John Thacker from Maypearl, Chief Tracy Aaron from Mansfield, Chief  Scott McAuley from Italy, Chief Jesus Mancillas from Ferris, Chief  Chris Amos from Milford, Chief John Zaidle from Palmer, Chief T.C.  Lawhon from Blooming Grove, Chief Robert Johnson from Corsicana, Chief  Scott Sykora from Dawson, Chief Charles Parson from Rice, Chief Daniel  Scesney from Grand Prairie, Chief Roy Ivey from Kerens, Chief Al Jones  from Arlington, Sheriff Brad Norman from Ellis County, Sheriff Elmer  Tanner from Navarro County, Chief Bill Waybourn from Tarrant County,  Chief Ricky Boyd from Waxahachie Fire, Chief Dale McCaskill from  Midlothian Fire, Chief Ben Blanton from Red Oak, Chief Bill Evans from  Ennis Fire, Chief Michael Ross from Mansfield Fire, Chief Jackie Cate  from Italy Fire, Chief Brian Horton from Ferris Fire, Chief Mark  Jackson from Milford Fire, Chief Kevin Rhoades from Palmer Fire, Chief  Mike Ryan from Corsicana Fire, Chief Robert Fite from Grand Prairie  Fire, Chief Don Crowson from Arlington Fire, and Chief Brandon Kennedy  from the Ovilla Fire Department.  [[Page H9844]]    You all go above the call each and every day, and it is my honor to  recognize you.   I also acknowledge the 30 applicants from Texas' Sixth Congressional  District who want to serve in our Nation's military academies. It is an  extreme honor as a 1992 Naval Academy graduate to pick the future  generation of leaders for this country, both in the military and  perhaps in statesmanship.   These men and women raised their hands and said, ``I am here. Send  me,'' and I recognize them here: Lucy Ballard from Mansfield Legacy,  Alexander Brough from Mansfield High, Jacob Brown from Mansfield Lake  Ridge, Marshall Cloyd from St. Stephen's Episcopal, Michael Cook from  Mansfield High, Austin Garcia from Midlothian High, Shania Grant from  iSchool Virtual Academy of Texas, Reid Griffin from James W. Martin  High, Joseph Gutierrez from Ennis High, Julia Helsel from Arlington  High, Brett Hoelscher from Arlington High, Jared Howell from Mansfield  Legacy, Alexander Huh from Lake Braddock Secondary, Hieu Huynh from  Arlington Bowie, Brian Larson from Nolan Catholic High, Ezra Lee from  James W. Martin High, Noah Loughlin from Mansfield Lake Ridge High,  Giovanni Mancuso from Midlothian High, Caitlyn New from Palmer High,  Asher Nguyen from James W. Martin High, Ricardo Olivares, Jr. from  Flower Mound High, Austin Palacios from Arlington Lamar High, Troy  Roberts, Jr. from All Saints Episcopal School, Madison Rodriguez from  James W.

Dana Compton: Congratulations on being awarded Civilian of the Year  by the Mansfield ISD Police Department. This honor recognizes your  commitment to the community that will leave a lasting impact for many  years to come. Leaders provide the structure and organization that  others aspire to have.

Your outstanding performance has helped strengthen the  relationship between public officials and community members. Your hard  work and dedication have inspired others to lead and follow your  exceptional example. The numerous contributions you have made to this  community will have a lasting impact for many years to come.   Madam Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx.)    It is a pleasure.   Madam Speaker, continuing on with the folks whom we were talking  about earlier:   I would like to recognize and congratulate Charles ``Chuck'' Beatty.   I congratulate you on having the new city hall annex in Waxahachie  named after you. Your outstanding leadership and service to Waxahachie  is greatly appreciated. You are a role model to your community, and I  commend you on your willingness to serve and your dedication to our  community.

We continue to remain indebted to all  those who have worn the uniform and sacrificed their all for our  beloved freedom.   Brian and Jeanie Harding: Thank you for volunteering with other  members of Midway Hills Christian Church and Refugee Services of Texas- Dallas, to set up a complete apartment for refugee families from the  Democratic Republic of the Congo and from Honduras in May, September,  and November.                                time  2110    Lisa West: I want to congratulate you on your retirement from  Corsicana ISD after 36 years. Lisa has served children of all ages in  the public education sector and special education. Thank you for your  years of service to our community.   I also want to recognize today an American hero, Lieutenant Commander  Richard Charles Dawson, better known as Dick. Just last month I had the  opportunity to present the Bronze Star Medal with Combat V to  Lieutenant Commander Dawson. What many may not know is that this Bronze  Star is the third highest that our military can award to a  servicemember. Any time this award is given, it is a tremendous honor.  But his was even more special because Lieutenant Commander Dawson  served our Nation in combat operations against our enemies in Vietnam  from April 1967 through March 1968. First of all, welcome home, sir.   This past April, Dick received a most unusual phone call. He was told  that Captain David Brown, his former commanding officer of Coastal  Division 11 was in the process of moving his home. Captain Brown had  discovered the original documentation supporting Dick's nomination for  the Bronze Star with Combat V.   Captain Brown then realized that the Department of the Navy had not  received the original package sent 54 years ago. After an  investigation, Captain Brown organized a small team to help correct  this oversight.   The paperwork was resubmitted and approved. It was an honor to be a  part of the ceremony. It proved that bipartisanship is alive and well  in Washington, D.C., and that we put America first, and we take care of  those who have taken care of us. Thank you, sir, for all you have done  for your country.   As an aside, I thank the Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, for  approving this award, it was well-deserved, and thank you for your  timeliness on it.   These are just a few examples of some outstanding people living in  Texas' Sixth District. So when you think that there is no hope in this  country, know that there is. There are good people like this everywhere  across our country, I am just talking about the folks in the Sixth  District, and it is my privilege to honor them on the House floor.   Every Sunday, after the joys would, of course, come the concerns, and  there was never a shortage because everyone knew in Matthew, he says,  ``When two or three are gathered in My name, I am in the midst of  them.'' And at times like these, everybody is in need in some way or  somehow, especially during the Christmas season.   I will start with a concern from Katherine Bongfeldt. She asks that  we all pray for the safety of our allies who are still in Afghanistan.  That those brave men and women who helped when we needed it most are  protected and safe during these uncertain times in their country--and I  sure hope we get them out.   I ask that you keep the Estes, Williams, and Tribbles families in our  prayers, for they have all lost a loved one. Anyone who has lost a  mother, father, brother, or sister knows how challenging these times  can be, especially during the holidays.   Mary from Ennis, Texas, would like us to keep an open door during  this holiday season. Many out there do not have a place to call home or  a family to have dinner with. Thank you, Mary.   Please pray for the family of Officer Brandon Tsai. Officer Tsai from  Grand Prairie Police Department was killed in a collision last month  while pursuing a driver fleeing a traffic stop.   On October 16, Coach Cliff White from Midlothian High School lost his  battle with cancer and Midlothian lost  [[Page H9846]]  a pillar of their community. Coach White was more than a coach to his  students, he was a mentor. Even during his hardest days, you would find  him at every sporting event cheering on his teams. You will be missed,  Coach.   I ask that you keep all Americans in your prayers. Keep joy in your  hearts, hope in man, and faith in God.   Next, I want to talk about somebody that many of us in Washington  know well.   On February 23, 1945, Hershel ``Woody'' Williams made history and was  presented our Nation's highest military honor for his inspirational  leadership and action in Iwo Jima; that is the Medal of Honor.   On July 3, 2022, Woody once again made history by being the first  enlisted man to ever be ``Lain in Honor'' here in our Nation's Capitol.   Even in death, Woody served his country, for his funeral gave all  Americans the opportunity to salute the 16 million men and women who  served in our Armed Forces during the Second World War.   In the 246-year history our country, no enlisted man had ever lain in  honor under the dome of our Capitol. On July 3, American history was  changed for the better.   There are few things that can change this world more than a powerful  child's idea--or a powerful idea from a powerful child. In 2014, 7- year-old Rabel Josephine McNutt was preparing to attend her  godfather's, Medal of Honor recipient, Walter Ehlers' funeral. Moved by  what she saw, she turned to her father, Bill, and said: Daddy, let's  get them to do a big funeral in Washington, D.C., for Uncle Walter's  friends.   So, Rabel and Bill got to work. The idea became a national cause with  volunteer efforts conducted in all 50 States; Sixteen State  legislatures passed resolutions, 15 congressional delegations wrote  letters of support, 11 State Governors wrote to the White House, and  the America Legion unanimously supported the mission at their 100th  convention.   Today, 35 million American families claim a parent, grandparent, or  close relative who fought in World War II. Make no mistake, they are  the reason we enjoy our freedoms today. The courage, devotion, and  faith that brought us through World War II's perils are exemplified by  the State funeral for these American heroes.   To the 16 million men and women who gave their lives or sacrificed in  some way so we can be here today, thank you and God bless. I would ask  that in the future every Medal of Honor recipient that is still alive,  that they get to lay in honor in the rotunda.   Next, I want to recognize a man that has spent his entire life in  service to his community. Chief Wade Goolsby has spent the last 42  years in law enforcement and September 30 he said he was finally done.   Chief Goolsby may call Waxahachie PD home now, but Waxahachie is not  the only department that has changed for the better.   He started his career with the Arlington Police Department where he  worked patrol, investigations, and professional standards. After being  promoted to sergeant, he served in leadership roles at the Coppell  Police Department, the Southlake Police Department, and the Seguin  Police Department before he landed home as the chief of police for  Waxahachie where he has been for the last 7 years.   If you ask the chief what the best part of his job is, without a  doubt he will say catching the bad guys, and over his 42 years of  service he did that a lot.   I have known Wade for the last 7 years, and I can honestly say that  the Waxahachie Police Department would not be where it is now without  his leadership. I know his goal was to leave every department he worked  at in a better place than when he started, and he did. You did it, my  friend.   I, and the people of Waxahachie thank you for your years of  dedication and service and for keeping our community save.   I wish both you and Sheryl a very happy retirement--whatever that  looks likes. I know you will succeed in your next goal of having the  best-looking yard.   As I said before, my district had 30 applicants of young men and  women eager to serve in our Nation's military academies. I had the  opportunity to sit down and meet each of them a few weeks ago. If  anybody is worried about the direction of our country, or if we will  have strong leaders in the coming years, don't be.   I would like you to meet my applicants. I promise you after meeting  them, by listening to their essays, you will be filled with hope for  our country. I want to take some time to read to you why these  applicants want to serve in our Nation's military, why they believe in  our country, and why they are hopeful for our future.   I asked each of these candidates to write one, and after I read them,  I was particularly touched by several of them. I was touched by all of  them, but here are a few that I would like to present to you today.   First is Michael Cook's, and these are his words:         An education through a service academy is right for me       because I aspire to academically challenge myself, develop       essential skills for any environment I may encounter, enhance       my leadership ability, and most importantly, gain the       essential preparation to ultimately serve and protect the       United States of America.        All of the academies offer a one-of-a-kind experience       academically, especially in the STEM fields, something that       pairs well with my desire to study mechanical engineering, or       a field closely related to it.        Each academy offers a vast array of resources through       state-of-the-art labs and equipment; in addition, access to       high-level and experienced professors to ensure that each       cadet acquires the necessary skills to excel in engineering.        Most importantly, the academies offer a real-world and       critical application for all labs and experiences.        I have no doubt that access to these resources will allow       me to become the best academic version of myself and position       me to excel in any STEM-based career.        Of equal importance to me is the dedication each academy       has to developing capable leaders in today's world. By       attending a service academy, I believe my leadership skills       will progress exponentially.        Since participation in some form of sports is a       requirement, all students will learn valuable lessons through       teamwork and encounter opportunities to lead in some fashion.        I know the coaches at the academy can use these lessons to       instill more refined leadership capabilities which will       translate into a career as an officer.        The academy's rigor and plethora of experiences are key in       developing leaders, as I would be exposed to various       scenarios encountered in the military, thus further equipping       me to lead others.        A service academy education is about more than a superior       experience academically; it uniquely pairs that with       preparing cadets to be officers and serve the United States       of America. Each academy offers a tough military regiment to       simulate military life.        Programs such as SERE, the survival escape program,       parachutist programs, flight programs, sea year, and       countless other programs enhance the capabilities of cadets       as they see firsthand what it takes to be excellent leaders       in the United States of America's military.        In my service, I want to be a combat rescue officer or       pilot. Through these extensive programs offered, I will       develop unique and tangible skills necessary to execute       missions as a pilot.        Ultimately, any service academy, through the academic       rigor, leadership opportunities, and countless programs, will       develop me into the best version of myself and allow me to       serve our great Nation to the best of my ability.                                time  2120    The next is applicant Asher Nguyen.         From computer coding to aviation warfare, the military       academies are prestige organizations that dedicate their       assets to train cadets, ultimately contributing to the       welfare of our Nation.        I want to attend a military academy because I explored what       it takes to be an officer and I believe that I possess both       the leadership qualities and selflessness to pursue a       military career.        Leadership is a key trait to serving in the military.       Taking initiative actions to guide companions is necessary to       pursue success. As the senior class president and as someone       who has taken many initiative roles in school clubs, I have       gained experience as a leader and a team player.        From effectively heading a STEM leadership conference of       300-plus students and earning the title of ``Compelled'' in       football by leading with my actions, I learned to carry out       leadership responsibilities in school, which correlates to       carrying out responsibilities in the military.        Participating in leadership opportunities opened the gates       and inspired me to guide those around me. Serving in the       Armed Forces would allow me to further cultivate my teamwork       and leadership skills, as well as help others.        The opportunity to serve in the military would also allow       me to return the favor it did for my family.    This is the important part that I want to express to you.   [[Page H9847]]              My father escaped the horrors of the Vietnam war at the age       of 9. His boat was stranded. However, a naval ship appeared       and saved my father's family. This incident was instilled       into my father's core memory, which inspired him to serve in       the military.        My father does play a small role in my inspiration to       attend and serve in the military. However, the main reason I       would like to serve is to help other families the way my       family was aided.        Being granted the opportunity to help others the same way       my father was helped is a dream of mine. No matter the role       in the military, every action contributes to the welfare of       our country.        Serving in the military would not only allow me to return       the favor as it has done for my family but ultimately serve       the people that define the United States of America.        Through physical fitness, educational opportunities, and       teamwork cooperation, I believe the military academies are       the best route to helping others and cultivating leadership,       ultimately contributing to our country's welfare and serving       others.    I think that is just fantastic.   The next is from Jacob Brown.         Attending a service academy is the ideal pathway to       achieving my goal of becoming a military officer. I believe       the service academy's overall experiences and benefits far       outweigh those of any traditional college.        I am excited to continue leadership and disciplined       learning at a service academy needed for the foundation of a       future military officer. I attended a summer aviation program       in Virginia in 2015, at the age of 10, which introduced me to       aviation.        I later joined the Civil Air Patrol in 2017 after my father       retired from the United States Secret Service and my family       relocated to Texas. Through the Civil Air Patrol, I have       experienced several military functions, such as staying on       military bases for summer encampment and leadership schools       over the past 5 years.        The experience I gained from attending leadership schools       such as Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy, Officer       Training School, and Cadet Command Staff College has helped       me advance to the rank of cadet colonel.        As the current cadet commander at my squadron, I have had       the opportunity to develop my leadership abilities through       conducting weekly drills and promotion review boards. The       Civil Air Patrol exposed me to the wonderful opportunity of       the military. Therefore, I have chosen a career path to       become an officer in the U.S. military.        Together, these experiences over the last 5 years have       provided a sound foundation that I believe has equipped me to       succeed in a service academy and future career in the       military. I was accepted last summer to an 8-week-long flight       school in New Bern, North Carolina.        There, I completed my solo flight, solo cross country, and       long solo cross country. I only have a couple of hours left       to take my check ride for my private pilot license. What       makes me a unique candidate for a nomination to the military       academy is the level of commitment and dedication I       demonstrated in setting and accomplishing goals.        For example, I began setting long-term goals when I was 6       years old with the 3-year program to successfully achieve my       black belt in tae kwon do. While I was motivated when I       started the program in 2011, at age 6, after a year and a       half, I faced a wall and wanted to stop and start another       sport.        Ultimately, through the leadership of my father, I       developed the invaluable trait of perseverance. Since that       early period in my life, I have used that lesson about the       power of commitment and dedication to overcome other walls       toward my goals.        Through commitment and dedication, I accomplished the Civil       Air Patrol's highest cadet achievement and promotion to cadet       colonel with the successful completion of the General Carl A.       Spaatz Award, which less than 1 percent of all cadets in the       Civil Air Patrol achieve.        I believe my experiences, training, and overall       preparedness through leadership and development in the Civil       Air Patrol have enhanced my level of commitment needed to       persevere through a military academy and as an officer in       the military after graduation.    Next is Ezra Lee.         Since the beginning, the United States has always needed       great leaders. To that end, military academies have been a       critical component in producing such leaders. The position       that the academies graduates put them in a place where they       have the ability to make an impact.        I want to attend a military academy because of the       extraordinary leadership, character-building, and academic       education it will provide to make me the best version of       myself to serve my country and my endeavors.        Attending an academy will allow me to be a part of       something bigger than myself by surrounding myself with the       same motivations, ambitions, and dedication.        Many people consider college to be a time of growth,       bonding, and change. While these are important, some will       desire more, like the desire to truly test themselves and       push beyond what they thought was imaginable.        While spending time at UTA through my dual-credit program,       I have found myself wanting more than the traditional college       experience.        Learning about how hard the academies push cadets through       their detailed scheduling, pressure, and rigorous academics,       I have found them to be the perfect place to fill what I       could not find in a traditional college.        The academies' physical, academic, and mental toughness       turn many away, but this is why I want to attend. I want to       be put in an environment in which I can truly test myself in       order to become the best version of myself to help others and       make an impact.        Throughout my life, I have had the privilege of being a       part of many communities, such as church, school, and       orchestra. I have developed an appreciation for what strong       communities provide.        A strong community such as my church has given me my faith       and has provided me with countless people who have changed my       life. Seeing those who have developed strong character has       given me a desire to pursue it.        School has provided me with friends and teachers who have       cared for me and given me a desire to learn.        Orchestra has provided me with an environment that has       pushed me and allowed me to understand teamwork.        Attending a military academy is the best option for me       because this is where the aspects of what I appreciate the       most from these communities, faith, care, teamwork, and       connection, come together in one place.        Additionally, it would allow me to give back to others in       these communities by serving. Ultimately, I want to attend a       military academy to be challenged and pushed in a way that       allows me to not only serve this country but also to emerge       as a leader and the most optimal version of myself. This is       what I desire to do most for the next decade of my life, and       I know that this decision will be one I never regret.    Next applicant is Brett Hoelscher.         For as far as back as I can remember, I have wanted to be a       pilot. And although passenger jets are interesting, I have       only ever aspired to become a military aviator.        My uncle, a graduate of the Air Force Academy and a former       F-16 pilot and test pilot, always shared his larger-than-life       tales with me as a kid and encouraged me to dream big.        So, I did. I realized very quickly that my long-term goal       was to earn a degree in aerospace engineering and use that       degree plus flight experience as an aviator or Air Force       pilot to become the chief test pilot at NASA or Lockheed       Martin.        In addition, I realized how competitive applying and       attending a service academy would be, but I was excited. I       knew that the competitive nature of these academies would       only serve to better prepare me for my future in military       service and in a civilian career.        So far in my application process, I have gotten to meet       some of the brightest, kindest, most encouraging, and most       honest people I have ever met.        Through a service academy, I will forge friendships through       hardship and laughter that will last a lifetime, and I will       be able to learn from some of the best professors and mentors       this country has to offer.        At a service academy, I will be able to surround myself       with motivated, hardworking, detail-oriented men and women       who share my passion and drive to succeed at everything I do.        Through military training, I will better understand how to       lead under intense pressure, how to work within a group, and       how to be supremely confident yet humble in my actions.        Through a service academy, I will develop as a young man,       and I will be able to realize my dreams at a place few can       say they have graduated from. I know I will not quit if given       an opportunity to attend a service academy, and I can only       hope that through this application you can see my drive to       succeed at a service academy.                                time  2130    Two more.   Next is applicant Bahij Said.         Being born in the United States and having lived abroad in       the Middle East for several years, I have developed a deep       respect for the freedoms Americans enjoy.        My father, who traveled to the United States to seek a       better future, and my mother, who studied criminology and       criminal justice in hopes to improve our Nation, instilled       the conservative and patriotic values that ignited my passion       to serve this great country.        After traveling to over 35 countries, including Iran, Saudi       Arabia, and Afghanistan, I have had the unique opportunity to       see the extent other countries are willing to confirm to in       order to harm our Nation.        From openly protesting against the United States to       spreading perverted religious ideology that directly impacts       U.S. citizens, the passionate hate that these individuals       have for our country left me astounded.        The more I witnessed these hateful acts, the more I began       researching and reading about recent historical events and       actions that inspired so many of these individuals.        I read over 80 books on topics including the war on       terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, the history of radical       jihadists, the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on       detainees, and the collection and analyzation of intelligence       from high-risk areas in the Middle East in order to develop a       deeper understanding of the complex situation.        As I got older, I began questioning what I could do in       order to make a difference.        After speaking with numerous individuals, both in the       government intelligence and  [[Page H9848]]       military intelligence community, I decided that I would like       to work in the field of intelligence as well.        The decision made sense for a number of reasons, which       included my trilingual capabilities in Arabic, Pashto, and       Persian, my ability to integrate myself in high-risk       environments, and my cultural and political understanding of       enemy countries, which are all valuable assets that I would       like to utilize in defense for our Nation.        Since higher education is a goal of mine, the service       academies stood out as excellent options since they not only       provided me with a world-class education but also the tools,       training, and environment in order to defend and protect our       country.        In addition to offering a challenging setting, the faculty       at the service academies are highly distinguished in their       areas of expertise and incorporate years of experience within       their academic lessons, a characteristic not found at other       educational institutions in the United States.        The academies also provide areas to discuss and store       classified material, a necessity for somebody wanting to       branch into intelligence.        My top service academy option is the Naval Academy since I       attended the Naval Academy Summer Seminar and fell in love       with the unique history and environment of the academy.        The students and instructors that I met while attending the       summer seminar were all high-achieving, highly-motivated       individuals who were all passionate about serving their       country.        Moreover, the students and instructors at the Naval Academy       are an excellent reflection of the overall category of       individuals who attend other service academies, individuals       who demonstrate both intelligence and athleticism and are       drawn toward service and duty.        As a Muslim and Middle Easterner, an underrepresented       minority in the United States military, it would be a great       honor to be selected to attend a service academy. I look       forward to serving my country by taking the first steps as a       midshipman.    That young man was 18.   Finally, applicant Marshall Cloyd:         I would like to attend a service academy because of my       desire to incorporate a sense of purpose in my undergraduate       experience and for the tangible career opportunities afforded       at a service academy. Furthermore, I believe that the ideals       of democracy and personal freedom our country stands for are       something worth protecting.        In Europe, South Korea, and many other places, our Armed       Forces are the only reason there is peace and justice. The       possibility and purpose of serving as a part of this       important cause enthralls me.        Another thing I noticed while touring multiple service       academies was the visible sense of comradery amongst the       cadets. The bond I witnessed while visiting was something I       value deeply in my personal life and wish to feel at whatever       workplace or academic institution I attend.        Military academies also develop you as a person in a way       that a traditional civilian school doesn't. For one, everyone       who graduates from a service academy is trained into being a       leader and goes on to develop said leadership skills after       graduation.        Military academies are also known for being academically       rigorous and competitive places filled with driven and       purposeful people. I value this sort of culture within my       current academic life and wish to continue it into my       undergraduate years.        I also respect the emphasis placed on physical prowess       present at military academies. I want a career that requires       a standard for physical fitness, as it is something both       missing from and deeply needed by American society.    It is indeed an honor and a difficult choice to have to choose from  these incredible young men and women from the Sixth District of Texas.  I realize that every district in this country has young men and women  just like that. No matter what you see on mass media about the demise  of our country and the downfall, our brightest days are yet ahead.   Ecclesiastes 1:9 says: There is nothing new under the Sun.   Let's have a bright outlook toward the future, especially at this  time.   I thank the people behind us who work so hard and so long, so many  hours, and especially the stenographers for all their hard work and for  everything that they do. It is a pleasure and honor to be working with  them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
