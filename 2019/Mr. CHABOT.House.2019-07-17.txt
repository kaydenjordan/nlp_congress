 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership on this and many other issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S.J. Res. 37 which would  prevent the transfer of Paveway precision-guided munitions to the  United Arab Emirates.   There are numerous reasons to oppose this resolution. Let me list  three:   First, and most obviously, some Paveways have already left the U.S.,  and this fact alone shows that this resolution is more about messaging  than action and demonstrates the urgent need the UAE has for these  munitions.   Second, the UAE is a steadfast partner against Iran. Tehran is our  foremost opponent in the region right now and a critical threat to our  interests there. I would note that the very flawed Iran deal put  millions--in fact, billions and billions--of dollars of cash into the  pockets of Iran, and they are now using those dollars to support  terrorism, foment instability, put mines on ships, and attack ships in  international waters. So they are now a threat not just in the region  but a threat around the world. So, thank God, President Trump had the  good sense to get us out of that terrible deal.   If we want the UAE's continued help, we need to make sure that we are  a reliable partner and that they are properly armed.   The third item is that the U.S. needs to continue its leadership in  the region. If the UAE and Saudi Arabia cannot buy arms from us, that  doesn't mean they won't get arms. It just means that they will buy them  from the Russians. This will diminish our standing, weaken our leverage  with our partners, and call into question our reliability as a partner.   For these reasons and others, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  resolution. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
