 Mr. President, as I said yesterday, the Senate has a  number of nominations to consider in the coming days.   Yesterday we voted to advance a well-qualified judicial nominee to  serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.   Soon we will consider one of the President's nominations for the  National Labor Relations Board, and we obviously need to confirm an FBI  Director. I would hope, with all the threats facing us at home and  abroad, our Democratic colleagues would not launch the first filibuster  of a nominee to be FBI Director, especially one who was reported out of  the Judiciary Committee by a vote to 20 to 0. These are just a few of  the many nominees who need to be acted upon and quickly.   Up until now, our friends across the aisle have thrown up one  unnecessary procedural hurdle after the next on even the most  uncontroversial of nominees. As a result, I noted last month that at  the pace we were going, it would take more than 11 years to confirm the  remaining Presidential appointments. Well, that pace has slowed even  further. Now it would take 12 years.   It is time to end this.   I look forward to our Democratic colleagues cooperating with us to do  that so the Senate can spend its time considering other things that are  important to our constituents. We have legislation to address over the  remainder of this work period as well. Our veterans deserve the best  care the country can provide. Under the last administration's VA  scandal, the veterans were let down in a big way. Congress came  together in the wake of that scandal to pass the Veterans Choice  Program, which allows many veterans to skip the long wait and travel  times at some VA facilities and access private care.   The House recently acted to shore up this program on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, 414 to nothing. Now the Senate needs  to act as well.   We also need to renew the FDA User Fee Program. This program is  critical to speeding up the drug approval process, and that is  important to everyone frustrated by the time and costs of bringing  lifesaving drugs to market. Without it, the important work of ensuring  that drugs and devices are safe and effective would literally come to a  screeching halt. Every 5 years, these agreements need to be reviewed  and reauthorized. The Senate legislation to do so was reported by the  HELP Committee on a 21-to-2 bipartisan vote, and given the lifesaving  developments in immunotherapy and personalized medicine on the horizon,  it is more important than ever.   We have important work to do over the remainder of this work period.  I hope colleagues will cooperate across the aisle in our efforts to do  so.

Mr. President, earlier this year the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs completed an investigation into internet sex trafficking. After  completing that investigation, the Subcommittee referred its staff  reports and findings to the United States Department of Justice for  additional investigation. The Subcommittee has received a request from  the Department seeking access to records that the Subcommittee obtained  during the investigation.   In keeping with the Senate's practice under its rules, this  resolution would authorize the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of  the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, acting jointly, to  provide records, obtained by the Subcommittee in the course of its  investigation, in response to this request and requests from other  Federal or State government entities and officials with a legitimate  need for the records.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material of the bill  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 237         Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of       the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs       conducted an investigation into Internet sex trafficking;        Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a request from a       federal law enforcement agency for access to records of the       Subcommittee's investigation;        Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United       States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no       evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate       can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from       such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;        Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or       in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion       of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote       the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the       Senate: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of       the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee       on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, acting       jointly, are authorized to provide to law enforcement       officials, regulatory agencies, and other entities or       individuals duly authorized by federal or state governments,       records of the Subcommittee's investigation into Internet sex       trafficking.                            ____________________
