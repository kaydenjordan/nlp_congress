 Mr. President, I would like to call up my amendment No.  1058 and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask for 6 minutes of debate prior to the  rollcall vote.    Mr. President, for 50 years--50 years--the Federal  Government has put into the water, into the soil, into the air of St.  Louis and surrounding regions radioactive nuclear material.   They have not told the people of St. Louis. They have not compensated  the people of St. Louis. They have not helped the people of St. Louis-- in fact, just the opposite. For decades--decades--they told the people  of St. Louis: No problem. There is no problem here.   Meanwhile, children were dying of cancer, and people all over the  region were contracting autoimmune diseases. Why? Because the  groundwater had been poisoned, because the creeks where they played in  had been poisoned. And now we know for a fact that the government has  covered it up for decades.   Mr. President, it is time to make this right. The amendment we are  about to vote on is a very simple amendment. It is about basic justice:  compensating the victims of the Federal Government's negligence for  what the government itself has done.   And it hasn't only happened in Missouri. It has happened around the  country, which is why this amendment would reauthorize a victims fund  for those who have suffered because of the government's negligence. And  by ``suffered'' I mean gotten sick and had family members die--in  Missouri, in States across the country. It reauthorizes it, and it  makes it available to those who have been the victims of what the  government has done.   This is a bipartisan bill. I am proud to have worked with Senator  Lujan, Senator Crapo, Senator Schmitt, and others.   Now I would like to recognize the Senator from New Mexico, Senator  Lujan.
