 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the situation  we have with agriculture and water in California and the President's  acknowledgment just a couple of days ago that we are going to see a  food shortage in the world but partially even in the United States of  America.   That is unbelievable to me. How could we, the United States of  America, be facing possible food shortages? Indeed, already on the  store shelves is empty space.   I remember a story just a few years ago where Boris Yeltsin,  President of Russia, of all places, came over and was visiting. They  took him to a grocery store in the United States, and he was amazed and  blown away and even emotional by the variety we have here.   Yet, the priorities don't seem to be producing for Americans or even  producing for those we help around the world. It seems to be based more  on environmental needs, like in my home State of California where they  are releasing more water out to the ocean than what is going to go to  agriculture this year.   Why does this affect all Americans? Why does this affect you? Because  so many of the crops that we grow in California supply somewhere  between 90 and 98 percent of what Americans eat of those crops, and we  are still doing this environmental stuff in California.                            ____________________
