 Mr. President, President Trump's outstanding Supreme  Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has earned high praise from all across the  political spectrum.   Some of it has come from unlikely corners, whether Democratic  Senators, left-leaning publications, President Obama's own legal  mentor, even his former top Supreme Court lawyer. We have heard from  those Gorsuch has taught. We have heard from many who have worked  alongside him. In fact, just a few days ago we received a letter from  several of his former law colleagues. So let me share some of that with  you now. The letter began:         We are Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.        Many of us have served in government, some during       Republican and some during Democratic administrations; some       of us have served in both. We have clerked for Supreme Court       justices and appellate and district court judges appointed by       Democratic and Republican presidents. We represent a broad       spectrum of views on politics, judicial philosophy, and many       other subjects as well. But we all agree on one thing: Our       former colleague, Neil M. Gorsuch . . . is superbly qualified       for confirmation.        He is a man of character, decency, and accomplishment, [one       who represented all of his clients] without regard to       ideology [and one] who merits this appointment.    Clearly, it is not going to be easy to paint Judge Gorsuch as  anything but extremely qualified and exceptionally fair, but that  hasn't stopped some on the left from trying. They started musing about  blocking any nominee before the President had even nominated anyone. It  is a good reminder that much of the opposition we are seeing from far  left groups and Democratic Senators isn't so much about Judge Gorsuch  as it is about their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the election.   As a Washington Post headline recently declared, ``Democrats' goal  with court nomination: Make it a referendum on Trump.''   ``[P]rominent Senate Democrats,'' the article read, are ``giving the  nominee's 10-plus years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th  Circuit almost secondary consideration.'' It seems they believe their  best, and perhaps only, bet to bring down this highly qualified judge  is by ``inject[ing] Trump into the process.''   The very next day, the New York Times ran an article about Democrats'  apparent hope that this Supreme Court fight will be ``More About Trump  Than Gorsuch.'' In other words, our Democratic colleagues are finding  it hard to oppose Judge Gorsuch on the merits, so they are trying to  divert attention and invent new hurdles for him to surmount. That is  the playbook. Sure enough, we see them running the play.   Consider the assistant Democratic leader's speech the other day. It  was supposedly about Judge Gorsuch. He sure had a lot to say about  President Trump, about things President Trump has done, about things  President  [[Page S701]]  Trump might do, about refighting old battles but precious little about  the qualifications of the actual nominee before us, and precious little  about the increasing number of accolades he has been receiving,  especially from well-known folks on the political left. I mentioned  several a moment ago.   Now we can add another to the list: Alan Dershowitz, the famous  constitutional scholar and longtime Harvard law professor. Dershowitz  described Gorsuch as ``highly credentialed and hard to oppose'' and  dismissed the idea that he would be caricatured as some sort of  ``extreme right-wing [ideologue].'' ``[T]hat doesn't seem to fit what I  know about him,'' Dershowitz said, adding that Gorsuch will ``be hard  to oppose on the merits.'' Indeed, he will.   That is precisely why our Democratic colleagues are making the debate  on his nomination about other things and other people. That is also why  they are arguing that there are special hurdles for Judge Gorsuch to  clear--hurdles they are forced to admit were not there for the first- term nominees of Democratic Presidents.   When even a leftwinger like Rachel Maddow can't help but admit that  Judge Gorsuch is ``a relatively mainstream choice,'' when even Maddow  characterizes a Democratic attempt to filibuster his nomination as  ``radical,'' it is hard to argue otherwise. That will not stop many on  the far left from trying.   I invite Democrats, who spent many months insisting ``we need nine,''  to now follow through on that advice by giving this superbly qualified  nominee fair consideration and an up-or-down vote. It is time to  finally accept the results of the election and move on so we can all  move our country forward.   That would also apply to other nominations before the Senate. Just  before the election, the Democratic leader said he believed the Senate  has a ``moral obligation, even beyond the economy and politics, to  avoid gridlock.'' Put simply, he said: ``We have to get things done.''  Yet just a few months later, Democratic obstruction has reached such  extreme levels that the smallest number of Cabinet officials have been  confirmed in modern history at this point in a Presidency. It is a  historic break in tradition, a departure from how newly elected  Presidents of both parties have been treated in decades past.   In fact, by this same point into their terms, other recent Presidents  from both sides of the aisle had more than twice as many Cabinet  officials confirmed as President Trump does now. President Obama had 12  Cabinet officials confirmed at this point in his term, President George  W. Bush had all 14 Cabinet nominees confirmed at this point, President  Clinton had 13, and President Trump has a mere 4.   It seems this gridlock and opposition has far less to do with the  nominees actually before us than the man who nominated them, just like  we are seeing with President Trump's outstanding Supreme Court pick.  The Democratic leader and his colleagues are under a great deal of  pressure from those on the left who simply cannot--cannot--accept the  results of a democratic election. They are calling for Democrats to  delay and punt and blockade the serious work of the Senate at any cost.  They would like nothing more than for Democrats to continue to resist  and prevent this President from moving our country forward.   Unfortunately, many of our friends across the aisle have given in to  these groups' calls for obstruction, and some have even gone to  unprecedented lengths to delay for delay's sake. They have forced  meaningless procedural hurdles, they have stalled confirmation votes as  long as possible, they have postponed hearings, and they have even  boycotted committee meetings altogether. Their excuses are ever- changing, and some border on the absurd. ``We don't like the seating  arrangement,'' they say. ``We can't be late to a protest,'' they argue.  There was even some excuse about a YouTube video.    Look, enough is enough. The American people elected a new President  last November. Democrats don't have to like that decision, but they do  have a responsibility to our country. The American people want us to  bring the Nation together and move forward. It is far past time to put  the election behind us and put this President's Cabinet into place,  just as previous Senates have done for previous newly elected  Presidents of both parties.   Mr. President, now I wish to say a few words about one nominee whom  we will be voting on tomorrow. The nominee for Education Secretary,  Betsy DeVos, is a well-qualified candidate who has earned the support  of 20 Governors and several education groups from across the Nation. As  Education Secretary, she will be our students' foremost advocate,  working to improve our education system so that every child has a  brighter future.   Importantly, she also understands that our teachers, students,  parents, school boards, and local and State governments are best suited  to make education decisions--not Washington bureaucrats. I have every  confidence that Mrs. DeVos will lead the Department of Education in  such a way that will put our students' interests first, while also  strengthening the educational opportunities available to all of  America's children.   I urge colleagues to join in confirming Betsy Devos so that she can  begin the very important work before her without further delay.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms  to request the attendance of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Mr. President, I have one request for a committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                             Committee on Finance         The Committee on Finance is authorized to meet during the       session of the Senate on Monday, February 6, 2017, in S-216,       the President's Room of the U.S. Capitol, during a vote on       the Senate floor, currently expected to occur circa 6 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``Now is the time to put country before  party.'' That was an observation by the Democratic leader just  yesterday on the Senate floor. Our friend from New York makes a good  point, and I am hopeful it is a principle his own caucus will follow in  the days to come.   We are no longer in the midst of a contentious Presidential election.  We have a new President, and that President has now put forth an  exceptional Supreme Court nominee and a number of well-qualified  Cabinet nominees. Yet, more than 2 weeks into his term, President Trump  has the fewest Cabinet Secretaries confirmed at this point than any  other President since George Washington.   The President deserves to have his Cabinet in place. The American  people deserve that as well. I would remind our Democratic colleagues  of the things they themselves have said when the shoe was on the other  foot.   Here is what their last Vice Presidential candidate, our colleague  from Virginia, had to say: ``I think we owe deference to a President  for choices to executive positions.'' So yes, ``Now is the time,'' as  the Democratic leader said, ``to put country before party.''   One way to do so is by ending the unprecedented delay we have seen by  Democrats on the President's Cabinet appointments. Our colleagues will  have an opportunity to chart a different path later this afternoon and  the rest of the week as we vote to confirm more nominees.   This afternoon we will vote on the President's nominee for Secretary  of Education, Betsy DeVos. I look forward to confirming her to this  important position so that she can get to work on behalf of America's  students and schools.   As I said yesterday, this well-qualified candidate has earned the  support of several education groups and nearly two dozen Governors from  across the Nation. She understands that teachers, students, parents,  school boards, and State and local governments, not Washington  bureaucrats, are best suited to make education decisions for our kids.  And I know she is committed to improving our education system so that  every child--every child--has a brighter future.   After we confirm Mrs. DeVos, the Senate will turn to another well- qualified Cabinet nominee, our own colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions of  Alabama. We all know Senator Sessions, and we know him to be a man of  his word. We know he is a man who believes in the rule of law. We know  him as someone who is willing to work with anyone, regardless of party,  as he did when he teamed up on legislation with Democratic colleagues  such as Senator Durbin and our late colleague, Ted Kennedy.   I would remind Democratic colleagues that Republicans did not  filibuster when a newly elected President Obama put forward his own  Attorney General nominee, Eric Holder. In fact, the nominee who will  soon be before us, Senator Sessions, crossed the aisle to vote for Eric  Holder; this, despite the fact that the Holder nomination in the  Republican conference here in the Senate was one steeped in  considerable controversy.  [[Page S810]]    What a contrast with the way the Democrats are now treating our  colleague's own nomination now. They are looking to waste even more  time for its own sake today. It has been unfortunate to hear the  attacks that some on the far left have directed at our friend over the  past few weeks, but I am pleased the American people have had the  opportunity to learn the truth about Senator Sessions and to see for  themselves how qualified he is to lead the Justice Department.   We can expect that Senator Sessions in his new role will continue  fighting to protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans as he also  defends the safety and security of our Nation.   Tomorrow I will have more to say about Senator Sessions and the  impact that he has had on each of us here in the Senate, but for now, I  would encourage colleagues to finally come together and show him and  each of the remaining nominees the fair consideration they deserve.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  confirmation.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the motion to reconsider.    I move to table the motion to reconsider.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the motion to  table.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, the Senator has impugned the motives  and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the Chair.   Senator Warren said Senator Sessions ``has used the awesome power of  his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by Black citizens.''   I call the Senator to order under the provisions of rule XIX.    I object.    Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms  to request the attendance of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Here is what transpired. Senator Warren was giving a  lengthy speech. She had appeared to violate the rule. She was warned.  She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Hawaii, I  have a very short statement, if I could do that.    Mr. President, we came together yesterday to confirm  Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education so she could get to work  improving our schools and putting students first.   We will come together to confirm Tom Price as Secretary of Health and  Human Services so he can get to work helping to provide relief from  ObamaCare and stabilizing the health care markets.   We will come together to confirm Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the  Treasury, too, so he can get to work continuing the President's efforts  to relieve the regulatory pressure on America's economy and American  job creation.   We will also come together later today to confirm a new Attorney  General. We all know our colleague from Alabama. He is honest. He is  fair. He has been a friend to many of us on both sides of the aisle. It  has been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in  recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague, with a deep reverence  for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to  everyone.   In his home State, he has fought against the forces of hate. In the  Senate, he developed a record of advocacy for crime victims but also  for the fair and humane treatment of those who break our laws, both  when they are sentenced and when they are incarcerated.   Jeff Sessions has worked across the aisle on important initiatives.  He is, in the words of former Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate  Joe Lieberman, ``an honorable and trustworthy person, a smart and good  lawyer, and a thoughtful and open-minded listener,'' someone who ``will  be a principled, fair and capable Attorney General.''   Our colleague wants to be Attorney General for all Americans. Later  today, we will vote to give him that chance, and I will have more to  say about our friend and colleague at that time.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I just wanted to congratulate the  Senator from South Carolina for a very, very meaningful and effective  presentation on behalf of our colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions.    Mr. President, I ask to proceed on leader time.    Mr. President, I would like to say a word about the  nominee we are about to confirm. We have long known our colleague from  Alabama as Senator Sessions--and soon Attorney General Sessions--but it  wasn't always this way. There was a time when the distinguished Senator  from Alabama was known simply as ``Buddy.'' Buddy--the product of a  small town called Hybart, the son of a country store owner, the  inheritor of modest beginnings.   Senator Sessions' parents grew up in the Depression. They taught  their son the value of a dollar and the importance of hard work. If our  colleague wasn't at school or football practice, you were likely to  find him at his dad's store lending a hand to customers. As anyone from  a small town can attest, that little store served as far more than just  a place to buy goods. It was also a local gathering place, a place  where people were liable to share their hopes and concerns, and their  dreams too.   This is where Jeff Sessions developed his core values. It is where he  developed an appreciation for the everyday struggles of working people.  It is where he learned the importance of listening first, of standing  up for what matters, of putting others' needs before one's own. It made  him a better person. It made him a pretty good politician too.   Senator Sessions is the kind of guy who, with just one conversation,  can make you feel as if you have known him your entire life. He is  usually the first to arrive at constituent events and the last to  leave. He has also made it a priority to travel annually to every  county in Alabama--all 67 of them.   His staff will tell you it is these trips home when Senator Sessions  is really in his element. Driving across Alabama, from sunup to  sundown, milkshake in hand, or maybe a Blizzard from Dairy Queen, Heath  bar flavor, thank you very much, that is Senator Sessions.   Now, it is not hard to see why Alabamians keep sending him back to  Washington. Last time out he scooped up a modest 97 percent of the  vote.   Part of Senator Sessions' secret to success is simple enough; he is  just a likable guy.   Our colleague is one of the most humble and most considerate people  you will ever meet. He is a true Southern gentleman. He is pretty funny  too. His staff would certainly agree. They still remember the time he  accidentally ran his suit coat through the paper shredder. They saved  the evidence too. Let's hope that one makes it into his archives.   Sessions' alums call this man a mentor. They remain ever grateful for  his focus on their own development. I know they are going to miss  grabbing a burger and fries with him at Johnny Rockets.   They are really going to miss his wife Mary as well. We will around  here too.   Now, in Sessions' world, Mary Sessions is something of a legend. She  has been our colleague's strongest supporter, no matter the task before  him. She has been a source of encouragement and a friend to all of Team  Sessions. I doubt they will ever forget Mary's friendship or her famous  cream cheese pound cake.   One thing they will not soon forget either is Senator Sessions'  intense focus on the office's letter-writing operation. Sometimes that  meant working weekends with the boss to get the constituent  correspondence just right.   There is no doubt Senator Sessions is very, very particular about his  writing, whether it is constituent letters or legal memoranda, and  there is a good reason for that. Words, as this lawyer is known to say,  have meaning. It is a philosophy that has animated Senator Sessions'  longtime love affair with the law.   He believes in equal application of the law to each of us, regardless  of how we look or where we come from. It is a genuine passion for him.  It is an area of deep importance and principle.   Senator Sessions will stand up for what he believes is right, even  when it isn't always the easiest thing to do.   Now, this is a guy who fought for Republican principles long before-- long before--Alabama became a red State. He stood up to the George  Wallace dynasty as a young man. He stared down the forces of hate as  U.S. attorney and State attorney general. He has continued to fight for  the equal application of the law as well, not to mention a growing  economy, a streamlined government, and a strong defense.   Of course, as anyone who knows him will tell you, Senator Sessions is  a lawyer's lawyer. He is willing to hear the other side of an argument.  He is willing to make the other side of the argument as well. He is  also willing to be persuaded.   He has worked across the aisle with Democrats like the late Senator  Ted Kennedy and the assistant Democratic leader on issues like prison  reform and sentencing reform. Democrats have praised him as someone who  is ``straightforward and fair'' and ``wonderful to work with.''   The politics of the moment may have changed, but the truth of  statements like these endures. Deep down, each of us knows these things  remain just as true about Senator Sessions today as they did when our  Democratic colleagues praised him.   Fair in action, bound to the Constitution, a defender of civil  rights, this is the man we have come to know in the Senate. It is the  same man we can expect to see as Attorney General.   Senator Sessions may be leaving the Senate, but there is plenty this  Eagle Scout will be taking with him. That includes the motto he has  lived by--``Be Prepared''--which is so engrained in our friend that it  is even engraved into the back of the granite nameplate on his desk. It  is a simple phrase with a simple message, and it seems particularly  fitting for our friend today.   He has a big job ahead of him. I think he is up to the task. He is  tough, but he  [[Page S963]]  is fair. He is persistent, but he is respectful. He is a likeable guy,  a principled colleague, and an honest partner. And while we are really  going to miss him, we also couldn't be prouder of him.   So let us thank Senator Sessions for his many years of service.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination.    I move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.
