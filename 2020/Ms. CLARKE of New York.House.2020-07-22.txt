 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a great  man, Representative John Lewis.   This past Friday, July 17, our country lost one of its greatest  heroes, a true patriot, who literally put his life on the line in the  pursuit of justice and fairness in our society.   The Honorable John Lewis was a penultimate hero who embodied the  struggle for human rights and dignity. He was a fierce civil rights  warrior, who refused to abide by the Jim Crow laws of the South. He  embodied what it means to be a public servant, putting his life on the  line and the people above his own self-interests.   I am so honored and privileged to have served with John Robert  Lewis--John Robert Lewis, who was a dancer, a man who loved to have fun  but was convicted for the right to vote, convicted as an activist for  civil rights and civil liberties.  [[Page H3674]]    And I will forever hold dear the moment that we landed in Ghana  together, invited by the President of Ghana for the Year of Return, and  to see the wonderment in his eyes of visiting a space where it all  began for all of us 401 years ago.   May he rest in peace and rise in power. The Honorable John Lewis will  never be forgotten. We all hold onto his legacy.
