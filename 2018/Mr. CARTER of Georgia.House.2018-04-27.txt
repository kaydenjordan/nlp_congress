 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Chatham-Savannah Counter Narcotics Team, also known as CNT.   In 2017, CNT and the DEA identified a drug distribution group  operating throughout Chatham County, and learned that a large drug  transaction was to take place. With this knowledge, CNT conducted drug  operations at various hotels, covering several local jurisdictions.   On March 25, 2018, CNT seized 25 kilograms, or 55 pounds of cocaine,  and made six arrests, which is the largest single cocaine seizure in  CNT's history. The confiscated cocaine had an estimated street value of  $4 million.   Cocaine is a highly addictive and mind-altering drug that poisons  communities and tears families apart. I applaud CNT's groundbreaking  work, which makes the entire Savannah community a better place to live.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Patricia ``Trish''  DePriest, who will be retiring this week as a casework manager after 34  years of working for the First Congressional District of Georgia.   Ms. DePriest has been referred to as the dame of Savannah's political  scene but is, frankly, so much more than that. She has worked for three  consecutive Members of Congress from Georgia's First Congressional  District. She started working in 1983 for Congressman Lindsey Thomas.  After that, she worked for Congressman Jack Kingston. Now she works for  me.   One of the first questions that I got when I was elected to this  office came from a lot of constituents who said, ``Are you going to  keep Trish?'' And I  [[Page H3738]]  would just think to myself, ``A better question is: Is Trish going to  keep me?''   Well, fortunately, she did, and I am glad she did. Throughout the  First Congressional District of Georgia, if you say Trish's name,  nearly everyone you speak to will have either a story about how she  helped them or at least know someone whom she had helped.   She has pushed passport applications. She is a passport expert. No  one knows the passport system better than Trish DePriest, I assure you.  She has passed through passport applications with lightning speed.   She has pulled veterans benefits out of the most unlikely situations  and cleared up entanglements in Social Security checks in order to get  constituents back on their feet, and oftentimes at a low point in their  lives.   Constituents who come to Ms. DePriest often have nowhere else to  turn, yet she is the secret weapon that always seems to come through in  the most desperate situations.   One of her most famous cases includes helping a man who, quite  literally, woke up next to a dumpster in Richmond Hill, Georgia, with  no memory at all of any friends, of any family, or of his past life.  Trish was tasked with helping build it back again from ground zero. To  give you a sense of her blunt personality, she told the Savannah  Morning News: ``It's like he appeared here from another planet.''   After 34 years of working for Congress, she has developed personal  relationships with all the relevant staff members at each government  agency, allowing her to perform her mighty tasks for constituents that  other caseworkers may take years to develop.   She has learned throughout her years to always ask constituents for  the other side of the story, which she has become famous for drawing  out, while using this to her advantage in performing casework. A  countless number of constituents whom she has helped out over the years  come in and out of the Savannah office each day just to chat with  Trish, update her on their lives, and become her friend.   Her bluntness and wit, her intelligence and sense of caring not only  keep constituents coming back for her friendship, but keep her own work  colleagues with a high level of morale.   But Ms. DePriest, Trish, is more than just an excellent caseworker  and staple of government in the First Congressional District of  Georgia. Trish was a loving spouse of 50 years to her husband, Joseph  Roy DePriest, Jr., who passed away in 2012. She is a caring mother to  Lisanne and Jamey.   She is also a breast cancer survivor, a testament to her strong will.  In fitting fashion, when Trish was told of her diagnosis of breast  cancer, she says she was more mad than scared and decided to jump in  feet first and attack the problem--and that she did.   There will never be another Trish DePriest for the First  Congressional District of Georgia, but I know she will be around,  helping other people wherever she can, and I hope everyone learns from  her abundance of knowledge and her outlook on life.   Trish, we are going to miss you in the office. We are going to miss  you a lot. We want you to have a happy and a well-deserved retirement.  Thank you for your service to the people of the First Congressional  District of Georgia.   God bless you, Trish.                            ____________________
