 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Protecting Seniors' Access to  Medicare Act, sponsored by my colleague and fellow physician,  Representative Roe.   ObamaCare's establishment of the Independent Payment Advisory Board,  or IPAB, is perhaps the most insidious part of the Affordable Care Act.   With IPAB, 15 unelected bureaucrats would be in power to make health  coverage decisions for 55 million Americans who are Medicare  beneficiaries. Care would be rationed, physicians like myself would be  unable to pursue the course of treatment we think is appropriate for  our patients, seniors would lose access to the best care, all without  any input from Congress or any accountability to voters.   With all of the divisiveness that we see in Washington, the IPAB  repeal bill we consider today is genuinely bipartisan. Mr. Speaker, I  urge my colleagues to give an overwhelming bipartisan vote and show the  country we are serious about keeping our promises to our seniors.
