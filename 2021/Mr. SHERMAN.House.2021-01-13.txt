 Madam Speaker, how ironic. An administration begins by  building an unnecessary wall on our southern border, it ends by making  necessary, a new wall around this Capitol.   Madam Speaker, I introduced Articles of Impeachment in July of 2017  with one cosponsor, Al Green, and again in January of 2019. And on  Monday night, I joined with so many of us in introducing these  articles. I have introduced Articles of Impeachment in the 115th,  116th, and 117th Congress because Donald Trump has continuously posed a  danger to this republic.
