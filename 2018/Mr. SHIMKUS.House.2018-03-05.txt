 Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by yielding to the  chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Mr. Walden.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman, the gentleman from  Oregon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Fleischmann), who has actually been a pretty big leader in this  issue because of Oak Ridge and the area that he represents.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his  comments, and I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota and  appreciate him spending this evening with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the next speaker, I want to highlight  that, in the days when people say we don't work together, there is no  bipartisanship shown, I just want to remind folks that this bill came  out of our committee 49-4. It has 108 cosponsors, many Democrats on  there.   So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Carbajal), a new Member of Congress who has been very active and  whom I have been proud to get to know.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague.   So we have heard from Oregon, Tennessee, Minnesota, and then from  California. Now I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments. I  now yield to the gentleman from the State of California (Mr. McNerney),  a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, a good friend, also.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his  comments, and I will pull up a chart later on to show that the five  surrounding counties have all passed resolutions in support of Yucca  Mountain, and there are recent numbers from the northern part of the  State that show a very positive movement as far as the acceptance, as  long as we show there is a science. And now I will address that in a  later discourse.   I want to thank my colleague for joining us. I now yield to the  gentleman from the State of Georgia (Mr. Carter), another member from  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his  comments, and now I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney) for his strong work, his positive statements, and his  reaching out so that we could have a national solution to a national  problem.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. I am  glad he brought up the debate and the discussion on the nuclear Navy,  because that is really a key part of this debate.   The nuclear-use fuel for our nuclear fleet is, by law, directed to be  housed at Yucca Mountain.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Duncan), a colleague, a new member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, but no stranger to this issue and this debate.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    I do that, Mr. Speaker, because we have had Members from  Oregon--I am from Illinois--Tennessee, Minnesota, California, Georgia,  South Carolina, Texas, Connecticut come down. Many, many Members from  all over this country also wanted to join me here tonight, but they  could not, so they will be submitting statements for the Record. I  appreciate the Chair allowing us to us do that.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight a few things and just follow up  on some of my colleagues, who I really appreciate coming down and  spending their time to talk about the importance of this issue.   This issue has national support, I think identified by the 49-4 vote  out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. People are very diverse, from  all over the country, on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I would  encourage people to go to the Energy and Commerce Committee website and  look at the members of that committee and how wide and how diverse we  are. We are all united on this issue.   The national newsmakers and the recorders of what is going on are  starting to take interest in solving this problem. We have a couple  editorials and statements from some major papers and some smaller ones.   Here is The Washington Post: ``Put Yucca Mountain to work. The Nation  needs it.''   As was stated, the law was passed in 1982 and it was amended in 1987.  Congressman Duncan said it right. This is the law of the land. For the  last 8 to 10 years, we have been breaking the law by not moving  forward. People have heard me say that numerous times before.   Here is The San Diego Union-Tribune: ``Revival of Yucca Mountain  nuclear waste project overdue.''   Well, it is 20 years. We should have been receiving spent nuclear  fuel and defense waste 20 years ago. Now we are paying judgments  because of our inability to comply with the law.   Wouldn't you like the government to do what it says it wants to do  and then is planning to do it? And then shouldn't they do it?   Here is Aiken Standard: ``Fed should proceed with Yucca Mountain.''   Here is the Reason: ``Open the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste  repository.''   Here is the Los Angeles Times and their statement on this issue:  ``The Federal Government needs to renew its efforts to bring the Yucca  Mountain site into operation.''   There is a lot of support in California because they are closing  nuclear power plants and they have spent nuclear fuel on the beach, as  Congressman Carbajal has said. He is talking about San Luis Obispo.   I think I will show a chart later on that shows San Onofre Nuclear  Generating Station, or SONGS, which is being decommissioned.   Here is the Chicago Tribune, from my State: ``Yucca Mountain is the  only viable alternative to the jury-rigged status quo. We hope the  Trump administration and Congress will revive it because if they  don't''--well, you can read it, right?  [[Page H1362]]    So let me give you an example. It was mentioned by one of my  colleagues, and I will talk about Illinois for a little bit. Zion  Nuclear Power Station is decommissioned. On the shore of Lake Michigan  is spent nuclear fuel.   Part of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 2017 does a couple  things. It makes sure the authorization language is in place so that we  start moving forward on a final repository.   We have listened to my colleagues from around the country to say it  is not going to move fast enough, even if you start it.   Can't we find some regional temporary locations.   Now, in the nuclear timeframe, ``temporary'' is about 40 years. That  is temporary when you are talking about nuclear stuff. So we want to be  able to consolidate.   What this shows is licensed and operating nuclear spent fuel storage  installations. These are just locations where you have nuclear power.  And you can see the red dots all over the place, and other nuclear  registered locations.   I am not talking about the other issue, which is defense locations.  That is why I am glad my colleague Joe Courtney came down to talk about  Connecticut and the nuclear Navy.   A colleague that really wanted to be down here was  Dan Newhouse, who  represents Hanford. Hanford is the epitome story of why we need to get  our act together as a nation and fulfill our obligations to clean up  these sites.   This is a defense site. We created waste in the production of our  nuclear arsenal. Decades, stored in tanks, toxic sludge underneath the  ground that needs to be glassified, as Chairman Walden mentioned. And  where that glassified toxic sludge is supposed to go is underneath the  mountain in a desert in Yucca Mountain.   So these are the different locations we have here across the country.  As was stated tonight already, 39 States, 121 locations. Thirty-nine  States, 121 locations.   So let me give you a few examples of what we are talking about.   My colleague Jason Lewis was down here earlier, and he mentioned  Prairie Island. These are old charts, but they are oldies but goodies  because we haven't done anything. I can go into the dustbin of history  when I talk about this on the floor, and the only thing that has  changed is there is more spent nuclear fuel on these sites.   So you have Prairie Island. You have waste stored aboveground in  pools and in casts. You have, in the Mississippi floodplain, on the  Mississippi River, 50 miles from Minneapolis-St. Paul versus Yucca  Mountain.   Now, what do we have at Yucca Mountain?   Now, Yucca Mountain is where, by law, we are supposed to be receiving  long-term repository.   I refer people, there is no nuclear waste on site. Here is the  mountain in a desert. The waste will be stored 1,000 feet underground  and 1,000 feet above the water table.                                time  2015    The Colorado River is the closest body of water 100 miles away. So  that is the example. That is what we want to show to the American  people.   Would you rather have nuclear waste or defense waste next to your  major cities and by major bodies of water, or would you rather have  them in a desert underneath a mountain?   I had a few Californians down here tonight. Why? Because they are  decommissioning nuclear power plants. This is the one I visited just  maybe 14 months ago. It is no longer an operating nuclear power  station. They are decommissioning it. The waste will be stored onsite.  It is the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. It is between L.A. and  San Diego right on the Pacific Ocean. At this time, there are 2,300  waste rods onsite. That has probably increased by a number I don't  know. Waste is stored aboveground. It is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean,  and it is located 45 miles from San Diego, versus Yucca Mountain which  is located here, which is a mountain in a desert. The waste would be  1,000 feet underground, and that is 1,000 feet above the water table.   So I have listened to my colleagues from Nevada. In fact, in this  picture, this green area, these are all the counties around the Federal  land site that have passed resolutions in support of moving forward.   Now, what do the Nevadans tell me? They want to make sure it is safe.  How do you make it safe? You decide to adjudicate the science. We give  Nevada, as per law, their last chance to question the science. That is  what we are trying to do in the appropriation process is get the money  to do the final adjudication so that the question can be answered. To  my friends from the State of Nevada: Is a mountain in a desert a safe  place to store the defense waste and spent fuel?   Now, the red part is Federal land. Yucca Mountain would be about  right here, a little pinhole. That yellow there is--when you hear  people say local consensus, the yellow here is a local consensus from  Sweden, and if you notice, it is smaller than the Federal land that we  have. So I would argue the local consensus is the Federal Government  since it is all that property. Now, why do we have all that property?  Because Yucca Flat is there. Because we put nuclear fuel--nuclear  waste, in some short and some shade, is already housed there. So,  again, it is a great location.   I was given a pin tonight from Nye County, and it says, ``Host of  Yucca Mountain.'' So with all due respect to my colleagues from the  State of Nevada, when they say that everyone is against it, they are  not talking to everyone in the State of Nevada. I have been to Las  Vegas, I have been to Reno, and I have been to Pahrump, and there are  people that--if proven safe.   So I would ask the Governor, allow us to have the litigation to fight  the science. That is what he wants to prove, that is what we want to  prove, and that is what we need to appropriate the money, get the final  adjudication, and then I am convinced that our nuclear scientists, the  studies, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that issued a safety and  evaluation report will come out and say: You are not going to find a  safer place on this planet; there is no more of a studied location on  the planet than Yucca Mountain.   So, again, I want to thank my colleagues for coming down to do a  couple things. First of all, we want to highlight to our leadership in  this House and our appropriators that we need to get money into the  final omnibus to do the adjudication to fight for the science, and we  have to do that now--issue one.   Issue two, there is a bipartisan consensus, as proven by the 49-4  vote in the committee and by 108 cosponsors, and when we get the bill  on the floor, a passage of a bill that we probably would project to get  300 votes out of 435.   So the nuclear era started in World War II. It was started to beat  Hitler to make sure they didn't win World War II. Then we had the arms  race with the Soviet Union. It has helped protect our freedom and  liberty. There was a price to pay, environmental degradations across  this country. We owe it to these communities and to ourselves to safely  gather, store, and protect the environment and protect our citizens. We  do that through the appropriation process. We do it by passing the  Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 2007.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my friends from both sides of the  aisle for coming down this night.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
