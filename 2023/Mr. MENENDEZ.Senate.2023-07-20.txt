The estimated total cost is $2.90 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally       that is an important force for political and economic       stability in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Germany's capability to meet       current and future threats by ensuring they have modern,       capable air-to-air munitions. This sale will further advance       the already high level of German Air Force interoperability       with U.S. joint forces and other regional and NATO forces.       Germany already has AMRAAMs in its inventory and will have no       difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missiles and       Defense, Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Federal Republic of Germany.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMRAAM) is a supersonic, air launched, aerial intercept,       guided missile featuring digital technology and micro-      miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high-and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. This potential sale will include Captive Air       Training  [[Page S3453]]       Missiles (CATM) as well as guidance section, control section,       and telemetry system spares and containers.        2. The KGV-135A is a high-speed, general purpose encryptor/      decryptor module used for wide-band data encryption.        3.

Transmittal No. 0K-23       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Singapore.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 13-03; Date:       April 3, 2013; Military Department: Air Force.        Funding Source: National Funds.        (iii) Description: On April 3, 2013, Congress was notified       by congressional certification transmittal number 13-03 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of 100 AIM-120C7 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-      Air Missiles (AMRAAM), AMRAAM Programmable Advanced System       Interface Simulator (PASIS), 10 AMRAAM Spare Guidance       Sections, 18 AN/AVS-9(V) Night Vision Goggles, H-764G with       GEM V Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM),       Common Munitions Built-in-Test Reprogramming Equipment       (CMBRE-Plus) in support of a Direct Commercial Sale of new F-      15SG aircraft. Also included were: containers, spare and       repair parts, support equipment, tools and test equipment,       publications and technical documentation, personnel training       and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, logistics, and technical support services, and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated cost was $210 million. Major Defense Equipment       (MDE) constituted $165 million of this total.        On September 18, 2013, Congress was notified by       congressional certification transmittal number 0J-13 of the       possible sale, under Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of 17 Link-16 Multifunction Information       Distribution System Low Volume Terminals (MIDS-LVT) for       aircraft, ground units, and spares in order to satisfy       operational requirements. Additionally, this transmittal       reported the inclusion of 26 H-764G with GEM V Selective       Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), as Major Defense       Equipment as required by the updated Military Articles and       Services List. Although the value of the H-764G was included       in the total value of the case, it was not enumerated or       valued as MDE in the original notification. The net increase       in cost of MDE for the upgrade was $9 million, and the total       case value remained at $210 million.        This transmittal reports the addition of the following MDE       items: twenty-six (26) Multifunctional Information       Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio Systems (MIDS JTRS).       The following non-MDE items will also be included: Ground       Support Systems (GSS) for Link 16; AN/ARC-210 radios; Joint       Mission Planning Systems (JMPS); Simple Key Loaders; and       classified software delivery and support. The total cost of       the new MDE items is $7 million, but will not require an       increase in the estimated total MDE value. The total cost of       the new non-MDE items and services is $34 million, but will       only require an $11 million increase in the estimated total       non-MDE value. The total estimated case value will increase       from $210 million to $221 million with MDE remaining at $174       million of this total.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the additional MDE items were not enumerated in the original       notification. The inclusion of this MDE represents an       increase in capability over what was previously notified. The       proposed sale will improve the Republic of Singapore Air       Force's (RSAF) air-to-air capability and ability to defend       its nation and cooperate with allied air forces,        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by improving the security of a strategic partner that       is an important force for political stability and economic       progress in Asia.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Multifunctional       Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System       (MIDS JTRS) provides an advanced Link-16 command, control,       communications, and intelligence (C3I) system incorporating       high-capacity and jam-resistant digital communications links       for exchange of near real-time tactical information,       including both data and voice, among air, ground, and sea       elements. MIDS JTRS is a multi-channel, software-defined       variant of the MIDS-Low Volume Terminal (LVT).        AN/ARC-210 radios provide voice communications radio       systems equipped with HAVE QUICK II and Second Generation       Antijam Tactical Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio for NATO       (SATURN), which employ cryptographic technology. Other       waveforms may be included as needed.        The Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) provides a multi-      platform, PC-based mission planning system. Its modular suite       of systems are tailored to user needs, allowing operators of       various aircraft to install planning modules required for       flight planning, weapons delivery planning, post-flight       debrief, and operational integration.        The AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader provides a handheld device       used for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data       between compatible cryptographic and communications       equipment.        The Sensitivity of Technology Statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items reported       here.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.
