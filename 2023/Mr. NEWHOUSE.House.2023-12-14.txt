 Mr. Speaker, this holiday season, many parents in  Washington's Fourth Congressional District and across the Nation will  struggle to afford a special holiday meal for their family or buy  presents for their children.   The hard truth is that under the President's self-proclaimed  Bidenomics agenda, we have seen trillions spent, causing inflation to  skyrocket to a 40-year high.   Americans today are still struggling to afford everyday expenses  because families are spending over $11,000 more this year than last to  purchase the same basic goods.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress, we have been working to rein in the out- of-control spending that this administration promotes and pursues. Over  the summer, House Republicans successfully passed the Fiscal  Responsibility Act to restore sanity, limit inflationary spending, and  lift Americans out of poverty, but there is more work to be done.   As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am proud of our  efforts in mitigating the damage done by Big Government spending and  reintroducing a commonsense, conservative approach to the way we use  taxpayer dollars. We must continue to foster an economy that works for  the American people rather than against them.   On that note, I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year.                            ____________________
