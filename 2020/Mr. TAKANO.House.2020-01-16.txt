 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  [[Page H309]]    Under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department of Education has  abandoned its responsibility to put students first and hold predatory,  for-profit colleges accountable. The Department has rolled back  protections for students seeking a foothold in the middle class through  higher education.   In what amounts to a giveaway to predatory, for-profit colleges,  Secretary DeVos has dismantled a crucial protection for students who  were defrauded by shady institutions that saddled them with student  loan debt, provided them with subpar education, and issued them useless  degrees.   Borrower defense to repayment was intended to provide full student  loan debt forgiveness to defrauded students. But Secretary DeVos has  issued a new rule which makes it harder for students to prove that they  were defrauded and fails to provide students with the full student loan  debt relief that they are legally entitled to.   Now, to make this even worse, she eliminated protections for students  whose schools shut down, shut down before they completed their  programs, leaving them burdened with loans and often without the  ability to transfer their credits elsewhere.   240,000 students--nearly 42,000 students from California--are waiting  for relief, suffering emotional and financial hardships in the process.  Many of these students attended the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, an  institution that even my Republican colleagues have agreed was in the  business of defrauding students.   These students did everything right, but they were deceived by a slew  of false promises from for-profit institutions that only saw them as a  boost to their bottom line.   Secretary DeVos is using the power of her office to defend a shady  industry. Today, we are here to send a clear message: We Democrats  stand with America's students who should be relieved of student debt  unjustly accrued.
