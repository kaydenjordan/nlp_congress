 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National  Mentoring Month and in honor of the youth mentors across Rhode Island  and the Nation.   Every day, mentors enrich the lives of young people. They are  powerful role models who provide essential support for at-risk youth.   Just some of examples of the powerful impact that mentors have in the  life of young people are that vulnerable young people with mentors are  more likely to enroll in college and volunteer more regularly than  their peers. They are 46 percent less likely to start using drugs and  52 percent less likely to skip school.   They are also more likely to develop self-confidence, form healthy  relationships, and cultivate productive habits.   Organizations like the Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership and Big  Brothers Big Sisters lead the way in the Ocean State. Organizations  like this and mentors across the country are improving our communities  one child at a time, and I am proud to honor them as we recognize  National Mentoring Month this January 2017. I encourage more people to  step forward and serve as mentors and make a difference in the lives of  young people.                            ____________________
