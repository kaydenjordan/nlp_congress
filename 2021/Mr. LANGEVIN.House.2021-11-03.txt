 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support  of President Biden's Build Back Better agenda.   Last November, the American people sent us to Washington to create  more jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for middle class families, and we  are ready to deliver.   The Build Back Better agenda will lower healthcare costs for families  across my district and across the country, cut taxes for more than 35  million working families, and expand high-quality home healthcare for  millions of older Americans and Americans with disabilities.   As the President also returns from the U.N. Climate Change Conference  in Glasgow, we have an opportunity to pass a $550 billion investment in  fighting climate change and transitioning to a green economy.   We simply do not have time to spare. The American people are counting  on us. Let's get this done.                            ____________________
