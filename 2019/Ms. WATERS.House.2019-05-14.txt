 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2578) to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2578         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance       Program Extension Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.         (a) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by       striking ``May 31, 2019'' and inserting ``September 30,       2019''.        (b) Program Expiration.--Section 1319 of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking       ``May 31, 2019'' and inserting ``September 30, 2019''.        (c) Retroactive Effective Date.--If this Act is enacted       after May 31, 2019, the amendments made by subsections (a)       and (b) shall take effect as if enacted on May 31, 2019.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this  legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2578, the National  Flood Insurance Program Extension Act of 2019.   Since the National Flood Insurance Programs' multiyear authorization  expired on September 30, 2017, ideological differences have led  Congress to pass 10 short-term extensions and even allowed the program  to briefly lapse twice during government shutdowns.   Unfortunately, the National Flood Insurance Program is currently set  to expire May 31. My bill, which I have coauthored with Ranking Member  McHenry, would extend the program to September 30 because we recognize  that the NFIP is critical to ensuring access to flood insurance  coverage across this country. This extension will afford the ranking  member and me time to complete our work on a long-term, bipartisan  compromise.   Mr. Speaker, the NFIP is much more than just an insurance program.  The NFIP plays an important role in disaster preparedness and  resiliency by providing flood maps, setting standards for floodplain  management, and investing in mitigation for our homes, businesses, and  infrastructure.                                time  1700    According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, everyone is at  risk of flooding. That means that this is not just a coastal issue. We  all have an interest in ensuring a strong National Flood Insurance  Program. We need a long-term reauthorization to provide certainty to  homeowners and businesses, and we also need critical reforms to the  program.   First and foremost, we must do more to address unaffordable premium  costs for low-income households; address the program's debt, which is  unfairly burdening policyholders with millions of dollars in interest;  and lower costs and fees on policyholders.   Secondly, we need to invest more heavily in mapping, floodplain  management, and mitigation, which will save taxpayer dollars in the  long run by helping to reduce the damage that occurs when floods hit.   Finally, Superstorm Sandy exposed numerous issues related to claims  processing, including findings of outright fraud. Going forward, we  must work to ensure that we have safeguards in place and mechanisms for  greater accountability and oversight to ensure that claims are handled  fairly and efficiently to provide relief for policyholders.  [[Page H3764]]    Mr. Speaker, passing H.R. 2578 is not just a stopgap measure to kick  the can down the road. I have every confidence that, with this  extension, Democrats and Republicans will finally break the cycle of  haphazard extensions. I intend to work in a bipartisan manner with Mr.  McHenry to provide a long-term reauthorization to restore stability and  confidence in the market. Through a thoughtful, bipartisan process,  Congress can provide real relief to families, communities, and  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the millions of families across  the country who rely on the National Flood Insurance Program by  offering H.R. 2578 here today.   My bill will provide continuity for the NFIP without which these  families would be left unprotected in the face of increasing flood  risk. What is more, without the NFIP, the stability of the housing  market would be put at risk.   My coauthor, Mr. McHenry, and I offer this bill today not as a  permanent solution, but as a step towards a broader plan that will  reauthorize the program for the long term and make reforms to ensure  continued availability, affordability, and fairness in flood insurance.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased for the coming together of Mr. McHenry  and myself to present a bipartisan bill on behalf of all of our  citizens. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2578, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 389) to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to pay  rewards under an asset recovery rewards program to help identify and  recover stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption and the  proceeds of such corruption hidden behind complex financial structures  in the United States and abroad, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 389         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         The Act may be cited as the ``Kleptocracy Asset Recovery       Rewards Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR), a World       Bank and United Nations anti-money-laundering effort,       estimates that between $20 billion to $40 billion has been       lost to developing countries annually through corruption.        (2) In 2014, more than $480 million in corruption proceeds       hidden in bank accounts around the world by former Nigerian       dictator Sani Abacha and his co-conspirators was forfeited       through efforts by the Department of Justice.        (3) In 2010, the Department of Justice established the       Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, to work in partnership       with Federal law enforcement agencies to forfeit the proceeds       of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, return       those proceeds to benefit the people harmed by these acts of       corruption and abuse of office.        (4) Of the $20 billion to $40 billion lost by developing       countries annually through corruption, only about $5 billion       has been repatriated in the last 15 years.        (5) Governments weakened by corruption and loss of assets       due to corruption have  [[Page H3765]]       fewer resources to devote to the fight against terrorism and       fewer resources to devote to building strong financial, law       enforcement, and judicial institutions to aid in the fight       against the financing of terrorism.        (6) The United States has a number of effective programs to       reward individuals who provide valuable information that       assist in the identification, arrest, and conviction of       criminal actors and their associates, as well as seizure and       forfeiture of illicitly derived assets and the proceeds of       criminal activity.        (7) The Internal Revenue Service has the Whistleblower       Program, which pays awards to individuals who provide       specific and credible information to the IRS if the       information results in the collection of taxes, penalties,       interest or other amounts from noncompliant taxpayers.        (8) The Department of State administers rewards programs on       international terrorism, illegal narcotics, and transnational       organized crime with the goal of bringing perpetrators to       justice.        (9) None of these existing rewards programs specifically       provide monetary incentives for identifying and recovering       stolen assets linked solely to foreign government corruption,       as opposed to criminal prosecutions or civil or criminal       forfeitures.        (10) The recovery of stolen assets linked to foreign       government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption may       not always involve a BSA violation or lead to a forfeiture       action. In such cases there would be no ability to pay       rewards under existing Treasury Department authorities.        (11) Foreign government corruption can take many forms but       typically entails government officials stealing,       misappropriating, or illegally diverting assets and funds       from their own government treasuries to enrich their personal       wealth directly through embezzlement or bribes to allow       government resources to be expended in ways that are not       transparent and may not either be necessary or be the result       of open competition. Corruption also includes situations       where public officials take bribes to allow government       resources to be expended in ways which are not transparent       and may not be necessary or the result of open competition.       These corrupt officials often use the United States and       international financial system to hide their stolen assets       and the proceeds of corruption.        (12) The individuals who come forward to expose foreign       governmental corruption and kleptocracy often do so at great       risk to their own safety and that of their immediate family       members and face retaliation from persons who exercise       foreign political or governmental power. Monetary rewards can       provide a necessary incentive to expose such corruption and       provide a financial means to provide for their well-being and       avoid retribution.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a       Department of the Treasury stolen asset recovery rewards       program to help identify and recover stolen assets linked to       foreign government corruption and the proceeds of such       corruption hidden behind complex financial structures is       needed in order to--        (1) intensify the global fight against corruption; and        (2) serve United States efforts to identify and recover       such stolen assets, forfeit proceeds of such corruption, and,       where appropriate and feasible, return the stolen assets or       proceeds thereof to the country harmed by the acts of       corruption.       SEC. 3. IN GENERAL.

(c) Table of Contents Amendment.--The table of contents for       chapter 97 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:  ``9706. Department of the Treasury Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards                Program.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 389, the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Act  offered by Representatives Lynch and Budd, will help the United States  Government identify and recover assets that corrupt foreign government  officials have stolen from their countries. The act does this through a  Treasury-based rewards program that incentivizes individuals to notify  the U.S. Government of the location of stolen assets that are linked to  foreign government corruption. These assets may be bank accounts as  well as luxury items, such as mansions, jewelry, jet planes, and  artwork.   Law enforcement already works hard to find these stolen assets. Since  2010, the United States has fought in courts to freeze, forfeit, and  ultimately recover more than $3.2 billion in assets linked to foreign  corruption to be returned to the victims of these financial crimes.   There are several recent examples of corrupt foreign funds making  their way to the United States. The multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal  involving Goldman Sachs defrauded the people of Malaysia. To date, the  FBI has identified $1.7 billion of the proceeds of that crime, which  went to purchase a yacht, museum-quality paintings, and real estate. In  fact, the government returned $57 million of recovered stolen funds to  Malaysia following a settlement over the rights to the 2013 film, ``The  Wolf of Wall Street,'' which was financed using corrupt 1MDB funds.   Similarly, the United States helped to recover over $30 million from  the sale of real estate, a Ferrari, and rare music memorabilia, which  were purchased by Equatorial Guinea's President Obiang and his son with  corrupt funds.   H.R. 389 would direct the Treasury to pay whistleblowers rewards from  the recovered assets for helping to uncover assets like these.  Encouraging and incentivizing whistlblowers would strip the bad actors  of the ill-gotten gains and help victims and their countries recover  from the devastating effects of corruption.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Lynch and Mr. Budd for  introducing this bill to help the U.S. punish kleptocrats. For these  reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 389.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the sponsor of this  legislation and a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that Mr. Lynch and Mr. Budd have  presented this bipartisan bill to the House. We must not allow the  United States financial system to be a haven for stolen assets that  rightly belong to others.   By incentivizing individuals to come forward with information about  where these stolen assets are hidden, we ensure the financial security  of our system and can help send back recovered assets to where they  belong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1060) to provide regulatory relief to charitable  organizations that provide housing assistance, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1060         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Building Up Independent       Lives and Dreams Act'' or the ``BUILD Act''.       SEC. 2. MORTGAGE LOAN TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1060, the BUILD Act, which is  bipartisan legislation authored by Representatives Loudermilk and  Sherman that will allow nonprofit organizations like Habitat for  Humanity, offering mortgage loans for charitable purposes  [[Page H3768]]  to use alternative forms to satisfy disclosure requirements.   Specifically, this bill would allow bona fide nonprofits which are  eligible for tax-exempt charitable donations to have the option to use  the Truth in Lending, Good Faith Estimate, and HUD-1 forms instead of  TRID forms required by the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule. They  may only do so in limited circumstances where they offer a zero percent  interest loan.   Currently, financial institutions that make five or fewer mortgage  loans a year are allowed to use these alternative disclosure forms,  including the HUD-1 form, instead of the TRID form.   This bill simply extends this flexibility to eligible nonprofit  charities in very limited circumstances, even if they make more than  five mortgage loans a year.   Passing this bipartisan legislation will help nonprofits do their  important work in helping families in our communities build and improve  places to call home.   For example, the vast majority of the more than 1,200 local Habitat  organizations in all 50 States are small, community-based organizations  with very small mortgage portfolios and few, if any, full-time staff  and rely on volunteers for much of their operations.   The BUILD Act will help charities like Habitat help families get a  home of their own, but still ensures the material terms and costs of  mortgage loans are clearly disclosed to the borrower.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Loudermilk and Sherman for their  work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1060, the  BUILD Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and lead cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate my thanks to the members of our  committee, Representatives Loudermilk and Sherman, for working together  to craft a narrow piece of legislation that will help nonprofit  organizations like Habitat for Humanity have flexibility on which  disclosure forms they use when they provide a zero-interest mortgage  loan to a family getting a home of their own.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1060, the BUILD Act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1037) to increase transparency with respect to financial  services benefitting state sponsors of terrorism, human rights abusers,  and corrupt officials, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1037         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. SUNSET.         The reporting requirement under this Act shall terminate on       the date that is the end of the 7-year period beginning on       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Member may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1037, the Banking Transparency  for Sanctioned Persons Act.   This legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to  Congress every 6 months a list of the licenses that it issues to  financial institutions to provide services to countries and persons  subject to certain U.S. sanctions. It also provides Congress with  information about foreign financial firms that similarly provide  [[Page H3770]]  support to those same countries and persons.   I support this bill because I believe its disclosure requirements  will serve as a useful oversight tool for Congress. Today, when the  Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, issues a license to a  company that allows them to engage in an activity that would otherwise  be prohibited by U.S. sanctions, OFAC does not disclose those licenses.   I support the bill's other reporting requirement related to foreign  financial firms. These lists of foreign financial institutions can  provide a useful basis for Congress to review the administration's  overall sanction strategy and to press the administration to impose  restrictions on these institutions to change their behavior.   When a nearly identical version of this bill was considered by the  Financial Services Committee last Congress, I supported the bill's  disclosure requirements, but I thought it would be counterproductive to  have the information revealed publicly.   For example, OFAC licenses often contain commercially sensitive  information. If companies could no longer expect licenses to remain  private, they would be less likely to apply for them, which would be  detrimental to humanitarian efforts.   I didn't think the public identification of these foreign financial  firms would serve a useful policy purpose and could otherwise move  legal activity into a shade of gray. For these reasons, a Democratic  amendment was adopted in committee by voice vote to allow for Congress  to review the lists confidentially.   I believe H.R. 1037, which includes this critical change from last  Congress, would increase congressional oversight of U.S. sanctions  activity appropriately, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1037, the Banking Transparency for Sanctioned  Persons Act of 2019, will help ensure that Members of Congress have the  information they need to provide more effective oversight of the  decisions made by Treasury and OFAC and the impact that those decisions  have on sanctioned persons.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Riggleman for bringing this bill forward,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
