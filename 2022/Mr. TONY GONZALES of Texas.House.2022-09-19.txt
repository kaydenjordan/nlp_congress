 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on the  Blackwell School National Historic Site Act. And I thank my  distinguished colleague from Alabama for allowing me this opportunity.   This bill would designate the Blackwell School in my district as one  of the first national park sites dedicated to Latino history. This  legislation comes at a critical time, as we celebrate the  accomplishments of the Latino community during Hispanic Heritage Month.   From 1909 to 1965, the Blackwell School in Marfa, Texas, was the only  public school for the city's Mexican-American children. Although there  was no State law that mandated separate schools for Hispanic students,  it was common practice for them to be taught at different facilities.  This meant that the Blackwell School was the only place where children  of Mexican descent could be educated and have a shot at the American  Dream.   Today, the Blackwell School reminds us of the resiliency the Mexican- American community has displayed throughout our history.   Designating the Blackwell School as a national park site would  improve the ability of the Park Service to oversee conservation  efforts, promote regional tourism, and share important stories about  the Mexican-American community in the U.S.   Please join me in passing this bill to honor the hard work and  fighting spirit of the Hispanic community.
