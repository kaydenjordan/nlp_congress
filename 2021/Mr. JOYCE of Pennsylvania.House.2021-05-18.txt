 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great  sadness to remember the life of my friend, Dr. Sam Magee, who  unexpectedly passed away this past weekend.   An exemplary surgeon, Dr. Magee dedicated his life to serving his  patients and our Blair County community.   Sam, as the son of an Altoona surgeon, proudly carried forth his  family tradition. Most recently, Dr. Magee cared for American veterans  as the chief of staff of the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center. In  this new role, Dr. Magee was an instrumental partner in the launch of  my Homegrown Health Care initiative, which aims to reverse the doctor  shortage in rural communities.   Dr. Sam Magee was a champion for solutions to tough problems.  Together, we shared a mission to improve Pennsylvanians' access to  quality healthcare, regardless of ZIP Code.   In addition to his work at the VA, Dr. Magee spent more than 35 years  practicing in Altoona, Pennsylvania, saving lives and improving our  local healthcare. My family and I personally came to experience his  great skills.    As both a fellow Altoona native, and Penn State and Temple Medical  School graduates, Dr. Magee and I shared so much in common. More than a  colleague, I considered him a very dear friend.   As we remember his life and his legacy, I also give thanks for his  meaningful contributions to his patients, to our community, and to our  medical profession. Even in sorrow, we celebrate Dr. Magee's life and  his indelible contributions to the world.   I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Bunny; their children, Rich  and Katie, along with their spouses, Desiree and Michael; their beloved  grandchildren; and their extended family.   Additionally, I extend my condolences to Dr. Magee's many patients  and to the veteran community that he served with such dedication. This  is a profound loss for our medical community, our veteran community,  and our community at large.                            ____________________
