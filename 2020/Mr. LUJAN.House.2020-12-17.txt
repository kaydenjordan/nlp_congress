 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise for the last time on the  floor of the House of Representatives.   Growing up on a small farm in New Mexico, I never imagined that I  would walk these hallowed Halls and speak from this Chamber. Of course,  I did not get here alone. I stand on the shoulders of giants like  Dennis Chavez and Manuel Lujan and many others who blazed a trail for  me and other Hispanic Americans to serve our communities proudly in the  people's House.   I also owe my public service to heroes a little closer to home: My  mother, Carmen, a retired public school employee; and my late father,  Ben, a union iron worker who became Speaker of the New Mexico House of  Representatives. They taught me that no job is too big or too small,  and that we must be guided by our compassion for others. It was their  passion for serving others that propelled me to seek public office.  Thanks, Mom and Dad.   I also want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to  Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Whip Clyburn and countless  other Members for their guidance and mentorship during my career in the  House and during these last 2 years that I have served as Assistant  Speaker.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for your  friendship and support.   And thank you to the freshmen Members, the new Members, who I had the  honor of working with and mentoring during the 116th Congress. During a  difficult time in our Nation's history, your commitment to our  constituents and the Nation has inspired me every day.   Thank you to my staff, who work long hours and weekends to serve the  people of New Mexico. Their support has enabled me to make progress on  the issues that matter most to New Mexicans.   And, finally, thank you to the people of New Mexico's Third  Congressional District. It has been such an honor to represent you. The  House and I will never stop working to make a positive difference.   I am proud of what we were able to accomplish for New Mexico's Third  Congressional District:   Defending the Affordable Care Act, which expanded health coverage to  270,000 New Mexicans;   Reaching across the aisle to pass bills into law combating the opioid  epidemic that has ravished families and communities;   Working with my Republican colleagues to make robust investments in  our world-class national labs;   Creating good-paying jobs for New Mexicans by passing measures to  bolster our State's growing outdoor economy and to improve broadband  deployment in our rural communities;   Passing legislation to preserve and protect Native languages for  future generations;   Ensuring New Mexico's land grants and acequias are treated with  dignity and respect, and can continue to thrive;   And assisting thousands of New Mexicans in navigating our Federal  agencies, helping veterans and seniors secure their hard-earned  benefits, taxpayers navigate the IRS, and new citizens through the  naturalization process.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record a list of 29 bills I led  and 10 that I co-led that became law while I served in the House.   Come January, the Third District will have a new representative in  Teresa Leger Fernandez. I know she will be a champion for working  families and for New Mexico. I look forward to continuing to work with  her and the rest of my friends in the New Mexico delegation from the  other side of the Capitol.   I am truly humbled that the people of New Mexico have sent me to be  their voice in the United States Senate. To be perfectly honest, it  hasn't sunk in yet.   But I will miss the people's House. It has been the privilege of my  lifetime to serve here alongside you. Let's continue to heed the call  of the American  [[Page H7232]]  people and make a positive difference every day that we can.                            ____________________
