 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, as we move into National Police Week, I rise in support  of two bills that will help make our officers safer out on the street.  The first is H.R. 2494, commonly called the POLICE Act, which simply  states that an illegal alien that assaults a police officer will be  deported. Not might be; will be.   Currently, the situation is they can be arrested for assaulting, and  in 2021 we had 43,000 law enforcement officers assaulted. I am sure  many of those were by illegal aliens. Those numbers are just going to  go up. They can be arrested, placed in a 287(g) jail facility where  they are held for ICE, convicted of the crime of assault, but they  still may not be deported. They have to go through a long legal  analysis after their conviction to ensure that they are deported out of  this country.    H.R. 2494, the POLICE Act, simply says if you assault one of our  officers, we are kicking you out of this country. I can't imagine why  anyone across the aisle would vote against that.   The other bill is H.R. 3091, the Federal Law Enforcement Service  Weapon Purchase Act. Mr. Speaker, we have several of our Federal law  enforcement agencies right now who are about to go through rearming  their agencies to the tune of about 20,000 weapons. They are going to  destroy these weapons if officers are not allowed to purchase their  service weapon as it is being retired or as the officer may retire.   This bill simply says that we are going to take these officers that  are retiring, and if they want to purchase their service weapon, they  will be allowed to. Currently, they are precluded from doing that. All  of these weapons are going to be destroyed; about $8 million worth. We  are just going to destroy them, and the taxpayers are going to have to  buy more.   As a 40-year law enforcement officer, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker,  your sidearm is not just any old sidearm. There is a special  relationship that you develop, and we need to allow these officers to  purchase their firearms.                                time  1300
