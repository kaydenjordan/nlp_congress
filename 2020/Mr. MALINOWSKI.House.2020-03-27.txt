 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today and to  say to my constituents in Phillipsburg,  [[Page H1833]]  in Dover, and in Clark who are out of work, to our restaurant owners in  Somerville and Summit, to our nurses and doctors at Overlook and  Hunterdon Medical: Help is on the way.   This does not mean we are done. There is so much more to do for our  local governments, for example, for our hospitals and healthcare  system. Congress must keep working.   Let's use technology. Let's use remote voting. Let's have virtual  hearings to make sure this money we are approving goes out the door  quickly and to the right people.   And let's remember, we are not here today rescuing the economy  because of a virus. We are rescuing the economy because of our failure  as a nation to test for that virus.   So Congress will do our job. We will take care of the economy. I  implore the President to work with us, Republicans and Democrats, to  fix the supply chain for masks, for ventilators, for test kits. Don't  talk about reopening America until we have done what we must to reopen  it safely.
