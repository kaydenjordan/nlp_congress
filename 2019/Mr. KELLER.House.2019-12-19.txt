 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the United  States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. While I am glad we are here  today, this moment is long overdue.   While Democrats have been focusing on impeaching President Trump,  manufacturers and family farmers in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District have been waiting for the trade deal to be ratified. That is  because this trade deal means a lot to the hardworking people and  farmers of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.   Just take the positive effect the USMCA will have on Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District farmers. Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District is home to more than 10,500 farms, 98 percent of which are  family farms. Moreover, our district is responsible for 18 percent of  Pennsylvania's agriculture products.   The provisions in this deal eliminating Canada's class 7 milk pricing  program, increasing corn and soybean exports, and many other  improvements will make a huge difference for those family farms.   More important is the leverage that gives the United States when  negotiating additional trade deals.   It is no surprise that when Speaker Pelosi agreed to the USMCA, China  agreed to the Phase One trade deal that President Trump had been  negotiating for the benefit of our country.   Again, USMCA is long overdue, but I am glad we are finally here to be  able to support America in this trade deal.
