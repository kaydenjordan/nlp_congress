 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Foxx very much for yielding. I  appreciate the opportunity to speak, Mr. Speaker.   All Americans, men and women, should be treated equally and receive  equal pay for equal work. I happen to be the father of two daughters,  and I will do everything in this House to ensure that that continues to  be the case and is, in fact, the case.   If this truly were an Equal Pay Act, Mr. Speaker, I think we would  have a bipartisan initiative here. We would have bipartisan agreement.  The problem is this is not what it is, Mr. Speaker, it goes well beyond  dealing with equal pay.   What it does is it provides equal pay for as many attorneys and trial  lawyers as possible. And therein lies the problem. Once again, we have  what looks like legitimate legislation that sounds good and feels good,  Mr. Speaker, yet when you look at the details, it is far left  extremism, which poisons the legislation and doesn't allow reasonable  Members like myself to be supportive.   And this isn't the first time. This occurs very often, and it is the  reason why we don't get things done, nor do we get bipartisan  cooperation. Because cooperation is the way that we will achieve and  complete bills of importance, particularly that are named equal pay for  all, equality for all.   That is what our goal is. It would be great if a bill like this had  the substance that provided the ingredients to provide for equal pay.
