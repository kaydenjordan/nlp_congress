 Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear all these  great amendments that have been made in order, and I was glad to hear  my friend from Alabama reference the fact that this is a bill to make  the people of America safe.   I rise in opposition to this rule because there was one amendment  that makes the people of America safe that was omitted from the list  that was approved. It was a bipartisan amendment by myself, Mr. Young  from Alaska, and Mr. Jones from North Carolina that would declassify a  50-year-old DOD project that sprayed biological and chemical weapons on  our servicemembers and some civilians, and that amendment was not made  in order.   Convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure, and death--those are  just a few of the most severe side effects of sarin gas, a chemical  weapon so deadly and debilitating that it was outlawed as a weapon of  mass destruction.   When Syria's military used it, we retaliated. But in the 1960s and  1970s, the United States Department of Defense sprayed biological and  chemical weapons like sarin, VX nerve gas, and e. coli on our own  servicemembers. In the years since, many of those exposed have suffered  debilitating health effects.   For 40 years, the Department of Defense has not provided a  comprehensive public accounting of these tests nor have they notified  all the veterans and all the civilians who were potentially exposed. We  can't allow this information to continue to be released piecemeal.  These veterans can't wait any longer. Their health continues to  decline, and some have already passed away. To sweep this under the rug  is shameful.   These veterans served honorably for the security of our Nation. These  tests are an ugly part of our history. They put veterans' lives at  risk, and our veterans have every right to know what it was they were  exposed to and how much they were exposed to. We need to think about  their safety and their security.
