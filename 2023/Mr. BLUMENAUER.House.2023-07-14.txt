 Mr. Speaker, I was disappointed in the recent debate  we had here dealing with the National Defense Authorization Act. It was  a culture war instead of national security. The biggest failure was the  inability to address our nuclear weapons policy.   We couldn't even eliminate one outmoded bomb. We couldn't allow the  reevaluation of our land-based intercontinental ballistic missile  system, even though they have been plagued by rampant corruption,  cheating, and drug use.   Sadly, Congress continued to avoid the issue of nuclear deterrence.  How many times do we have to destroy a country before they are  discouraged in attacking us?   How many billion dollars need to be wasted in piling on additional  nuclear weapons that pose threats in and of themselves?   This is a question that the American people deserve Congress to  address. Sadly, this legislation continues to ignore the issue.                            ____________________
