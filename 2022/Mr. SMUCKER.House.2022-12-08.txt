 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Brian  Troop of Ephrata Area School District in Pennsylvania's 11th  Congressional District for being selected as the 2023 Pennsylvania  Superintendent of the Year by the Pennsylvania Association of School  Administrators.   With over 500 districts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dr.  Troop's selection speaks to the excellence he brings to Ephrata Area  School District.   Dr. Troop was described as an exemplary, forward-thinking leader by  PASA Executive Director Dr. Sherri Smith. I would certainly agree with  those words.   I have had the pleasure of visiting the school district as a Member  of Congress, and I was able to see firsthand the work that they are  doing to prepare students in STEM technologies as fifth-grade students  were participating in a computer coding project. It was encouraging to  see the district offer such an outstanding opportunity to their  students.   I thank Dr. Troop for all of his work to provide an excellent  education to students in the Ephrata Area School District. I  congratulate him on being named the 2023 Pennsylvania Superintendent of  the Year.                            ____________________
