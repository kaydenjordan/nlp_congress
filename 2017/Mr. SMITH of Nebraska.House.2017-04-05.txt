 Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory of Ambassador  Clayton Yeutter, a native of Eustis, Nebraska, who recently passed away  after a hard-fought battle with cancer.   Mr. Yeutter was a true statesman, who generously shared his time and  expertise throughout his very remarkable career. On top of his numerous  professional accomplishments, Mr. Yeutter was known as a humble, kind,  and respected leader who never lost sight of his commitment to rural  America.   No one understood the importance of trade to American agriculture  better than he did, and his work has benefited generations of,  incidentally, Nebraska agriculture producers as well as others across  the country.   Mr. Yeutter grew up on a cattle and corn operation in central  Nebraska during the Great Depression. He attended the University of  Nebraska, where he earned a bachelor's degree in animal husbandry and,  later, a juris doctorate and a Ph.D. in agricultural economics.   After serving in the Air Force in the 1950s and returning home to  work on his farm, he got his start in politics as chief of staff for  Nebraska Governor Norbert Tiemann in the mid-1960s. Soon he was named  director of the Nebraska Mission to Colombia, which led him to the USDA  and decades of distinguished public service.   His extensive resume included serving as U.S. Trade Representative  under President Ronald Reagan and Agriculture Secretary under President  George H.W. Bush. He also ran the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for 8  years and served as chairman of the Republican National Committee.   As we mourn the loss of this influential Nebraskan, I extend my  condolences to Mr. Yeutter's wife, Cristena, and his children,  grandchildren, and great-granddaughter as well.   I yield to my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Mr. Speaker, I can't say enough to honor such  a true giant in public service as Secretary Yeutter, Ambassador  Yeutter. The list goes on of his many titles, an incredible man, but  his humility did so much for our country.                            ____________________
