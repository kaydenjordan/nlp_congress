 Madam President, before the Senator from Texas leaves  the floor, I think he needs to be complimented because one of the four  things in the bill which I am talking about our introducing and which  he is going to be one of the cosponsors of is border security. He has  worked for years on border security. He needs to be complimented on it.  He is chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of our Judiciary  Committee. And I think Senator Johnson of Homeland Security has some  aspects of border security as well. I think he and Senator Johnson  ought to be complimented for being in the lead of 100 Senators to make  sure we don't make the same mistakes we made in 1986 when we gave  amnesty because we thought we had border security. Quite obviously, the  numbers  [[Page S861]]  show we didn't do a very good job on border security in 1986. The  Senator from Texas and the Senator from Wisconsin are going to make  sure we don't make that same mistake again, so I thank them very much.   Madam President, I rise today to announce the formal introduction of  an amendment to H.R. 2579. H.R. 2579 is the vehicle for immigration.  This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Cornyn, Tillis, Lankford,  Perdue, Cotton, and Ernst. It is a product of several months of hard  work between these Senators and including the White House.   Since this past September, I have held more than two dozen meetings  with interested Senators in an attempt to craft a fair and permanent  solution to DACA. I have also met with the President on four separate  occasions to figure out exactly what he needs to see in a legislative  package so that it can be signed into law, because what is the point of  our working hard if we are not going to get something that is going to  be finalized by a signature from the President of the United States?   I just said I have met with the President on four separate occasions.  I should have said that this group of introducers of this legislation  met with the President on those four occasions. But most importantly, I  have been continuously listening to what my colleagues have said they  need in any immigration consensus. As a result of our meetings and  conversations with our colleagues, the Senators sponsoring this  amendment have attempted to develop a simple, commonsense framework  that can address everyone's concerns while also providing necessary and  critical changes to our Nation's immigration laws.   What does our amendment do? Working off the broad bipartisan,  bicameral framework agreed to on January 9 at the White House, our  amendment has four key pillars. I said bipartisan, bicameral. Members  of Congress met with the President for an hour and a half to boil down  all the issues that can be brought up, and we ended up with these four  key pillars.   First and most importantly, our amendment fully funds the President's  border security request. Other plans that we have heard about claim  that they fund the President's border security request by--I want to  put this word in quotes--``authorizing'' money. But anyone who knows  Washington knows that just an authorization turns out to be a gimmick  sometimes. It turns out to be a promise sometimes or an IOU to maybe  fund something at some later date. Every Member of the Senate knows  that in this town, Washington, DC, promises are quite cheap.   We went down the road in 2006 when Congress authorized money for  border fencing, much of which Congress never actually funded. Our  amendment rejects that approach. Instead, we actually appropriate $25  billion into a border security trust fund. This trust fund will allow  Homeland Security to use between $2.5 billion and $3 billion a year for  infrastructure, technology, and personnel recruitment and retention.   By setting up a border security trust fund, we ensure that the  Department of Homeland Security will actually have the money that it  needs every single year to secure our borders, while also retaining  Congress's ability to exercise oversight.   Unlike other plans, we also recognize that real border security is  more than just throwing money at the border. This group of Senators  realized that real border security means that we have to close the  legal loopholes in the current law that allow dangerous criminals to  enter and remain at large within our country. Our amendment ends these  dangerous loopholes and makes it easier for our law enforcement to  apprehend, detain, and speedily remove sex offenders, drug smugglers,  human traffickers, international terrorists, criminal gang members,  repeat border crossers, drunk drivers, and other dangerous people.   Second, our amendment provides a generous and permanent solution for  DACA and DACA-eligible recipients. Our plan contains an earned path to  citizenship for these young people. Provided these young men and women  have no criminal record and either serve in the military, attain a  college or vocational degree, or maintain full-time employment, they  can eventually gain citizenship. This represents a major concession for  many Republicans, including this Senator, but this concession is  necessary to provide a permanent and fair solution to this issue.   The third pillar of our proposal reforms family-based immigration to  place greater emphasis on the nuclear family. Moving forward, we limit  family-based immigration to the nuclear family, meaning the spouses and  minor children of citizens and lawful, permanent residents.   This change doesn't end family-based immigration. It simply  recognizes that extended-family immigration doesn't serve the American  people or our country's economic interest. It is important for all of  my colleagues to recognize that these family-based changes are  prospective. This means that all 4 million immigrants who are waiting  in line for a family-based petition will continue to have their  petitions processed under the old rules.   This group of Senators understands that we can't penalize the  millions of people who actually followed the law and, by following the  law, did the right thing.   In addition to rewarding those who did the right thing by  grandfathering all pending petitions in the pipeline, it will take  years--by some estimates, more than a decade--for Congress to debate  and enact merit-based immigration reform.   Finally, our plan reallocates the 55,000 visas and the diversity visa  lottery to clearing backlogs in the family-based and employment-based  backlogs. By reallocating these visas, we not only promote faster  family reunification but also speed up the immigration of skilled  workers in the EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories.   As you can see, this is an eminently fair plan that closely mirrors  the President's framework. This plan is a true compromise, and  supporting it will require concessions from all Senators-- conservatives, liberals, Democrats, Republicans, and everyone in  between.   This Senator is ready and willing to make a major concession and,  once again, vote for a path to citizenship. Other Senators need to be  willing to do the same, to make sacrifices when it comes to border  security and to chain migration.   But at the end of the day, in spite of everything else, the simple  fact remains that this amendment is the only plan that the President  supports. This plan is the only Senate plan that has any possibility of  passing the House of Representatives and becoming law.   So I have asked my colleagues who oppose this proposal: Are you  interested in actually getting something done, in actually providing a  path to citizenship for these DACA kids, or are you interested in a  political issue for the 2018 elections? If you are actually interested  in getting something done, in getting a bill signed into law, and  fixing the DACA issue, the choice is obvious: You will vote to support  this plan.   But if my colleagues are more interested in grandstanding, in passing  a bill that will never become law and that will not actually protect  DACA kids, well, that choice is pretty clear as well.   To all my colleagues, I urge your support for this amendment. Let's  fix this issue. Let's demonstrate that we can find solutions to the  challenging problems that Americans are calling on us to solve.   This is a compassionate compromise. As for the people who have been  advocating for this for years--longer than I have been, because I have  been at it just a short period of time--let them accept a compassionate  compromise. Let them do what they have called on to be done for a long  period of time--settling the DACA issue once and for all. Then, let's  show the world that we are serious about finding a long-term solution,  instead of kicking the problem to a future date.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.    Mr. President, we have had a chance today to listen to  my colleagues discuss what we think is the only piece of legislation  that can get through the Senate, through the House of Representatives,  and, most importantly, be signed by the President of the United States.  All are cosponsors of this bill, except Senator Hatch, who spoke on  another issue that he is very interested in, but it is a very important  immigration issue as well.   We heard from Senator Cornyn. Then I spoke. Senator Cotton spoke and  Senator Ernst, Senator Tillis, and Senator Lankford. Senator Perdue is  one of those who is a cosponsor of the bill and would have liked to  have been here to speak, but he is just now returning from his  constituency.   We have tried to lay out a path to giving DACA kids certainty, doing  it from a standpoint of being humanitarian for people who were brought  to this country by their parents. Their parents may have broken the  law--and they did break the law--by coming over our borders without  documentation, but we never should hold children responsible for what  their parents did. This legislation takes a compassionate and  reasonable approach to reforms, including a pathway to citizenship for  a broad population. It grandfathers people waiting in line for family- based visas, and it expedites clearing that backlog. It helps to keep  young people out of the same legal limbo in the future.   This legislation is a product of compromise. The President and many  conservatives have come a long way to offer this plan and especially  the part of the plan that offers citizenship to this group of people.  For one example of compromise, as chairman of this committee, there are  a lot of things I would have liked to have seen in this legislation  that can't be in there, as a way of getting a broad base of compromise.  I am a strong supporter of mandatory E-Verify, but that is not in this  document. I think the other side needs to be willing to compromise as  well. We need to pass something that can become law. Several times my  colleagues have been told that this is the only plan the President  supports, and you have heard him say that on television many times  since he put out the four-pillars program, as we call it, that came  from his White House. The House isn't going to bring up anything that  the President will not sign. I think we need to stop political  posturing and pass something that can fix a real problem by providing  border security and certainty for DACA kids.   This legislation is a reasonable approach to shielding children  illegally brought to our country through no fault of their own while  also taking meaningful steps to ensure that nobody finds themselves in  the same situation in the future. This is a rare opportunity to fix a  real problem and protect the country in a thoughtful and compassionate  way. We simply have to correct the loopholes in current law that allow  dangerous criminals to enter and remain at large in our country.   Our proposal is supported by the President, who has come a long way  to reach a compromise. Just think of the long way from the positions he  took during his campaign for President. This President can be very  correct in stating that a platform he once ran on he wants to serve on.   In this particular case, I think he has come to the same conclusion  as a lot of us have: These young people are here through no fault of  their own. They may be technically violators of the law, but as a  practical matter, humanitarianism calls for us to make a legalization.  This is the only Senate proposal that has any chance of passing the  House and being signed into law. If my colleagues are serious about  actually finding a real and permanent solution to the DACA crisis, they  should be ready and willing to support this compromise.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, last September President Trump  rescinded the DACA Program. Since that time, nearly 20,000 DACA  recipients have lost their status. That number continues to grow. I  have posted this sign outside my office so my colleagues can see that  122 Dreamers are losing their status every single day. This chart  cannot begin to tell the story of the impact this arbitrary decision  has had on Dreamers' lives.   Over the past year, I have held roundtables with Dreamers throughout  Nevada. I wanted to hear their concerns, listen to their stories, and  make sure they know their rights. Dreamers  [[Page S867]]  are not charts or numbers. They are people. They are amazing. They are  putting themselves through school, studying hard, serving in our  communities, our churches, and our military--all while working multiple  jobs to support their families.   In meeting with them, I have learned that they are their own best  advocates. Dreamers deserve the chance to speak for themselves. They  deserve better than to be used as pawns in a cynical game. They should  not be forced to choose between achieving protection in the only  country they have ever known and seeing their families attacked with  arbitrary and cruel cuts to our family reunification and diversity visa  programs. I am tired of seeing the White House pit people against one  another.   Tonight and this week, Congress is about to determine the future of  these patriotic young men and women. Before we begin this debate, we  need to take a few moments to understand who they are, what they are  doing for our country, and what the consequences will be if we fail  them. I wish to read a few letters they sent me.   Listen to this letter from Jevi. He is a freshman at Nevada State  College. Jevi said:         I was born in Mexico in March 1998 and was brought to the       United States when I was six months old. I recently started       my freshman year at Nevada State College. I am majoring in       Business Administration in the hope that I can open a small       family restaurant someday. I have grown up in Las Vegas my       entire life. It's the city I know, the city that raised me.       It is my home, my only home.    Listen to this letter from Maggie. She wrote:         I came to the United States when I was ten years old. I       faced language barriers when I started elementary school, but       I quickly learned English and excelled as a student. I       graduated from High School in 2007 with $20,000 in academic       scholarships, but couldn't use them because I was       undocumented. After receiving Deferred Action for Childhood       Arrivals in June of 2013, I was able to begin working as a       health care enrollment counselor for Nevada Health Link. In       January 2014, I was accepted to the University of Nevada       Reno, where I continued working to help people access       affordable health care while going to school full time.    That was Maggie. That was her letter to me.   Listen to Francisco. This is his letter to me.         My story is very much like others in this country. I am one       of the 1.5 million undocumented children that were brought to       the United States as minors by their parents. On September       17th, 2012, I applied for Deferred Action, hoping to be       granted a work permit. Around that same time, I learned that       I had been admitted to the University of Nevada, Las       Vegas. On November 5 my work permit arrived. My family and       I all came to tears upon learning the news. I quickly       looked for a job so that I would be able to enroll and       start paying for my school.    That was from Francisco.   Now hear from Anna, who wrote:         I came to the United States with my family, from the       Philippines, at the age of 7. My father left our family in       2001, and our visas expired soon after. I graduated from       Centennial High School in 2008 and started nursing school at       the College of Southern Nevada. I graduated in 2012 and       received my DACA acceptance a year later. I am currently       going on my third year working at University Medical Center .       . . as a pediatric ICU nurse.    These are only four of the stories that I have heard from Dreamers,  and there are hundreds of thousands more just like them.   I want to point out that just recently, I received a batch of 32  letters from seventh graders at Bailey Middle School in Las Vegas. To a  T, the concern for every single one of these seventh graders was the  same thing.   Clarisa, one of these seventh graders, wrote:         I would like to change Trump's decision and let the DACA       program stay so immigrants get to have the life they had       before. My family and friends are all I have in my life. I       don't want to see them go because they cannot go to school or       get a job. Thank you.    That was from Clarisa.   We also have a letter from Andrea G.:         President Trump's decision affects my family, the people I       know, and the community. It affects my family because my two       older siblings were brought here when they were just babies.       It affects people I know because some of my other family       members were brought here as babies. I hope President Trump       does not end DACA. Thank you.    To a T, with regard to all of these letters, all of the information,  all of the people with whom I have met both here in the Capitol and in  Nevada, these Dreamers are incredible people. They are incredible  individuals who are contributing to our communities.   When you hear these stories, you see that this fight is not about  charts and numbers or political leverage. This fight is not even about  individuals. It is about entire communities. It is not just about what  will happen to Jevi and Maggie and Francisco and Anna and all of those  families who are connected somehow to those kids at Bailey Middle  School. It is about what will happen to their customers, their  students, their patients, their employers, their parents, their  families, and their friends.   You see, Dreamers are our first responders. They serve in our  military. They drive our ambulances. They pray with us in church. They  are on the frontlines, teaching our kids and defending our country.  What happens when they are not here anymore?   The debate over immigration in this country has focused for too long  on misconceptions and stereotypes. Immigrants are not taking our jobs;  they are creating them. They are not causing crime; they are putting  their lives on the line to fight it. What do we gain by deporting them?   What do we gain when Maggie and Francisco are forced to drop out of  school? How do we gain when Anna cannot go back to work in the  pediatric ICU?   Jevi has no memory of the country in which he was born. He spent only  the first 6 months of his life there. What do we gain when we send him  back?   Living in a community means depending on the people around you. It  means having neighbors you can turn to in times of need. Dreamers are  our neighbors. This is their time of need.   I urge my colleagues to understand who Dreamers really are. Don't pit  kids against parents or neighbors against neighbors. This is bigger  than partisan politics. It is about human lives. It is time to fight  for these families and for keeping these families together, who are an  integral part of our communities.   I know many of my colleagues support the Dream Act and reasonable  border security measures. Let's get through to the finish line. The  American people are watching us, and 80 percent of them want us to help  Dreamers. Dreamers belong here, and Dreamers are American. This is our  chance to do what is right.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before  the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       proceed to Calendar No. 302, H.R. 2579, an act to amend the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the premium tax credit       with respect to unsubsidized COBRA continuation coverage.
