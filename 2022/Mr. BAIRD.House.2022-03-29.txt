 Madam Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to my good  friend, Representative Don Young.   The House of Representatives has been home to many unique individuals  throughout its history, perhaps none more memorable than my colleague  and friend, Representative Don Young.   His office walls are adorned with various mounted animals, and a 10- foot grizzly pelt, a homage to his favorite place, Alaska. For 49  years, Representative Young dutifully served his beloved Alaska,  fiercely advocating for his home and the constituents he proudly  served.   When I first came to Congress, Don was among the first to welcome me  and show me the ropes. This Chamber is far quieter without his  boisterous laugh. It is dimmer without his smiling face. We will miss  this unforgettable giant, and I will miss my friend.
