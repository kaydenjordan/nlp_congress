 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Sharon Giese. Sharon passed away unexpectedly in Arizona last week, a  few short days after the death of her husband, Burt.   Sharon was a respected, admired, and cherished member of our  community. She had a long history of promoting conservative principles,  and everyone she touched will miss her steady voice. Sharon Giese was a  steadfast icon of the conservative movement in Arizona and a former  Republican National Committeewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I pray that the family of Burt and Sharon will receive  peace in remembering their lives of purpose and distinction. These two  individuals made a difference for Arizona and for the causes they  dedicated themselves to. Burt and Sharon left behind a wonderful legacy  for their family, community, church, and State.   Like Sharon, we do not have knowledge of the moment of our life's  final breath, but we are exhorted to run with endurance the race that  is set before us. Sharon Giese ran her race with an abundance of  endurance and inspired countless individuals around her. Her example  will be celebrated and her loss mourned.                            ____________________
