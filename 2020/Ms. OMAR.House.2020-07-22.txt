 Madam Speaker, it gives me great pride to rise today in  support of the NO BAN Act.   Our friends on the other side of the aisle might try to obscure the  reality here by pointing to the Muslim countries that are not on the  ban. The White House has tried to wrap their hateful policy up in a  false story about national security, but we know the truth.   I have spoken countless times, both before and since I have entered  this office, about the hateful brutality of the Muslim ban.   Today, I want to celebrate the work that brought us to this point. I  want to  [[Page H3636]]  celebrate the countless Americans who went to the airport the day the  first ban was announced. I want to celebrate the thousands of State  Department employees who signed the dissent memo and those who resigned  in protest. I want to celebrate Congresswoman Chu and Senator Coons for  their tireless work on overturning this ban.   Today's vote is a culmination of all of their work, starting at the  grassroots level. We have been in the struggle together, and we will  continue to be in it until this ban is in the dustbin of history.
