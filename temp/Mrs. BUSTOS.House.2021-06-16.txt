 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of efforts to build back  our care economy. I recently toured a place called Lifescape in  Rockford, Illinois, where I met a woman named Miss Selma.   Miss Selma lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, and she has  three generations under one roof. Three generations where she was the  major caretaker for many years.   About a decade ago she had a stroke, and so now her daughter has to  take care of her. But she has to go to work also. So it is places like  Lifescape that help families get back to work so they can make sure  that their loved ones are cared for while they also make a living.   The global pandemic put a spotlight on the need to invest in our care  economy and places like Lifescape. Because of the CARES Act, Lifescape  expanded their home meal delivery service by 800 meals every single day  and allowed for the care of people like Miss Selma.   As we continue to negotiate an infrastructure package, we need to  invest in our care economy in order to get our national economy back in  place.                            ____________________
