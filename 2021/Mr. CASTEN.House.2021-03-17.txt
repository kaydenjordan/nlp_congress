 Mr. Speaker, during my first month in Congress, I visited  Family Shelter Service, an organization that provides lifesaving  counseling, victim protection, and a 24/7 hotline to women and children  in northern Illinois. They provide nearly 11,000 nights of shelter for  abused women and children every year.   To their staff, to their clients, and to the one in three women in  the United States who experience domestic violence and the one in five  women who are raped, the Violence Against Women Act has been a lifeline  since 1994. But it needs to be updated and renewed, and that is what we  have done today.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 makes crucial  updates to this landmark bill to address its gaps, expand protections,  and meet increased needs. We have expanded protections to make the law  more inclusive of our LGBT communities. We have closed loopholes to  better protect victims from gun violence, improved victim services to  help survivors heal and access justice, and increased funding for  programs to help children who are exposed to domestic violence in the  home.   We have made vital new investments in prevention and victim services,  including an amendment that I introduced to train healthcare providers  on college campuses so they can better meet the needs of the one in  four undergraduate women who are victims of sexual assault.   This is for our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, and our friends.  But it is also for Americans, regardless of their gender, who aspire to  live in a country that truly provides equal protection and equal  opportunities for all.   We have done our work here today. It is now crucial that the Senate  do theirs and send this bill to the President's desk.  [[Page H1484]]                                ____________________
