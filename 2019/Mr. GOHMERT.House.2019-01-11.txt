 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  King).                           Clarification of Remarks     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Iowa,  for his comments. I have traveled with him, been to different parts of  the country and different parts of the world with my friend, Mr. King  from Iowa. I have seen him dealing with different races, nationalities  around the world. And I have had a lot of private conversations and  never seen anything that indicated anything but condemnation for white  supremacists.   But he is a proud American. He is an American; he is very proud of  it. And he is proud to carry the moniker of being an American in any  situation, and I would contend that is not a bad thing.   Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the speeches on the floor here  this week. There has been a great deal of righteous indignation and  constant condemnation for a shutdown. It is deeply troubling. There are  some people working who are not getting paid. I would like to see that  fixed.   But President Trump got his answer this week when he continued to try  to compromise with Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, trying to get a  compromise.   I was delighted to hear Majority Leader Hoyer mention that we have to  have compromise. It is how things are  [[Page H513]]  supposed to work. I agree with the tone o that comment, but it is not a  compromise to say I will give you a dollar for the border wall when it  is such a serious matter, and especially when we have a history of  people making comments on the Democratic side as well as the Republican  side about the need for border security, the need for either a wall, a  barrier, a fence, but tough, tight border security for the country,  which is the most generous country, not only philanthropically. There  has never been a country that has given more, done more, without any  request in return, but just out of the goodness of Americans' hearts,  for other parts of the world. We do that. We care deeply.    But the only way you can have people who are giving and who have  money to share and spare is if we have a vibrant economy here.  Otherwise, America continued the move we saw during the last  administration where the middle class kept shrinking, the poor got much  bigger, and the rich, well, it is easiest to put it this way: We have  never had a time in the United States history, never, when the policies  of an administration would have the effect that the Obama  administration had.   Here is what President Obama acknowledged: For the first time in  American history, 95 percent of American income went to the top 1  percent.   But that is what happens as you move more and more toward a socialist  form of government. You will have the rich ruling class, virtually no  middle class, and then you have everybody equal in the poor ruled  class.   That is where socialism goes, and that is where this country has been  heading as young people have been miseducated and not been informed  that socialism has never worked. It will never work. It always leads to  totalitarianism. You can't have socialism without totalitarianism.   One might ask, why do we have so many billionaires supporting  socialism, the Democratic cause, the progressivism, as they call it?  Well, it is because they see themselves being in the rich ruling class  once they get rid of the middle class. It helps to get rid of the  middle class if you keep bringing illegal immigrants into the country  so they take the jobs of Americans. But never forget the cost of that.   Here are some quotes:   ``Well, look, I voted numerous times when I was a Senator to spend  money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from  coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.'' That was  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.   She was asked: ``Would you commit tonight that you would finish the  fence and speed up the construction?''   And she said: ``Both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of  the immigration debate . . . . We were voting for the possibility that,  where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered.''   So she was watering it down already a little bit from where she had  been before.   But Senator Barack Obama said: ``We fail to protect our Nation if we  do not regain control over our immigration system immediately.''   It is really heartbreaking to hear people that I like condemn as  hateful and immoral a wall like they have around their house. The walls  of the houses themselves show that wall works. The fact that so many  people in this body at night, the last thing they do, they make sure  all the doors are locked. It didn't used to be that way.   If you are in a gated community and you have really tight security in  your gated community, you may not need to lock your doors. You may feel  safe enough without that. But most will secure their doors, not because  a burglar can't break through and get into their home, but because  walls work. They are secure in slowing down people who would be  trespassers, burglars, long enough, hopefully, for either the police to  arrive or for the homeowner to be prepared for the burglar coming in.  That is the hope.   I mean, that is why people don't just have a roof. They have walls  around their home. People that they don't want to come in and interrupt  their families don't come unless they are invited. That is the way the  immigration system works.   So I would encourage all my friends who say walls don't work, go home  this weekend and get a contractor to destroy your outer walls. If you  have a wall or fence around your home, you have a gated community, tell  them, demand, that the walls, the gates, they all be destroyed and say:  ``Walls don't work. I have been saying it over and over on the House  floor and in the media, CNN, MSNBC, `Walls don't work,' so I am going  to eliminate the hypocrisy that some could see in my life. I am going  to eliminate the outer wall of my home, because walls don't work. I am  not going to have a door anymore, no walls, because walls don't work.''   That is what needs to happen this weekend to avoid--some people I  really care deeply about, I don't want them to look like hypocrites. I  want them to look fine and upstanding, but you have to eliminate the  walls of your house, because walls don't work, according to you.   The righteous indignation that we have heard this week and in prior  weeks about the shutdown, I want to put the focus on people who are  working right now and who may not get their next paycheck if Speaker  Pelosi and Schumer do not at least agree to some compromise, something,  not continue to say no to a wall, no to a barrier.   Then when he says: Okay, I will compromise. It won't be concrete. It  will be steel. There is a compromise.   They said: Oh, now we see you don't have a definite plan.   Well, yeah. He is trying to compromise with people who disagree with  him. Fine, but if you are going to compromise, you are going to do it  with the President: Okay, I will compromise. We will make it a steel  wall.   Okay, we will compromise, and we will have barriers.   Let's work it out, what we will have.                                time  1345    Oh, see, they say: He doesn't have a plan. We need to see exactly  what his plan is.   Oh, he has got a plan, but you said under no circumstances would you  agree. He has been compromising. That is what it is called. That is  what he is trying to do. And that is what we have been wanting to do  here in the House. Let's have a compromise. But don't say under no  circumstances will you ever agree to any kind of wall, fence, barrier  and then say: There is our compromise. That is not a compromise.   And if people would just go back and look at what they have said in  the past, it will be much easier for them to reach this compromise: Oh,  I forgot I said that. I did.   And I know they wouldn't have said it in prior years if they hadn't  meant it.   Now, some of my friends across the aisle are saying, well, we don't  need a wall. We need a virtual wall: the drones, the cameras, and that  kind of thing. Well, you also do need a barrier or those things don't  work.   And, in fact, under the prior administration that had, as I recall,  about $8 billion to create a virtual wall in support of securing our  border, there was one little out that they had to avoid doing any of  that, and that was if the administration declared virtual walls  wouldn't work, the technology wouldn't work. And that is what Secretary  Napolitano did.   I can't find out what they did with the $8 billion in the prior  administration since they didn't spend it on the drones and the  technology, but they declared, in the prior administration, that that  kind of thing doesn't work, and so they weren't going to spend money on  it.   Now they come back some years later and say: Well, do you know what?  We think we were wrong before. Those kind of things do work. The  technology, that is what we need.   Why they are saying that now, when they disagreed some years back, is  because President Trump, who creates PTSD--President Trump stress  disorder. They are suffering from the PTSD, the President Trump stress  disorder. And now, in that condition, they are saying: It doesn't  matter what he wants. We are not agreeing to anything he wants, period.  He has to have total capitulation, and that is our offered compromise.   Going back just a little bit again, you had this comment: ``When I  see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes  feel  [[Page H514]]  a flush of patriotic resentment. When I'm forced to use a translator to  communicate with a guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.''   My friends may recognize the name. That was Senator Barack Obama.   You have another here: ``The American people are fundamentally pro- legal immigration. . . . ''   And put me in that category, too.   But he said: ``The American people are fundamentally pro-legal  immigration and anti-illegal immigration. We will only pass  comprehensive reform when we recognize this fundamental concept. . . .  First, illegal immigration is wrong, and a primary goal of  comprehensive immigration reform must be to dramatically curtail future  illegal immigration.''   That is what President Trump is trying to do. That is what we are  trying to do.   By the way, that was Senator Schumer who said that.   We had a President that recently said: ``I'll tell you what we can't  have; it's these parents sending their kids here on a dangerous journey  and putting their lives at risk.''   That was President Barack Obama in 2015.   I have several pages of quotes from Democratic friends who have been  supportive in the past of what we are asking for now. Let's not play  politics with this. Let's just help the American people.   I got a great quote from President Clinton in his State of the Union  back in 1995, when he felt like the Republicans do now.   Here is a good quote: ``It's a competition for space.''   I don't buy that, but this is what was said by a Democrat: ``It's a  competition for space. Whether the space is a job, the space is a home,  a place in a classroom, it becomes a competition for space. This is a  country that's based on immigration. And we all know that. . . . And  yet, at times you become so overtaxed you have to concentrate on  saying, `The people who should be here are those who come legally at  this time.' And we've got to, for the time being, enforce our  borders.''   That was a well-educated Senator named Dianne Feinstein on a visit to  the border. And, yes, it was some years back.   And again, I have got lots of these quotes. Here is one.   ``Do we have a commitment to secure the border? Yes. What are the  options that we have available to us; let's make sure they work. . . .  Because we do need to address the issue of immigration and the  challenge we have of undocumented people in our country. We certainly  do not want any more coming in.''   And I agree with Speaker Pelosi when she said that previously in the  last Democratic majority. That was made in 2008. That helped the  Democrats keep the majority for a second term.   And now, I think, to put the needs of the American people behind the  desires of people who want to come in illegally is a big mistake. You  will erode and destroy this country's ability to be the most  philanthropic, to be a country that every year produces cleaner air or  cleaner water, like Texas has. You erode that ability. Because when  people are struggling financially, the thoughts of a cleaner  environment and helping others fall behind the desires of just making  enough to feed their family. We have seen it throughout history. It is  important to secure our border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a real  patriot. I don't believe he minds being called a patriot.    Do they secure their doors and secure their cities  because they hate people who are not part of their home or their city?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida. We have  been friends for a long time, and I know how deeply my friend,  Representative Yoho, cares about this country and about the people who  are under our charge.   This poster has some more recent folks. You have heard about Officer  Singh, who was recently killed by a person illegally in the country.  That is the charge. Pierce Corcoran, 22 years old, and I was hearing  his parents talk about him yesterday; Justin James Dennis Lee, 14 years  old, a cute kid; Steven Marler, his family would love to have him back.  Some of these were not intentional murders. Some of these were  accidents, some by drunk drivers, and some by negligent homicide, but  they killed Americans.   Grayson Hacking, she was 22 months old. It is a little harder. Ellie  Jean Bryant reminds me of one of mine, killed when she was 4 years old;  Blake Michael Zieto, he was 20; Chrishia Odette, 13; Rocky Jones, 51.   Now, Dominic Durden's mother is a friend of mine, and I know how she  has suffered--she is a single mom--at the loss of Dominic. He sounds  like he was an absolutely awesome young man. Then there is Shayley  Estes and Grant Ronnebeck. He was 21.   I got to see a little bit of my friend Sean Hannity's show last night  and I saw these names scrolling, and I was going: Oh, my gosh. Look at  those names. And there is a website his producer, Linda, directed me to  that they were using that has lists of names. There are three columns,  in case someone can't see, three columns of names.   This isn't everybody that has been killed by illegal immigrants. So  knowing people who have lost family members to illegal immigrant  homicides, it is difficult to absorb the pious, righteous indignation  that we have sometimes heard here on the House floor about the  shutdown. It sounds like callousness on this floor, potential  callousness to the murders and the deaths of so many Americans that  would not have happened if Congress had done its job.   And it breaks my heart to think of the murders and the homicides,  negligent homicides and otherwise, that will occur if we continue to  fail to do our job, which is, I would submit, a part of our oath.   Our oath is not to protect and defend people who want to break into  this country illegally. That is not the people for whom and to whom we  took an oath.   I have heard from teachers who were saying: My heart breaks for these  groups of kids that are thrown into our classrooms that don't speak  English. But my heart also breaks for the American citizens and legal  residents who are not getting the education anymore that they would  have gotten had we not had so many illegal immigrants thrown into the  classroom. We can't take care of both. We can't teach them both because  if we try to concentrate on the people who don't speak English that are  illegally here--and I am hearing from teachers saying, we are getting  them constantly.   We are getting more people, and we are not prejudiced against  anybody, but we can't teach them and the students who are legally here  because they can't learn at the same level. So what happens? The  American citizens, the legal residents, people who are legally here,  they are not getting the education that they would get otherwise.   I would just submit, before I yield again to my friend from Florida,  this is a compassionate country. It is one of the things I am proud  about. But I ask the question, Mr. Speaker: What is more compassionate?  Is it to allow people to flood into America illegally when we know 37  percent of the girls are being sexually assaulted, normally multiple  times; 17 percent of the young boys are being sexually molested on the  way, as they are drawn toward the United States to come in illegally;  and every day another girl is pulled into sex trafficking that would  not be if our border weren't so porous.   Is that compassionate or is it more compassionate, looking at the  situation--and I love Mexico. They have got some of the most beautiful  places in the world. My wife and I honeymooned there 40 years ago and  we loved it. I got certified in an hour to scuba dive. It was a great  certification process, and I loved scuba diving. It was just beautiful.  They have got incredible beauty in Mexico and in Central America.   They have more natural resources than most countries in the world.  They have got actually a better location in Mexico and Central America  for commerce than North America does. They are between two continents,  two oceans. They ought to be one of the very top economies in the  world. There is one reason they are not, and that is the corruption.   Where does the corruption come from? It comes from the tens of  billions of dollars that Americans pour into the drug cartels. Because  they are getting money for people coming up here from human  trafficking; they are getting money from sex trafficking; they are  getting money from the drug trafficking that is going on in the U.S.,  and it is funding corruption.   We have got places where the police won't step up because they know  they will get killed like the last ones that stepped up. It ought to be  a top economy in the world. It ought to have a burgeoning, huge middle  class that is thriving and doing so well. It is not because we have a  porous border, and we are funding the corruption in Mexico.    They have got some of the hardest working people in the world. I know  some. It would be so much better for the people of Mexico if we would  secure our border, cut off the money to the drug cartels, and let them  become what they could be if we weren't funding the corruption through  our porous border.   So I ask my friend from Florida if he would agree that the  compassionate thing to do is to secure our border, if our only goal was  to help all of the people in Mexico.    Please.    It is worse.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend, Representative Yoho  from Florida, not just for his eloquent comments, but also for his  friendship and his deep, abiding love for America.   There are three rows of names on each of these, and these are just a  part of the people who have been killed by people who came into the  United States illegally.   I would like to go back to the place I honeymooned with my wife, one  of the prettiest places on Earth, Las Hadas.                                time  1415    For our 25th anniversary we went to Cancun. But I am not comfortable  going back now. I read recently near Cancun cartels had some people  killed. I want Mexico to return to being a safe place to go. There was  a time when the cartels would not do anything like murder around any of  the tourist attractions because tourism was so important to Mexico.  That has gone by the way. The corruption is terrible. People who stand  up many times pay with their lives or family members' lives.   I have heard people here on the floor say that this is a manufactured  crisis and that, of course, the megaphone that is used in places like  CNN, MSNBC, and others repeat the same exact talking points. I don't  have any talking points here from the President, the White House, or  from Republicans. This is just coming from the heart and from the  facts.   We are in trouble. This little experiment in self-government our  Founders knew would not go on forever. They knew it would go on for  only so long as we could keep it. As Ben Franklin said:         It is a Republic, madam, if you can keep it.    I know a lot of my friends across the aisle think they are acting  from compassion when they say: let's leave these borders wide open, and  let's do a blanket amnesty for everybody who can get here.   But as someone who has worked in our legal system, our judicial  system, much of my adult life, I do believe with all its faults--and  there are plenty--it is the best legal system the world has ever known.   One of those legal doctrines that has evolved over the years because  it is fair, it has been deemed to be fair by Americans, I think it  exists in every State, it has a strange name for a doctrine, attractive  nuisance.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans know inherently or through education that  if you have something like a swimming pool or a really cool playground  and you don't put a fence around it, then if someone comes and is hurt  in that swimming pool or drowns or falls in the playground, or is  killed or hurt in some way, the landowner that refused to put up a  fence or a wall or something to keep people from getting to that  attraction are held financially liable, and they have to pay  financially to those who have suffered, or, in the case of a death, to  the family of those who have suffered. That has been considered one of  the great doctrines of our legal system.   But thankfully for people here in the House and Senate, we haven't  applied that sound doctrine to the fact that America has become a lure,  a draw, and it is drawing people by the thousands and tens of thousands  and hundreds of thousands. Some die on the way here or when they get  here. Some are pulled into sex trafficking, their lives are destroyed.   I have been there so many times when it is not on their lists of  questions to ask, but many times they ask: How much did you pay to get  into this country?   The response was 5, 6, 7, $8,000.   Where did you get that kind of money?   Well, $1,000 here, $1,500 there.   Where are you getting the rest from?   The drug cartels are who get the money.   They are going to let me work it off when I get where I am going.   I have watched them hand over different addresses. 2, 3 in the  morning, while the Border Patrol is coming down and asking the  questions, getting the information; they pass around a different  address.   I have seen them say, basically: Do you want to claim this child?   No, you claim the child.   Mr. Speaker, you don't know how many are unaccompanied and who are  accompanied by people who they shouldn't be.   Let's stop luring people to their demise or to their despair. Let's  continue to be the most generous country in the world when it comes to  allowing people in legally, as we do. As my friend, Congressman Yoho,  pointed out, over 1 million visas legally a year. Nobody else does  that. China? Russia? Nobody does that. We do.   But let's make sure it is legal; that it is not MS-13 gang members  who are going to repeatedly stab a young boy or girl and rape women.  Let's make sure that it is not drug cartels sending people in.   I hear people say: well, there is not that much drugs that comes  across our border on the south.   Mr. Speaker, I have been there too many times, and the Border Patrol  will tell you, down there at 2 and 3 in the morning: look, they just  sent over 20 in a raft.   You hear it on the radio. They call all the Border Patrolmen in. They  start processing the people, and as the Border Patrolmen will tell you,  that is when they send in the illegal drugs.   The two guys who said that we got pinned down a while ago by a 50- caliber--there is no mistake about that 50-caliber when it is fired-- and we were hunkered down behind the tanks wondering what high value  individual or what big drug shipment are they bringing across right now  when they know we don't have anything that stops a 50-caliber.   Look, the drugs are coming in. We have been there when we used  thermal technology--I say, we, it was the Texas Department of Public  Safety that gave that information by radio to the Border Patrol. They  float up a balloon. They use their thermal technology.   They say: oh, yeah, we see those two or three people here. Apparently  they are carrying drugs, some big thing they are bringing in. Here are  17, 18 people, they are not carrying anything; they are clearly just  trying to come in illegally.   They would find the people that we would tell them about as they  float up the balloons and get to zoom in. In the end, they said: okay,  we have got all the people. We are processing all the groups that you  saw that appear to be just trying to come in illegally. But the ones  who appeared to be bringing in drugs, they knew some little way and  they got away, so we didn't catch any of those guys.   That goes on every day, every night. Who dies from those illegal  drugs coming in?   The compassionate thing for Mexico, for Central America, and for the  people to whom we owe our oath, is to secure the border. Build a  barrier where we have got to have it to secure the border, and let's  stop Americans dying unnecessarily, so we can save the righteous  indignation in this room for those who have died because we did not do  our job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H517]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
