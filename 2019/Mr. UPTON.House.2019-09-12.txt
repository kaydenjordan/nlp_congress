 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. I served  as the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and now  serve as the top Republican on the Energy Subcommittee.   In those years, I helped develop, promote, and implement a North  American energy independent plan, and it includes all of the above-- yes, renewable energy as well.   I can remember the gas lines. I can remember paying higher prices for  natural gas. I can remember $4 and $5 per gallon gas prices. And I can  remember sending $1 billion every day to the Middle East.    I smiled this last weekend when I filled up for $2.25. I smile now  when I know that we can export rather than import oil from places that  may not be so friendly to the United States.   So if this bill passed, as well as the other two that passed  yesterday and somehow became enacted into law, we have this thing  called supply and demand. And guess what? Our consumers will pay much  higher gas prices and we will lose out. So I would urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
