 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I hope this is the last time that we do this. Just last  week, we watched members of the January 6th Select Committee criticize  the DOJ for not jailing their political opponents fast enough.   Now the committee is trying to refer two more of President Trump's  advisers to the DOJ for criminal prosecution. The same DOJ, by the way,  that has slandered concerned parents as domestic terrorists; a DOJ  overseen by a President who said President Trump should be prosecuted.   So let's be clear, we aren't voting today to rename a post office.  So, please, let's be honest with ourselves. A vote to hold Dan Scavino  and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress is a vote to put them in jail  for a year. Neither of these men deserve this. The party line isn't a  good enough excuse today. Disliking their politics isn't an excuse.   Mr. Scavino has two boys. He is a good dad. He doesn't deserve this.  His boys definitely don't deserve this. So before we vote today, I have  got to ask, could anyone here explain to those boys why their dad  deserves to be behind bars for a year?   Mr. Scavino grew up in a working-class family in New York City. He is  a former caddy who worked his way up to the White House through hard  work and determination. Mr. Scavino lived the American Dream. Now,  thanks to the select committee, he is living an authoritarian  nightmare.   The select committee will say that it is Mr. Scavino's fault for  refusing to cooperate. That is simply not true. Mr. Scavino asked time  and again for the committee to follow the rule of law and provide him  with a narrow and specific legislative purpose for the information that  they were seeking. He asked, ``How is what you want from me pertinent  to your investigation?'' And they refused to explain.   But remember what they said last week. The January 6th Committee must  enforce its subpoenas. But contempt is not enforcement; it is  punishment. Contempt won't get the committee any information. Only the  court can do that. But they don't want to go to the judiciary. They  don't want neutral arbitration. They want political punishment.   The select committee has never been interested in factfinding. In  fact,   Jim Jordan and I were both blocked from sitting on the  committee because we promised to fully investigate the security failure  at the Capitol. The Democrat leaders don't want that. They claim they  blocked us for being too partisan.   Meanwhile, the committee's lead staffer signed his name to a false  letter calling the Hunter Biden laptop Russian disinformation.  Apparently, lying to undermine democracy is a key qualification for  employment of this committee.   If the January 6th Committee gets its way, Congress will have  referred four former Trump officials for prosecution in under 6 months,  another record for the 117th Congress.   The select committee aims to do two things: silence legitimate  questions about the breakdown of security at the Capitol and punish  their political opponents. It is that simple.   Dan Scavino is accused of listening to his boss, the former Commander  in Chief, who told him to ``invoke all applicable privileges and  immunities.'' Today's vote is not about wrongdoing, and it isn't about  anybody's character, no matter what they say.   Today's vote is about the character of this House. It is about  abusing the seat of our democracy to attack American democracy. The  question is, do we live in a country where you can go to jail for  working for the wrong politician? Would you want to live in that  country? The question is, will you help create that country? Because I  think we have had a pretty good thing going for the last 240 years, and  that is exactly why I urge all of my colleagues  [[Page H4373]]  to vote ``no'' on this resolution today. Madam Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis.)  [[Page H4376]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Jackson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it might feel really good today for my opponents on the  other side of the aisle. It might feel really good in a vindictive sort  of way, to vote to put their political opponents behind bars. That  might feel really good for my opponents across the aisle.   But I guarantee you, the history will not look back kindly on those  actions in the years to come. I guarantee it. It couldn't be anymore  un-American what they want to do today, to vote to put two men behind  bars purely because they disagree with their politics and the man that  they worked for.   I can't think of a bigger reason for my opponents to vote ``no'' on  such an un-American resolution. I urge all of my colleagues to vote  ``no'' and do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
