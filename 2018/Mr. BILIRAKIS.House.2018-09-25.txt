 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Brooks, who  is doing an outstanding job. We both served on the House Committee on  Homeland Security, and we chaired a subcommittee prior to Energy and  Commerce. She is doing an outstanding job.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6378, the  Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act.   From storm-related injuries and illnesses to delivery and logistics  issues, last year's historically costly hurricane season tested the  mettle of our health delivery system, and I am pleased to see children,  seniors, and other at-risk patient communities being addressed in this  reauthorization.   This bill also encourages innovative partnerships and coalitions,  like the Nicklaus Children's Hospital and the Florida International  University, to continue to develop novel approaches to healthcare  delivery and, ultimately, save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of  legislation.
