 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy) for the purpose of the majority leader telling us in-depth  the schedule for the weeks to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  those remarks.   I want to join him in thanking our colleague, Brian Cooper. I am not  sure, Brian, that I adopt the sentiments of the majority leader with  respect to what Mr. Thomas could and could not do. Apparently he chose  not to, and that is good.   But, Brian Cooper, we want to thank you for three and a half decades  of service to this House; three and a half decades of service to this  House in a role that most people, including Members of this House,  would not recognize, but that is critically important to the good  management and flow of the people's business through this House.   As the majority leader referenced, he will continue to root for the  Baltimore Orioles because he is from Baltimore. He is a Marylander, and  we are very proud of him. I want to thank him for his service and wish  him the very best in the days ahead.   I now will go to the schedule.                                time  1200    By law, under the Budget Control Act, a budget is supposed to be  brought to this floor on April 15. The majority leader would quickly  observe that neither Democrats nor Republicans have always met that  deadline. However, we are unusually late in the budget process, in my  view, and despite months of promising to return to regular order, we  have not yet done so as it relates to the budget, and the budget has  not been marked up in committee, Mr. Speaker.   Monday marked the statutory date by which the Appropriations  Committee no longer has to wait to bring bills to the floor of the  House because the majority has failed to meet its obligation to pass a  budget on time.   Now, again, I want to quickly note that both parties have failed to  meet that deadline in times past, but I cannot remember us being as  late in the session in getting to the appropriations process, because  there really has been no direction from the administration as to what  their budget priorities should be, would be, other than the so-called  ``skinny budget'' that was sent down, which, in my view, almost every  Member of Congress thought was a totally unrealistic, unadoptable, and  unworthy budget priority document; and if it were to be adopted, the  security of the United States, both abroad and at home, would be put at  substantial risk.   So, Mr. Majority Leader, can you provide some indication? I know it  is not on the floor next week.   And I want to say that I join with the majority leader. The issue of  human trafficking is one of the critical issues that confronts us, as a  country, and the global community. It puts millions of young women and  young men at risk--and not so young men and women at risk--on a daily  basis. It is appropriate that we deal with this issue. Hopefully, we  will deal with it, as the majority leader said, in a bipartisan fashion  and that we will produce more effective ways to stop and to hold  accountable those who put human beings at risk by human slavery.   But can the gentleman tell me when the Budget Committee will mark up  a budget and when we will have such a budget considered on the floor?   I yield to my friend.    I thank the gentleman.   With respect to the appropriations process, as the gentleman knows,  there are 12 discrete appropriation bills dealing with national  security and domestic spending. Can the gentleman tell  [[Page H4376]]  me whether or not we still intend to consider, on a timely basis,  discretely, that is, one at a time, the 12 appropriation bills?   I don't think any of them have been marked up as of this point in  time. Obviously, not having a budget would preclude that from  happening. I understand that. But, as the gentleman knows and I know  from experience of serving on the appropriations process, frankly, it  was at the beginning of this month, historically, that we would start  to mark up appropriation bills, with the intent to use much of June and  July for the purposes of passing appropriations bills so that we might  send them to the Senate for consideration and have some chance of  getting them done prior to the expiration of the fiscal year on  September 30.   Does the gentleman anticipate that we will be considering separately  the 12 appropriation bills between now and the August break?   I yield to my friend.    Well, I hope that we do, in fact, get that done.   Now, Mr. Leader, I was shocked yesterday to learn that the process  that, from my perspective and our side's perspective, was  extraordinarily accelerated, undermining the opportunity for careful  and thorough consideration, the bill that is known as the American  Health Care Act, or otherwise known as the bill to attempt to repeal  the Affordable Care Act. That bill, as the gentleman knows, was  introduced on March 6. It had not a single hearing and was marked up  less than 2 full days later in the Ways and Means Committee, on March  8. It was marked up on March 8 and 9 in the Energy and Commerce  Committee, in the Budget Committee on March 16, in the Rules Committee  on March 22, and brought to the floor with a CBO score on March 23. In  other words, in my view, Mr. Speaker, it moved so quickly that no one  could have given it thoughtful consideration. In fact, Mr. Speaker, on  March 24, that bill was brought to the floor, was subjected to some  debate, and then was pulled. The judgment was made that, apparently, it  was not ready for prime time.   That bill was then brought back to the floor some 2-plus weeks, about  2 weeks later, on Thursday, May 4 of this year. It was passed on a  Thursday, notwithstanding the fact it had not been noted for  consideration on Thursday at the beginning of the week or in the week  prior. It passed on a vote of 217-213, with a significant number of  Republicans voting against it and a significant number of Republicans  who voted for it saying ``no, I haven't read the bill'' in response to  inquiries from the press.   That afternoon, Mr. Speaker, there were buses out in front of the  Capitol to take my Republican colleagues down to the White House to  cheer its passage, an accomplishment of what our Republican colleagues  had pledged for 6 years.   Mr. Speaker, you can imagine my shock, chagrin, and surprise when I  learned yesterday that bill has not gone to the Senate. Apparently, it  has gone from one chair to maybe the other chair in the desks before  me. It has been held, Mr. Speaker. It has been held because there was  no CBO score to ensure that, in fact, it complied with the rules.   A lot of talk about regular order, Mr. Speaker.   So the bill that was cheered at the White House and the President  saying ``I'm so glad this passed,'' apparently, may not have passed  this House in a form that is consistent with the rules. And so, my  colleagues, I want you to know that you may think you have passed the  bill, but it is still here 2 weeks later.   I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, why we couldn't have waited for a CBO  score, other than the political imperative of going home and having  Members be able to say, ``We passed the bill.''   Well, it is still here, folks. It is still within the bosom of the  House, warmly embraced, aging, unfortunately, not to perfection.   And so, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the majority leader: When might we  pass this bill? Is the bill going to have another hearing? Are we going  to wait for the CBO score? And will another vote be necessary to,  again, confirm the 217-213 votes?   I will not ask you whether or not you think you still have 217 votes,  but let me ask you: When might this bill be considered again on this  floor? And when might this bill go to the United States Senate, as  everybody thought it had on the 4th of May?   I yield to my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker.    But he got the point, I am sure.    Mr. Speaker, we have had a similar conversation before,  and the majority leader would love to rely on the hearings that were  held before this bill that we passed was introduced. The 113 hearings  were on the repeal. This bill, as surely the majority leader knows and  Members who voted on it know, was not repealed. It does not repeal.   Now, it is said that the gentleman is correct that the insurance  industry has been very badly roiled, and confidence in the marketplace  has been very badly undermined by this administration since its first  day in office, and badly undermined by the Republicans' continued  attempts to repeal, and passage of repeal legislation that didn't  become law, and so insurers have, in fact, lost confidence that the  marketplace will be stable, an absolutely critical component of pricing  their product correctly.   The administration continues, as does the House itself and the  Republican leadership in the Senate, to undermine the confidence that  there will be a market. So, yes, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader is  correct. The insurance market is not as stable. But almost everybody  who speaks to that--and there is a Los Angeles Times story today,  relatively lengthy on that--in terms of what steps the administration  has taken from the very beginning, starting with the IRS, don't worry  about the mandate. Don't worry about the fact you have insurance.   It is like the automobile people saying, don't worry about having  automobile insurance; there is going to be no penalty. Well, if that  was the case, I bet you a lot of people would not have automobile  insurance, and if they hit you, you would be exposed to the expense  yourself.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader says he wants to follow the  rules. They want to follow regular order, and, of course, they will do  that. My, my, my.   Mr. Speaker, on May 4 of this month, why did we not have such a CBO  score?   He says we didn't send it because the rule will not allow us unless  we have a CBO score.   Frankly, I think there are some additional reasons because they are  not sure that they are complying with the Byrd rule in the United  States Senate, and they have got to see. So they may have to pass this  again, to which the majority leader did not address himself.   But there was no reason not to wait other than politics, other than  to have those buses go down to the Capitol and cheer one another. They  had no idea what CBO is going to come up with next week. So they did  not wait, consistent with the rules. We should have had a score when we  passed the bill. But that was not convenient for the politics of  repeal.   Now, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, has not told me when we are  going to consider that bill again or if we are going to need to  consider that bill again. And perhaps the honest answer is the majority  leader does not have that knowledge as to whether he is going to have  to bring that bill to the floor again because he is going to need the  CBO score to make that determination. I understand that. And we should  have waited, Mr. Speaker, not rushed to judgment.   He talks about hearings. There were no hearings on this bill. One  reason there were no hearings on these bills is because my Republican  colleagues have been having town meetings, and they are hearing about  the public's thoughts about their bill. And some of them are not having  town meetings because they don't want to hear any more than they wanted  to have hearings here in the House to hear what the public thought.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that the majority leader will be able  to, perhaps at some point in time in the relatively near future, give  us a clear picture as to when we may either consider this bill again or  when we are going to send it to the United States Senate; flawed,  though, it may be.   Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to yield to my friend, the majority  leader, if he would like to say something further. If not, I will yield  back.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  listened to his comments with interest. I want to touch on a number of  comments he made, however.   First of all, in a very partisan vote from 3 a.m. in the morning  until 6 a.m. in the morning, my Republican colleagues passed a bill in  a partisan fashion--there were a few Democrats; not many--that passed  part D prescription drugs for seniors.   We voted against that. And then we took the majority. And what did we  do, Mr. Speaker? We acted in a way to ensure that the part D  prescription drug package that the Republicans had passed in the  previous Congress did, in fact, work; and it is a success today because  we did that.   That is exactly the opposite of what our Republican colleagues did,  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the  Affordable Care Act, as my friend knows and polling now shows that over  55 percent of Americans believe that the Affordable Care Act ought to  be kept; and 75 percent of them, three out of four Americans, believe  we ought to fix the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it.   That has not changed, however, the Republicans' attempt and rhetoric  to repeal. Now, there were a number of things that the Republicans did,  contrary to what we did with respect to the prescription drug bill for  seniors, to undermine and create this situation of which the majority  leader speaks where there are some insurance companies that have pulled  out, that are not doing as well as they should have and we wanted them  to have.   One thing, many Republican Governors refuse to join the Medicaid  expansion program, adversely affecting millions of Americans.   Secondly, they did not find the risk corridors. We knew when we  established this problem that there was going to be a very tough time  in making valid judgments on what costs were going to be two years into  this program. We did not fund it. The CO-OPs also did not receive the  support that was contemplated by the statute.   The cost-sharing subsidies the administration has put at risk. Now,  we were assured just before the bill passed that: Oh, no, we are going  to pay for the cost-sharing subsidies.   But the Republicans, Mr. Speaker, filed suit, and the court said: Oh,  no, you have to appropriate those moneys on the cost-sharing subsidies.   The majority leader knows--certainly everybody on the Energy and  Commerce knows, and every Member ought to know--without those  subsidies, the insurance companies will have mispriced their product,  for deductibles and copays, in particular.                                time  1230    That, Mr. Speaker, is what I speak of, in terms of the actions that  have been taken over the last 6 years to undermine the confidence of  the marketplace. Everybody knows that confidence is an important factor  in any marketplace.   I am sure we are going to debate this again. Mr. Speaker, again, I  would simply ask: Is this bill coming back to the House? Will we expect  another vote on it?   The CBO report is due next week. I believe that if, in fact, we are  going to schedule that, we ought to at least be given notice that that  either is or may be a piece of legislation that will be on the floor  next week, prior to our break for Memorial Day.   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
