 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  several Pittsburgh athletes. The first is a young man named Roberto  Clemente.   Roberto Clemente was a tremendous player for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He had an 18-year career with the Pirates--3,000 hits, 240 home runs,  two-time World Series champion, and he had an arm that was incredible.  Nobody in the Major Leagues, after getting a single to right field,  ever made a wide turn at first base. Clemente would throw them out,  throw it behind them.   As we remember him as a baseball player--and this is his last hit,  which was a double where he got his 3,000th hit--one of the things I  really admired about Roberto Clemente was not the fact that he was a  great athlete, that he was a great leader, but that he was a great  humanitarian.   Roberto died on December 31, 1972. That is 50 years ago this New  Year's Eve. He was on a mission trip to deliver aid to the victims of  an earthquake in Nicaragua. Mr. Clemente was only 38 years old.  [[Page H9920]]    I think the thing that we need to remember as Americans is that while  people have different talents, their commitment is always to their  fellow man.   What I remember about Roberto Clemente was just how involved he was  in Puerto Rico and in the islands because he knew they needed help.   On that day in 1972, in a DC-3 airplane loaded with medical supplies  and food supplies, Clemente took off on a trip that would never reach  the end he desired. The cargo shifted in the airplane, and the plane  went into a spin and dove into the ocean.   We lost Roberto Clemente that day. We didn't just lose a great  baseball player and a Hall of Fame player. We lost somebody else. On  the back side of this, this is, perhaps, the picture--if you were to  ask Roberto Clemente what uniform he liked the most, it would have been  a toss-up between the Pittsburgh Pirates and U.S. Marines uniforms.   Roberto Clemente served in the Marine Corps from 1959 to 1962. In  that time period, he was on the All-Star team and won a World Series  twice, but again, it was his efforts to help his fellow human beings  that we remember the most.   A tragic loss for us, but also something for all young people to look  at and say: I want to be like him.   Also, Dr. Joyce spoke earlier today about the loss of Pittsburgh  Steelers running back and Hall of Famer Franco Harris.                                time  1245    Madam Speaker, I had the blessing of actually knowing Mr. Harris, he  was a very imposing figure and he was a phenomenal athlete. When we  think of Franco Harris, this is a picture of him. This is the last  tackler that was trying to get him. He picked up a pass that ricocheted  off a guy name Frenchie Fuqua and ran it into the end zone. The  Pittsburgh Steelers ended up winning their first championship game that  day.   In addition to his years in the NFL and in addition to the years of  being an idol in the Pittsburgh community, Franco Harris was something  else. Franco Harris was very approachable. Franco Harris always had  time for those who needed something.   Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said today that Franco always said yes to  helping our food banks, blood drives, and youth sports leagues. He  loved this city and this city loved him. His memory will always be a  blessing for the people of Pittsburgh.   When you think of these two athletes--not only their great prowess on  the field of play, but their commitment to their fellow human beings-- the thing that we really have to sort out and dwell on, especially at  this time of the year, is that these are incredible people who did  incredible things both on the field of athletics, but more importantly  in the city in which they lived and for the people that were around  them.   Roberto Clemente died in a mercy flight to Nicaragua and Franco died  this morning just days before the Pittsburgh Steelers were going to  retire his number and honor the 50th anniversary of the ``Immaculate  Reception.''                            ____________________
