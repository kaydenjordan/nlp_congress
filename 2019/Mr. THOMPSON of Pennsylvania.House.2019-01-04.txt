 Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the  second day of the 116th Congress, to represent Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District.   The 15th Congressional District encompasses 14 counties, 24 percent  of the land mass of Pennsylvania, and includes all of Armstrong,  Cameron, Clarion, Clearfield, Elk, Forest, Indiana, Jefferson, McKean,  Venango, and Warren counties. It includes parts of Butler, Cambria, and  Centre counties, including my hometown of Howard.   Madam Speaker, I take great pride in my service to the people of the  15th Congressional District, and I work hard to earn their trust, help  solve their problems, and be a diligent Representative.   When not in Washington, I spend my days on the road in the district,  traveling to meetings and events. I work to connect with my  constituents and truly be a voice for each community I represent.   Madam Speaker, I also appreciate the opportunity to speak here, as I  did 219 days in the 115th Congress, to be a strong voice for the  citizens of the 15th District.   The challenges before us remain great, but it is my hope that we will  tackle these challenges head-on. It is the American way.                            ____________________
