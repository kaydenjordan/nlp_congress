 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  career of Robert J. Halstead, or as most of us know him, Bob. To some,  this name might sound familiar. He has appeared before Congress on a  number of occasions on behalf of the State of Nevada to provide expert  witness testimony on nuclear waste storage and transportation. His name  graces the archives at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the  Department of Energy, and he has been a fierce and dedicated partner in  the fight against the Yucca Mountain project.   In 1988, the year after the ``screw Nevada bill'' recklessly  designated Yucca Mountain as the Nation's sole high-level nuclear waste  repository site, Bob brought his knowledge of Federal radioactive waste  programs and activities to help arm Nevada in its fight against the  broken and misguided processes that led to the Yucca Mountain  designation. At the time, he may not have known how long of a fight he  was signing up for, but Bob never looked back.   He threw himself into helping Nevada, learning every aspect of the  complicated and far-fetched license application, analyzing the  geography of the site, and leaving no stone unturned when reviewing  proposed transportation routes that would ship one of the most  dangerous materials known to man across the country to Nevada.   For more than 30 years, he helped guide the State on nuclear  transportation matters, poured over environmental impact statements,  submitted contentions to the Yucca Mountain application, and  represented the State in technical proceedings that involved the  proposed repository. These are just a few of the things we have to  thank him for.   Since 2011, Bob served as the executive director of the Nevada Agency  for Nuclear Projects, always making himself available to assist the  Governor. Before coming to the Senate, I had the pleasure of working  alongside Bob during my time as the Nevada Attorney General. No matter  the day or hour, Bob always made time to review materials and provide  well-informed, robust responses not just to me, but to my staff.   It was comforting knowing someone with his exceptional experience was  at the helm, guiding the State on an issue that is so important to  Nevadans and trying to right the wrongs of the Federal Government's  reckless mismanagement of nuclear waste.   Just last year, when the State learned of secret weapons-grade  plutonium and mischaracterized waste shipments having been received at  the Nevada National Security Site, Bob once again proved how  instrumental he is to the State of Nevada. His institutional knowledge  of Nevada's nuclear history and depth of experience provided the State  with an unmatched resource as it rose to challenge the shipments.   Bob has been a vital contributor and colleague; and as he embarks on  his well-deserved retirement, I want to share my deepest appreciation  and gratitude for his decades-long commitment to helping Nevadans as  they have worked to bring fairness, reason, and science back to the  repository site designation process.   It is my understanding that Bob will be returning to his home in  Wisconsin, where he will live with his wife, Margaret. Bob is looking  forward to having more time with his two grown children and finally  having time for one of his favorite past times: fishing.   As he casts a line in one of the many beautiful lakes Wisconsin has  to offer, I hope he knows how much the State of Nevada and I appreciate  the sacrifices he has made to protect the safety of Nevadans and the  time he has dedicated to one of our State's greatest fights.                            ____________________
