 Mr. President, the United States' mineral security has  really become our Achilles' heel. It is a significant threat to our  economy, to our competitiveness, to our security, and to our  geopolitical leverage, all at the same time.   We know that mineral demand is skyrocketing, and yet it is harder  than ever to produce minerals here in this country. So what we have  done is that we have turned to imports to fill the gaps in our supply.   We are seeking, through this amendment, to put some limited  assistance on the table to make sure that projects for the most  critical minerals can move forward in a timely manner. That is what my  amendment does for cobalt and for nickel.   Right now, we import 76 percent of our cobalt, 48 percent of our  nickel, but demand is growing so dramatically for both as a result of  EVs, of energy storage systems, and other clean technologies. So what  we are seeking to do with this is repurpose $400 million for States to  implement energy efficiency codes to instead ensure that domestic  nickel and cobalt projects can advance.
