 Mr. President, earlier this month, 16 Democratic Senators  introduced a resolution calling for President Biden to forgive $50,000  of Federal student loan debt per borrower--$50,000.   There is no question that student loan debt is a problem for many  Americans. College costs have risen to unrealistically high levels, and  many students or their parents take out unrealistic amounts of debt in  response. But the answer to this problem is not to have the President  or Congress simply step in and forgive a large chunk of student loan  debt.   To start with, Democrats' plan is incredibly, fundamentally unfair.  Right now, there are individuals around this country who have just paid  off the last of their student loans. They have been working hard,  making payments, sometimes for a couple of years, sometimes for a  couple of decades, as was the case with me. What happens to these  individuals if the President steps in and forgives $50,000 of student  debt? Well, I will tell you what happens--nothing. These individuals  who have worked hard for years to pay off their debt will see no  benefit from the Democrats' blanket loan forgiveness. Meanwhile, other  Americans who have made no more than a month or two of payments will  see their student loans entirely disappear. That is incredibly unfair.  In addition to being unfair, forgiving student loan debt does  absolutely nothing to address the problems that created this debt  crisis in the first place. In fact, the Democrats' solution is likely  to make things worse.    What possible incentive will students have to take the responsible  approach to borrowing if they think the Federal Government will step in  and solve their debt problem? What incentive will colleges have to  restrain tuition growth if they think they can rely on the Federal  Government to subsidize their students' tuition fees through loan  forgiveness?   Forgiving $50,000 in student loans would also set a terrible  precedent on the sanctity of contracts. While it may at times be ill- advised, students freely enter into the agreements they make when they  take out a loan. Should we really be teaching that agreements and  contracts mean nothing, that people can incur debt and then not have to  pay it off? And about that ``not paying it off,'' the phrase ``student  loan forgiveness'' carries with it a suggestion that these debts will  just disappear, that $50,000 can be wiped off each American's slate and  vanish into the ether.   But, of course, we know that is not the case either. This is money  students have borrowed from the Federal Government, and if the  Government doesn't get that money back, the Government will be facing  an unexpected debt.   Now, some people, especially some Democrats, tend to talk as if the  Government draws on an unlimited pot of money, but, of course, we know  that is not true. Government funds aren't anywhere close to being  unlimited, and Government coffers are not filled from a pot of gold at  the end of the rainbow. They are filled by taxpayer dollars, and,  sooner or later, it will be taxpayers who foot the bill for any loan  forgiveness program, including the many taxpayers who opted not to  attend college or chose a debt-free way of doing so. There are a lot of  Americans out there who saved up to get a degree or went part-time to  avoid incurring debt. Are they really supposed to foot the bill for  other Americans' student loans?   While you might think that Democrats' plan is largely targeted to  low-income or disadvantaged individuals, that is not actually the case.  Under the Democrats' plan, an American making $20,000 and an American  making $120,000 would receive the same loan relief. In fact, since more  loan dollars are held by those in higher income brackets, higher income  Americans could end up benefiting the most. And that brings up another  thing that we need to remember.   Yes, a number of Americans carry a significant amount of student loan  debt, but some of those Americans have incurred that debt for a career  that will bring significant financial rewards.   Plus, a substantial portion of student loan debt is not for  undergraduate degrees but for graduate and professional degrees. Under  the Democrats' student loan forgiveness proposal, taxpayers could be  subsidizing not just bachelor's degrees but master's degrees and Ph.D.  degrees, as well as law and medical degrees.   Instead of putting taxpayers on the hook for billions, we should be  focused on exploring ways to drive down education costs and educate  students on the dangers of taking on excessive debt.   We should also be highlighting affordable education options like our  Nation's community and technical colleges. These colleges, like the  outstanding institutions we have in South Dakota, provide students with  associate's degrees, certificates, apprenticeships, opportunities to  learn a trade, and more.   There are also things we could do to help students pay off loans  without putting taxpayers on the hook for such massive amounts of  money. In December, Congress passed a 5-year legislation that I  introduced with Senator Warner to allow employers to help employees  repay their loans. Our Employer Participation and Repayment Act amends  the Educational Assistance Program to permit employers to make tax-free  payments on their employees' student loans.   Previously, employers could make tax-free contributions to their  employees' tuition if their employees were currently taking classes,  but they  [[Page S840]]  couldn't provide tax-free contributions to help employees with  education debts that they had already incurred. Our bill allows them to  make tax-free contributions to help with employees' already existing  student loan debt. That is a win-win situation. It is a win for  employees who get help paying off their student loans, and it is a win  for employers who have a new option for attracting and retaining  talented workers.   Our bill is not a silver bullet, but it will certainly help ease the  pain of paying back student loans for a number of young Americans. I am  pleased it was enacted into law for a 5-year period, and I hope  Congress will act to make it permanent.   Another big thing we could do is make sure that graduates have access  to good-paying jobs. This is key to enabling people to pay off their  debt, and we should resolve to build on the economic progress that we  had made prepandemic and focus on policies that will allow our economy  to grow and to thrive.   High college costs and student debt are a problem, but blanket loan  forgiveness is not the answer. I hope that President Biden will resist  Democratic calls to put taxpayers on the hook for literally billions  and billions of dollars in student loans.   I yield the floor.

A bill to improve Federal efforts with respect to the  prevention of maternal mortality, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 411         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Mothers and Offspring       Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act'' or the ``MOMMA's       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 4,000,000       women give birth, about 700 women suffer fatal complications       during pregnancy, while giving birth or during the postpartum       period, and about 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-      related complications.        (2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as a proxy to       measure the overall health of a population. While the infant       mortality rate in the United States has reached its lowest       point, the risk of death for women in the United States       during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period is       higher than such risk in many other high-income countries.       The estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000       live births) for the 48 contiguous States and Washington,       D.C. increased from 14.5 percent in 2000 to 17.3 in 2017. The       United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising       maternal mortality rate.        (3) The National Vital Statistics System of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention has found that in 2018, there       were 17.4 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in       the United States. This ratio is more than double that of       most other high-income countries.        (4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent of maternal       deaths in the United States are preventable.        (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically       for women by race and ethnicity. There are about 13 deaths       per 100,000 live births for White women, 40.8 deaths per       100,000 live births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 29.7       deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/Alaskan       Native women. While maternal mortality disparately impacts       Black women, this urgent public health crisis traverses race,       ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational background, and       geography.        (6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black women are       about 3 times more likely to die from causes related to       pregnancy and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White       women, which is one of the most disconcerting racial       disparities in public health. This disparity widens in       certain cities and States across the country.        (7) According to the National Center for Health Statistics       of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the       maternal mortality rate heightens with age, as women 40 and       older die at a rate of 81.9 per 100,000 births compared to       10.6 per 100,000 for women under 25. This translates to women       over 40 being 7.7 times more likely to die compared to their       counterparts under 25 years of age.        (8) The COVID-19 pandemic risks exacerbating the maternal       health crisis. A recent study of the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention suggests that pregnant women are at a       significantly higher risk for severe outcomes, including       death, from COVID-19 as compared to non-pregnant women. The       COVID-19 pandemic has also decreased access to prenatal and       postpartum care.        (9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) through (8)       are of major concern to researchers, academics, members of       the business community, and providers across the obstetric       continuum represented by organizations such as--        (A) the American College of Nurse-Midwives;        (B) the American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists;        (C) the American Medical Association;        (D) the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and       Neonatal Nurses;        (E) the Black Mamas Matter Alliance;        (F) the Black Women's Health Imperative;        (G) the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative;        (H) EverThrive Illinois;        (I) the Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative;        (J) the March of Dimes;        (K) the National Association of Certified Professional       Midwives;        (L) the National Birth Equity Collaborative;        (M) the National Partnership for Women & Families;        (N) the National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association;        (O) the Preeclampsia Foundation;        (P) the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine; and        (Q) the What To Expect Project.        (10) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions,       cardiomyopathy, infection or sepsis, embolism, mental health       conditions (including substance use disorder), hypertensive       disorders, stroke and cerebrovascular accidents, and       anesthesia complications are the predominant medical causes       of maternal-related deaths and complications. Most of these       conditions are largely preventable or manageable. Even when       these conditions are not preventable, mortality and morbidity       may be prevented when conditions are diagnosed and treated in       a timely manner.        (11) According to a study published by the Journal of       Perinatal Education, doula-assisted mothers are 4 times less       likely to have a low-birthweight baby, 2 times less likely to       experience a birth complication involving themselves or their       baby, and significantly more likely to initiate       breastfeeding. Doula care has also been shown to produce cost       savings resulting in part from reduced rates of cesarean and       pre-term births.        (12) Intimate partner violence is one of the leading causes       of maternal death, and women are more likely to experience       intimate partner violence during pregnancy than at any other       time in their lives. It is also more dangerous than       pregnancy. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and       postpartum crosses every demographic and has been exacerbated       by the COVID-19 pandemic.        (13) Oral health is an important part of perinatal health.       Reducing bacteria in a woman's mouth during pregnancy can       significantly reduce her risk of developing oral diseases and       spreading decay-causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some       evidence suggests that women with periodontal disease during       pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor birth outcomes,       such as preeclampsia, pre-term birth, and low-birth weight.       Furthermore, a woman's oral health during pregnancy is a good       predictor of her newborn's oral health, and since mothers can       unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, putting       their children at higher risk for tooth decay, prevention       efforts should happen even before children are born, as a       matter of pre-pregnancy health and prenatal care during       pregnancy.        (14) In the United States, death reporting and analysis is       a State function rather than a Federal process. States report       all deaths--including maternal deaths--on a semi-voluntary       basis, without standardization across States. While the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity       and system for collecting death-related data based on death       certificates, these data are not sufficiently reported by       States in an organized and standard format across States such       that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is able       to identify causes of maternal death and best practices for       the prevention of such death.        (15) Vital statistics systems often underestimate maternal       mortality and are insufficient data sources from which to       derive a full scope of medical and social determinant factors       contributing to maternal deaths, such as intimate partner       violence. While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death       certificates since 2003 have likely improved States'       abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they are not       generally completed by obstetric providers or persons trained       to recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these vital       forms may be missing information or may capture inconsistent       data. Due to varying maternal mortality-related analyses,       lack of reliability, and granularity in data, current       maternal mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the       myriad medical and socially determinant factors that       contribute to such high maternal mortality rates within the       United States compared to other developed nations. Lack of       standardization of data and data sharing across States and       between Federal entities, health networks, and research       institutions keep the Nation in the dark about ways to       prevent maternal deaths.        (16) Having reliable and valid State data aggregated at the       Federal level are critical to the Nation's ability to quell       surges in maternal death and imperative for researchers to       identify long-lasting interventions.        (17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly recommend that       maternal deaths and cases of maternal morbidity, including       complications that result in chronic illness and future       increased risk of death, be investigated at the State level       first, and that standardized, streamlined, de-identified data       regarding maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention. Such data standardization and       collection would be similar in operation and effect to the       National Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the Confidential       Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Programme in the United Kingdom.       Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities registry and       surveillance system would help providers, academicians,       lawmakers, and the public to address questions concerning the       types of, causes of, and best practices to thwart, maternal       mortality and morbidity.        (18) The United Nations' Millennium Development Goal 5a       aimed to reduce by 75 percent, between 1990 and 2015, the       maternal mortality rate, yet this metric has not been       achieved. In fact, the maternal mortality rate in the United       States has been estimated to have more than doubled between       2000 and 2014.        (19) Many States have struggled to establish or maintain       Maternal Mortality Review  [[Page S860]]       Committees (referred to in this section as ``MMRC''). On the       State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have not had       the resources to mount local reviews. State-level reviews are       necessary as only the State departments of health have the       authority to request medical records, autopsy reports, and       police reports critical to the function of the MMRC.        (20) The United States has no comparable, coordinated       Federal process by which to review cases of maternal       mortality, systems failures, or best practices. Many States       have active MMRCs and leverage their work to impact maternal       wellness. For example, the State of California has worked       extensively with their State health departments, health and       hospital systems, and research collaborative organizations,       including the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative       and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, to       establish MMRCs, wherein such State has determined the most       prevalent causes of maternal mortality and recorded and       shared data with providers and researchers, who have       developed and implemented safety bundles and care protocols       related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, peripartum       cardiomyopathy, and the like. In this way, the State of       California has been able to leverage its maternal mortality       review board system, generate data, and apply those data to       effect changes in maternal care-related protocol. To date,       the State of California has reduced its maternal mortality       rate, which is now comparable to the low rates of the United       Kingdom.        (21) Hospitals and health systems across the United States       lack standardization of emergency obstetric protocols before,       during, and after delivery. Consequently, many providers are       delayed in recognizing critical signs indicating maternal       distress that quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal       incidences. Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric       emergency that does not consider both clinical and public       health approaches falls woefully under the mark of excellent       care delivery. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives,       or entities participating in the Alliance for Innovation on       Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetric protocols, tool       kits, and other resources to improve system care and response       as they relate to maternal complications and warning signs       for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hypertension, and       preeclampsia. These perinatal quality collaboratives serve an       important role in providing infrastructure that supports       quality improvement efforts addressing obstetric care and       outcomes. State-based perinatal quality collaboratives       partner with hospitals, physicians, nurses, patients, public       health, and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for       collaborative learning, rapid response data, and quality       improvement science support to achieve systems-level change.        (22) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports       that nearly half of all maternal deaths occur in the       immediate postpartum period--the 42 days following a       pregnancy--whereas more than one-third of maternal deaths       occur while a person is still pregnant. Further, 21 percent       of maternal deaths occur between 1 and 6 weeks postpartum,       and 12 percent of maternal deaths occur during the remaining       portion of the postpartum year. Yet, for women eligible for       the Medicaid program on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid       coverage lapses at the end of the month on which the 60th       postpartum day lands.        (23) The experience of serious traumatic events, such as       being exposed to domestic violence, substance use disorder,       or pervasive and systematic racism, can over-activate the       body's stress-response system. Known as toxic stress, the       repetition of high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm       healthy neurological development and other body systems,       which can have cascading physical and mental health       consequences, as documented in the Adverse Childhood       Experiences study of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention.        (24) A growing body of evidence-based research has shown       the correlation between the stress associated with systematic       racism and one's birthing outcomes. The undue stress of sex       and race discrimination paired with institutional racism has       been demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal       mortality, irrespective of one's gestational age, maternal       age, socioeconomic status, educational level, or individual-      level health risk factors, including poverty, limited access       to prenatal care, and poor physical and mental health       (although these are not nominal factors). Black women remain       the most at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-      related causes of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for       example, for which obesity is a risk factor, Black women of       normal weight remain at a higher at risk of dying during the       perinatal period compared to non-Black obese women.        (25) The rising maternal mortality rate in the United       States is driven predominantly by the disproportionately high       rates of Black maternal mortality.        (26) Compared to women from other racial and ethnic       demographics, Black women across the socioeconomic spectrum       experience prolonged, unrelenting stress related to       systematic racial and gender discrimination, contributing to       higher rates of maternal mortality, giving birth to low-      weight babies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a       risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. This       cumulative stress, called weathering, often extends across       the life course and is situated in everyday spaces where       Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism,       structural barriers, lack of access to care, lack of access       to nutritious food, and social determinants of health       exacerbate Black women's likelihood to experience poor or       fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account for the       great disparity.        (27) Black women are twice as likely to experience       postpartum depression, and disproportionately higher rates of       preeclampsia compared to White women.        (28) Racism is deeply ingrained in United States systems,       including in health care delivery systems between patients       and providers, often resulting in disparate treatment for       pain, irreverence for cultural norms with respect to health,       and dismissiveness. However, the provider pool is not primed       with many people of color, nor are providers (whether       maternity care clinicians or maternity care support       personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit bias,       cultural competency, respectful care practices, or empathy       training on a consistent, on-going basis.        (29) Not all people who have been pregnant or given birth       identify as being a ``woman''. The terms ``birthing people''       or ``birthing persons'' are also used to describe pregnant       and postpartum people.       SEC. 3. IMPROVING FEDERAL EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION                     OF MATERNAL MORTALITY.         (a) Technical Assistance for States With Respect to       Reporting Maternal Mortality.--Not later than one year after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in       this section as the ``Director''), in consultation with the       Administrator of the Health Resources and Services       Administration, shall provide technical assistance to States       that elect to report comprehensive data on maternal mortality       and factors relating to such mortality (including oral and       mental health), intimate partner violence, and breastfeeding       health information, for the purpose of encouraging uniformity       in the reporting of such data and to encourage the sharing of       such data among the respective States.
