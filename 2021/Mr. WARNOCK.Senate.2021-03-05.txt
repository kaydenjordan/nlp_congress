 Mr. President, contrary to the suggestion from my  colleague from Pennsylvania, this provision has everything to do with  COVID-19 relief.   The thing about this terrible pandemic is that it has both  illuminated and exacerbated longstanding disparities rooted in our  racial past, and for too long, farmers of color have been left to fend  for themselves, not getting the support they deserve from the USDA,  making it even more difficult for them to recover from this pandemic.   We have an opportunity here to lift all of our rural communities by  aiming the aid where it is needed given our historic past, which is  very much present. So I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this  amendment that strips these communities that have been forgotten by our  government of the relief that they so desperately deserve. It will have  an adverse effect on the very relief that we are trying to provide to  all rural communities.
