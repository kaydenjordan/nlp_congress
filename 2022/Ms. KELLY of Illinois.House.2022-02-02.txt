 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman  Eddie Bernice Johnson and her committee for all of their hard work.   Passing the America COMPETES Act will help small businesses and  ensure the U.S. remains a leader in scientific development.   This bill funds STEM programs to develop the next generation of  diverse scientists and inventors and funds the CHIPS Act to bring back  semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. shores.   Companies large and small across industries are confronting new  supply chain challenges. In my district, I have visited companies like  Plochman's. They are doing their best to produce delicious mustards,  despite current production challenges.   The bipartisan Supply CHAIN Act included in this bill will create an  Office of Supply Chain Resiliency and Crisis Response within the  Department of Commerce to monitor supply chains of critical goods and  materials to mitigate future challenges.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this  bill and bring relief to small businesses across the country.
