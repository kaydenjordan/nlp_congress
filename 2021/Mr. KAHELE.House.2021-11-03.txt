 Madam Speaker, we face a now-or-never moment to reverse  the severe consequences of the climate crisis. Our narrow margin to  avert catastrophe is shrinking, and right now, Democrats hold the power  to enact aggressive policies to turn that tide. Failing to meet the  moment in the Build Back Better Act is frankly a nonstarter.   In my home State of Hawaii, the devastating effects of climate change  are crystal clear. Each year, we experience unprecedented flooding,  which causes landslides, washes out bridges, and creates dam failures;  rising sea levels that lead to coastal erosion are visible along every  island; and warming waters that cause widespread coral bleaching that  kill our fish populations and threaten our economy.   As we face these challenges, Hawaii has been a leader in green energy  sources, including geothermal, ocean, solar, and hydro-energy. However,  while my State can do its part, we need a robust national effort if we  are to sustain our planet for future generations.   Madam Speaker, the global climate crisis is our greatest national  security threat, and I urge all my colleagues to answer the call to  action by passing the Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
