 Madam Speaker, in the past 18 months,  President Biden has shown the American people that he and his  administration are not prepared to lead.   According to a new whistleblower report, problems at the Michigan  baby formula plant were actually reported to the U.S. Department of  Labor in February of 2021. Instead of addressing this crisis head-on,  the Biden administration squandered precious time. As a result,  American families were unable to buy the formula that their infant  children so desperately need.   As a father, I think back on shopping for children's formula for my  own children, and I am saddened by the thought of parents arriving  today at the grocery store and seeing empty shelf after empty shelf.   The longer President Biden remains in office, one thing continues to  become clear: Americans cannot afford the failed leadership that has  allowed this crisis and so many crises to continue.                            ____________________
