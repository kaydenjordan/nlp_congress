 Madam Speaker, last Friday marked the 1-year  anniversary of the Biden bailout bill. This $2 trillion package has  directly led to worker shortages, billions in waste, and the worst  inflation in 40 years.   The Biden bailout didn't rescue our economy. It ruined a recovery  that was already underway.   Madam Speaker, $500 billion spent to incentivize business closures,  lockdowns, and antiscience masking policies; billions wasted, misused,  or repurposed for projects unrelated to the pandemic: Florida golf  courses, checks for prisoners and Japanese citizens, trees for New  York, libraries in the President's home State. The list goes on.   And as a result, American families are finding it harder to put food  on their table, clothes on their backs, and gasoline in their cars.   President Biden sold the American people a COVID package that spent  less than 9 percent on fighting COVID. He created a massive worker  shortage and instigated the highest inflation in a generation. That is  his legacy.                            ____________________
