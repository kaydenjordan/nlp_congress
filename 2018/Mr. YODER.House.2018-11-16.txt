 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express a heartfelt thank you  to all the veterans across Kansas and throughout the United States.   This week we celebrate Veterans Day and we recognize and honor the  service and sacrifice each and every veteran has made to ensure the  preservation of the freedom and liberty we take for granted every day.   One of my greatest responsibilities in Congress has been to support  the men and women of our military and fulfill the promise that we make  to them in exchange for their service.   Over the last 2 years, Congress has worked with this administration  to provide a record amount of funding for health programs at the VA,  and we have increased accountability measures to make sure no one falls  through the cracks. We have paid special attention to improving the  mental health services and opioid abuse prevention among our veterans.   We owe these veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never fully  repay, but the best way to try to do that is to ensure they are cared  for as promised when they come home.   Mr. Speaker, may we continue to honor our veterans this week and  always.                            ____________________
