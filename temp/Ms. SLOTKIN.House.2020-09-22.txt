 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and thank my  colleagues in the House for passing my bill, the Strengthening  America's Strategic National Stockpile Act, with bipartisan, unanimous  consent to ensure we never again depend on foreign suppliers for  supplies we need to keep Americans safe.   This bill was truly a bipartisan effort: 10 Democrats and 10  Republicans joined me in introducing the bill. It was endorsed by the  bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and passed out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee on a similar unanimous, bipartisan vote.   At a time when divisions in Congress can seem insurmountable, this  bill is an example of what we can accomplish, even in our country's  most challenging moments, when we focus on the mission.   In this bill, we are responding to the mission to ensure that we  never repeat what we went through in the early days of the COVID  outbreak.   Amidst uncertainty and fear, my office received frantic calls and  emails day after day in March and April from essential workers begging  for help. As cases of COVID surged, our hospitals and frontline workers  simply did not have the protective equipment necessary to keep  themselves safe.    I heard from a physician in Brighton who compared his job to being a  soldier  [[Page H4650]]  on the front lines wearing a T-shirt and a baseball cap instead of body  armor and a helmet.   I heard from nurses in Mason who had to share one gown--not per  person, but per entire staff.   I heard from doctors, nurses, and first responders who were bravely  answering the call to serve their country, yet they were battling this  deadly disease with improvised face shields and homemade solutions.   In my home State of Michigan, we requested millions of medical  supplies from the Federal Strategic National Stockpile. Michigan needed  millions of masks, gowns, face shields, and ventilators. It quickly  became clear that the aid we sought from our national stockpile was  delayed and insufficient. The supplies we did receive were woefully  inadequate to meet the moment. Some masks arrived so far beyond their  expiration date that they were starting to mold.   I found myself doing anything and everything I could to secure  personal protective equipment for Michigan, calling dozens of mask  manufacturers, negotiating with suppliers in China, and fighting for  each and every shipment. My staff remembers some sleepless nights on  the phone working to get doctors and nurses in Michigan enough supplies  for just a few more days' work in the hospital.   At the same time, manufacturers across my district stepped up to help  fill the void and started retooling their businesses to manufacture  personal protective equipment for our frontline workers.   In Oxford, Michigan, Vaughn Hockey jumped into action, taking the  specialized nylon that they used to make hockey pads and turning it  into washable hospital gowns.   Magna International, in my town of Holly, Michigan, retooled their  car seat fabric assembly line to make masks for workers and suppliers.   It was American ingenuity and Michigan grit at its finest.   This experience shook me to my core, and I immediately got to work  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to draft legislation to  ensure that America is better prepared for the next pandemic or the  next phase of COVID.   Our bill, the Strengthening America's National Stockpile Act, was the  product of our bipartisan collaboration and makes important fixes to  our national stockpile for medical supplies so that it is fully  stocked, maintained, and ready whenever Michigan and other States  across the country need it.                                time  1000    This is even more important as we see the number of COVID cases  across the country continue to increase. This bill requires constant  upkeep to make sure that the items in the stockpile aren't expired. It  infuses transparency into how supplies are distributed from the  stockpile, and it helps States create their own stockpiles.   Second, it strengthens the stockpile's finances. It makes efficient  use of taxpayer dollars and prevents waste by allowing the stockpile to  sell excess supplies to other agencies. It also ensures that taxpayers  are properly compensated for the use of stockpile products and boosts  its funding.   Critically, it helps reduce our overall dependence on foreign  suppliers by incentivizing production of critical medical supplies here  in America. It creates a $500 million pilot program that will allow the  stockpile to work directly with American manufacturers to replenish  existing supplies, expand our manufacturing capacity, and strengthen  these critical supply chains.   Over the next few weeks, I will be visiting a bunch of Michigan  companies who could directly benefit from this portion of the bill.   Here in Congress, we have a responsibility to respond to the way this  crisis is shaking our communities; to protect our healthcare workers  and support the businesses who are adapting to this once-in-a- generation event. Our communities are stepping up and so should we.  Passing this bill to better arm our doctors and nurses against this  deadly disease is an important way to do that.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for passing this  legislation with overwhelming, bipartisan support, and I look forward  to working together to help keep our fellow Americans safe.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Tegan Roobol of  Howell, Michigan.   Ms. Roobol has dedicated her career to helping others overcome  obstacles. As a physical therapist who works with children with  disabilities and those who have suffered traumatic injuries through the  Livingston Educational Service Agency, Ms. Roobol has helped hundreds  of children learn to walk, master basic motor skills, and gain  independence.   Recently, the inspiring mother of two had the chance to try out some  obstacles of her own when she competed on the popular TV series  ``American Ninja Warrior.''   Frustrated with the lack of recreation opportunities for those with  disabilities, she developed a unique, adaptive ninja warrior program  for children with special needs, and founded a non-profit organization  to reach even more kids.   Roobol has worked to overcome the obstacles of the stigma around  mental illness, and bravely shared her own battle with depression in a  book she authored.   Regardless of what happens on the obstacle course, Ms. Roobol is a  real-life warrior, fighting to make a difference for some of the most  vulnerable members of our community.                            ____________________
