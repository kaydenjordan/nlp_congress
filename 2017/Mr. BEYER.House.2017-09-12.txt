 Mr. Chairman, I stand here also to express my strong  support for the Amash amendment.   Civil asset forfeiture without limits presents one of the strongest  threats to our civil, property, and constitutional rights. It creates a  reverse incentive for law enforcement to seek profit over justice.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this great  amendment.
