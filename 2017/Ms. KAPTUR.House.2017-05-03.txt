 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my dear colleague, Mrs.  Lowey, the ranking member of the committee, for yielding, and thank  Chairmen Frelinghuysen, Rogers, and Ranking Member Lowey again for the  hard work they did to push this bill across the finish line.   Yet today, I rise with frustration that it has taken us so long to  finish doing our job. There is simply no good reason why, over 7 months  into the 2017 fiscal year, we are only now taking a vote to fund this  year's government operations. The American people deserve so much  better.   There are many things in this bill with which I disagree, but I am  pleased to see that the bill before us represents a bipartisan  compromise. It also includes a lot of positive aspects.   For Ohio, the agreement brings welcome news to coal industry  pensioneers. It also provides an important $600 million to fight the  national opioid epidemic which has devastated our communities.                                time  1445    It also provides $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative, assuring our critical work to improve water quality in the  Great Lakes continues.   As ranking member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee, I am well aware we have more work to do. But  this bill continues our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and  provides a modest increase for innovative science as well as energy  efficiency and renewable energy for America's future and for our global  leadership.   Once again, I believe it is Democrats who are getting the job done  for America and leading the charge of bipartisan negotiations and  compromise to avoid a government shutdown. Our side of the aisle  continues to focus on making progress, moving the ball forward inch by  inch and making progress, advancing progress for our country a step at  a time.   A recent poll reported that this is what 77 percent of the American  people want: compromising, working together, and moving forward. I hope  that this agreement will be a beachhead in our efforts to fulfill their  wishes. This bill demonstrates Congress can work together collegially  for the 2018 fiscal year appropriations to follow to benefit our  Nation's future.   I thank, again, Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Nita  Lowey, and all of our dedicated staff on appropriations on both sides  of the aisle for the hard, bipartisan work they put in putting this  bill forward together for America's sake. I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.    Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine  Caucus, I rise to commemorate the precious life of Joseph Stone of  Tucson, Arizona. The 36-year-old American was serving his part of an  official international peace team monitoring the border conflict  between Ukrainian Government troops and Russian-backed separatists who  invaded Ukraine.   Mr. Stone was working with a German and a Czech peace monitor when an  explosion--likely a mine--damaged their vehicle in Pryshyb, Ukraine.  The two other monitors are hospitalized in stable condition. Stone is  the first Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe monitor  killed in that very important mission.   Stone's career in foreign assistance missions brought him to  Afghanistan and Liberia before Ukraine. Before entering the aid  community, Stone worked at American Medical Response in southern  Arizona for 9 years, starting out as an EMT and rising to the level of  paramedic. He graduated from Pima Community College. He is survived by  his mother, two brothers, a longtime companion, and 13-year-old  daughter.   Since its establishment in 2014, the OSCE has played a vital role in  monitoring the Minsk agreements designed to bring peace to eastern  Ukraine after Russia's brutal invasion of a sovereign neighbor. This  fateful tragedy makes clear the absolute brutality of Vladimir Putin's  threats to liberty and democracy in Ukraine.   It also instructs us about the unrecognized selfless heroes among us  who define the meaning and cost of liberty. May our recognition of his  selfless sacrifice bring comfort to those bearing this great loss, and  may he be remembered always in the protracted struggle for a free  Ukraine.                            ____________________
