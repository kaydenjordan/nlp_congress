 Mr. Speaker, the American people expect corrective  actions by this body and the other body, and so I rise today to  reinforce the importance of the translators' notes as it relates to the  meeting between the President of the United States and President Putin.   If there is anything more important for the American people, it is to  know whether we are safe, whether our military is safe, and whether we  are secure.   Secondarily, I am so disturbed that there is some thought of  providing our public servants--Ambassador McFaul's name was mentioned  as being an exchange target, if you will, for President Putin to play  with.  [[Page H6579]]    I will be introducing legislation to protect all our ambassadors from  foreign nations that may desire to undermine their leadership here in  the United States.   Also, I am intending to announce next week my introduction of a  temporary protective status to help those Central Americans and others  who this administration has precipitously taken away their TPS and  jeopardized them in 2018.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we must reunite the children, and we must do it  now.                            ____________________
