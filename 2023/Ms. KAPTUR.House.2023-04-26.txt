 Mr. Speaker, dangerous budget shenanigans by House  Republicans play with fire that can blunt economic growth and cruelly  hurt countless Ohioans.   Speaker McCarthy's roulette creates economic instability that can  yield disastrous consequences for students, families, seniors,  veterans, and public safety across our Buckeye State.   His plan would endanger public safety and impact public health by  shutting down five air traffic control towers in our State, cutting 330  safety inspections in rail, and denying 2,000 Ohioans admission to  opioid treatment.   His plan would raise costs for working families and students by  eliminating 12,300 preschool and childcare slots in Ohio, stripping  food assistance from nearly half a million Ohioans, making college  tuition expensive for 200,000 Ohioans, and raising housing costs for  23,000 Ohioans. How about that for a start?   The McCarthy plan is reckless and inches us closer to default. In  sum, the McCarthy plan would thwart economic progress and should be  shelved for a commonsense, bipartisan solution that serves all of  America. Let's put people before politics.                            ____________________
