 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Connor  Nicol of Hampton as November's Granite Stater of the Month. For the  last 3 years, 15-year-old Connor has helped to ensure that  servicemembers who died overseas are remembered. Connor creates dog  tags for people to carry, or place somewhere prominent, so that  servicemembers' names and sacrifice will never be forgotten.   Connor was inspired to create the military identification tags,  commonly called ``dog tags,'' while watching a movie about World War  II, and he was struck by how young the servicemembers were. Knowing  that many servicemembers never came home, he wanted to make sure that  those who died overseas are always remembered. Using information from  the National Archives, Connor has now made dog tags for 40,000  servicemembers who died in the Korean war, and he has recently expanded  the project to create tags for those who died serving in the Vietnam  war.   The tags have been distributed across the country, including to  veterans service organizations, church groups, Scout Troops, and  schools. Connor works to ensure that the tag goes to someone who  actively wants it and is dedicated to honoring the name of the  servicemember. In addition to keeping the name and memory of the fallen  servicemember alive, the tag also serves to remind the person carrying  it of the sacrifice these men and women made in service to our country.   Connor's goal is to create and distribute dog tags for those who died  in additional overseas conflicts, including World War II, the Vietnam  war, and the Global War on Terror. If you would like to request a tag,  you can do so through his website, www.wewillremember.us. Connor's  dedication to respecting and commemorating military service is a strong  reflection of the Granite State spirit of patriotism. In New Hampshire,  we honor those who keep our country safe, secure, and free. I thank  Connor for his work to make sure that those who died in service to our  country will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
