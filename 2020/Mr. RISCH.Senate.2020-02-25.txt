 Madam President, when you do nuclear theory  research and classified national security work, you need a world-class  protective security force to protect materials, facilities,  information, and people. Fortunately, Idaho National Laboratory, INL,  has a world-class protective force, Pro Force, as was recently affirmed  through the presentation of the Colonel Sydnor Memorial Award.   Each year, the Colonel Sydnor Memorial Award recognizes an  exceptional participant in the Composite Adversary Team--CAT--Program,  which trains members of Pro Force teams across the Department of  Energy's nuclear security complexes to act as attackers in simulated  force-on-force exercises that test the strength of each lab's Pro Force  team. This year, that recognition was given to INL Pro Force captain  Jeremy White. White has an expansive career in law enforcement,  including time as a juvenile detention officer and a deputy officer in  adult corrections. Along with his duties as Pro Force captain, White  also serves as Bingham County reserve deputy and is a member of the  Special Tactics and Response--STAR--team, a multijurisdictional SWAT  team. Before being presented the award, White was described as an  individual who demonstrates ``excellence in the areas of character,  ability to motivate others, physical fitness, tactical skills and  teamwork'' by April Stephenson, Deputy Director for Department of  Energy's Office of Enterprise Assessments.   As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I  am honored to represent people like Jeremy White who are so dedicated  to protecting the energy resources of Idaho. Congratulations to Jeremy  and to all the members of INL's Pro Force team. You make Idaho proud,  and I wish for your continued success in the Pro Force field.                            ____________________
