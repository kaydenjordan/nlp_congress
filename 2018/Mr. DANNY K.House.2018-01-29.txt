 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  anchoring this session, and all of those who have come to join in it.   I read someplace the other day where there are three men in this  country who own as much of the wealth as 50 percent of all the poorest  people in this country. If it were not for organized labor, not for  unions, and the influence, millions of individuals who are middle class  would be working at peon wages. Individuals would not be able to send  their children to college, wouldn't be able to own an automobile or a  home. So we can never undermine or not understand the value of  organization.   Many of us in this room enjoy the support of organized labor. You  have got to get resources from somewhere. You have got to get money in  order to function.   If you cannot match what the big megabucks individuals can give to  maintain control of our society, how do you expect to change it?   So I am simply pleased to join with my colleagues and suggest that  nothing is more important in the distribution and redistribution of the  wealth of this country than organized labor.
