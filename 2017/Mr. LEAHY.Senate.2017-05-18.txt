 Mr. President, in celebration of Museum Day on May 18, we  reintroduce the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act.'' This legislation  would enable our country to keep cherished art works in the United  States and to preserve them in our public institutions. At the same  time, this legislation will erase an inequity in our Tax Code that  currently serves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to  museums and libraries. Since 2000 I have introduced this same bill in  each Congress. It was also included in the Senate-passed version of the  2001 tax reconciliation bill, the Senate-passed version of the 2003  Charity Aid, Recovery, and Empowerment, CARE, Act, and the Senate- passed version of the 2005 tax reconciliation bill.   This legislation would preserve cherished art works for the public by  allowing artists to take a fair market deduction for works they donate  to museums, libraries, colleges and other public institutions. Under  current law, artists who donate their created work may only deduct the  cost of supplies, while a collector of the same work who donates it to  qualified charitable institutions is allowed to take a tax deduction  equal to the fair market value of the donated work.   In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works  produced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in  the Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and  libraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and  strengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its  cultural heritage. Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum  or examined an original manuscript or composition and has gained a  greater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result,  knows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of  them, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.   Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a  deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work. Congress  changed the law for artists in response to the perception that some  taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by inflating the market  value of self-created works. Much has changed in the United States  since 1969 when the tax law was amended. There has been an explosion of  artistic and literary creativity in the country that is valued  throughout the world. Yet, since the law was changed, artists now give  far less frequently than before, harming the public by denying it the  opportunity to see museum-quality contemporary art. The current tax law  discriminates against those who choose to make their living as artists  and writers. It also undermines the ability of public and cultural  institutions, especially those in small and midsized cities and towns,  to collect and preserve our Nation's cultural patrimony. With no or  meager acquisition budgets, it is impossible for them to compete in the  global art market.   A letter from the distinguished Librarian of Congress Emeritus James  Billington stated that ``restoration of this tax deduction would vastly  benefit their institution's manuscript and music holdings, and remove  the single major impediment to developing the Library's graphic arts  holdings. The Artist-Museum Partnership Act would once again allow  artists who donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or  scholarly compositions to be subject to the same new rules that all  taxpayers or collectors who donate such works follow.''   This legislation is vital because it reminds us that artists have an  important role in the process of engaging communities, and artists are  a cultural necessity in the fabric of any community in Vermont or  around the world.   The Artist-Museum Partnership Act is supported by such organizations  as the Vermont Arts Council, Shelburne Museum, Association of Art  Museum Directors, American Alliance of Museums, Americans for the Arts,  Dance/USA, League of American Orchestras, National Assembly of State  Arts Agencies, National Council for the Traditional Arts, OPERA  America, Theatre Communications Group, Local Learning, Artists Rights  Society, National Humanities Alliance, College Art Association, and  Fractured Atlas.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Durbin):   S. 1185. A bill to increase public safety by punishing and deterring  firearms trafficking; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  [[Page S3044]]         Mr. President, for too long, criminals have exploited  loopholes in our gun laws. Congress's failure to properly address this  issue has had devastating consequences for families and communities  across the country. We have allowed criminals to readily obtain  firearms through straw purchasers, trafficking networks, and  unregulated gun markets. It is past time for this body to take action.   Today, I am reintroducing bipartisan legislation to close loopholes  that allow criminals to obtain firearms through straw purchases and  illegal trafficking. I am proud to be joined once again by Senators  Collins and Durbin. The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act would  make it a Federal crime to act as a straw purchaser of firearms or to  illegally traffic in firearms. It sets forth tough penalties for anyone  who transfers a firearm with reasonable cause to believe that the gun  will be used in a drug crime, crime of violence, or act of terrorism,  or for anyone who smuggles firearms out of the United States. This  legislation would help keep guns out of the hands of those who seek to  do us harm.   As the opioid crisis reached epidemic levels throughout the United  States--and in Northeastern states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and  Maine in particular--gun traffickers stood ready to profit. Dealers who  cannot pass background checks take advantage of addicts by forcing them  to make straw purchases. Passing this gun trafficking bill and closing  these loopholes will be a key piece of our response to the opioid  crisis in so many of our communities.   This legislation will also be an important tool in preventing  terrorist attacks on American soil. Terrorists have increasingly turned  to guns to carry out domestic attacks, as they did in San Bernardino,  Orlando, and Charleston. In the case of San Bernardino, the shooters  relied on straw purchasing to acquire their deadly weapons. But because  straw purchasing is not a Federal crime, prosecutors only charged the  straw purchaser with making a false statement--a so called  ``paperwork'' offense. I have often heard from law enforcement that  current law does not do enough to deter gun traffickers. This  legislation answers that call.   I also want to take note of National Police Week. This is a time when  we pause to thank our Nation's law enforcement officers for their  important work and many sacrifices. Earlier this week, thousands of  officers gathered for a candlelight memorial. The names of 143 officers  killed in the line of duty during 2016 were added to the walls of the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. It is not enough to merely  pay tribute to these men and women. They deserve action. A year ago  during Police Week, President Obama signed into law my legislation  reauthorizing the life-saving Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant  Program. That law will ensure that more than 200,000 officers receive  protective vests over the next five years.   The legislation that Senator Collins and I introduce today will also  help keep our officers and our neighborhoods safe. We must not wait for  another national tragedy to address this problem. Only Congress can  close these loopholes. I recognize that one piece of legislation cannot  prevent all gun violence, but this bill would provide a critical tool  to investigate and deter straw purchasers and gun traffickers. That is  why it has strong support from groups representing law enforcement  officers and prosecutors around the nation, including the Fraternal  Order of Police, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association, National Tactical Officers  Association, and National District Attorneys Association.   Like so many Vermonters, I am proud to be a responsible gun owner;  and I know that Senator Collins shares my commitment to protecting our  Second Amendment rights. But we also share a desire to keep guns out of  the hands of violent criminals, drug traffickers, and terrorists. There  is broad agreement in Congress that our existing gun laws do too little  to prevent gun violence in our communities. The legislation we  introduce today is an important part of the solution, and I call on all  Senators to support this bill and make our communities safer.
