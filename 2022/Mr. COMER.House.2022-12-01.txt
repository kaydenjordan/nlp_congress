 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. Tony Brannon on his  well-deserved retirement.   Dr. Brannon grew up on a small family farm and at an early age began  to participate in the Future Farmers of America events. His dedication  to the FFA program and agricultural community would only grow.   He completed a bachelor's degree in agricultural education from  Murray State in 1981, a master's degree in 1982, and a Ph.D. at  Oklahoma State University in 1988.   Dr. Brannon's heart never left Murray State, though. Legend has it he  even wrote in soap on his bathroom mirror ``MSU'' as a reminder of his  goal to come back to Murray State.   He returned to Murray State as a faculty member in agricultural  education and mechanization. In 2005, he was named the dean of the  School of Agriculture. For nearly 35 years, he has molded a generation  of new agricultural leaders in Kentucky.   As many gather to celebrate Dr. Brannon's retirement, I thank him for  his commitment to the MSU community, service to the Kentucky FFA  Foundation, and unwavering passion for helping thousands of students  achieve their dreams.                            ____________________
