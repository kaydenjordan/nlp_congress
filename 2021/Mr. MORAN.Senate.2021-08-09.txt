 Madam President, I joined the bipartisan infrastructure  group of 22 Senators. I am one of the originals. I did so for a number  of reasons. One is how important infrastructure is to Kansas and to the  country.   I would highlight the importance of infrastructure investment to my  State. We are in the middle of the country, where our manufactured  goods and agricultural commodities need to be able to compete in the  world economy. How efficiently and effectively we get those goods and  those commodities to market has a huge consequence to the ability for  Kansans to earn a living.   Across our State, from Southeast Kansas to Southwest Kansas, from the  suburbs of Kansas City in Johnson County and Wyandotte County, all  across Northwest and Central Kansas, the demand for improved roads,  greater safety, is there. There is a great desire to see that roads and  bridges are repaired. County commissioners and trustees of our  townships have called to say: We have a bridge. Could you help us do  something about that?   So I entered this group of 22 Senators. I was one of the 11 to  provide some input and to see that Kansas priorities--that we had a  seat at the table and to help negotiate a deal that didn't raise taxes,  that didn't spend trillions of dollars and focused on actual  traditional infrastructure, and to avoid what I fear is to follow, what  I would describe as a Democratic wish list. I wanted this to be a  smaller, more affordable, paid-for package that was not excessive in  scope, didn't add to the national debt, and did not raise taxes on the  American people.   This package includes a number of priorities of mine, including a  historic increase in investment in broadband and does provide critical  resources to repair our roads, bridges, and airports.   So a desire for a seat at the table, a desire to invest in  infrastructure, and I also would add a desire to see that this U.S.  Senate, Republicans and Democrats, can work together for a beneficial  product for the American people. However, from the very beginning, I  outlined criteria that would be needed to be met for my support on any  final outcome of the negotiations. My priority was that the bill be  paid for and therefore not raise the national debt.   Half of the new spending in this bill is not offset--is not offset-- with reduced spending or increases in nontax revenues. The  Congressional Budget Office scores this bill as adding a quarter of a  trillion dollars to the national debt.   My view has been from the beginning that if we can only find offsets  to pay for a certain amount--in this case, about half of the increased  spending included in this bill--then the size of our bill should be  half of what it is. If you can only find a way to pay for half of what  you are spending, then spend less money--spend half as much less money.  That, of course, was not the outcome of these negotiations.   Additionally, I had hoped that this bipartisan plan would dissuade  Democrats from pursuing their own partisan $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend  spree. The Democratic plan to immediately follow this bipartisan  infrastructure bill with their own spending bill significantly  [[Page S6072]]  undermines the bipartisan effort to deliver a good outcome for the  people of this country.   I had hoped that if we reached a bipartisan agreement--in fact, I had  hoped a bipartisan agreement would be reached among the 22 Senators,  but pretty early in the negotiations, it became clear that there was  significant input and direction from the Biden administration and from  the majority leader, the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate.  So instead of negotiating with my colleagues and seeking an outcome  that we supported, it had to be run by those who are in the White House  and those who are the leadership of the Democratic Members of the U.S.  Senate.   My desire to see that we pass or reach an agreement to pass a bill  that would be paid for did not occur, was not met--that criteria was  not met--and the desire to see Democratic Senators say: If we do this  together, we are not going to do something else on our own. In fact,  some of the things we negotiated in or out of the bipartisan package  will now be included in the broader package of the Democratic wish  list.   It doesn't make a lot of sense to me to reach an agreement, only to  discover then that in a succeeding bill, one that immediately follows,  the things that we negotiated in or out are now included or taken out.  So the bipartisan nature of the agreement is in many ways offset by the  bill that follows.   Reaching an infrastructure deal in a bipartisan way would send a  great message that we are capable of working together, and I certainly  indicate to my colleagues--I particularly indicate to Senator Sinema,  the Senator from Arizona, how much I appreciate her efforts to pull us  together and to lead our meetings in a productive way, and I would say  again that I am open to those opportunities.   I am saddened by the fact that this did not reach an agreement that I  can support, but I certainly indicate to my colleagues that I am  willing to work with Republican and Democratic Members of the Senate to  see if, in other instances, we can come together in a way that provides  hope for the American people that we can work together on a better  product than we were able to reach in this instance.   Unfortunately, to sum up, there is too much spending, too much debt,  and therefore there will be too much inflation. My efforts to reach a  compromise were honest and sincere, and I regret that we were unable to  arrive at a bill that I can support   I yield the floor.    Madam President, 10 years ago I attended the memorial  service for CW2 Bryan J. Nichols. I vividly remember the outpouring of  support from the Hays community as hundreds of people lined the streets  with American flags to honor their hometown hero.   On Friday, August 6, 2021, a memorilization ceremony was held in New  Century, KS, by the Army Reserve Center and Aviation Support Center to  once again honor the bravery and sacrifice of Chief Nichols.   I have been told that Bryan knew his life's purpose was to become a  soldier, a calling he pursued to defend our freedom.   He took his oath of enlistment in 1996, swearing to protect our  country from enemies foreign and domestic. After 9/11, he answered our  country's call to defend our homeland, serving on  [[Page S6108]]  multiple tours abroad, including in Iraq.   As we approach the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the way Americans like  Bryan dedicated themselves to their country following the attacks  continues to move and inspire me.   After graduating flight school in 2008, he was assigned as a pilot to  the Army Reserve's 7th Battalion of the 158th Aviation Regiment in New  Century, KS. He deployed in May 2011 in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom as a CH-47 Chinook pilot.   On August 6, 2011, he gave his life for his country alongside 29 of  his brothers in arms when his helicopter was shot down by enemy fire.  It remains the single deadliest loss of U.S. forces during the war in  Afghanistan.   The ultimate sacrifice he made a decade ago is a painful reminder  that freedom is not free. And that it is the solemn duty of our Nation  to make certain his sacrifice--and those of all American heroes--are  never forgotten.   On Friday, that duty was fulfilled in a particularly special way with  the Memorialization Ceremony remembering Chief Warrant Officer 2  Nichols as a fallen hero and beloved member of this community.   As Kansans so naturally do, we have also seen the Hays community  continue to keep his legacy at the forefront of our minds, from  creating the annual Memorial Ride in his honor to dedicating the new  flag pole outside Thomas More Prep-Marian High School in his name.   Shortly after his passing, I was also pleased to support efforts to  designate the junction of I-70 and US 183 as the ``CW2 Bryan J. Nichols  fallen veterans memorial interchange.'' This designation serves as a  reminder to all those who drive by of the heroes who have safeguarded  our opportunity to live in the strongest, freest, and greatest Nation  in the world.   While Bryan was an American hero to all of us, he was also a son,  brother, husband, and dad to those who loved him most. Military service  is family service, and I want to recognize his family's sacrifice to  this country as well. Thank you.   Our nation is forever indebted to Bryan for his service.   May God bless our servicemembers and their loved ones.                            ____________________
