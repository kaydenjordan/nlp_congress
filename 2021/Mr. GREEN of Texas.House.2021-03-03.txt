 Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   My dear friends, you say you have a bill. Where was your bill when  you had the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and you could have  passed it?   You say you have a bill. The same bill that you had to replace the  Affordable Care Act that you never passed?   The same bill that you had to rebuild the infrastructure across the  length and breadth of this country that you never passed?   Where is the invisible bill?   I rise to support this bill that will deal with elimination of deadly  force racism that can take the lives of Black people with impunity.   I rise against your invisible bill.
