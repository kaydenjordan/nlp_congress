 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3764) to extend the Federal recognition to the Little Shell  Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3764         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Little Shell Tribe of       Chippewa Indians Restoration Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Member.--The term ``member'' means an individual who is       enrolled in the Tribe pursuant to section 6.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Little Shell Tribe       of Chippewa Indians of  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 3764,  the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act. As the only  Member from Montana in the House of Representatives, I am proud to  sponsor a bill which would extend Federal recognition to the Little  Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana.   With Federal recognition, the Little Shell Tribe and its members  would become eligible for all services and benefits provided by the  Federal Government to federally recognized Tribes.   The Tribe, as a condition of receiving Federal recognition, services,  and benefits, must submit to the Secretary of the Interior a membership  roll consisting of the name of each individual member of the Tribe and  must maintain such membership roll.   The act directs the Secretary of the Interior to acquire, for the  benefit of the Tribe, trust title to 200 acres of land within the  Tribe's service area to be used for a Tribal land base.   I appreciate the work of Chairman Gray and the Little Shell people  for  [[Page H8129]]  continuing this fight for recognition. I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, for over 20 years, the Walnut Grove Community Church in  Jessieville, Arkansas, has sought to gain title to the 4 acres of land  on which their church and historic cemetery are located. They have  offered 6 acres of land within the Ouachita National Forest to the U.S.  Forest Service in exchange. The cemetery and congregation both predate  the Forest Service.   Since 1938, the church has operated under special-use permits and has  had to renew its permit annually since 2002. This situation has left  the congregation uncertain about their future on the land they have  worshipped on for decades.   Furthermore, like any structure built 80 years ago, the church  requires maintenance. Unfortunately, its operation under a permit  limits the congregation's ability to maintain and improve their church  building.   Congressman Westerman has introduced a commonsense land exchange that  will greatly benefit the community of Jessieville at no cost to the  American taxpayer. He should be commended for his work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4824) to allow certain State permitting authority to  encourage expansion of broadband service to rural communities, and for  other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 4824, introduced by  John Curtis of Utah, is the Rural Broadband  Permitting Efficiency Act of 2018. The bill, which I have cosponsored,  provides much-needed efficiency to the broadband permitting process on  Federal lands to ensure underserved communities receive this vital  utility.   Approximately 40 percent of rural Americans do not have access to  broadband internet. Without adequate and consistent internet access,  people are unable to effectively communicate, gain access to vital  information services, and increasingly participate in the American  workforce.   Currently, providers who wish to install broadband infrastructure in  existing utility and road rights-of-way on Federal land are frequently  required to obtain approval from multiple Federal and State agencies.  If the infrastructure crosses Indian Country, the Bureau of Indian  Affairs is involved. This cumbersome process also includes extensive  environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act.   H.R. 4824 streamlines broadband permitting in existing rights-of-way,  saving time and money in broadband deployment. Specifically, this bill  authorizes a program to enhance the permitting process for broadband  internet projects in each of the Bureau of Land Management's State  offices.   H.R. 4824 also authorizes the Bureau and the U.S. Forest Service to  enter into agreements with States and Tribes to allow those entities to  carry out environmental reviews for broadband projects within existing  rights-of-way on Federal land. This coordinated approach should help  alleviate unnecessary delays in permit processing and encourage  providers and States to pursue broadband deployment projects,  particularly in rural areas.  [[Page H8132]]    Congressman Curtis should be commended for his work on this bill and  his efforts to have it considered by the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, August 1, 2018.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 4824, the Rural       Broadband Permitting Efficiency Act of 2018, which was       primarily referred to the Committee on Natural Resources and       additionally referred to your committee. The Natural       Resources Committee ordered the bill favorably reported by       voice vote on June 6, 2018, and my staff has shared with your       staff a draft bill report, a copy of the bill as ordered       reported and the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional       Budget Office.        I ask that you allow your committee to be discharged from       further consideration of the bill so that it may be quickly       scheduled by the Majority Leader. I agree that this discharge       in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter       of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have your       committee be represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and your       response in the report for the bill and in the Congressional       Record during debate on the bill to document our agreement.        Thank you very much for your consideration of my request,       and I look forward to bringing H.R. 4824 to the Floor soon.            Sincerely,                                                     Rob Bishop,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                      Washington, DC, July 30, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to review       H.R. 4824, the Rural Broadband Permitting Efficiency Act of       2018. As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to       the Committee on Natural Resources, while the Agriculture       Committee received an additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 4824 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,                                                          Chairman.

SEC. 6. FIREARM AND BOW HUNTER EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAM                     GRANTS.         Section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife       Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669h-1(a)(1)(A)) is amended--        (1) in clause (iii), by striking ``and'' at the end; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(v) the enhancement of hunter recruitment and       recreational shooter recruitment; and''.       SEC. 7. MULTISTATE CONSERVATION GRANT PROGRAM.         Section 11 of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration       Act (16 U.S.C. 669h-2) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1)--        (A) by striking ``Not more than'' and inserting the       following:        ``(A) In general.--Not more than''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Availability for hunter and recreational shooter       grants.--Not more than $5,000,000 of the revenues covered       into the fund from any tax imposed under section 4161(b) of       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for a fiscal year shall be       available to the Secretary exclusively for making hunter       recruitment and recreational shooter recruitment grants that       promote a national hunting and shooting sport recruitment       program, including related communication and outreach       activities.'';        (2) in the matter preceding subsection (b)(3)(A), by       striking ``International'';        (3) in the matter preceding subsection (c)(2)(A)(i), by       striking ``International'';        (4) in subsection (c)(2)(A)(i), by inserting ``or to       recreational shooting activities'' after ``wildlife''; and        (5) in subsection (d), by inserting ``or to recreational       shooting activities'' after ``wildlife''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 2591, introduced by Representative Austin Scott of Georgia, is a  bipartisan bill which I cosponsored that amends the Pittman-Robertson  Wildlife Restoration Act to modernize the funding for wildlife  conservation.   The Pittman-Robertson fund, which relies on excise tax fees paid by  hunters and recreational shooters, has been a driving force for  wildlife habitat preservation in the United States for nearly 80 years,  contributing over $10 billion in that time. The fund is also  responsible for important hunter education programs, as well as the  construction and maintenance of public shooting ranges.   The long-term viability of the Pittman-Robertson fund is at risk,  however, because of the diminishing number of hunters and recreational  shooters nationwide. Recent surveys have shown a decline of over 2  million hunters since 2011. This has largely been caused by growing  urbanization and suburbanization, which has made it more difficult for  Americans to participate in these activities.   This legislation will give States additional flexibility to use their  Pittman-Robertson dollars to fund programs to recruit, retain, and  reactivate hunters and target shooters. Empowering the States with this  added flexibility will help promote safe and responsible hunting and  shooting, while also ensuring this American system of wildlife  conservation funding remains strong into the future.   Congressman Scott should be commended for his work on this bipartisan  measure. I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2606) to amend the Act of August 4, 1947 (commonly known as  the Stigler Act), with respect to restrictions applicable to Indians of  the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2606         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stigler Act Amendments of       2018''.  [[Page H8135]]            SEC. 2. IN GENERAL.         The first section of the Act of August 4, 1947 (61 Stat.       731, chapter 458), is amended--        (1) in the matter before subsection (a), by striking ``That       all restrictions'' and all that follows through subsection       (a) and inserting the following:        ``Sec. 1. (a) All restrictions against alienation,       conveyance, lease, mortgage, creation of liens, or other       encumbrances upon all lands, including oil and gas or other       mineral interests, in Oklahoma belonging to a lineal       descendant by blood of an original enrollee whose name       appears on the Final Indian Rolls of the Five Civilized       Tribes in Indian Territory, whether acquired by allotment,       inheritance, devise, gift, purchase, exchange, partition,       partition sale, or by purchase with restricted funds, of       whatever degree of Indian blood, and whether enrolled or       unenrolled, shall be and are hereby, extended until an Act of       Congress determines otherwise.        ``(b) The extension of restrictions described in subsection       (a) shall include without limitation, those interests in the       estate of a decedent Indian who died before the date of       enactment of the Stigler Act Amendments of 2018--        ``(1) if such interests were acquired by an heir or devisee       of one-half or more degree of Indian blood, as computed from       the nearest enrolled lineal ancestors of Indian blood       enrolled on the Final Rolls described in subsection (a), by       final order issued by an Oklahoma district court or a United       States district court determining the decedent's heirs or       devisees or otherwise determining the ownership of said       interests before said date; or        ``(2) if such interests were, immediately prior to the       decedent's death, subject to restrictions and had not, as of       said date, been--        ``(A) the subject of a final order issued by an Oklahoma       district court or a United States district court determining       the decedent's heirs or devisees or otherwise determining the       ownership of said interests;        ``(B) conveyed by the decedent's undetermined heirs or       devisees by deed approved by an Oklahoma district court; or        ``(C) conveyed by the decedent's undetermined heirs or       devisees of less than one-half degree of Indian blood with or       without Oklahoma district court approval.        ``Sec. 2. (a) Except as provided in subsection (f),       subsection (g), subsection (h), and subsection (i), no       conveyance, including an oil and gas or mineral lease, of any       interest in the restricted lands described in this section       shall be valid unless approved in open court by the district       court of the county in Oklahoma in which the land is       situated;'';        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by striking ``county judge'' and inserting ``district       judge''; and        (B) by striking ``Proceedings for approval of conveyances       by restricted heirs or devisees'' and inserting ``Proceedings       for approval of conveyances'';        (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``best interest of the       Indian'' and inserting ``best interest of the grantor''; and        (4) by adding before the period at the end the following:       ``; (h) nothing contained in this section shall limit or       affect the right of an Indian owner of restricted lands       described in this Act to seek and obtain Secretarial removal       of restrictions on all or any portion of said restricted       lands in accordance with any applicable Federal law; (i)       nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the       alienation, conveyance, lease, including oil and gas or other       mineral leases, mortgage, creation of liens, or other       encumbrance of any lands, if such action was effective before       the date of enactment of the Stigler Act Amendments of 2018       and valid under the law then in effect; and (j) in       determining the quantum of Indian blood of any Indian heir or       devisee, the Final Indian Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes       in Indian Territory as to such heir or devisee, if enrolled,       shall be conclusive of his or her quantum of Indian blood. If       unenrolled, his or her degree of Indian blood shall be       computed from the nearest enrolled lineal ancestors of Indian       blood enrolled on the Final Indian Rolls of the Five       Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory''.       SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.         The Act of August 4, 1947 (61 Stat. 731, chapter 458), is       amended--        (1) in section 5, by striking ``of one-half or more Indian       blood,'';        (2) in section 6(c)--        (A) by inserting ``purchase, partition sale,'' after       ``gift,'' each place it appears; and        (B) by striking ``of one-half or more Indian blood''; and        (3) in section 8, by striking ``of one-half or more Indian       blood,''.       SEC. 4. REPEALS.         The following are repealed:        (1) The first section of the Act of August 11, 1955 (69       Stat. 666, chapter 768).        (2) Section 2 of the Act of August 4, 1947 (61 Stat. 731,       chapter 458).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2606, the Stigler Act  Amendments of 2018.   The bill would amend the 1947 Stigler Act to remove the Indian blood  quantum requirement for certain land to be maintained in restricted fee  status for any member of the Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw Nation, Choctaw  Nation, Muscogee Creek Nation, and the Seminole Nation, which are  collectively known as the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma.   Under current law, when a person of less than one-half degree Indian  blood from one of the Five Tribes inherits an interest of an allotment  of land, the land can be taxed and be conveyed without approval of the  Secretary of the Interior.   Under H.R. 2606, restricted fee land currently owned by members of  the Five Tribes would remain in restricted status regardless of the  blood quantum of the owners.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for his tireless work on issues  impacting Indian Country, including this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6287) to provide competitive grants for the operation,  security, and maintenance of certain memorials to victims of the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6287         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR COVERED MEMORIALS.

(d) Availability.--Grant funds made available under this       section shall remain available until expended.        (e) Criteria.--In awarding grants under this section, the       Secretary shall give greatest weight in the selection of       eligible entities using the following criteria:        (1) The needs of the eligible entity, and ability and       commitment of the eligible entity to use grant funds, with       respect to ensuring the security and safety of visitors of       the covered memorial.        (2) The ability of the eligible entity to match the amount       of the grant, on at least a 1-to-1 basis, with non-Federal       assets from non-Federal sources, including cash or durable       goods and materials fairly valued, as determined by the       Secretary.  [[Page H8137]]         (3) The greatest number of visitors that would benefit.        (4) The ability and commitment of an eligible entity to use       grant funds--        (A) to preserve the grounds at the covered memorial; and        (B) to educate future generations.

(g) Reports.--Not later than 90 days after the end of each       calendar year for which an eligible entity obligates or       expends any amounts made available under a grant under this       section, the eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary       and the appropriate committees of Congress a report that--        (1) specifies the amount of grant funds obligated or       expended for the preceding fiscal year;        (2) specifies any purposes for which the funds were       obligated or expended; and        (3) includes any other information that the Secretary may       require to more effectively administer the grant program       under this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6287, offered by Congressman Tom MacArthur of New  Jersey, honors and memorializes the victims and heroes of September 11,  2001.   The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award grants  through a competitive process to nonprofit organizations for the  operation and maintenance of memorials to commemorate the events and  honor the victims of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.   It has been 17 years since that dark day in American history. The  National September 11th Memorial in New York City, the National 9/11  Pentagon Memorial just across the Potomac River in Virginia, and the  Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, stand as  solemn tributes and remembrances to the thousands of victims of those  attacks.   H.R. 6287 authorizes a competitive grant program for operation,  security, and maintenance of these memorials.   Throughout our Nation's history, Congress has stepped forward to  authorize operating funds in public-private partnership with  nongovernmental organizations for memorials and museums of national  significance. Like congressional authorizations of the Oklahoma City  National Memorial and Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial  Museum, and the Kennedy Center, a Federal authorization for grants in  support of 9/11 memorials at the sites of the attacks will help to  operate and maintain these sites of national remembrance and  reflection.   We should always remember and forever honor those who lost their  lives on that fateful day.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Representative MacArthur for his work on  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Every Kid in a Park program launched in 2015 as part of the  National Park Service's centennial anniversary to encourage the next  generation of park visitors. The program offers fourth graders and  their families free entrance to our national parks. To date, Every Kid  in a Park has enabled more than 350,000 fourth graders to use our  national parks and public lands as outdoor classrooms. I have  personally seen the positive impacts visiting national parks, historic  sites, and recreation areas can have on young people in my home State  of Montana.   Special places like Glacier National Park, Little Bighorn Battlefield  National Monument, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, and the  Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument will be more accessible  to fourth graders from all over the country with the passage of this  bill.   H.R. 3186 codifies this program by directing seven agencies to  jointly establish the Every Kid Outdoors program to provide any fourth  grader in the U.S. with a pass to gain free access to Federal lands and  waters. This includes the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of  Reclamation, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.

I appreciate you working with us on the base       text of the bill and request you urge the Speaker to name       members of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was a time of  significant transformation for the United States. Reconstruction  addressed how the 11 States that had left the Union would be  reestablished in Congress, as well as how the civil rights and  integration into a free society of 4 million formerly enslaved  individuals could be secured.   The Reconstruction Era National Monument was established by  Presidential declaration in January 2017 as a unit of the National Park  Service. It is located in Beaufort County, South Carolina, an area that  has been called the birthplace of Reconstruction.   In and around this area, some of the first African Americans enlisted  as soldiers and founded the first African American schools and  hospitals during Reconstruction.   This was also the home of Robert Smalls, a former slave who became a  political leader, serving on two State constitutional conventions: in  the State legislature and, ultimately, the U.S. Congress.   H.R. 5532 redesignates Reconstruction Era National Monument as the  Reconstruction Era National Historical Park and authorizes the  Secretary of the Interior to expand the park boundary. The bill also  establishes the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network, which  will connect similar sites across the country to promote education and  preservation efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 660) to require the Secretary of the Interior to submit to  Congress a report on the efforts of the Bureau of Reclamation to manage  its infrastructure assets.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bureau of Reclamation       Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for all Members  to have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 660 is bipartisan legislation introduced by  Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona.   For more than a century, the Bureau of Reclamation has transformed  the West into a powerhouse that feeds the Nation and the world, and  provides renewable and emissions-free energy for millions.   Bureau of Reclamation projects have proven to be critical to the  American way of life in the West, and we must ensure their protection  for future generations. This means having open and honest discussions  about the challenges the Bureau of Reclamation faces maintaining and  repairing these projects.   To that end, H.R. 660 is a bipartisan bill that requires the Federal  Government to make public in a unified way the estimated cost of  repairs for reclamation facilities. The American public has asked for  and deserves laws that reflect transparency and open discussion. H.R.  660 delivers that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his work on this.  I urge adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4689) to authorize early repayment of obligations to the  Bureau of Reclamation within the Northport Irrigation District in the  State of Nebraska.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4689         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(d) Effect.--Nothing in this section--        (1) modifies any contractual rights under, or amends or       reopens, the reclamation contract between the District and       the United States; or        (2) modifies any rights, obligations, or relationships       between the District and landowners in the District under       Nebraska State law.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Mr. Smith for his  work on this bill, and I yield back the remainder of my time.     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.  [[Page H8145]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5317) to repeal section 2141 of the Revised Statutes to  remove the prohibition on certain alcohol manufacturing on Indian  lands, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6040) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey  certain land and facilities of the Central Valley Project, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6040 would transfer the Contra Costa Canal to the  Contra Costa County Water District. Contra Costa seeks to enclose the  earthen canal to increase water supply availability and improve public  safety.   Officials in the region have documented 81 instances where  individuals have drowned from falling into the canal, but, currently,  Contra Costa faces financial and bureaucratic challenges to conducting  this important upgrade because it doesn't have title to the canal.   This bill would allow local water users who best understand the  unique challenges of the area to determine what is right for them. H.R.  6040 is not only advantageous to local beneficiaries, but it is also a  relief to the American taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  tragic epidemic that impacts too many Montanans and Americans.   Suicide rates are increasing across the country. On average, a  Montanan dies by suicide every 33 hours. Suicide is now the eighth  leading cause of death in Montana. The Centers for Disease Control  recently reported a 30 percent increase in suicide rates in the last 20  years, with nearly 45,000 Americans taking their own lives in 2016.   Veterans account for almost 20 percent of all suicides in the United  States. Suicide rates amongst farmers have been increasing.   We, however, can reverse the trajectory of one of the leading causes  of death in this country.   There is good news coming out of Montana. The Billings Clinic, which  I recently toured, announced it will launch Montana's first psychiatric  residency program. This will expand access to mental healthcare for our  more rural areas.   I speak out today during Suicide Prevention Week because suicide is  preventable. Access to crisis resources saves lives. Mental and  behavioral health research saves lives. Ending the stigma surrounding  suicide saves lives                            ____________________
