 Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 987,  Stephen Henley Locher, of Iowa, to be United States District Judge for  the Southern District of Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, following my submission yesterday, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the next part of an  investigation directed by the U.S. Central Command concerning the Abbey  Gate bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         ACTS-SCK-DO        SUBJECT: Findings and Recommendation--Attack Against U.S.       Forces Conducting NEO at Hamid Karzai International Airport       on 26 August 2021        (r) The SPMAGTF EOD Team, attached to 2/1, conducted a post       blast analysis at 0620 on 27 August with U.K. Forces EOD and       Taliban security (exhibits 5, 65). EOD concluded the blast       was either a vest or backpack detonated on the far side of       the canal held above the waist, directly across from 1st       Platoon, Golf Company Marines (exhibit 5). EOD deduced this       location from the fragmentation pattern in the nearside canal       wall, fragmentation in the PSYOP vehicle, and blast burns on       the wall on the far side of the canal (exhibit 5). The       fragmentation from the vest or backpack was primarily ball       bearings (exhibits 5, 95). Open source news reported the       Taliban had recently freed the individual bomber, (TEXT       REDACTED) on 15 August from the Parwan Detention Facility       near Bagram Air Base (exhibit 165). The investigation found       no evidence to support a conclusion the bomber used U.S.       identification to clear Taliban checkpoints on the approaches       to the Abbey Gate canal. There were multiple avenues of       approach to the canal, continuously used by Afghans to bypass       Taliban checkpoints (exhibits 76, 102). The bomber likely       used one of these avenues. Further, no Marine mentioned that       any person used U.S. identification to move closer to their       position in relation to the attack.        (s) There was no complex attack; it was a single suicide       bomber not accompanied by enemy small arms fire.        (i) Immediately following the blast, nearly all Marines and       personnel reported small arms fire (see all exhibits with 2/1       Marines, 24th MEU). There is wide variation of thought on       where the firing originated and who was actually doing the       firing. Many Marines described personnel near the canal as       the source of outgoing small arms fire immediately following       the blast. Many Marines, to  [[Page S3368]]       include snipers in the tower, also recall fire from the       Chevron area into the outer gate and from the East (see all       exhibits with 2/1 Marines, 24th MEU). Marines from Golf       Company described seeing individuals on a roof near a water       tank to their east, one with a camera and one with a rifle       (exhibits 86, 87). These Marines stated they fired on the       individuals after confirming they posed a threat, and that       they suppressed the threat (exhibits 86, 87, 88). Golf       Company Marines reported U.K. Forces occupied the position in       that building shortly after the attack, but (TEXT REDACTED) 2       PARA, stated his soldiers never occupied a position in that       building (exhibits 86, 87, 88, 127, 148). Several key leaders       from 2/1 stated it was unlikely Marines received fire from       the East, as Taliban members had occupied those buildings       throughout the NEO (exhibits 53, 76, 77). The 2/1 Marines S2       stated that friendly forces occupied all elevated positions       around Abbey Gate (exhibit 76). Soldiers from the 82nd       Airborne Division provided overwatch of Abbey Gate from a       tower 75 meters north of the outer gate tower. (TEXT       REDACTED) was in the tower during and after the blast, and       was confident small arms fire came from the vicinity of the       Barron Hotel and not the Chevron or the East (exhibit 144).       (TEXT REDACTED) also had visual of one Afghan civilian on a       rooftop near Abbey Gate, but this individual posed no threat       (exhibit 144). It is unlikely Marines received fire from       buildings to the East of Abbey Gate. If they did, it was far       more likely to have originated from a rogue Taliban member,       than it was part of a complex attack.        (ii) Marines who reported hearing small arms fire after the       blast most likely heard friendly warning shots. Golf Company,       2/1 Marines specifically identified members of the Recon       Company, 24th MEU as shooting from near the canal after the       explosion (exhibits 77, 87, 88). (TEXT REDACTED) of the 2nd       Marine Recon Company, stated during their interview that       (TEXT REDACTED) fired unsuppressed warning shots (two       hammered pairs) at an individual who positioned himself to       observe the Marines' reaction to the blast and had been in       the crowd acting suspiciously before the blast (exhibit       106, 184, 237). (TEXT REDACTED) fired the rounds       southwest, down the canal, toward the Barron Hotel. The       rounds would have crossed the frontage of Marines, who       were entering the canal to recover casualties and take up       security positions, which would have contributed to their       perception that they were taking fire (106, 237). No       Marines beyond the Recon element Staff NCOs, and those       firing at the individuals near the water tank, describe       having positive identification of any targets (exhibits       62, 66, 86, 87, 88, 106). This includes the snipers in the       Abbey Gate tower and Soldiers in the tower to the North,       who had the best vantage point (exhibit 62, 144).        (iii) In addition to the Recon element firing warning       shots, (TEXT REDACTED) 2 PARA, confirmed U.K. Troops fired       warning shots to help control the crowd in vicinity of the       Barron Hotel (exhibits 127, 148). The Bravo Company, 2/501       PIR (TEXT REDACTED) was in the outer corridor, south of the       blast area, and described seeing two U.K. Soldiers firing       their weapons at a 45-degree angle into the air, towards the       northeast (exhibit 124). These roundsalso would have crossed       in front of Golf 2/1 Marines, contributing to their confusion       about taking fire.        (iv) Claims by the Marines to have heard or felt fire       originating from outside Abbey Gate should be attributed to       both the 2 PARA and Marine Recon personnel firing warning       shots, and their potential for disorientation post blast       (exhibits 76, 95, 106, 127, 148). Many of the Marines we       interviewed were at Abbey Gate. The vast majority of those       Marines were within the blast radius and suffered potential       TBIs or concussions from the event (exhibits 62, 63, 77, 88,       91, 92, 93, 95, 164). There was a tremendous amount of smoke,       and tear gas canisters were ruptured and pouring chemicals       into the blast area, further limiting visibility, and       responsiveness (exhibits 63, 89, 127), Nearby observers noted       the overwhelming noise from the wounded and civilian crowd       fleeing the area (exhibit 148). Marines at the canal were       already exhausted and were now experiencing sensory overload       (exhibits 77, 127). It is unknown whom Marines engaged       holding a weapon on a rooftop immediately following the       blast, or even if this actually occurred. (exhibits 76, 77,       87, 88). During the interviews, fellow Marines expressed       skepticism and doubt about possible positive identification       of targets (exhibits 87, 88). It is worth noting the only       Marines who reported receiving fire following the explosion       were junior Marines, with no prior combat experience. (TEXT       REDACTED) and other leaders concluded there was no complex       attack, merely the belief there was one (exhibits 53, 76, 77,       102, 148).        (t) Interviews with Marines at Abbey Gate post-attack       revealed no information supporting a conclusion fratricide or       civilian casualties resulted from reaction to the blast. Open       source research found no reporting to support a conclusion       warning shots or engagement of targets in response to the       attack caused additional harm to civilians. Marines did       report stopping civilians from running through the gate after       the attack, and presenting deadly force to stop civilians       with bags from approaching or using hones, but no shots were       fired in these instances (exhibited 63). A Platoon (TEXT       REDACTED) from 2/1 Marines, (TEXT REDACTED) stated during a       group interviewed he witnessed a flash bang grenade detonate       near a civilian's head (exhibit 84). He stated the incident       did not appear intentional and assumed the injury resulted in       death (exhibit 84). This incident took place during the       confrontation at Abbey Gate on 20 August between Golf Company       and unruly civilians who breached the gate (exhibit 84).       (TEXT REDACTED) Surgeon at the Role II-E, recalled treating a       civilian with an eye injury that may have been from Abbey       Gate (exhibit 128).        (u) The reaction to the blast, and the immediate CASEVAC,       by the 2/1 Marines, and adjacent Army and Marine units, were       nothing short of incredible. All wounded personnel were       evacuated from the canal blast site to the inner gate CCP in       15 minutes (exhibit 53). All the wounded were evacuated by       vehicle to the Role II-E at North HKIA in less than one hour       (exhibit 66). Marines flooded the blast area, worked through       tear gas, and expeditiously moved over 30 personnel nearly       100 meters to the CCP (exhibits 62, 63, 64, 65, 76, 77, 88,       92). Marines used riot control shields as makeshift litters       and a Marine immediately cut multiple holes in the fence to       shorten the distance from the blast site to the CCP (exhibits       62, 63, 88, 92). At the CCP, Navy corpsmen, and Marines with       additional medical training, were assessing and stabilizing       the wounded rapidly (exhibits 63, 77, 98, 144). The situation       was chaotic. With many leaders injured, it was difficult to       determine if anyone was truly in charge, but collectively the       task of triage and movement was successfully accomplished       (exhibits 53, 57, 66, 76. 77, 78, 90, 98,124, 128, 131). At       least twenty vehicles rotated through Abbey Gate to move the       wounded either to the SPMAGTF's STP Role I-E facility,       positioned between Abbey and East Gates, or directly to the       Role II-E at North HKIA (exhibits 66, 124). The STP Role I-E       facility treated four urgent surgical patients, to include 2/      1 Marine (TEXT REDACTED) during the MASCAL event (exhibit       66). The STP also treated injured Afghan civilians for over       an hour and half after the attack (exhibit 66). All wounded       from Abbey Gate were evacuated from HKIA rearward to CONUS by       0700 on 27 August.        (v) After the blast and recovery of all Marines and U.S.       personnel, (TEXT REDACTED) Echo Company (TEXT REDACTED) took       control of the outer gate, closed the gate and focused on       internal security (exhibits 56, 77) (TEXT REDACTED) focused       internally on his company, which sustained heavy casualties       (exhibit 77). The SPMAGTF EOD Team attached to 2/1 conducted       a search for secondary devices and sensitive items after the       gate was closed (exhibit 65). U.K. Forces took over security       of the canal and outer corridor, but the blast dispersed the       crowd considerably (exhibits 15, 17, 18, 53, 56, 65, 77). At       approximately 0200 on 27 August, (TEXT REDACTED) Bravo       Company, 2/501 PIR, began to transition his company into       Abbey Gate to relieve Echo Company and 2/1 Marines (exhibit       124). By 0500, Bravo Company had taken responsibility for       security of Abbey Gate (exhibit 124). U.K. Forces did not       complete their operations at Barron Hotel and fully       retrograde through the inner gate of Abbey Gate until 0700       (exhibits 124, 127).        (w) 2/1 Marines consolidated in North HKIA and received the       task of demilitarizing equipment in preparation for the JTE       (exhibits 54, 57, 77). At approximately 1300 on 27 August,       they attended the Ramp Ceremony and the KIA from the blast       were evacuated rearward (exhibits 14, 54, 100). Before       departing HKIA, but after completion of demilitarization, 2/1       Marines were tasked to police call the PAX Terminal area of       trash and debris (exhibits 54, 56). 2/1 Marines perceived       this order to be punishment for some of their excessive       demilitarization efforts, namely defacing and breaking       property that was not supposed to be broken (exhibit 56). MG       Donahue specifically commented on the excessive destruction       by 2/1 Marines, stating DoS and 82nd had to intervene       (exhibit 125). He overtly noted Golf Company Marines, led by       (TEXT REDACTED) were not involved in the destruction and had       set the standard for all units operating at the gates       throughout the NEO (exhibit 125). The 2/1 Marines departed in       two groups, with Fox Company (-), Golf Company, and Weapons       Company departing for Camp Buehring, Kuwait on 28 August and       2/1 Battalion HQ with Echo Company departing on 29 August for       PSAB (exhibit 54).        c. Force Protection, specifically including pertinent       issues associated with; Force Posture. and Gate Operations.        (1) Key Finding. The attack was not preventable at the       tactical level without degrading the mission to maximize the       number of evacuees.        (2) Force Posture        (a) Manning. Abbey Gate was operated by 2/1 Marines       throughout the NEO (exhibits 53, 56, 77,100). On 19 August,       Golf Company consisted of three platoons, and was reinforced       by two additional platoons of Fox Company, when they       established operations at Abbey Gate (exhibits 77, 81). From       19-22 August, Golf Company was responsible for Abbey Gate and       relieved by Echo Company on 22 August (exhibits 56, 77). From       22-25 August, Echo Company, with four platoons, reinforced by       two Weapons Company platoons, was responsible for Abbey Gate.       At approximately 1600 on 25 August, Golf Company reinforced       by Fox Company platoons, resumed responsibility of Abbey Gate       (exhibits 56, 77). Echo Company, reinforced by Weapons       Company platoons, was tasked to prepare Abbey Gate for       closure and RIP with 1/82 IBCT (exhibits 56, 57). On the       afternoon of 26 August,  [[Page S3369]]       the size and aggressiveness of the crowd increased (exhibits       53, 56, 77). (TEXT REDACTED) tasked Echo Company to assume       operation of the inner corridor to facilitate Golf Company's       need to allocate more platoons for crowd control in the outer       corridor (exhibits 53, 56, 77). At the time of the blast,       approximately seven platoons were operating Abbey Gate. This       consisted of three from Golf Company, two from Fox Company,       and two from Echo Company (exhibits 53, 56, 77, 81). Steady       state manning was generally five to six platoons (exhibits       53, 56, 77).        (b) Rest Cycle. Companies rotated between Abbey Gate, QRF,       rest, and evacuee security for those waiting for processing       or flights (exhibits 53, 56, 57, 77). While establishing the       gate, rest cycles were initially by opportunity only,       resulting in infrequent and short periods for Marines to       sleep during 72-hour periods at the gate (exhibits 53, 56,       57, 77). After gate operations normalized, the companies were       able to establish a sustainable rest cycle, with one platoon       rotating to a rest shift for six or eight hours (exhibits 53,       56, 77, 81). Because of the tempo of operations, all units at       HKIA experienced challenges establishing rest cycles       (exhibits 13, 15, 53, 57, 76).        (c) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Marines at Abbey       Gate consistently maintained full PPE while working in the       outer corridor and canal areas (exhibits 54, 89, 98). PPE       included plate carrier, small arms protective inserts (SAPI),       eye protection, ballistic helmet, and issued combat gloves       (exhibit 55, 89, 98). Marines could remove PPE during rest       periods. In the inner corridor, behind protective cover       (exhibits 83, 89). Marines occasionally removed their helmets       to humanize themselves and deescalate confrontations with       civilian evacuees (exhibits 83, 89). Marines affected by the       blast were universally wearing their PPE, as evidenced by       statements, autopsy results, and JTAPIC analysis (exhibits       77, 83, 89, 138, 145). The one known exception was (TEXT       REDACTED) 1st Platoon (TEXT REDACTED). At the time of the       blast, he removed his helmet to engage with a civilian       evacuee at the canal wall (exhibit 83, 92). JTAPIC analysis       demonstrated helmets and SAPls were effective in stopping all       fragmentation (exhibit 138).        (d) Crowd Control Measures. The most effective method of       crowd control was physical presence and interaction by       Marines with the crowds (exhibits 56, 77, 80, 129).       Professional actions, verbal commands, physical force, and       riot control shields prevented crowds from breaching the gate       (exhibits 56, 77, 80, 89). Forces utilized warning shots with       varying degrees of success at HKIA (exhibits 53, 54, 100,       117, 118). 2/1 Marines did not use warning shots and only       used flash bang grenades infrequently (exhibits 53, 54, 77,       80, 83). The employment of riot control agents (RCAs), such       as tear gas, required 0-6 approval for use in defensive       situations (exhibit 116, 117). 2/1 Marines employed cross       cultural engagement and de-escalation with the civilian       population to establish calm and decrease aggressiveness       (exhibits 57, 77). The employment of PSYOP capabilities       served to enhance the 2/1 Marines' techniques by       communicating threat warnings, document requirements, and       advisements for safety and temporary closures (exhibits 105,       129).        (e) Force Protection Measures. Abbey Gate Corridor provided       some natural force protection and required additional effort       by 2/1 Marines to enhance survivability.        (i) The canal running southwest to northeast initially       served as a natural obstacle. The canal was approximately       three meters wide and two-three meters deep, and held       approximately a foot of water throughout the NEO (exhibits       172, 176-178, 192). The wall and fence of Abbey Gate bordered       the canal on the northwest, or nearside, and a wall and fence       on the opposite side divided the area from private property,       which created a long alley (exhibits 167, 172, 176-178, 192).       The canal walls rose approximately three feet above the       ground on each side, providing protection to Marines on one       side, and creating an obstacle for the crowd on the other       side (exhibits 167, 172, 173, 175, 177, 178, 192). Jersey       barriers were located at the base of the sniper tower to       impede the flow of civilians from approaching the gate on the       nearside of the canal (exhibits 167, 172, 177, 178, 180, 182,       185, 192). The terrain limited the crowd from massing and       overwhelming Marine formations (exhibits 167, 172, 175-178,       192).        (ii) 2/1 Marines made a significant improvement to force       protection when they emplaced the shipping containers, known       as the Chevron (exhibit 83, 89). This obstacle blocked the       road leading to Abbey Gate from the South, reducing risk of       VBIEDs and controlling the in-flow of crowds (exhibits 15,       18, 53, 77, 89). Another improvement was installation of       concertina wire across the nearside canal wall to prevent       civilians from climbing out of the canal (exhibits 167, 172,       176-178, 192). Snipers continuously operated from the tower       to provide overwatch of Marines executing screening and to       observe the crowd for potential risks to force (exhibit 62),       The SPMAGTF EOD section installed two ECM devices at Abbey       Gate to prevent the use of remote control detonated IEDs and       inhibit the cell phone communications of potential attackers       (exhibit 62, 65). When threat streams indicated an impending       attack, commanders regularly stopped processing evacuees,       pulled Marines back to cover, and reduced posture (exhibits       19, 77, 80, 89), Leaders utilized UAVs and RAID cameras to       observe avenues of approach and maintain situational       awareness to employ QRF for emergencies (exhibits 13, 15, 18,       54, 102, 125).                            ____________________
