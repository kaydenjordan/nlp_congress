 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the efforts of  the town of Rayville, Louisiana, and the Eula D. Britton Alumni  Association to preserve their community's heritage.   The only part of Eula D. Britton school still standing is its  gymnasium, but that didn't stop the 1960 graduate class from doing  something good. Quincy Mason, who is in the audience today, and the  rest of the alumni association purchased and turned it into a museum,  showcasing the school's history.   First known as Rayville Colored School, its first class of 11  students graduated in 1939. It was renamed Rayville Rosenwald High  School in 1949, and eventually Eula D. Britton High School in 1956  after its long-serving principal, Eula D. Britton.   In 2014, Quincy Mason, who is present here today in the House  gallery, as I said, had the idea to petition for a historical marker to  commemorate the school's history for generations to come. This year, on  July 3, it will become a reality when the marker is dedicated by its  alumni association.   The town of Rayville, Louisiana, is proud of Quincy Mason, who went  on to play professional baseball for the Chicago Cubs organization and  was inducted into the Southern University Sports Hall of Fame in 2015.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the town of Rayville and the  Eula D. Britton Alumni Association for their efforts to preserve their  community's rich history.                           Thanking Ronnie Anderson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Mr. Ronnie Anderson  for his 51 years of service to Louisiana farmers and ranchers.   After graduating from LSU in 1970 with a degree in animal science,  Ronnie returned home to work on his family's farm. He quickly became  involved in the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation and was elected  president of his parish chapter shortly thereafter.   In 1989, he was elected president of the statewide farm bureau, and  he has been elected an additional 31 times since.   I have known Ronnie personally for many, many years as a farmer  myself, and it has always been clear to me that he loves Louisiana  agriculture. When I was elected to Congress, I came to rely on his  counsel to advocate for our farmers and ranchers.   During his tenure, the Louisiana Farm Bureau has grown from 67,000  members to more than 148,000, and Ronnie still raises several hundred  head of cattle, as well as horses, hay, and timber, on his farm in East  and West Feliciana Parishes in my congressional district.   In addition to his work at home and with the farm bureau, Ronnie has  served for all but 2 years since 1997 on the Louisiana State University  Board of Supervisors.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Ronnie Anderson for his many,  many years of service to Louisiana and wish him well as he retires  after 31 years as president of the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation.                            ____________________
