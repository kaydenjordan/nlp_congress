 I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I take this time to explain why I voted to  convict the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, of the  Article of Impeachment presented by the House of Representatives in  regards to the incitement of insurrection.   Throughout his Presidency, Donald J. Trump has violated his oath of  office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United  States. There are many examples that I can give of how he has violated  his oath of office. I could also cite the basis of the first Articles  of Impeachment that were tried last year as violating his oath of  office. But, by far, the most egregious violation of his oath of office  took place in his incitement of insurrection that occurred with the  attack on this Capitol on January 6.   But it started well before January 6. The seeds were planted a long  time ago and even before the November elections, when President Trump  pointed out, when the polls were showing that he might lose in the  election, that he refused to acknowledge that he would accept the  election results if he lost. He didn't say that once before the  November elections, he said it on several occasions. He talked about a  rigged election. He talked about a fraudulent election. He talked about  the election being ``taken away from us''--the victory--with no  evidence of voter fraud.   One of the key provisions of our Constitution, of our democracy, is  the peaceful transition of power. Donald Trump called that into  question prior to the November 3 elections.    Then came the November 3 elections, and, shortly thereafter, Joe  Biden was declared to be the winner. Why? Because he had the most  votes--most populace votes--over 7 million. But he was declared the  winner because of the electoral votes, 306 to 232. By the way, that is  the same electoral margin that Donald Trump won 4 years earlier and  which Donald Trump called a ``landslide.''   But then came the legal challenges by President Trump. He didn't  accept the electoral vote or the declared elections. And he has his  right to contest the elections in the court by asking for recounts or  asking for challenges, but in every one of those cases, he could  [[Page S737]]  not establish widespread fraud that would have changed the results in  any one of the States, let alone enough electoral vote changes to  change the outcome of the election.   But did he stop after he was denied relief in all of those legal  challenges? The answer is no. He further contested by trying to  inappropriately interfere with State election officials and State  public officials, urging them to take action to change the  certification results.   Now, we have many examples that during this period of time he was  talking about a fraudulent election, a stolen election, all the  different things about raising questions as to the legitimacy of the  voices of people of this Nation. We have so many examples of his  interference, but we actually have the tape of his conversation with  the Georgia secretary of state that we all heard and heard how the  President tried to intimidate and threaten the secretary of state of  Georgia in order to change the certified election results from the  votes of the people of Georgia--clear examples of how President Trump  violated his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of  the United States.   But that wasn't the end of it. He went to his Department of Justice  believing the Department of Justice is his Department of Justice, not  the Department of Justice of the United States of America. Now, let's  remember that the Department of Justice had found no widespread  corruption. In fact, they had determined this was one of the freest  elections and one of the least problem elections that we have had. It  didn't stop President Trump from trying to intimidate and order his  Department of Justice to conduct an additional investigation to find  fraud to overturn the will of the people--once again, violating his  oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.   He continued to do this, contrary to his constitutional obligations.  ``Corrupt election,'' ``stop the steal,'' ``rigged elections,''  ``tremendous fraud''--all words that he used after the November 3  election. He knew what he was saying was a lie. He knew there was no  widespread fraud, but he continued to use the Office of the Presidency  and his voice to promote the big lie, and he knew his followers would  believe it. He knew he could convince his loyal followers to believe  that this was a rigged election--a stolen election--again, compromising  our democracy and the will of the people to determine who our leaders  are. And he knew his followers would be motivated to action because he  knew he could motivate his followers.   He put himself before the Nation and before his responsibilities as  President of the United States. He put his own self-interest above his  responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States and to the  people of this Nation.   And then he summoned his loyal following to Washington on January 6.  He knew they would come. He knew dangerous people were in the group. He  knew the Proud Boys were there, to which he had directly said: ``Stand  back and stand by.'' He knew that they were ready for violent action.   And then he incited the mob to action on January 6. We know the words  that he used. We saw the videos as part of the record of the  impeachment trial. ``We will never surrender,'' ``we will never  concede,'' ``we will stop the steal,'' ``stolen election''--all words  that he had been using during the entire 2020 election cycle,  particularly when he thought he was going to lose.   But the most damning part of the President's violation of his oath of  office--the most serious part--is what he did and did not do after  seeing the violence erupt in the United States Capitol. After the  Capitol was penetrated, after we saw the violence being committed,  where we knew that the Members of Congress were in danger, the Vice  President of the United States was in danger, the people that work here  were in danger, all the people that were in the Capitol legitimately  were in danger--we all saw that--and the President of the United States  knew that, and he did nothing to stop the violence. He could have  called off his loyalists and told them to get out of the Capitol. He  didn't do that. He could have sent in the National Guard in order to  protect us. He didn't do that. And he never condemned the participants  in this mob in penetrating the Capitol for what they did.   I am going to sort of summarize my feeling about that by agreeing  with Representative Liz Cheney, the House Republican caucus chair, who  said it on the floor of the House. Let me just quote her statement:         The President of the United States summoned this mob,       assembled this mob, and lit the flame of this attack.       Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would       have happened without the President. The President could have       immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence.       He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a       President of the United States of his office and his oath to       the Constitution.    I agree with that. President Trump violated his oath of office to  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. He violated  that.   But let's take a look at what he did do after knowing the violence  that occurred--his tweet of 2:24 p.m. Now, this is after the Vice  President had been removed from presiding in the Chamber, after he knew  the violence that was taking place in the Capitol of the United States.  He was aware of all that. He knew that we had shut down the operations  of the House and the Senate, that there was violence taking place  within the Capitol, and that his Vice President was the target of that  attack. And what he tweeted at 2:24 p.m.--I am quoting the President:  ``Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done  to protect our country.'' He inflamed the group even more to violence  after he knew that it was a violent circumstance.   He had known violence had taken place, and we heard put into the  record of the impeachment trial today Congresswoman Beutler's report of  Majority Leader McCarthy's conversation, which, again, is during this  period of time. Here we are. The Republican leader of the House of  Representatives gets the President on the phone. He says: Mr.  President, we are being attacked. My office is being broken into. We  need help. Send the Guard. Take care of us.   And then President Trump said something like: Well, it is not my  supporters. It is some leftwing group.   And Leader McCarthy said: No, Mr. President, these are your  supporters who are doing this.   And what did the leader say? What did the President say? I guess,  Kevin, these people are more upset about the election than you are.   Here we have the Members of Congress in harm's way, and the President  is talking about the support for those who are causing the violence and  putting his own interest above the safety of the people whom he is  sworn to protect as our Commander in Chief.   And then, at the end of the day, about 6 o'clock, he sends out a  tweet that really sums up his feelings about what these people were  doing. Now, these are people who came into the Capitol. They killed  people. They hurt people. They stole property. They damaged property.  They invaded the Capitol of the United States. They hurt law  enforcement officers. They hurt all of us. They hurt our democracy. So  how does the President sum up the day? His tweet:         These are the things that happen when a sacred landslide       victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away       from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated       for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day       forever!    He was repeating the big lie and saying the day was a day of  celebration when it was one of the bleakest days, dark days in the  history of our Nation. That is what President Trump did, rather than  bringing in the National Guard, rather than telling his people to go  home, rather than being concerned about the safety of the Vice  President and the Members of Congress as the President of the United  States should have been doing.   He violated his oath of office over and over and over again--a  pattern of practice that we have seen for so long. It clearly  establishes that he incited an insurrection against our country--that  the facts included as a basis for the Article of Impeachment brought to  us by the House of Representatives have been proven.   The purpose of impeachment is not just the accountability for the  President but also to protect our Constitution and to make sure this  conduct never happens again. No one is above  [[Page S738]]  the law, including the President of the United States. Everyone who was  responsible for the insurrection that occurred on January 6 should be  held accountable--from those who broke into the Capitol and caused the  harm and damage to the President of the United States who incited the  violence.   That is why I voted to convict President Trump of the Article of  Impeachment for inciting an insurrection, and that is why I would have  voted for disqualifying him from ever holding an office of trust again.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a copy  of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship rules of  procedure be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee                           Rules--117th Congress                                 Jurisdiction         Per Rule XXV(1) of the Standing Rules of the Senate:        (1) Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to       which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation,       messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to       the Small Business Administration;        (2) Any proposed legislation reported by such committee       which relates to matters other than the functions of the       Small Business Administration shall, at the request of the       chairman of any standing committee having jurisdiction over       the subject matter extraneous to the functions of the Small       Business Administration, be considered and reported by such       standing committee prior to its consideration by the Senate;       and likewise measures reported by other committees directly       relating to the Small Business Administration shall, at the       request of the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and       Entrepreneurship, be referred to the Committee on Small       Business and Entrepreneurship for its consideration of any       portion of the measure dealing with the Small Business       Administration and be reported by this committee prior to its       consideration by the Senate.        (3) Such committee shall also study and survey by means of       research and investigation all problems of American small       business enterprises, and report thereon from time to time.                              Rules of Procedure       General        All applicable provisions of the Standing Rules of the       Senate, the Senate Resolutions, and the Legislative       Reorganization Acts of 1946 and of 1970 (as amended), shall       govern the Committee.      Meetings        (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee shall be the       first Wednesday of each month unless otherwise directed by       the Chair. All other meetings may be called by the Chair as       he or she deems necessary, on 5 business days notice where       practicable. If at least three Members of the Committee       desire the Chair to call a special meeting, they may file in       the office of the Committee a written request therefore,       addressed to the Chair. Immediately thereafter, the Clerk of       the Committee shall notify the Chair of such request. If,       within 3 calendar days after the filing of such request, the       Chair fails to call the requested special meeting, which is       to be held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such       request, a majority of the Committee Members may file in the       Office of the Committee their written notice that a special       Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date, hour and       place thereof, and the Committee shall meet at that time and       place. Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Clerk       of the Committee shall notify all Committee Members that such       special meeting will be held and inform them of its date,       hour and place. If the Chair is not present at any regular,       additional or special meeting, such member of the Committee       as the Chair shall designate shall preside. For any meeting       or hearing of the Committee, the Ranking Member may delegate       to any Minority Member the authority to serve as Ranking       Member, and that Minority Member shall be afforded all the       rights and responsibilities of the Ranking Member for the       duration of that meeting or hearing. Notice of any       designation shall be provided to the Chief Clerk as early as       practicable.        (b) It shall not be in order for the Committee to consider       any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure       under consideration by the Committee unless an electronic       copy of such amendment has been delivered to the Clerk of the       Committee at least 2 business days prior to the meeting.       Following receipt of all amendments, the Clerk shall       disseminate the amendments to all Members of the Committee.       This subsection may be waived by agreement of the Chair and       Ranking Member or by a majority vote of the members of the       Committee.      Quorums        (a)(1) A majority of the Members of the Committee shall       constitute a quorum for reporting any legislative measure or       nomination.        (2) One-third of the Members of the Committee shall       constitute a quorum for the transaction of routine business,       provided that one Minority Member is present. The term       ``routine business'' includes, but is not limited to, the       consideration of legislation pending before the Committee and       any amendments thereto, and voting on such amendments, and       steps in an investigation including, but not limited to,       authorizing the issuance of a subpoena.        (3) In hearings, whether in public or closed session, a       quorum for the asking of testimony, including sworn       testimony, shall consist of one Member of the Committee.        (b) Proxies will be permitted in voting upon the business       of the Committee. A Member who is unable to attend a business       meeting may submit a proxy vote on any matter, in writing, or       though oral or written personal instructions to a Member of       the Committee or staff. Proxies shall in no case be counted       for establishing a quorum.  [[Page S741]]           Nominations        In considering a nomination, the Committee shall conduct an       investigation or review of the nominee's experience,       qualifications, suitability, and integrity to serve in the       position to which he or she has been nominated. In any       hearings on the nomination, the nominee shall be called to       testify under oath on all matters relating to his or her       nomination for office. To aid in such investigation or       review, each nominee may be required to submit a sworn       detailed statement including biographical, financial, policy,       and other information which the Committee may request. The       Committee may specify which items in such statement are to       be received on a confidential basis.      Hearings, Subpoenas, & Legal Counsel        (a)(1) The Chair of the Committee may initiate a hearing of       the Committee on his or her authority or upon his or her       approval of a request by any Member of the Committee. If such       request is by the Ranking Member, a decision shall be       communicated to the Ranking Member within 7 business days.       Written notice of all hearings, including the title, a       description of the hearing, and a tentative witness list       shall be given at least 5 business days in advance, where       practicable, to all Members of the Committee.        (2) Hearings of the Committee shall not be scheduled       outside the District of Columbia unless specifically       authorized by the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member or by       consent of a majority of the Committee. Such consent may be       given informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing.        (b)(1) Any Member of the Committee shall be empowered to       administer the oath to any witness testifying as to fact.        (2) The Chair and Ranking Member shall be empowered to call       an equal number of witnesses to a Committee hearing. Subject       to Senate Standing Rule 26(4)(d), such number shall exclude       any Administration witness unless such witness would be the       sole hearing witness, in which case the Ranking Member shall       be entitled to invite one witness. The preceding two       sentences shall not apply when a witness appears as the       nominee. Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be       conducted on behalf of the Committee by Members of the       Committee or such Committee staff as is authorized by the       Chair or Ranking Minority Member.        (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file       with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the       prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of       the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this       requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority       Member.        (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may       be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who       shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise       the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain       counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and       testifying.        (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the       production of memoranda, documents, records, and other       materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of       the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority       of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given       informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The       Chair may subpoena attendance or production without the       consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chair has not       received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of       disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified       of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and       holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the       Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena       for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the       purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the       witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production       of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall       identify the papers or materials required to be produced with       as much particularity as is practicable.        (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of       privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to       subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in       hearings.        (f) Testimony may be submitted to the formal record for a       period not less than two weeks following a hearing or       roundtable, unless otherwise agreed to by Chair and Ranking       Member.      Confidential Information        (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential       material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or       any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or       confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a       subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or       by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the       Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted       to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the Chair       with the consent of the Ranking Member.        (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or       materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly       designate them as such on their face. Designation of       submissions as confidential does not prevent their use in       furtherance of Committee business.      Media & Broadcasting        (a) At the discretion of the Chair, public meetings of the       Committee may be televised, broadcasted, or recorded in whole       or in part by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or an       employee of the Senate. Any such person wishing to televise,       broadcast, or record a Committee meeting must request       approval of the Chair by submitting a written request to the       Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day before the meeting. Notice       of televised or broadcasted hearings shall be provided to the       Ranking Minority Member as soon as practicable.        (b) During public meetings of the Committee, any person       using a camera, microphone, or other electronic equipment may       not position or use the equipment in a way that interferes       with the seating, vision, or hearing of Committee members or       staff on the dais, or with the orderly process of the       meeting.      Subcommittees        The Committee shall not have standing subcommittees.      Amendment of Rules        The foregoing rules may be added to, modified or amended;       provided, however, that not less than a majority of the       entire Membership so determined at a regular meeting with due       notice, or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.                            ____________________
