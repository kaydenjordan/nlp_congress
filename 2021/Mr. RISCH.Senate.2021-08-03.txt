 Madam President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month, I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to honor K & T Steel  Corp in Twin Falls as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for August  2021.   Purchased by William ``Bill'' Koch, Sr., and Lavear Thornock in 1959,  K & T Steel Corp is a fabricator and manufacturer of steel and  reinforced bar products located in Idaho's Magic Valley that is now  owned by Gary Palmer and Jamin Wills. For more than six decades, the  company has developed a reputation for its high-quality production of  beams, rebar, and fuel storage tanks, among other specialty steel  products. The company prides itself on tailoring its products and  services to meet the unique needs of its clients.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S5710, August 3, 2021, in the middle of the third  column, the following appears:Purchased by William ``Bill'' Koch,  Sr., and Lavear Thornock in 1959, K & T Steel Corp is a fabricator  and manufacturer of steel and reinforced bar products located in  Idaho's Magic Valley that is now owned by Gary Palmer and Jamin  Willis.

In 2018, K & T fabricated the trellis  pieces of a sky bridge that connects St. Luke's Children's Hospital  with Idaho Elks Children's Pavilion and, in 2020, built the Shoshone  Street Archway that was constructed as a tribute to the historic  Perrine Memorial Bridge. K & T's contributions to these celebrated  projects encapsulate the company's unique connection and commitment to  Idaho and the Twin Falls community.   Additionally, K & T Steel Corp has a long-standing tradition of  service to the community. The company donated a stairwell to the Twin  Falls Optimist Youth Ranch in 2018, provided donations to St. Luke's  Magic Valley Health Foundation, and is a sponsor of the College of  Southern Idaho's Nuts, Bolts, and Thingamajigs camp for children aged  12-17.   Congratulations to Gary, Jamin, and all of the employees of K & T  Steel on  [[Page S5711]]  being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for August  2021. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to your  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
