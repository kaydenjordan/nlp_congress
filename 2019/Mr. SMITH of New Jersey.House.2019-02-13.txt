 Mr. Speaker, what an expression of love,  compassion, and faith we just heard, the child who was thought to be  impossible; and what a tribute to parents and a mother who just love so  unconditionally.   Mr. Speaker, in 2012, two bioethicists, Dr. Alberto Giubilini and  Francesca Minerva, published an outrageous paper in the Journal of  Medical Ethics justifying the deliberate, premeditated murder of  newborn babies during the first hours, days, and even weeks after  birth. The ethicists said:         When circumstances occur after birth that would have       justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should       be permissible.    In other words, the same conditions that would justify the killing of  a baby in utero justifies the killing of that baby even when she is  born.   These two individuals made it clear that because the child does not  have dreams about the future at birth, that that somehow is a  disqualifier to personhood.   The infanticide that they proposed, Mr. Speaker, is here. After-birth  abortion is here.   A couple weeks ago, New York Governor Cuomo signed into law a bill to  allow abortion until birth and even removes penalties for infanticide.  Other States, including Virginia, Rhode Island, and New Mexico, have  similar anti-child statutes under consideration.   The violent assault on children, Mr. Speaker, must end. Not only have  61 million unborn babies been killed since 1973 by either  dismemberment--when a child is torn apart, arms, legs, and torso,  literally dismembered--or by chemical poisoning, a death toll that  equates with the entire population of Italy, the pro-choice crowd now  is legislating to extend the violence after birth.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot look away when a child's fundamental human  rights are being violated with such lethal actions. Pass the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act now. Mr. Speaker, give us that chance  to vote on this.
