 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1224, I call  up the bill (S. 3373), as amended, to improve the Iraq and Afghanistan  Service Grant and the Children of Fallen Heroes Grant, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on S. 3373, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I stand before this Chamber in support of S. 3373, as  amended, which is now the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring  our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022.   This measure addresses a technical drafting error in the Senate  amendment to my PACT Act. As you know, the PACT Act passed the House  with strong bipartisan support in March of this year.   Today, despite the current rancorous political debates taking place  across America, this Chamber has the chance to help the country heal  after 20 years of war.   We have an opportunity to make good on the promise we made to our  servicemembers when our country sent them into harm's way: that we  would take care of them and pay for that care when they come home.   For too long, veterans have faced an uphill battle to prove that the  rare illnesses and cancers they were experiencing stemmed from their  time in the military.   For too long, Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs have  been slow to accept responsibility and cost of that care, and for too  long the United States has not made good on our promise to our  veterans.   But today, I make a plea for unity so that we may right this wrong  and make good on our commitment to honor our pact with America's  veterans. Today, we can finally recognize toxic exposure as a cost of  war.                                time  1345    In the past, we saw Vietnam war veterans living with the effects of  Agent Orange, fighting the VA for the care and benefits they were due.  The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act was signed into law in 2019,  but it came nearly four decades too late. This bill could have been  passed 2 years earlier when my friend, then-Republican chairman, Dr.  Phil Roe, was leading this committee, but two Senators held up that  bill. During that needless delay, many veterans succumbed to their  illnesses, and their families were not compensated. Now is our chance  to make amends for that.   There is absolutely no reason for veterans and their survivors to  fight the VA for the care and benefits they have earned through their  service. Never again should veterans be made to suffer the indignity of  fighting their own government.   After Blue Water, I vowed that we would never again fail to live up  to our promises to our veterans. That is why, at the beginning of the  117th Congress, I made addressing the effects of toxic exposure my top  priority as chairman.   Throughout our history, America has cast aside party affiliation on  behalf of veterans, coming together to pass landmark legislation to  properly recognize those who have served, such as in 1944 when Congress  passed the GI Bill. The GI Bill was transformational for a generation  of veterans. By 1956, nearly 8 million veterans had used the GI Bill's  education benefits and millions more still benefit from it today.   We have an opportunity to make a generational impact today. The PACT  Act will directly affect one out of every five veterans, or 3.5 million  people. It will also send a strong message to future generations of  veterans that America will take care of them when their service ends.   The way this country has dealt with toxic exposure has been piecemeal  and inadequate. President Biden recognizes this, too. Shortly after he  was sworn in, I met with the President about our shared priorities for  veterans. Upon learning of my goal to pass comprehensive legislation to  help toxic-exposed veterans, the President leaned over to me and talked  about his son, Beau, who served near burn pits in Iraq and Kosovo.   It might be hard for most Americans to imagine what a burn pit looks  like because they are illegal in the United States. Picture walking  next to and breathing fumes from a burning pit the size of a football  field. This pit contained everything from household trash, plastics,  and human waste to jet fuel and discarded equipment burning day and  night. Beau Biden lived near these burn pits and breathed the fumes  that emanated from them.   President Biden believes that constant exposure to these burn pits,  and the toxic fumes they emitted, led to Beau's cancer and early death.  It was during that meeting when I knew I had a partner in President  Biden.   At the State of the Union, President Biden called on Congress to pass  bipartisan legislation to comprehensively address the effects of toxic  exposure and improve the delivery of benefits for toxic-exposed  veterans. I cannot thank him enough for throwing his support behind  this effort and placing those who have served our country at the center  of his unity agenda.   To my colleagues who previously voted ``no'' on the PACT Act in  March, I ask you the same question I asked you then: Are you willing to  support our troops and honor our Nation's promise to them? Or will you  allow naked partisanship to once again deny our veterans the care they  deserve?   Just this Congress alone, every single Democrat in this body voted to  make sure each day in uniform counts toward GI Bill benefits. Every  single Democrat voted to ensure a smooth transition from Active Duty to  civilian life. Every single Democrat voted to honor our pact with  toxic-exposed veterans. There is no question as to where Democrats  stand on prioritizing America's veterans. We are backing up our thank- you with concrete action.   Frankly, all the bills that I mentioned should have passed with  unanimous support. If the American people knew the context of these  bills and knew the content of them, they would demand unanimous support  from this Chamber.   But I take this moment now to recognize my Republican colleagues in  this Chamber who put keeping our promise to veterans above  partisanship. I thank the Republican cosponsors of this bill,  Representatives Fitzpatrick and Cline.   Further, I recognize the 34 Republicans who in March showed their  support for veterans by voting ``yes'' on final passage, including  Veterans' Affairs Committee members, General Bergman and Representative  Mace. I also recognize the commitment of Representatives Bilirakis and  Kinzinger, who do not serve on this committee, but demonstrated early  leadership by supporting this legislation. I am also glad to see my  colleague, Ranking Member Bost, finally stand in support of this bill  today.   Moreover, in June, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 84 Senators  voted in favor of the PACT Act in the Senate. This proved the value of  the cause and showed that it had momentum, so the trajectory of this  effort is clear.   But here is also a very rare situation where there is a chance for  redemption. For those of my Republican colleagues who previously  hesitated, sat on the sidelines, or chose politics over veterans, you  get a second chance to do the right thing. There is no reason why this  time this measure should not garner at least 400 votes in this Chamber.   Why is it that a Republican leader and Republican whip, who aspire to  be in the majority but do not show the fortitude to govern, are  continuing to oppose this bill and are asking you to do the same? Do  not let them stand in the way with unconvincing arguments about  budgetary constraints when the true cost of war, the human cost of war,  is abundantly clear.   For example, as the House considers the National Defense  Authorization Act this week, a bill that authorizes $838.8 billion,  spending which I believe could be justifiable, I am reminded of the  stark reality of how this Congress approaches Federal spending.    It has become a battle of defense spending versus everything else.  That everything else includes veterans, schoolchildren, the elderly,  and our constituents. I vigorously object to veterans being pitted  against their fellow Americans to fight for funding. Do  [[Page H6018]]  we really want to support veterans by limiting school lunches for  children? Do we support veterans by limiting help for seniors? You can  be damn sure our veterans didn't sign up to serve our country, watch  their families make sacrifices, or go to war far from home so Members  of this body could perpetuate a false choice that pits Americans  against one another.   The right choice, the choice we are going to make today, is simple:  Recognize toxic exposure as a cost of war, period.   Using hypocritical arguments about fiscal responsibility as a reason  to oppose this bill when the truth of the moral responsibility of  caring for our veterans is made crystal clear, is not consistent with  American values. Make no mistake: When our country goes to war, we  don't nickel and dime the Department of Defense, and we shouldn't try  to pinch pennies when it comes to covering the care for toxic-exposed  veterans.   We don't hear these arguments about needing offsets when we are asked  rightly to support more body armor or protection from IEDs. This  Congress steps up to the plate to provide our servicemembers with what  they need to fight our wars. So why are Members of this body arguing  that we need to scrounge around to find money for our veterans? It is  time for Congress to fully support toxic-exposed veterans as they fight  the rare cancers and illnesses after returning home.   Now, I must express dismay also about the procedural steps we must  now undertake because a single Senator is preventing the Senate from  quickly fixing the technical issue in this bill. This Senator, already  having watched the bill pass the Senate the first time with strong  support, knowing the veteran sacrifice behind it, and the blood, sweat,  and tears shed by the veteran community to finally get this done, chose  instead to object because he doesn't like the funding mechanism in this  bill.   His position is the losing one, it was the losing one, and he has  held up this bill for no other reason other than sour grapes; and to  what end is unclear when veterans suffer in the meantime. Therefore, we  Members of the House must take this route to push forward and do what  we know is right.   The Honoring our PACT Act would not have been possible were it not  for the veterans who selflessly shared their stories, their pain, and  their trauma, opening the eyes of their fellow Americans to the  realities of being exposed to toxic substances.   Throughout this process, I have met many toxic-exposed veterans whose  sacrifice and courage continued long after they hung up their uniform.  I am forever humbled by the courage of Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas, a  Marine veteran who served near a burn pit in Fallujah who later fought  the VA for 3 years to get the care she needed.   I am sorry to say she passed away this spring, but not before  selflessly fighting for a comprehensive bill that would aid over 3.5  million veterans like her living with the effects of toxic exposure, a  bill that she herself would not benefit from. We also honor the valor  of Wesley Black, Heath Robinson, Jennifer Kepner, and so many others  who are no longer with us.   This bill would also not have been possible without the support of  over 40 veteran service organizations. Each of these organizations  understand that toxic-exposed veterans are still in the heat of battle.  I thank them for their impact and advocacy for the Honoring our PACT  Act.   I also thank my staff, who worked tirelessly to listen and engage  with advocates and stakeholders and spent countless hours drafting and  redrafting this bill to get it right.   I also thank Speaker Pelosi for always being a tireless advocate for  veterans, along with Majority Leader Hoyer.   I also thank Senate Majority Leader Schumer for his work with  Senators Tester and Moran and the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to  pass this bill.   I also point out that Jon Stewart and John Feal kept us accountable.   Most importantly, to the families of veterans who tragically lost  their lives as a result of being exposed to toxic substances during  their time in service, I thank you for your sacrifices.   This legislative effort will help our veterans heal, and it offers  hope that our country can do the same. It sends a message to all  Americans that their Government will not allow their grievances to go  unaddressed. It acknowledges the suffering endured by our Vietnam war  veterans and demonstrates to them that we have learned from our  mistakes and that their struggle and their suffering was not in vain.   We are setting a new standard with the PACT Act. We are telling our  veterans: The burden of proof is not on you. Because of your sacrifice  to our country, this Congress and the American people are giving you  the benefit of the doubt that you have earned.   Let's pass this bill and ease the anxiety in the minds of our  veterans who are living with cancer or other illnesses and terminal  diseases and let them know that their families are going to be taken  care of. I believe this is what the American people want and what  everyone in this Chamber should want. It is what our veterans deserve,  and it is the right thing to do.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to honor their pact with  the veterans by voting ``yes'' on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I certainly welcome the support of the  ranking member on this bill.   May I inquire as to the time remaining in debate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend who is the chairwoman of the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), my good friend who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Technology Modernization and on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.  [[Page H6020]]         Madam Speaker, nothing could be more important or a  higher priority in defense of our Republic than to address the  unaddressed grievances of our veterans. We are keeping our promise to  our veterans. We are saying today that doing so is a cost of war.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Trone), a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and active  member of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), my good friend who serves on the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I welcome the support of the gentleman  from Montana.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz), my good friend and member of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, where he is an active member of the Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego), who is my good friend. He is an active member of  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and serves on the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) who has been a tremendous  supporter of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I so welcome the support of the gentleman  from Florida. He got it right the first time. He voted ``yes'' the  first time. I know he is going to vote ``yes'' the second time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  Omar), my good friend who serves on the Education and Labor Committee  and the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I welcome the even begrudging ``yes'' vote  from the gentleman from Georgia. I will just say there is no budget  gimmick here. This vote is going to unite America. It is going to heal  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Dingell), my good friend who serves on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am delighted that the ranking member is offering his support for  this bill. I accept that support, but I do not accept his objections.   This bill, I mean, yes, I do say that we are creating entitlements.  But the entitlements we are creating are 3.5 million veterans eligible  for healthcare, veterans that were exposed to toxic substances. We are  conceding exposure to them. We are making it possible for them to not  have to fight their government.   Yes, we are creating entitlements with our 23 presumptive illnesses.  It is going to mean that those veterans are entitled to benefits, and  their families will be entitled to benefits, so those veterans that are  suffering from terminal illnesses are not going to have to worry about  their families being without resources after they pass.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in finally doing  what is right and passing this very important piece of legislation, S.  3373, as amended. I hope we get 400 votes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 42) authorizing  the use of the rotunda of the Capitol on Thursday, July 14, 2022, for  the lying in honor of the remains of Hershel Woodrow ``Woody''  Williams, the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient for acts  performed during World War II, and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment  of my friend and colleague, Congressman Lieu, that would allow the  Department of Veterans Affairs and community partners to address the  needs of homeless veterans in the Los Angeles area by authorizing the  use of innovative funding streams.   Currently, the VA's West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 restricts  funding. Any Federal revenue generated from leases on the West Los  Angeles VA campus may be used only for the renovation and maintenance  of land and facilities.   This means that while the VA can use proceeds from the leases to pay  for things like running utility lines, they cannot use funds for the  supportive services that veterans residing on the campus need.   Los Angeles has the largest homeless veteran population in the  country, with close to 10 percent of all homeless veterans across the  U.S. residing there.   The West LA VA hospital campus provides an enormous opportunity to  provide shelter and support for those who have served our Nation, but  face hard times, by building a supportive community for veterans.   We have made great strides at the West LA VA campus to address  veteran homelessness, but there is still so much more that needs to be  done.   Specifically, this amendment will ensure that the West LA VA is able  to collect $25 million from the Los Angeles Purple Line Metro easement  and put that money toward housing and supportive services for homeless  veterans.   Funds from easements and other use agreements at the West LA VA  should be returned to the campus and used for those who served our  country in the Armed Forces. This is simply common sense.   Last November, I visited the West LA VA campus with VA Secretary  McDonough, Congresswoman Brownley, Congresswoman Bass, and Congressman  Lieu, who is leading this amendment.   During that visit, we learned about how the VA campus was  transitioning the care, treatment, and rehabilitative services, or  CTRS, from using tents to small innovative shelters.    Madam Speaker, this provides a much more supportive  living situation for those veterans trying to escape homelessness.   Currently, there are roughly 105 veterans residing in these  innovative shelters, and over 550 unique veterans have been admitted to  the program--it has proven to be a successful model for getting  veterans connected to VA resources and quickly moved into permanent  housing or treatment programs.   The change Congressman Lieu's amendment will make is especially  significant.   VA has determined that under current law it is restricted from using  funds from its leases and easements to pay for critical improvements  for veteran safety and well-being, like security for CTRS.   This amendment would also free up funding for permanent supportive  housing to be built on the campus, which means more veterans will be  off the streets and into a home to call their own with the VA care that  they need close by.    Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the House Committee on  Veteran's Affairs, one of my top priorities has been to curtail  unethical conduct aimed at the men and women that have worn the uniform  of our Nation. The Cicilline/Takano amendment offered to H.R. 7900, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 is another  means to that end. This amendment would prohibit the enforcement of  forced arbitration clauses in contracts covered by the Servicemembers  Civil Relief Act (SCRA).   SCRA was created to extend important financial protections to  military service personnel who are currently serving on active-duty and  often targeted for exploitation. These protections can range from  prohibiting lenders from repossessing cars and foreclosing on homes  while servicemembers are actively deployed. Despite the protections  granted in SCRA, corporations and big banks have been consistently  targeting servicemembers and their families through the deceptive use  of forced arbitration clauses. Forced arbitration has undermined the  rights of servicemembers for years by forcing them to waive their  ability to seek remedies through the courts. More often than not, these  clauses are buried in the fine print of lengthy employment contracts.   This amendment will expand these protections to remove a common tool  used in an exploitation that has become all too common. Those who serve  in our military are inherently at a disadvantage against aggressive  lenders as the nature of their service makes it difficult to seek fair  resolve in any claims. Lenders are acutely aware of this unique  disadvantage of servicemembers and many seek to take full advantage.   This prohibition on forced arbitration clauses would protect  countless men and women from predatory lenders while deployed. Our  servicemembers protect us both at home and abroad, and it is time we  safeguard their rights against predatory lenders and others who  shamelessly seek to exploit members of our military. I am hopeful that  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote in favor of this  amendment, and I thank Congressman Cicilline for his leadership.
