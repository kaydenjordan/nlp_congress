 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and  friend, Chairwoman Lowey.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, particularly the  division involving Transportation, HUD appropriations for fiscal year  2021.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and the former chairman of our  subcommittee, Mario Diaz-Balart, for his kind words this morning and  for his cooperation throughout this process. We  [[Page H4119]]  do work well together, and we share many, many goals for this  legislation. We have a bill that reflects that collaborative work.   My heartfelt best wishes to Chairwoman Lowey. Your leadership has  been exceptional, as many have said--your friendship, even more so. We  are going to miss you, and we are happy to see these tributes today.  And also, to other retiring Members: Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Serrano, Mr.  Graves; all colleagues who have contributed greatly, and whom we will  miss.                                time  1130    This year's T-HUD appropriations bill represents a renewed commitment  to address our Nation's housing crisis and to modernize our aging  transportation infrastructure. Throughout the bill, we focus on  improved safety, on the needs of underserved people and communities,  and on resiliency in the face of a changing climate.   Overall, the bill includes $75.9 billion in discretionary funding.  That is an increase of $1.6 billion over the Fiscal Year 2020 level,  and it is $16.7 billion above the President's budget request. It also  includes major increases for highway and transit formula funding,  consistent with Chairman DeFazio's INVEST Act, which passed the House  on July 1, 2020.   On the housing side of the ledger, we provide increases of $100  million for the Community Development Block Grant program and $350  million for HOME, to help spur the creation of new affordable housing.   We fully renew all Housing Choice Vouchers. We provide $250 million  for new vouchers targeting homeless families and those at risk of  homelessness, and we increase homeless assistance grants by  approximately 23 percent over last year's level. That is the largest  increase in over a decade.   Our bill includes an 11 percent increase in the Public Housing  Capital Fund and new set-asides within that fund to address urgent  health and safety issues. We continue to provide new resources to  create more housing for the elderly and disabled and for the Choice  Neighborhoods program, formerly known as HOPE VI.   The bill also does right by transportation. All modes receive robust  funding, including highways, transit, rail, aviation, bike and  pedestrian projects, and ports.   This includes $1 billion for the popular BUILD program; more than $2  billion for Amtrak; a very deliberate 50 percent increase for intercity  passenger and freight rail improvements in the CRISI program; and a  funding boost for highways, bus fleet replacement, and the Federal  Transit Administration's Capital Investment Grants, or ``New Starts''  transit program.   This division of the bill also includes emergency funds. It provides  an additional $75 billion for infrastructure investments to revitalize  transportation networks, jump-start affordable housing production, and  further reduce the disgraceful public housing capital backlog.   Some may object to this use of emergency spending, but to them I ask:  What is the cost of continued inaction for our economy, for our  communities? ``Infrastructure Week'' shouldn't be a punch line. We need  to mean it. This funding is necessary for our future prosperity,  especially as we transition from this pandemic to recovery.   I want to underscore that the funding in the bill deliberately  promotes equity and resiliency in our communities. We set aside funding  for areas of persistent poverty, provide dedicated funding for DOT and  HUD to offer technical assistance, especially to rural and low-income  areas, and to fund programs that promote opportunity.   The bill seeks to protect taxpayer dollars by incorporating  resiliency principles into DOT and HUD programs. That means building  smarter, requiring all-hazards mitigation, and the use of updated  building codes.   Importantly, the bill prevents HUD from implementing mean-spirited  and harmful rules that would split up immigrant families in Federally  assisted housing and allow homeless shelters to discriminate against  LGBTQ individuals.    The bill also provides increased funds  for fair housing enforcement, which is all the more important given  HUD's open hostility to bedrock fair housing laws and the President's  racist tweet, just yesterday, about low-income housing in suburban  communities. Pending amendments will go one step further in preventing  Donald Trump from repealing our fair housing rules.   So, Mr. Speaker, this year's T-HUD bill incorporates many priorities  from Members on both sides of the aisle, makes forward-looking  investments in our housing and transportation infrastructure, boosts  safety, protects vulnerable population, and promotes equity and  fairness.   I want to thank our excellent professional staff: Joe Carlile, our  majority clerk; his teammates Gladys Barcena, Winnie Chang, Jo Eckert,  Sarah Puro, Angela Ohm, and Becky Salay; our minority clerk, Doug  Disrud, and his colleague, Alyssa Hinman. I want to thank Sean Maxwell  from my personal staff and Chris Sweet from Mr. Diaz-Balart's personal  staff. They work hard, and we appreciate that hard work.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition, although I want to support the bill, if that is acceptable.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  amendment.   Madam Speaker, the rail safety issues that our colleagues raise are  not limited to the State of Florida. They are severe in Florida, but  they are, in fact, national problems.   Communities across the country are working to address highway-rail  grade crossing safety, to prevent trespassing on railroad rights-of- way, and to mitigate blocked railroad crossings. In fact, the two  leading causes of all rail-related fatalities are collisions at  highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad rights-of-way.   This bill will provide communities and the Federal Railroad  Administration with tools to mitigate these safety risks and to develop  local solutions--specifically:   $110 million in grants for highway-rail grade crossing improvement  projects;   $25 million for capital projects and engineering solutions targeting  trespassing;   $10 million to continue media campaigns focused on grade crossing  safety;   And $3.6 million for FRA to develop risk models, bolster community  outreach and education, and support enforcement grants.   In addition, the bill requires FRA to continue to update each year  its national strategy to prevent trespassing on railroad property, so  we can have the most current data available and better understand the  progress being made or the challenges that remain in reducing  trespasser fatalities.   Madam Speaker, I commend my colleagues for offering this amendment,  for calling attention to this issue, and I pledge to continue to work  with them as we address railroad safety.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment. The  Federal-State partnership for State of Good Repair Competitive Grant  program is vital to improving passenger rail infrastructure all along  Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and across the Nation.   I have traveled firsthand to see the Portal Bridge, the Hudson  tunnels, the other infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor that we  must upgrade as part of the critical Gateway program. This corridor is  significant not just to New York, not just to New Jersey, but to the  entire Nation's economy.   At the request of my colleague from New Jersey--whose amendment I  commend--and others from the region, this bill includes important new  flexibilities in the program which should help jump-start rail  projects.   The bill rejects the administration's flawed decision to restrict  project eligibility to final design and construction activities and  makes important early-stage project activities like design,  engineering, environmental studies, and acquiring rights of way  eligible for funding.   Given the strain the coronavirus pandemic has placed on the budgets  of State and local governments, Amtrak, and others, the bill eliminates  the selection preference for projects which have a 50 percent or higher  non-Federal match.   The bill also provides strong funding through other programs which  could advance the rail infrastructure projects that make up the Gateway  program, including $5.75 billion for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, $7.2  billion for Capital Investment Grants (CIGs), $5.5 billion for CRISI,  and $4 billion for the BUILD program.   In addition, the bill directs the administration to administer the  CIG program as required by law, including a prohibition on requiring  that certain financial metrics be met for projects before they finalize  environmental reviews.   So I commend my colleague for her amendment. I look forward to  working with her and others with a strong interest in this matter to  support investments in Gateway and other important rail infrastructure  all across this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
