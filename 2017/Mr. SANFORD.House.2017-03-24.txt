 Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear that I agree with what  every Republican speaker has said thus far on the need to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act. I want to say how much I admire the  Speaker and the leadership team, President Trump and his team,  Chairwoman Black, and others on the Budget Committee for what they have  brought to bear.   My simple question is one of timing. What I tell my boys consistently  is: If you don't know, you don't go.   One of the things that I think we have to really look at in this bill  is one of process. It does do a lot of good things, as has been pointed  out by the Republican speakers, but it still leaves in place community  rating. It leaves in place the architecture, I think, of a flawed bill  that came with the Affordable Care Act.   The question is: Can we build on top of that to do the very good  things that are talked about in this bill, or do we take just a little  bit more time to make certain that we have it right?   I think that when you look at this notion of lowering premiums, look  at it like rent control in New York. Rent control in New York has done  a lot of good for some folks, but it has hurt a lot of others in the  process.   The question we fundamentally have to ask ourselves is: At this  juncture, can we make the changes necessary?
