 Mr. Speaker, last week, I visited with the  police officers in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to hear firsthand about the  drug epidemic that is facing communities in my district.   One of the officers told me a story of how just the night before, he  recovered over 150 bags of heroin after receiving a 911 call for a man  abusing a puppy on a public street. This story gets to the heart of  what these deadly drugs do to our communities.   Instead of addressing this crisis by securing our border, President  Biden has chosen to end title 42, a program that has helped our Border  Patrol agents protect Americans.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to fight the drug epidemic that has allowed  heroin, crack cocaine, and fentanyl to take the lives of so many  Pennsylvanians, so many Americans.   It is time to secure our border and make title 42 the law of the  land.   It is time to face the drug crisis head on.   It is time to protect all of our communities.                            ____________________
