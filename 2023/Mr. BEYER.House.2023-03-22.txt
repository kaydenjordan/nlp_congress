 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a team of high  school athletes from Virginia's Eighth Congressional District.   Two weeks ago, Hayfield Secondary School's boys basketball team  defeated the Patriot Pioneers to win Virginia's Class 6 basketball  title for the second consecutive season.   Their hard-fought win was a testament to their collective work and to  the energetic, orange-out crowd that traveled down from Fairfax to  cheer them on.   Hayfield Secondary students, teachers, and administrators are the  best of our future. They are diverse, brilliant, and creative. It takes  the whole Hayfield community to build the past two seasons where they  had a 62-1 record in addition to back-to-back State championships.   Hayfield's win reflects their courage, discipline, and excellent  sportsmanship.   Congratulations to Coach Carlos Poindexter, to everyone who made this  success possible, and to the Hayfield players who brought this  championship home.   Daryl Holloway, Jr., David King, Gregory Jones, Donovan Bass-Briscoe,  Yohanse Awoke, Jahleel Jackson, Braelen Cage, Phenix Card, Andrew  Ramirez-Novas, Owen Pottenburgh, Ryan Payne, Isiah Blue, Sean Burton,  Parker Cage, Evan Sussin, Landon Judy, Jaylen Lemon, and Damarius  Duncan.   Go Hawks!                            ____________________
