 Mr. President, I just listened with interest to the  remarks of the majority leader and his accounting of history--his very  defensive remarks, based on an attack from, I guess, some journalist.  The majority leader, I would say, was liberally using words like  ``McCarthy'' and ``McCarthyism'' and ``liar'' and how he proudly stood  up to the Soviet Union in the wake of Brezhnev and Chernenko and  Andropov. They are fascinating words, but you don't need x-ray vision  to notice a few things about the discussion the majority leader  launched. First of all, this weekend, the Director of National Security  resigned in frustration that his boss, the President of the United  States, has chosen to believe Russia instead of his own intelligence  officials.   One of most embarrassing moments in my lifetime was when the  President of the United States stood next to the dictator of Russia and  said that he believed Putin and not his own intelligence officials and  the consensus of his intelligence officials when it comes to  influencing our 2016 elections.   So I hear that the majority leader always has an acute sense of  history and his place in it. I am hopeful the majority leader, using  his knowledge of history, understands the influence Russia continues to  have in our country and on our elections and that this body will  actually address that instead of denying the obvious.                                   Opioids    Mr. President, America is in the middle of a public health crisis. In  my State, 14 people die, on average, every single day of a drug  overdose. The numbers are not much better in most of the other 49  States. We have known for a long time that addiction so often starts in  the family medicine cabinet and that drug companies were all too eager  to push these addictive drugs on the American people, but the evidence  we have seen in the past couple of weeks is staggering.   New data from the DEA released this month reveals that drug companies  flooded the country with 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pills  from 2006 to 2012--76 billion pills in a nation of slightly more than  323 million people. Seventy-six billion pills is enough to supply every  person in the United States with 36 pills every one of those years from  2006 to 2012. This evidence makes clear these companies, these  corporations knew exactly what they were doing.   One wholesale drug distributor in Ohio wrote an email that the opioid  pills were ``flyin' out of there. It is like people are addicted to  these things or something. Oh wait, people are.''   Can you believe that? He acknowledged they are addicted, and he joked  about it. If that is not bad enough, then the drug company  representative responded: ``Just like Doritos, [people] keep eating.  We'll make more.''   They certainly did make more. That is what Big Pharma does. They push  their drugs on the American people to line their own pockets and the  cost in empty bank accounts and ruined lives be damned.   If that isn't bad enough, these corporations can actually write off  the cost of advertising these drugs on their taxes. In other words, all  of us as taxpayers subsidize this drug company advertising. All those  years that Big Pharma was pushing more and more opioids on the country,  selling them ad after ad, they were getting a tax break to do it. Yet  does this body do anything about that? Of course not.   For years, I tried to track down drug company ads. It is why I  introduced an amendment at our Finance Committee  [[Page S5127]]  markup last week based on my legislation with Senator Shaheen to end  taxpayer subsidies for Big Pharma's drug ads. We shouldn't be giving  tax breaks to Big Pharma to sell its drugs, period.   There are a lot of other ideas many of us have to crack down on these  companies and limit their power to push potentially addictive drugs on  people.   Senator Hassan filed an amendment during that same committee drug  pricing markup to increase transparency on these drug companies. Big  Pharma has a history of creating false grassroots organizations to do  their lobbying for them. Groups supposedly made up of ordinary citizens  but in reality are bought and paid for by drug companies. People have  the right to know if the groups pushing drugs on them are actually  bought and paid for by those pharmaceutical companies. The opioid  addiction crisis is one of the greatest public health emergencies of  our lifetime, and it is crystal clear Big Pharma purposefully and  deliberately helped to cause it, and the Federal Government gave them  tax breaks and continues to give them tax breaks to do it. We need to  hold these corporations accountable, and we need to make sure they  never again have the unchecked power to push addictive drugs or any  other drugs on the American people just to line their executives'  pockets.   I yield the floor.
