 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday the President gave a State of  the Union Address that was short on details but long on hypocrisy. His  remarks were long, self-absorbed, and divorced from reality.   Much like 1 year ago, his speech was noteworthy for the things he  didn't say. He didn't mention that we live in a time of the greatest  income inequality since the 1920s. He didn't mention the environment  and our responsibilities to respond to climate change, to strengthen  Social Security, or education for young people.   These are the real challenges facing working people today. They are  also the things that the President has ignored during his time in  office.   The people of this great country deserve better.   Democrats are committed to delivering for the people. That means:   Cracking down on corruption in Washington and reducing the influence  of money in our political system;   Raising wages by rebuilding our infrastructure;   Lowering healthcare and prescription drug costs;   Ending the epidemic of gun violence; and   Taking on the challenge of climate change.   Let's get the job done and restore government of, by, and for the  people of this great country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and  I particularly thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this issue  and for organizing today's Special Order hour.   One of the great blessings of being in the majority is wonderful new  colleagues who are bringing their incredible intellect and passion and  commitment to the issues facing the American people, and the  gentlewoman from California is obviously a magnificent example of that,  so I thank her for the courtesy.   Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. On average, 100  Americans are murdered with firearms every day. Three hundred more are  shot and wounded.   In 2017, the number of gun deaths in this country hit 40,000, the  highest level in 20 years, according to the Centers for Disease  Control. Globally, we have the highest rate of gun violence of any  developed Nation on Earth.   We have a gun violence epidemic in this country.   The U.S. is now the world leader in child gun deaths, with death by  gunshot being the second highest cause of death among children.   This is a public health crisis.   People are being killed at schools, at houses of worship, in  restaurants, at homes, and everywhere in between. There is no place  safe from the threat of gun violence in this country.   We have seen it at the Sandy Hook Elementary School and Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School; at houses of worship in Charleston, Oak  [[Page H1439]]  Creek, Sutherland Springs, and Pittsburgh; at a nightclub in Orlando, a  movie theater in Aurora, and a country music concert in Las Vegas.   But under GOP control for the last 8 years, Congress did nothing. We  had moments of silence for 30 minutes. We stood. We said nothing and  did nothing.   Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, this is about to change. Yesterday, the  House Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on gun violence  prevention in nearly a decade. The room was filled with parents who  lost their children and young people who lost their friends to gun  violence.   They are determined to make sure that no one else has to live through  such senseless tragedies. Particularly the young people, whose passion  and commitment and dedication to making sure that we do something to  reduce gun violence in this country, have changed the conversation in  America. It was a great pleasure to have the opportunity to thank these  young people, because their voices are making a difference.   I used my 5 minutes at the hearing in part to apologize to these  young people, because we have failed them. The adults in this country  and the adults in this Congress have failed them.   They are asking us to do our jobs at the very basic minimum: Keep  them safe. Allow them to lead their lives and reach their full  potential.   I am very proud that I am introducing a number of bills that will  reduce gun violence in this country--a bill to ban assault weapons, a  bill to ban dangerous bump stocks and 3D-printed guns.   I will also be introducing a bill to improve the background check  system by requiring States to establish better reporting systems for  mental health professionals to identify individuals who pose a risk to  themselves or others if they have a gun.   I plan to introduce a bill that will require notification to law  enforcement if a prohibited purchaser buys or attempts to buy a gun.   Mr. Speaker, there are dozens of commonsense proposals that will be  introduced in this Congress. Sadly, almost all of them will be  introduced by Democrats. I hope we can have some bipartisan support on  this, because the American people want us to do something before  another horrible tragedy occurs and before another deadly weapon ends  up in the wrong hands.   There are many good ideas on how to do it. Our Republican colleagues,  as I know the gentlewoman from California will agree, always say there  isn't one bill that will stop every instance of gun violence, and so,  they argue, we shouldn't do anything, because we can't stop it all. Of  course, that is a ridiculous argument against taking action, because  there is no question that we can take action on a number of bills that,  taken together, will substantially reduce gun violence in this country.   We have the responsibility to do it. The American people are  demanding that we do it. We will take up a bill to close the background  check loophole that allows nearly 22 percent of guns sold in this  country to happen without a background check.   We are going to take up legislation to fix the background check  system and make certain that all sales of guns undergo a background  check, so we can make sure criminals don't have access to firearms.   That is just the beginning. That is the first thing we will do. We  are going to move forward on a whole series of commonsense proposals  that will help stop the carnage being caused by gun violence in this  country.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield back to the gentlewoman and  again thank her for her leadership and accommodation this evening. I  thank her for organizing this very important Special Order hour to  continue to raise this issue and demonstrate to the American  people that we are committed to getting something done to reduce gun  violence in this country to protect our constituents who sent us here  to do just that.
