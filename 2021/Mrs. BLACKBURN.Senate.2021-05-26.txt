 Madam President, in the 4 months since the Democrats  took control of the U.S. Government, they have not once indicated they  understand the severity of the crisis playing out along our southern  border.   It is hard to believe they get the same reports from Customs and  Border Protection as I do, so just in case they haven't seen this  month's update yet, I am going to go ahead and run through the numbers.   In April, CBP apprehended more than 178,000 people trying to  illegally cross our border.   Almost 14,000 of them were unaccompanied children or single minors.   Drug seizures were up 6 percent from March. We have already seized  more fentanyl this year than we did all last year.   On top of all that we are still catching smugglers trying to pass off  counterfeit face masks, prohibited COVID test kits, and banned  pharmaceuticals.   It is important to understand that all of this, from the human  trafficking to the drug smuggling to the bootleg PPE operations, are  symptoms of a much bigger problem.   We are dealing with a systemic humanitarian, health and safety, and  national security crisis that gets worse every time the Biden  administration doubles down on open borders rhetoric.   What is worse, they are treating the chaos like a logistics issue.  Instead of trying to reduce the flow of migrants coming to the southern  border, the Biden administration is trying to speed the flow.   They are actively trying to move as many migrants into our country as  possible.   Last week, we received reports that the Department of Health and  Human Services is using Chattanooga, TN, as a rally point for  unaccompanied minors on their way to meet up with their sponsors or  move on to area shelters and homes.   We saw video of the children getting off of planes at Wilson Air  Center and boarding buses to continue on their journey. At least four  planes full of unaccompanied minors landed in Chattanooga last week.   It is important to realize that all this was happening in the dead of  night, without the knowledge of any Tennessee elected officials or  community leaders.   No transparency, no coordination, no notice whatsoever.   This is cause for concern not only because HHS circumvented State  authorities but because this Agency has a history of operating under a  veil of secrecy when it concerns their handling of migrant children.   Back in 2014, HHS blocked congressional oversight of their migrant  housing facilities. Our attempts to tour one such facility, which at  the time housed more than 1,000 children, were met with delays, denials  and refusals.   Fast-forward to today, and HHS is being just as secretive about how  they are managing care for these children. Fortunately, eyewitnesses  have come forward to confirm the scope and secrecy of this operation.   One source said: ``They have intentionally not shared a lot of  information with us. They don't want this to get out.''   He went on: ``They had, to my understanding, a field full of buses  with more buses and more buses running all of these routes. Now,  they're flying the kids because the buses were easier to videotape  going down the highway. They've changed their strategy from buses to  flying . . . In Chattanooga and other cities, motorcoach companies are  waiting on planes to land and continuing their trek further north,  dropping kids off along the way.''   Now, let's be clear about one thing: The children in those buses are  victims--victims of irresponsible rhetoric, of bad policy, and of  manipulation and abuse by traffickers.   I would implore my colleagues to listen to these stories and to  accept that the tragedy is compounded by the knowledge that none of  these children should have been on those buses in the first place.   Moving children through Border Patrol custody, into HHS custody, and  then delivering them to sponsors throughout the country is not a  solution to the problem. It only makes the problem worse.   If Democrats want to embrace a ``humane'' approach to immigration  reform, they should stop worrying about those talking points and secure  the border. Treat this like the crisis it is.   Restore the Migrant Protection Protocols. I have introduced a bill  that would make that happen; all we need is a few votes and a  signature.   Fully embrace our title 42 authority to turn away adults and children  who attempt to enter the country illegally. Close the loophole that has  tempted so many parents to send their children to the border alone.   Resume construction of the border wall, and invest in the  infrastructure, technology, and manpower it will take to truly secure  those points of entry.   But above all else, stop making promises you can't keep.   This is the most important piece of advice I can give to my  colleagues on  [[Page S3498]]  the other side of the aisle and to the administration.   I know that you believe opening the border is compassionate policy,  but the cartels are exploiting your version of compassion and using it  to manipulate desperate families.   For some inexplicable reason, the Biden administration has made it  official policy to finish the cartels' work for them and take these  children to their new life, which could be as part of an MS-13 gang, or  a labor work crew, or a sex trafficking ring. It could be with drug  runners.   If you believe all these children are headed to their families,  you're living in fantasyland.   Last week, Senator Hagerty, Congressman Fleischman, and I sent a  letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and OHS Secretary Alejandro  Mayorkas asking for an explanation. We are still waiting for a  satisfactory response.   But I will tell you, you cannot fix this crisis with a talking point.  You cannot fix it by staying silent, as Secretaries Becerra and  Mayorkas have chosen to be.   Parents are sending their children 1,000 miles across the continent  in the custody of drug mules and sex traffickers because the  administration has given them hope that if they take this one,  unthinkable risk, the door will be open, and they will be able to  follow their children into the country.   We have the power to stop this.   It is time to abandon talking points, address the root cause of the  crisis, and secure our southern border before it is too late. Because  if we have learned anything about how the cartels operate, the children  who passed through Chattanooga last week, the ones who made it here,  are the lucky ones.                            ____________________
