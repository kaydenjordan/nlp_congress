 Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 days, I have seen the very  best of America. I have seen restaurants Umi Seafood and Lucille's BBQ  in Fort Wayne deliver thousands of meals to those who need it.   I have seen TNT Floral Shop in Columbia City deliver flowers to every  nursing home resident in my county.   I have seen many lining up to donate blood.   I have seen so many healthcare professionals put themselves in harm's  way on the front lines.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to join them and bring relief to  our neighbors who needed it yesterday.   The CARES Act will keep the lights on in America. It will put cash in  the hands of Americans who need help to pay their bills and put food on  the table. It will give a lifeline to small businesses when they need  it most.   This is, by no means, a perfect bill, but it gets help to the people  who need it most. I hope we will come back and make changes, as needed,  in the near future.   Mr. Speaker, in this time of national crisis, we must continue  working together and with President Trump to keep our country in the  fight.
