 Mr. Speaker, in the zeal to spend more money on our  military, some of which is admirable, it is easy to forget that we  still have a crisis at the southern border.   Again and again, month after month, 160,000, 180,000 people are  coming here. It should be brought to our attention because recently a  horrific sexual assault of a 10-year-old made national news, and I  don't believe it was anywhere near publicized enough that the assault  was done by an illegal immigrant.   This is what happens when we have an open border. People have to pay  a horrible price for the laxness here. In addition, of course, to the  sexual assault, we have the 110,000 deaths by illegal drugs in this  country, and the current administration doesn't seem to care at all.   It is time in this plethora of spending bills to have dramatic  increases in the number of people at the border as well as to go back  to the stay in Mexico policy.                            ____________________
