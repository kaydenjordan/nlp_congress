 Mr. Speaker, one of the most important parts of  President Obama's legacy is the recognition that Americans should not  be discriminated against based on preexisting conditions. This  principle was enshrined in law by the Affordable Care Act, and now  millions of Americans across the political spectrum support these vital  protections. Even yesterday, President Trump, an avowed opponent of the  Affordable Care Act, stated unequivocally that he was opposed to  discrimination based on preexisting conditions.   The bill under consideration by this House, the American Health Care  Act, does not represent that same bipartisan principle. My colleagues  are advancing a measure that would let States turn back the clock for  millions of Americans and begin that discrimination again.   Today, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill for the sake of all  those it would harm. For the sake of anyone who has survived cancer,  battled diabetes, or was simply born a woman, I urge you, vote ``no.''                            ____________________
