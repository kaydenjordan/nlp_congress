 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captive Nations  Week.   In 1959, Congress authorized and requested the President proclaim the  third week in July as Captive Nations Week. During this week, we stand  united with those who still live under the rule of communist regimes as  they continue fighting against this oppression and lack of human  rights. You have my word that I will continue to fight along with you.   As a way to educate current and future generations about the  ideology, history, and societal impact of communism, the Victims of  Communism Memorial Foundation was authorized in 1993 by a unanimous act  of Congress.   In honor of this foundation, I have introduced H. Con. Res. 57, which  expresses the sense of Congress that establishing a museum in memory of  the victims of communism is an important step in educating Americans  about the human rights violations committed by these totalitarian  regimes and telling the whole story of 20th century history.   This museum would honor the memory of the heroes who resisted  communist tyranny and commemorate America's more than half a century of  efforts resisting Soviet imperialism.   I ask my colleagues to join me during Captive Nations Week in  recognizing and supporting victims of communism by cosponsoring H. Con.  Res. 57 and bringing the truth to light.                            ____________________
