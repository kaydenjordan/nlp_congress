 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the life and career of  golfer Renee Powell and discuss why she deserves a Presidential Medal  of Freedom.   In 1967, Renee Powell became just the second African American to play  on the LPGA tour and competed in more than 250 professional  tournaments.   Also, Powell was an international ambassador for the game of golf.  She was a member of the British PGA, won a tournament in Australia, and  taught golf to African heads of state.   In 1977, she was the first woman ever to play in a men's professional  golf tournament. In 2017, Powell was elected to the PGA American Hall  of Fame. However, she was more than an exceptional golfer.   Powell designed golf apparel for the famous British department store  Harrods. Today, she runs Clearview H.O.P.E., a rehabilitation program  for female war veterans.   Renee Powell is an American icon and a civil rights pioneer, and she  deserves to be recognized with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for the  opportunity to speak tonight in this Special Order, and the gentleman  from Illinois, for showing great leadership in what is a wholesome and  honorable responsibility to lead these Special Order hours.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our fallen African-American  veterans in the week before Memorial Day and discuss what the Honoring  our PACT Act will do to help all surviving veterans.   Almost 200,000 Black Americans died while fighting to protect U.S.  freedoms. They fought in every major U.S. conflict, from the  Revolutionary War to the Iraq war. In fact, the first person to die in  the Revolutionary War, our war for freedom, was Crispus Attucks, an  African American.   The names of the regiments are emblazoned in American history, names  like the Buffalo Soldiers, the Tuskegee Airmen, and the Harlem  Hellfighters. In my district, they continue to make a difference in  local industry and local politics.   Black soldiers are America's forgotten heroes. They fought in foreign  wars to protect our Nation, then they fought oppression, racism, and  hatred when they returned home--not welcomed in the restaurants, not  welcomed in the hotels, not welcomed to drink from certain fountains,  but fought far and wide away from this Nation.   They deserve more than the usual ``thanks for your service'' they  receive across the country, and I am proud to support a law that helps  them get more support.                                time  2000    The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to  Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the Honoring our PACT Act, could  be the largest veterans' healthcare and benefits expansion in American  history.   The Honoring our PACT Act expands and extends eligibility for  Veterans Administration healthcare to veterans who have suffered toxic  exposure, and it does the same for veterans of the Vietnam war, Gulf  war, and other post-9/11 conflicts that we have engaged in. That means  five million veterans could be eligible for benefits, thanks to this  act.   Also, the Honoring our PACT Act adds more than 20 health conditions  to the list of eligibility for VA health benefits, such as exposure to  Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxins. It requires the VA to  provide toxic exposure screening to every veteran enrolled in the VA  healthcare system.   But local veterans and advocates are excited about more than these  benefits. They are telling district veterans that the Honoring our PACT  Act will allow them to get physicals in order to find service-related  ailments and disabilities. These physicals could allow more eligible  veterans to enroll in VA healthcare and help them register as an  American veteran for health-related or other benefits nationwide.   But the VA has to do a better job in contacting veterans to encourage  them to participate. Some veterans in my district said the VA has a  version of the notorious don't ask, don't tell policy. They say, if you  don't ask the VA about the benefits directly, they won't let you know,  and that seems to be a theme that runs across the Federal Government.   There are so many projects and plans and opportunities for people  across this Nation, just everyday, normal Americans, but if you don't  know the right question to ask, the information is not forthcoming.   Now, nobody will mislead you, but you have to ask the right question  and then they are forthcoming with the information. That has to change.   As we honor our Nation's fallen heroes, we must do more to support  veterans and other American heroes. That way, our dedication to the men  and women who protect our country and keep us safe will be more than  words. It will be a direct action. I am just delighted to be here to  raise this issue.   There shouldn't have to be an acknowledgment separately of African- American veterans, but this country, in some ways, has forgotten them  and so we have to raise the issue. We don't want it. We want to be a  part of the collective of this great Nation, but there are so many  instances where the contributions of this population are left out. So  we are here to make sure it is clear, and to correct the history.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Nation's  brave Black servicemembers. I rise not only for our veterans who served  our Nation with honor and integrity, but also for those who gave the  ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country.   Black soldiers have fought and given their lives in every American  conflict since the Revolutionary War fighting for democracy at home and  abroad, while being treated like second-class citizens on American  soil.   In 1944, this very body passed the GI Bill to provide free education,  unemployment pay, and home loans for millions of veterans returning  from World War II. These benefits helped to expand our American middle  class after the war, but Black veterans were excluded from these  benefits due to our Nation's original sin.   This exclusion helped to widen the already existing wealth gap  between White and Black Americans, the same gap that we feel and see  today. The wide disparity in the bill's implementation increased  wealth, education, and civil rights gaps. The inequitable  implementation of the GI bill shut the door for 1.2 million Black  people, veterans who bravely served the country during World War II in  segregated ranks.   The willingness on the part of African-American soldiers to serve and  sacrifice their lives for a country that treated them as second-class  citizens is beyond remarkable. It wasn't until President Truman's  executive order 9981 that the Armed Services were forced to  desegregate, but by this time the damage had already been done.   In the South, the GI bill exacerbated rather than narrowed the  economic educational attainment of Black veterans. After World War II,  Black veterans who wanted to attend college in the South were  restricted in their choices of about 100 public and private  institutions. Only 6 percent of African-American veterans of World War  II earned college degrees, compared to 19 percent of White veterans.  [[Page H2490]]    For over 200 years, Black soldiers have endured individual and  institutional racism while fighting for their country. It is time to  honor every Black veteran and soldier who paid the ultimate sacrifice  while fighting for a more perfect union at home. May their memory be a  blessing, and may this Congress rectify injustices committed on this  very floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson).
