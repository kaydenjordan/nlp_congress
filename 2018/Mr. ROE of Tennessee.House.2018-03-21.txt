 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act.   I am a physician and scientist with over 40 years experience treating  patients, some of whom had the dreaded diagnosis of cancer.    Six months ago, I was operated on for cancer, and I, to this day, am  a cancer survivor. If needed, I would like to have the right to try.   A little over 3 years ago, my beloved wife, Pam Roe, a nurse and  friend, died of stage IV colon cancer. She would have liked to have had  the right to try.   Less than 2 months after that, one of the best friends I will ever  have in my life, Phil Street, a Vietnam veteran, Air Force veteran,  died of a cancer related to Agent Orange. Phil would have liked to have  had the right to try.   My senior partner in medical practice, a year later, good friend, was  diagnosed with brain cancer. Dr. Cone would have liked the right to  try.   Shortly after that, Linda Baines, a scrub nurse that I have operated  with hundreds of times in my medical practice, was diagnosed with  cancer. Linda would have liked the right to try.   I have two dear friends at this moment who are both being treated for  stage IV cancer. If those treatments don't work--and I have had to look  patients in the eye and say, Mr. Speaker: ``Your life is not in my  hands anymore. It is in God's hands''--they would like to have the  right to try.   I tell you this: all these patients want and deserve is a right to  try. Please, I am asking you to support this legislation.
