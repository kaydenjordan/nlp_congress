 Madam Speaker, today, I would like to call attention  to an issue that gravely impacts the lives of South Carolinians and  folks up and down the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts: offshore drilling.   Most actions in Congress are viewed through a partisan lens. The  opposition to offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting, however,  crosses party lines. In a time when Democrats and Republicans cannot  agree on much, that this singular issue has gotten bipartisan support  is even that much more significant.   H.R. 291, the Coastal Economies Protection Act, legislation that I  introduced earlier this week, places a 10-year moratorium on oil and  gas drilling and seismic airgun blasting off the Atlantic and the Gulf  Coasts.   Our vibrant natural resources define South Carolina, generating  revenue and jobs and creating our unique way of life. Risking our  thriving tourism, recreation, and fishing industries to oil exploration  could have devastating economic repercussions across the State, and,  frankly, these industries are too important to the health of South  Carolina to risk.                            ____________________
