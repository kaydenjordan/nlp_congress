 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Democrats' spending bill is not about building back better, it is  about building up a bureaucracy that will expand the reach of the  Federal Government, especially over education.   This bill will impose Federal control over pre-K, limit parental  choice, increase the cost of childcare, punish job creators, reward  far-left special interests, and deepen our debt crisis.   This bill recklessly sets aside $400 billion for universal pre-K and  childcare but, in reality, there is no telling how much this provision  will cost the American people. Subsidizing the childcare of wealthy  families isn't building back better, it is building back bankrupt.   This legislation is wrong for our country and wrong for our children.  Education is best when run locally and when parents are involved.   The bill also includes dangerous provisions from the PRO Union Bosses  Act, which kneecap business owners while putting a target on job  creators' backs with outrageously inflated Labor Department fines.   Democrats keep saying this legislation is transformational. Well, let  me tell them something: The American people do not want this country to  be transformed in the way they want to transform it.   It is time to make protecting the future of this Nation, our  children, a priority, not empowering teachers unions, burdening job  creators, or centralizing control in the hands of unelected,  unaccountable Washington bureaucrats.
