 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if there is one thing we have been able to  rely on over the past half century or so, it is Democratic hysteria  over Republican Supreme Court nominations. No sooner does a Republican  President announce a nomination than the Democrats are off and running.  It doesn't matter who the nominee is--the playbook is the same. The  Democrats warn that equal rights are in jeopardy; that our system of  government may not survive; in fact, that Americans may not survive.  That is right. In the lead-up to Justice Gorsuch's confirmation, the  head of one liberal organization stated that there was ``substantial  evidence'' that if Gorsuch's ``egregious views were to become law,  Americans' lives . . . would be put at risk in untold ways.'' I am  happy to report that a year into Justice Gorsuch's tenure on the  Supreme Court, Americans seem to be doing OK.   Fast-forward to Judge Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination, and once  again, Democrats are predicting that the sky will fall if a Republican  President's Supreme Court nominee is confirmed.   Faced with an eminently well-qualified, mainstream nominee, they have  been forced to resort to distortions or outright conspiracy theories to  make their case. Their statements have been so extreme that they have  already been called out more than once by the mainstream media.   The New York Times--not exactly known as an apologist for the  Republican Party--published a fact check with the headline ``Democrats  Overstate Kavanaugh's Writings on the Affordable Care Act.''   The Washington Post published a fact check that described a  Democratic characterization of Kavanaugh as ``extreme distortion.'' Two  tweets offering a truly absurd conspiracy theory about Justice  Kennedy's resignation received four Pinocchios from the Washington  Post--a rating that qualifies the tweets as ``whoppers.''   At the root of Democrats' frenzy is their belief that the only good  Supreme Court Justice is a Supreme Court Justice who shares their  political beliefs and who will rule in support of them. That is a very  disturbing point of view. Our system of government is based on the rule  of law, but the rule of law depends on having judges who will rule  based on the law and the facts, not on their personal opinions.   Once judges start ruling based on their political opinions or their  feelings about what they would like the law to be, then we will have  replaced the rule of law with the rule of individual judges. That is  exactly what Democrats are pushing for. They are looking for Supreme  Court Justices who will rule based not on the law but their personal  beliefs. More specifically, they are looking for judges who will rule  based on Democrats' beliefs. Just look at the Democrats' statements  since Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Democrats aren't interested in  whether Judge Kavanaugh is qualified or will rule in accordance with  the law; instead, they are concerned about his views on specific issues  and whether those views line up with Democrats' opinions.   Democrats want a Supreme Court that will ratify the opinions of the  Democratic Party, whether or not those opinions are in line with the  law or the Constitution. Of course judges have political opinions. Of  course judges have personal feelings. When you are a judge, your job is  to leave those things at the courtroom door. Your job is to judge based  on the law and the facts, even when you don't like--especially when you  don't like the outcome. As Justice Gorsuch has said, ``A judge who  likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge--stretching  for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''   I don't know how Judge Kavanaugh would rule on the cases he would  face as a member of the Supreme Court, but I do know that in each and  every case, he would look not for the results he prefers but for those  the law demands.   In a 2017 speech at Notre Dame Law School, Judge Kavanaugh said:         I believe very deeply in those visions of the rule of law       as a law of rules, and of the judge as umpire. By that, I       mean a neutral, impartial judiciary that decides cases based       on settled principles without regard to policy preferences or       political allegiances or which party is on which side in a       particular case.    That is it. That is the job of a judge--to serve as the umpire, to  call the balls and strikes, not rewrite the rules of the game.   When you are considering a candidate for Congress, political  opinions, like those the Democrats are demanding, matter. When it comes  to judges, there are really only two important questions: First, is  this judge well qualified? Second, does this person understand the  proper role of a judge? When it comes to Judge Kavanaugh, the answer to  both questions is yes. His qualifications are outstanding. He is a  graduate of Yale Law School. He clerked for a Supreme Court Justice. He  is a lecturer at Harvard Law School. Most importantly, as a judge on  the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, he has handed down thoughtful, well- respected decisions that reveal his deep respect for the law and the  Constitution and his understanding that it is a judge's job to  interpret the law, not to legislate from the bench.   It is unfortunate that Democrats' belief that the only good judges  are liberal judges is preventing them from giving an outstandingly  qualified nominee like Judge Kavanaugh a fair hearing. There is still  time for them to abandon their partisan political opposition and take a  real look at Judge Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court. I  hope they will.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
