 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I rise today with  a belief that the Honorable   John Lewis was eminently correct with his  statement. He does not need my commentary; hence, I will not give  commentary.   I just want the Record to reflect that on September 24, shortly after  the noon hour, I had the preeminent privilege of being here in this  very room to hear the Honorable   John Lewis.   While I won't comment on his commentary, I will just comment on  something that was on my heart as it relates to people who approach and  ask questions about the state of affairs, the status of our country.   On yesterday, a young man, 9 years of age, his name is Alec. Alec is  a variation of Alexander. Alexander means helper of humankind.   This 9-year-old young man expressed his concerns about our country--9  years of age. The proof of what I say can be validated because he was  at the rally that was held right out front of the Rayburn House Office  Building--9 years of age.   People of all ages who have been chronicling these events are asking  questions. There are many answers to be given, but I think the  Honorable   John Lewis has given us the best. I am honored that I was  here when he gave us pearls of wisdom to facilitate our going forward.                            ____________________
