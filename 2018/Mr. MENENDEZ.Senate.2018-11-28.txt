 Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the chairman.   I understand Senator Inhofe wants to speak to this issue.    No, he doesn't want to speak to this issue.   I am happy to yield to the chairman, or I am ready to go--whichever  way you want.  [[Page S7164]]         Mr. President, I rise today to speak to S.J. Res. 54,  legislation brought forward by Senators Lee, Sanders, and Murphy more  than 8 months ago. The past 2 years have reminded us time and again of  the urgent responsibility of Congress to perform real checks and  balances and to steadfastly defend our American values both at home and  abroad. I thank them for their continued efforts throughout these  intervening months to shed light on the devastating humanitarian crisis  in Yemen and to make sure this body fulfills its oversight duties.   Over the last 3\1/2\ years, the tragic humanitarian crisis in Yemen  has continued to deteriorate. More than 10,000 people are dead and 14  million people are on the brink of starvation. We have seen the  heartbreaking photos of malnourished starving children on the brink of  death. We have learned from U.N. reports of the cholera outbreaks that  jeopardize more than 10,000 people every week. We have come to the  conclusion that the status quo cannot stand.   Back in March, I joined a majority of my colleagues in voting to  table this resolution with the understanding that the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee would hold hearings to fully weigh our options in  Yemen and the hope that the administration would strategically leverage  our limited military support for the Saudi coalition to lessen civilian  casualties, to influence a potential political settlement, or at the  very least prevent the situation from getting worse.   At the time, I also made clear to this body, to the President, and to  the Saudi Government that our relationship and our limited military  support was not and is not a blank check. I had hoped the  administration would provide convincing evidence that our military  support was, in fact, reducing civilian casualties--a goal we heard  repeatedly emphasized by U.S. officials. I had hoped the administration  would use this foreign policy tool to advocate for a meaningful  political process.   Unfortunately, this administration has failed to adequately address  either problem. The Saudi coalition has not provided any more  confidence in its operations. Despite being reassured that our engaging  with the Saudis was decreasing civilian casualties, the facts on the  ground speak far more powerfully against those assertions.   On a broader scale, we are seriously evaluating our bilateral  relationship with Saudi Arabia. The bombing of a schoolbus full of  children and other civilian targets is not something I want America's  fingerprints on.   Make no mistake--the United States and Saudi Arabia do share common  security interests. Saudi Arabia faces real and imminent threats from  Yemeni-originated attacks inside its territory--from ballistic and SCUD  missile attacks aimed at major Saudi population centers, to cross- border attacks by Iranian-backed Houthis.   Meanwhile, Iran continues its destabilizing behavior across the  Middle East, and the terrorists with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula  take advantage of the security breakdown.   I continue to believe the United States must live up to our  commitments and support our partners in the face of real and imminent  threats, but over the past year, I have failed to see how continued  U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalitions operations in Yemen  have, in fact, promoted our interests or, indeed, the long-term  interests of the Saudi population.   As I said in March, this particular resolution raises the question of  how we leverage all of the foreign policy tools at our disposal to  advance peace and prevent the tragic loss of more human life.   Today, it is clear to me that the status quo is not advancing these  critical interests. The limited military support we are providing the  Saudi coalition is not our best tool, and today I offer my support for  discharging something I normally oppose--discharging a resolution from  the committee.   I call on the administration again to develop a cogent strategy, in  concert with the international community, to compel all the parties to  the negotiating table and to ensure that the millions of Yemenis at  risk of starvation receive the humanitarian support that is ready to be  delivered.   I have also worked with Senators Young, Reed, Graham, Shaheen, and  Collins, as well as with my colleague Senator Murphy, to introduce  legislation with reference to the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen  Act of 2018. I had hoped the committee would have considered this  legislation and that we would have had a vote on it in this Congress.   In the aftermath of the Saudi Government's murder of U.S. resident  and journalist Jamal Khashoggi and of the whitewashing the Trump  administration has performed to avoid real consequences for those who  ordered his death, this legislation is needed now more than ever.  Without a real diplomatic and political strategy, there is no end to  this conflict. There is no end to the violence. There is no end to the  human suffering. It is time we bring this resolution to the floor for  the full consideration of the Senate.   Over the last several months, I have seen nothing to convince me that  our limited military support for the Saudi coalition's efforts in Yemen  continues to serve our national security interests or to reflect  America's enduring values and commitment to freedom and human rights. I  continue to believe that an absence of American leadership undermines  our interests, our security, and the security of our allies. An  American presence does not necessarily equal American leadership.  America's leadership on the global stage must always be driven by a  sense of purpose and moral clarity. I feel that when we lose that sense  of moral clarity, that sense of purpose, then we lose who we are as a  nation, and we lose sight of the very values that make America a leader  of nations. That is, in fact, what we have lost sight of here.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I yield back all time.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
