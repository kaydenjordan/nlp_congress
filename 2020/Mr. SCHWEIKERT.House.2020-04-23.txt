 Madam Speaker, how many of us have had the phone  calls over the last couple of weeks where we are talking to that small  businessperson, and you can almost hear the tears on the other side of  the call? You can hear the stress, almost panic that they are about to  hurt the very people that they work with, because their business is  failing, because they are desperate for what we made a promise to do,  that payroll protection money that functionally ran out a couple of  weeks ago. We knew the math, and we engaged in a type of cruelty around  here because we sat here and engaged in partisan--we are better than  this. We knew what we had to do. Let's never do this again.   For Arizona, what we are about to vote on is 202,000 jobs. And the  fact of the matter is, they should have had those two weeks ago. Let's  make this happen.
