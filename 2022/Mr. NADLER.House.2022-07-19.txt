 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1232, I call up  the bill (H.R. 8404) to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure  respect for State regulation of marriage, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 8404.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8404 the Respect for Marriage Act would reaffirm  that marriage equality is, and must remain, the law of the land.   Over the past several decades, millions of LGBTQ people in loving and  supportive relationships have married and formed families, particularly  after the Supreme Court ruled, in Obergefell v. Hodges, that the  Constitution protects marriage equality.   An estimated 2 million children are being raised by LGBTQ families  today. An enormous body of research shows that stable and loving  families are the foundation for children's well-being and success, and  children do best when their families have the critical legal  protections to care for one another.   Thankfully, marriage equality remains constitutionally protected, and  there is no indication that it will be overturned in the foreseeable  future. It is--and should forever be considered--settled law.   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court's recent position in Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health, which extinguished the constitutional right to  abortion, has raised concerns among some people that other rights  rooted in the constitutional right to privacy may be at risk,  notwithstanding the Court's assurance that Dobbs was limited to  abortion. This includes the right to marriage equality.   In fact, in a concurring opinion in Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas  explicitly called on the Court to reconsider its decisions protecting  other fundamental rights, including the right to same-sex marriage. And  although Justice Thomas did not mention the right to interracial  marriage, that right relies on the same constitutional doctrines as the  right to same-sex marriage, and, therefore, it could be vulnerable to a  legal challenge in the future as well.   Even if we accept the Court's assurance in Dobbs that its decision  does not call other rights into question, Congress should provide  additional reassurance that marriage equality is a  [[Page H6720]]  matter of settled law. All married people who are building their lives  together must know that the government will respect and recognize their  marriages--for all time.                                time  1215    The Respect for Marriage Act, which I introduced with the co-chairs  of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, the chairs of the Congressional Tri- Caucus, and the House Democratic Caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries, is an  updated version of the bill that I first introduced in 2009.   The first provision would repeal the odious Defense of Marriage Act,  or DOMA--the 1996 law that discriminates against married same-sex  couples. While that law was ruled unconstitutional, it remains on the  books, and it must be removed.   The bill would also enshrine marriage equality for Federal law  purposes and would ensure that States give full legal effect to valid  out-of-state marriages regardless of the sex, race, ethnicity, or  national origin of the individuals in the marriage.   This legislation would provide additional stability for the lives  that families have built upon the foundation of our fundamental rights.  Congress must pass the Respect for Marriage Act to dispel any concern  or any uncertainty for families worried by the implications of the  Dobbs decision. And it must pass the Respect for Marriage Act to  enshrine in law the equality and liberty that our Constitution  guarantees.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the chair of the Equality Caucus and a  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, much of what the prior two speakers said was absolute  nonsense. Some was true.   Unfortunately, pregnancy crisis centers have been the targets of  terrorism, and that is deplorable. But so have abortion clinics. They  didn't mention that. Abortion clinics have also been the targets of  terrorism.   The murder of Dr. Bernard Slepian comes to mind. That is equally  deplorable, and we should stop both of them if we can.   The rest of what they said was nonsense.   The Supreme Court logic, the substantive due process logic by which  the Court overthrew Roe v. Wade, applies equally to Obergefell, to  Loving, and to Lawrence, in other words, to the right to contraception,  to the right to gay marriage, and to the right to interracial marriage,  for that matter.   Justice Thomas mentioned all that specifically. Yes, he said, this  case doesn't involve that. We are not deciding that yet, which is the  portion of his concurrence that Mr. Johnson read, but read the rest of  his concurrence where he said specifically that we should overrule or  reconsider Obergefell and Lawrence, which is gay marriage, which is  consensual sodomy.   He didn't mention Loving, though, for some reason, which is  interracial marriage. Maybe the fact that he is intermarried and so is  Senator McConnell had something to do with it. But the same logic  applies there, so that is not nonsense.   Note that they offered no argument against this bill at all. We  didn't hear anything about the merits of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Much of what the gentleman from Texas just said was irrelevant; but  he made one correct point. He said that the bill before us today  codifies Obergefell. It does, and if Obergefell is not overruled by the  Supreme Court, it is not necessary, but it is also not harmful.   If Obergefell is overruled by the Supreme Court, as Justice Thomas  hints it might be, then passing this bill becomes vital.   And as to recognizing marriage in one State or another State,  obviously, if you get married in Texas and you go to Nevada, you don't  get unmarried. You can't be married in one State and not in another  State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court, in the Obergefell  decision, reversed the actions of the people in those 30 or 35 States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York, (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the Respect for Marriage Act provides  additional stability for the millions of American married couples and  families that have ordered their lives around the constitutional  guarantee of marriage equality. It has nothing to do with attacks  on abortion clinics. It has nothing to do with attacks on so-called  pregnancy crisis centers. It has to do with marriage.    This legislation repeals an unconstitutional and discriminatory  statute that the Court has effectively rendered inoperative, but which  remains on the books. It is time to appeal this abhorrent law and fix  the mistake that Congress made a generation ago while we reinforce and  cement current law.   As I pointed out before, the Obergefell decision is a decision of the  Supreme Court. If that decision is not overturned, this bill is  unnecessary but harmless. If that decision is overturned, this bill is  crucial, and we don't know what this Court is going to do. Despite what  Justice Alito said, Justice Thomas suggested that the decision on gay  marriage ought to be overruled.   We have seen this Court overrule other precedent in Dobbs, so who can  be confident that the Court will not overturn the Lawrence decision or,  rather, the Obergefell decision? Who can be confident of that? The  answer is no one.   As to the gentleman from Ohio's comment that the people in, I think  he said, 33 States or whatever have decided that gay marriage should  not be, and it should be up to the people of each State, that is  absurd. And that is why we have one of the provisions of this bill. You  can't be married in Texas and not be married in New York or vice versa.  You can't lose your marriage status by crossing a State line.   This legislation is very necessary to make sure that people have the  right to remain married, that gay couples have the right to get  married, have the right to stay married, and that is why leading  national organizations have endorsed the bill, including the ACLU,  [[Page H6728]]  the Equality Federation, Family Equality Council, Freedom for All  Americans, GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Black  Justice Coalition, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the National  Women's Law Center, and PFLAG. They know what is going on. They know  what is at stake.   Mr. Speaker, this is a long overdue bill. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
