 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, President Trump's instincts on China are  correct, but his execution is poor. He should stick with those  instincts and not those who label anything we do to protect America  against China's rapacious policies as protectionist. At the same time,  he should fix his plan so it really does what he intends it to do or  wants it to do.   I have been one of the chief critics of the status quo on trade.  Americans--and I share this view--resent all those academics who any  time we try to do anything with China say: protectionist, trade war.   The bottom line is simple. China is eating our lunch. China is  rapacious. China, day by day, gnaws away at our economy by manipulating  currency. They sometimes do it, they sometimes don't, but they will  again when they can.   By having no reciprocity, they don't let good American industries in,  but they want to come here--and do, easily--buying our family jewels,  our intellectual property, our leading companies in robotics,  artificial intelligence, chips, and pharmaceuticals.   China has a plan to take advantage of America, to surpass us  economically by not being fair. They keep their huge market protected,  steal our stuff, learn how to do it, then try to come sell it here and  gain an advantage when they can by manipulating currency.   The President should not be deterred by all of those business  interests that are only interested in their profits, not in what is  good for America. That is their job, their shareholders--I get it--but  he should not be deterred by them. At the same time, he has to back off  this plan which doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Major harm is  done to allies like Canada and Europe, not to China.   That is the tightrope we need to walk on. If the President walks on  that tightrope carefully and well, we will support him.   The President's instincts to go after China are correct, but the  policy he proposes doesn't fit the bill. It is not well targeted, it is  not precise and, as a result, it could cause a mess of collateral  damage that hurts America more than it helps.   The sweeping nature of the tariffs has already justifiably angered  key allies in Canada and Europe and could draw reciprocal tariffs on  American goods, raising costs on average consumers from coast-to-coast.  A country such as Canada, with which we have a trade surplus, could  retaliate.   Mr. President, focus on China. Go after China and do it in a smart,  focused but sharp-edged way. Don't create a policy that hurts our  allies more than it hurts China and causes China to sort of giggle at  our ineffectiveness.   A trade war is not what we want. Making China play by the rules is  what all Americans want, except for a handful of businesses that just  see their interests and raising their profits no matter where the jobs  go or where they sell goods.   China dumps counterfeit and artificially cheap goods into our market,  denies productive U.S. companies fair access to their markets, and  steals the intellectual property of American companies. I am pained,  actually pained, because I love this country, and I want to see us stay  economically No. 1. I am pained when I go over in my mind the statement  of retired four-star GEN Keith Alexander, who is in charge of cyber  security in America. He called China's theft of our intellectual  property the ``greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' American  wealth is actually being stolen by China, and we sit here and shrug our  shoulders or do things that are not effective.   The Trump administration should rethink its approach to sweeping  tariffs while there is still time and focus attention on China. China  is our No. 1 trade problem--not Canada, not Europe. President Trump  could do a much better job of tailoring his trade policy to address the  real problems instead of creating new ones.                                Infrastructure    Mr. President, on infrastructure, a year ago last January, guided by  what President Trump had said, wanting to  [[Page S1407]]  work with Democrats on infrastructure, Senate Democrats unveiled our $1  trillion infrastructure plan. It was an outline.   We sent it to the President. We said it was one of the areas where we  could work with the President to get something done. Then we waited and  we waited and we waited. A full year after we made our proposal, the  Trump administration finally released one of its own. Frankly,  President Trump's plan on infrastructure, to put it kindly, was  underwhelming. It is going over like a lead balloon, and it is very  simple why. After a year of bold promises about trillion-dollar  infrastructure, a plan to build ``gleaming new roads, bridges,  highways, railways, and waterways all across our land,'' President  Trump's infrastructure plan proposes no new net increase in  infrastructure funding. He put in $200 billion and then took it away by  cutting the existing programs on infrastructure. It will not get the  job done. Robbing Peter to pay Paul a pittance will not do nearly  enough to rebuild our infrastructure.   Because so much of the funding is not from the Federal Government,  which has traditionally funded the lion's share of infrastructure-- highways, water and sewer--the money is going to have to come from two  places, neither of which is a good option: localities, which are  starved for cash already--they are not going to build much--or the  private sector, which will, of course, quite naturally want a payback.  That is how the private sector works. They are not going to put money  up unless they are paid back. They are not going to lend money without  being paid back. We know what that will mean--tolls, tolls, and more  tolls. Trump tolls from one end of the Nation to the other. That is not  what America wants. Trump's plan is already a huge flop. Hardly anyone  is paying attention to it.   We Democrats have a better deal to offer the American people. Rather  than cutting existing infrastructure projects to pay for a paltry  program that will not work, we want to roll back the Republican tax  giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy and invest that  money instead in job-creating infrastructure. The overwhelming majority  of Americans would say, they would rather see millions of jobs created  than give tax breaks to the wealthiest. Our plan could create up to 15  million good-paying jobs for the middle class.   We have already seen, by the way, that those tax breaks are not  creating many jobs. Instead, they are going to stock buybacks, which is  a way for corporate executives to take that money, raise their own  salaries and raise the salaries of shareholders, the vast majority of  whom are in the top 10 percent of America.   We are proposing something new and different. We propose to put the  top rate back to 39.6 percent. The wealthy are doing great in America;  they didn't need a tax cut. It is the middle class that needed more of  one.   We propose restoring the AMT. That AMT prevented the wealthiest of  Americans from evading taxes. It is a tax expert's way of restoring the  Buffet rule, which says that a rich corporate executive shouldn't pay a  lower rate of taxes than his or her secretary.   We restore the estate tax. After all, that benefits 5,000 wealthy  families. We also close the carried interest loophole.   We raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, which is what the  Business Roundtable called for. But our Republican friends and  President Trump were in a mania to just cut, cut, cut corporate taxes-- even at a time that corporations are doing well--and moved it to 21  percent. We go back up to the 25 percent that the Business Roundtable  suggested.   With all that money, what do we invest it in? A modern infrastructure  plan that would build everything from roads and bridges to schools and  airports, to high-speed internet and more, with a focus, by the way, on  rural internet because one-third of rural America doesn't have it.   In addition to the traditional types of projects we have long built  in this country, we are building 21st century infrastructure--as I  mentioned, rural internet, high speed. In the thirties, Franklin  Roosevelt said that every home in America should have electricity. It  was aimed at rural homes that didn't have it. Today, we Democrats  believe that every home should have high-speed internet, and that, too,  is aimed at rural America--where close to one-third of the homes don't  have high-speed internet--and at our inner cities as well.   Only with real, direct investment of Federal dollars will we build  the kinds of transformational projects that need to be built. Only with  real investment will rural America see the projects it needs built.  Only with real investment will we create millions of good-paying jobs.   You say: Where is the money going to come from? We don't want to  increase our deficit. The tax bill has done that enough.   We say: Take some of those tax breaks from the wealthiest of  Americans and put them into middle-class jobs, plain and simple.   Americans are realizing now where that money is going. The tax bill,  before it came out, was unpopular. It had an initial splurge of  popularity, and now, as Americans learn what it is actually doing, it  is becoming less popular again. It will go back to where it was, I  believe. More Americans will dislike it than like it, but when they  hear we can take some of that money and put it into infrastructure and  create millions of middle-class jobs, I think Americans of all stripes  will embrace that policy.   We Democrats want to work with the President and our Republican  colleagues on infrastructure, but we want to do it in a way that  produces real results, not the chimerical proposal the President made  that will produce very little infrastructure, almost no jobs, and put  Trump tolls all across America. We hope the President will move away  from his plan and come much further in our direction so that we can get  something done for the American people, particularly the American  working and middle classes.   I yield the floor.
