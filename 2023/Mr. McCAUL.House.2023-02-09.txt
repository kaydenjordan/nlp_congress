 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 104) condemning the Chinese Communist Party's use  of a high-altitude surveillance balloon over United States territory as  a brazen violation of United States sovereignty.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 104         Whereas, on February 2, 2023, the Department of Defense       publicly announced it was tracking over United States       territory a high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to       the People's Republic of China (PRC);        Whereas the Department of Defense has since acknowledged       that North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) first       began tracking the surveillance balloon on January 28, 2023,       prior to its entry into United States airspace;        Whereas the Secretary of Defense has stated that the       balloon ``was being used by the PRC in an attempt to surveil       strategic sites in the continental United States'';        Whereas the surveillance balloon traveled near sensitive       United States national security facilities, including       Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana;        Whereas, on February 4, 2023, a United States Air Force       aircraft shot down the surveillance balloon off the coast of       South Carolina;        Whereas the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) intelligence       collection directed against the United States poses a threat       to United States interests and security;        Whereas, while the PRC has a long history of intelligence       collection operations against United States national security       entities, reports of its espionage have risen significantly       in recent years;        Whereas the CCP attempted to spread false claims about the       nature and purpose of the surveillance balloon, falsely       claiming it to be a weather balloon that veered off-course       due to ``force majeure'' events;        Whereas, on February 3, 2023, the Secretary of State       postponed his planned trip to the PRC and referred to the       balloon incident as an ``irresponsible act and a clear       violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law that       undermined the purpose of the trip'';        Whereas Article I of the Convention on International Civil       Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention, states that       ``every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the       airspace above its territory'';        Whereas although PRC surveillance balloons have previously       violated United States airspace, this incident differs from       those prior violations due to the length of time the balloon       spent over United States territory; and        Whereas it is in the United States national security       interest to deter foreign adversaries from engaging in       intelligence collection and other malign activities within       United States territory and airspace: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the PRC's brazen violation of United States       sovereignty;        (2) denounces the CCP's efforts to deceive the       international community through false claims about its       intelligence collection campaigns in violation of United       States sovereignty;        (3) determines that it should be the policy of the United       States to promptly and decisively act to prevent foreign       aerial surveillance platforms, including those directed by or       connected to the CCP, from violating United States       sovereignty; and        (4) calls on the Biden administration to continue to keep       Congress apprised by providing comprehensive briefings on       this incident that include--        (A) a complete account of all known infiltrations of the       national airspace by the PRC over the past several years,       regardless of platform;        (B) a complete account of similar past incidents of the       PRC's use of surveillance balloons around the world;        (C) a complete timeline of events for the most recent       infiltration from first detection to the eventual shootdown       of the balloon;        (D) an assessment of what surveillance data the PRC was       potentially able to collect or transmit, via the balloon       while it was over United States territory;        (E) a detailed account of what measures were taken to       mitigate the intelligence collection threat posed by the       balloon, the costs of those measures, and the impact on the       regular operations of the affected installations, platforms,       and personnel;        (F) a description of what options were identified to       mitigate the threat, and a description and timing of the       recommendation the U.S. military made to the President       regarding those response options;        (G) a detailed account of diplomatic communications between       the United States and the PRC regarding this incident,       including any demarches by Department of State personnel and       subsequent responses by the PRC; and        (H) a detailed description of plans, capabilities, and       methods to deter and defeat intelligence collection       activities conducted by the PRC or other foreign adversaries       in the national airspace system and any additional       authorities needed from Congress to ensure detection and       defeat of these activities in the future.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this past week the Nation watched in shock as a Chinese  surveillance balloon traversed much of the United States, including  sensitive American military sites like Malmstrom Air Force Base in  Montana. That base is one of the three places where our minuteman ICBM  nuclear missiles are stored.   Americans were rightfully deeply disturbed by this brazen violation  of sovereignty by the Chinese Communist Party. This act of aggression  was done on the eve of a scheduled meeting between Chairman Xi and  Secretary of State Antony Blinken. That meeting was ultimately  canceled.   The balloon, I believe, was a test, a test of this administration to  see how it would respond. I believe the President should have shot it  down before it entered American airspace rather than allow it to cross  over the Continental United States airspace.   But make no mistake, this was another intentionally provocative act  by the CCP. As I have said often, weakness invites aggression. This act  will only further embolden and empower our enemies; it will embolden  and empower Chairman Xi.   Mr. Speaker, I have never seen a foreign nation adversary fly a  reconnaissance aircraft that you could see from the ground with your  own eyes. The CCP threat is now within sight for Americans across the  heartland, a vision and memory that they will not forget.   This is further proof that the CCP does not care about having a  constructive relationship with the United States. It is publicly  challenging U.S. interests, threatening Taiwan, supporting Russia's war  of aggression in Ukraine, and now violating U.S. sovereignty.   If there is any question whether the administration should request  funds supporting Taiwan's foreign military financing grants, this  incident alone should make it clear that the time is now to harden  ourselves and our partners against the Chinese military aggression.   An event like this, Mr. Speaker, must not happen again, and it cannot  go unanswered. They only understand one thing and that is force, and  that is projecting power; and we need to project power and force and  strength against the Chinese Communist Party.   They must understand that we do desire peace, but infringing upon our  sovereignty leads us down a dangerous path. Our adversaries must  believe that any future incursion into American airspace by a spy  balloon or any other vehicle will be met with decisive force, and that  is why the House should pass this resolution.   The resolution, under section 4, does call for the Biden  administration to continue to keep Congress apprised by providing  comprehensive briefings on this incident that include--and there  [[Page H795]]  are many of these, but I want to go to the end,--most importantly, a  detail description of plans, capabilities, and methods to deter and  defeat intelligence collection activities conducted by the PRC or other  foreign adversaries in the national airspace system and any additional  authorities needed from Congress to ensure detection and defeat these  activities in the future.   I hope this administration will comply with this resolution. This  resolution, I believe, sends a clear, bipartisan signal to the CCP and  our adversaries around the world that this action will not be  tolerated; to tell the world, with a united voice, that our national  security is not a partisan issue.   We stand together today with one voice, as Americans, Americans  against this act of aggression by the Chinese Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous support of this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Fry), who personally eyewitnessed  the spy balloon in the Atlantic Ocean as it was shot down on the  beaches right off of his district, off the coast of his district in  South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the vice chair of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs and another eyewitness to this act of aggression as the balloon  traveled across her State, the State of Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International  Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim), chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Indo-Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Zinke), an original cosponsor of this bill and yet another  Member who witnessed the spy balloon as it flew over his State of  Montana.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Moran), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Kean), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that lies, deceit, espionage, spying,  this is nothing new.   Mr. Speaker, I remember, in 1997, I was assigned to a case at the  Department of Justice to prosecute a man named Johnny Chung. He was  taking money from Chinese intelligence officials, from China Aerospace,  to put into the Clinton campaign to influence the election because  China wanted to influence the election back then. They wanted  satellites. They wanted aerospace technology. That is why they were  doing it then.   Guess what? My FBI agent got indicted for espionage for sleeping with  a Chinese spy--imagine that--a Chinese spy who for 20 years was  cultivated as an FBI asset. Her name was Katrina Leung. I will never  forget it because all the information I gave my agent went straight  back to the mother ship in Beijing. A Chinese spy, 20 years cultivated,  became a double agent reporting back to Beijing, and we can't release  those documents from 20 years ago, 30 years ago.                                time  1100    But this--this one--takes the cake: a balloon this brazen that is  only 60,000 feet above the ground and that can be seen with the naked  eye surveilling the United States of America.   We talked at our organizational meeting last night about how this  committee is bipartisan. We are bipartisan. We are bipartisan on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you this: If there is anything this Congress  should get done--I challenge the other side of the aisle--let's stand  together against this common enemy that we have.   Our enemy is not each other. Our enemies are foreign enemy nations  like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea--China being the largest  foreign state adversary and the biggest threat long term to the  national security interests of the United States.   Let's do it with one voice. Let's put our partisan politics aside and  do what is right for America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
