 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, my community was shaken by the  murder of Second Lieutenant Richard ``Richie'' Collins III, a young  African American stabbed to death while waiting for a bus on the campus  of the University of Maryland.   He was a student at Bowie State University just days from graduation.  Richie was in College Park visiting friends to celebrate his recent  commission as an officer in the United States Army.   He was a young man of great promise, very talented and driven to  success. He was popular on campus and helped create Bowie State  University's first lacrosse team. He was an avid player of golf,  soccer, and baseball. Richie loved deep conversations about life,  politics, and philosophy.   The individual on trial for his murder has been charged with a hate  crime.   Mr. Speaker, we must do more to combat the spread of hatred by  spreading tolerance and respect instead, and we must never forget  those, like Richie Collins, whose lives were cut short by hatred and  prejudice.   I again offer my condolences, as I have, to Richie's parents, Richard  and Dawn, his family, his friends to mark this somber anniversary. We  ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolled for us.                            ____________________
