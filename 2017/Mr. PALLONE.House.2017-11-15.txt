 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering legislation that would  authorize additional emergency uses for medical products in response to  the needs of the Department of Defense in the instance of a military  emergency.   Like all of my colleagues, I want to ensure that our military  personnel who put their life in harm's way for our freedom have access  to the medical products that they need, and I have supported and will  continue to support policies that further the goal of protecting our  troops from life-threatening risks.   However, these policies also have to be balanced to ensure that, in  our effort to protect troops from harm, we are not inadvertently  exposing them to additional risk from unproven products. That is why I  was disappointed to learn that the National Defense Authorization Act  conference report included a policy supported by the Senate that would  have given the Secretary of Defense authority to authorize emergency  access to unapproved medical products, an authority that solely rests  within the Food and Drug Administration today.   This provision was not the subject of hearing and debate, did not  receive the congressional oversight it should have, and I believe  decisions of such consequence should go through regular order,  providing Members and stakeholders with the opportunity to learn fully  of the risks and benefits associated with transferring regulatory  oversight of medical products to an agency that is not equipped with  the expertise and medical product knowledge of the FDA.   While I am not pleased with the process and how it has unfolded, I do  support H.R. 4374 because I believe it will maintain emergency use  authority with the agency that has the resources and scientific  expertise needed to make decisions about access to unproven medical  products. It is solely the FDA that has been charged with weighing the  risks and benefits of medical products and making determinations as to  their safety and effectiveness, and this legislation maintains the  FDA's important role in that process.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4374 not only addresses the Department of Defense's  concerns about access to medical products in instances of military  emergencies, but it also goes further by providing them with additional  support, in this instance, to expedite the development and review of  medical products that are of priority to the Department. It also  commits FDA to regularly meeting with the Department of Defense to  discuss their priorities and product pipelines.   So I just want to thank FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, Chairman Walden,  Senate Health Committee Chairman Alexander, and Ranking Member Murray  for working to find a compromise that will maintain proper regulatory  oversight over emergency uses of unproved medical products, while also  ensuring that our Nation's military has access to the products that  they need in a military emergency situation.   I do urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  legislation. I do think it is a good compromise dealing with these  military emergencies, but at the same time making sure that the FDA,  which has responsibility for approving medical products, still retains  its authority.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4374.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
