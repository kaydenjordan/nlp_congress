 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for H.R. 3441, the  Save Local Business Act.   I spent my career in business, so I know how damaging uncertainty is  for businesses. Job creators need a clear understanding of the rules;  otherwise, businesses and employees suffer and our economy suffers.   In yet another incident of unelected bureaucrats overreaching their  authority, the NLRB redefined the rule defining joint employers which  had been in place for 30 years. Unfortunately, I was not surprised.   The NLRB created a maze of uncertainty. Basic business decisions  managed between employers and employees are now put into turmoil by the  NLRB redefining what an employer is.   The Save Local Business Act would roll back a convoluted joint  employer scheme, restore a commonsense definition of employer, and  protect workers and local employees who are most likely to be impacted  by yet another confusing Federal rule.   I urge support of the bill.
