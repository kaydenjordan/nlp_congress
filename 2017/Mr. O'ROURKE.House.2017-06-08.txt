 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 111th anniversary of the  Antiquities Act. Over more than a century, Presidents of both parties  have preserved and opened to the public over 157 monuments, like the  Grand Canyon by President Theodore Roosevelt, or Zion in Utah by  President William Howard Taft, or the Pacific National Monument in  Hawaii by President George W. Bush. It is also connected to our economy  and jobs, with 7 million jobs in the United States connected to outdoor  recreation in our national monuments.   While this administration is reviewing certain monuments, we need to  protect the ones that we already have, like Organ Mountains National  Monument in New Mexico, or Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.   We also need to think about expanding national monuments where we  have heritage that we want to preserve, like Castner Range, that  preserves 10,000 years of human history and civilization in El Paso,  Texas, where the United States and Mexico meet.   Mr. Speaker, let's work together to strengthen the Antiquities Act  and not diminish its protections.                            ____________________
