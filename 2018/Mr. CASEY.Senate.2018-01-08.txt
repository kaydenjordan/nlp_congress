 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about another matter that  will be before us in the days ahead. It should not be before us as it  should have been done many months ago. In fact, if you want to count it  by days, it should have been done about 100 days ago, as we have heard.  That is the Children's Health Insurance Program, known by the acronym  CHIP.   Most Americans know what the CHIP program is. It is a program that  became Federal law a little more than 20 years ago in order to provide  an opportunity for healthcare for those families whose incomes were a  little bit too high, maybe, to have their children enrolled in Medicaid  but those families did not have their children's healthcare paid for by  their employers. You had a lot of families--a lot of middle-income  families or families near middle income--who were caught in between and  didn't have opportunities for healthcare. So CHIP was passed. For the  most part, it was bipartisan. All of these years now--decades later--it  remains bipartisan, but it is not reauthorized. Probably, the only two  numbers I will get into tonight are 9 and 180. What do I mean by that?  I will start with Pennsylvania.   So ``180'' means 180,000. That is the number of children, roughly,  who were enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program as of  December of 2017. If you look at it over the course of a year--of  children becoming eligible and then maybe moving off of CHIP to some  other insurance or having other changes--in Pennsylvania, roughly, in  the last year, 340,000 children benefited, at one time or another, but  the monthly number was 180,000 children just in  [[Page S64]]  Pennsylvania, and ``9'' was representative of the 9 million children  across the country who were enrolled in CHIP. When we have all of these  debates about what has to get done in the next couple of days and  between now and the middle part of January, I hope that 9 million  number will be uppermost in people's minds. Included within that are  180,000 children in Pennsylvania.   This is really not about a number or a program. It is about real  people, real people's lives. Every Member of the Senate has a  constituent he could tell a story about or hundreds, if not thousands,  of stories. I will just tell one tonight about a mom whom I met not too  long ago, just about a week ago, Jennie Sheeks. Jennie is from Upper  Makefield, PA. That is Bucks County, Southeastern Pennsylvania, just  north of the city of Philadelphia.   Jennie told us about her son Kam-au. Kam-au is 8 years old, and he is  enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. His brother and  his sister have special needs and are Medicaid beneficiaries. So, in  one family, you have an example of one child, thankfully, benefiting  from the CHIP program and then two other members of that same family  benefiting either from CHIP or the Medicaid Program. Thank goodness  those programs are in place. Without CHIP and Medicaid, Jennie said her  children would be uninsured because, even though both Jennie and her  husband work full time, covering the whole family on her plan is too  expensive.   This is another example of working families who depend upon these  programs for their children. They need these programs. These programs  aren't theoretical. They aren't some far-off Washington debate about  timing and leverage and negotiations and back-and-forth. This is about  their real lives right now. As I said, the CHIP program should have  been reauthorized 100 days ago, and it is inexcusable that it is not  being done now.   We all left here right after the tax vote. Everybody went back to his  home State and, I am sure, had a great holiday season. Unfortunately,  even though there was a little bit of a patch--a tiny, little patch  made for this program--a lot of people left here with no worries at all  and went back to their States and communities and neighborhoods, where  there were a lot of other people worrying about whether they were going  to get the kind of coverage for their children they should have a right  to expect.   Back to Jennie and her son. What are they going to do without the  Children's Health Insurance Program? I cannot imagine--and few Senators  or House Members can imagine--how Jennie and her son will get from here  to there without having the Children's Health Insurance Program. I  cannot imagine what it must be like for Jennie to worry about how she  will pay for her son's care if he loses CHIP coverage. No parent should  have that kind of stress in his life when there is an existing program  that covers 9 million kids that should be reauthorized.   When he was a public official, my father used to talk about people  who had led lives of real struggle. We have all known them in our  lives--people who have to work every day just to make ends meet in  order to provide for their families and get through another day,  another week, another month, another pay period. He used to refer to  those Americans as leading ``quietly triumphant lives.'' My father's  words for those who struggle--``quietly triumphant lives.''   There are a lot of families out there who lead very difficult lives,  and they depend sometimes on the Children's Health Insurance Program or  Medicaid or some other program just to get through another week, and I  think about Jennie and parents like her who have to overcome so much to  help their children--to love them, to care for them, to protect them,  and to educate them. Even the most loving, caring, hard-working, and  dedicated parent cannot provide the protections and the care health  insurance coverage and quality healthcare can provide, the kind of  quality healthcare from professionals that comes to that child because  he or she has the protection of health insurance. Those parents--no  matter how much they work, no matter how good they are to their  children--sometimes cannot provide something as basic, obviously, as  healthcare and, of course, the insurance coverage that makes it  possible.   We have legislation ready today, the KIDS Act, that is bipartisan. It  has already moved through the Finance Committee unanimously. I don't  think there was a single vote against it. If there was, it was not that  loud a vote. I hope we can make these children a priority in the coming  days, finally, at long last.   There were a lot of deals made in the tax bill, a lot of numbers  moved around to get the tax bill done. I understand that is part of any  legislation, but if a tax bill can get done in the U.S. Senate, we can  certainly have a vote to get the Children's Health Insurance Program  reauthorized now that it is 100 days old.   I see the distinguished majority leader is here so I will wrap up  tonight with the words of Jennie's son Kam-au:         I was happy when I got health insurance because I knew I       could go to the doctor if I got hurt or sick. When I didn't       have health insurance, I was a little worried . . . I think       we should keep CHIP going so we can stay healthy.    No better words were uttered or spoken about the Children's Health  Insurance Program than Kam-au's, an 8-year-old, who said CHIP should  stay in place so we can stay healthy.   I agree. The American people agree. Let's get CHIP done.   I yield the floor.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15  p.m. tomorrow, all postcloture time on the Campbell nomination be  considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Campbell  nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
