 Mr. President, due to a family medical emergency,  I was unable to attend today's vote on confirmation of Executive  Calendar No. 119, Lina M. Khan, to be a Federal Trade Commissioner. Had  I been able to attend, I would have voted yea on confirmation.                            ____________________
