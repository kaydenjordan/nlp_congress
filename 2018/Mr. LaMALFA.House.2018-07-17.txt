 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment today simply aims to increase  funding to help combat illegal marijuana grow operations in our  Nation's national forests. Illegal marijuana grows pose a significant  threat to public safety as well as the environment.   According to the DEA, the majority of illegal marijuana production  that occurs in Federal land is carried out by Mexican drug cartels.  These cartels smuggle deadly weapons, illegal pesticides, and other  dangerous materials across the border to grow illegal substances on our  public lands.   Siskiyou County, in my district in northern California, has actually  declared a state of emergency over the damage illegal marijuana  production has caused to neighboring communities, the surrounding  environment--again, damage much beyond what anybody would ever accuse  legal industries of, farming, timber, whatever--and they are using,  again, banned chemicals in the process, damaging wildlife, the  environment, water supply, across the board.   While the majority of illegal grow activity occurs within  California's borders, States across the country are also affected. Drug  trafficking organizations are operating on 72 national forests in 21  States throughout the country.   Our agencies need the funding and tools to take proactive steps to  push back against this growing, large threat. According to the Forest  Service, it would cost over $100 million over 5 years to reduce the  spread of this problem in California alone.   My amendment would increase funding to the National Forest System  account by $4.5 million. Indeed, that is barely scratching the surface  of what is truly needed, but it is a good start, and then we can  fashion a pilot to show the good we can do over time.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate my colleague's position  there, but we are talking about, again, what the Forest Service says  themselves is a $100 million problem over 5 years, or $20 million per  year. This would seek to boost that.   If you saw the emergency situation, again, in areas like my district  and adjacent, you would probably agree this  [[Page H6455]]  $4.5 million boost would be very important in order to get a good start  at that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the conversation here,  but when you look at the depth and the danger of what is being brought  into our States and my own part of northern California, my colleague in  the Cleveland National Forest, this is an acute problem. The  environmental damage is unspeakable with the amount of chemicals, the  damage to the wildlife, and the threat this poses to people out there  innocently hiking camping, utilizing the forest or maybe for even  logging operations.    So we need to kick-start this as strongly as possible, and that is  why I offer this amendment tonight in order to counter and send a  message that we are taking this seriously where Federal employees,  Federal agents have feared to tread in recent years because of this  tremendous threat that the Mexican nationals and gang activity has  caused in our national forests that belong to the people.   So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this. It is an important  start and weaves into so much with human trafficking, environmental  destruction, and even, in some cases, murder associated with the  problems of the growth of this product in our national forests.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this  amendment.   My colleague today has labeled this language a loophole in the bill,  which is false. A loophole is used to get around a law. The language he  wants to strike requires EPA and Army Corps to follow the law.   I ask once again my colleague, a friend of mine and a nice guy, to  come visit us in northern California and meet with the farmers and  ranchers who have seen firsthand this misuse and abuse of the Clean  Water Act and to gain an understanding why this language is necessary.  It is not theoretical. This is regulatory overreach at its worst going  on right now.   The recapture provision of the Clean Water Act was never meant to  swallow the original intent of the agricultural exemptions clearly laid  out in the act, but that is exactly what has been happening. If this  amendment passes, it would only get worse.   It was never the intention of the Clean Water Act to punish farmers  for conducting normal farming practices, normal operations, such as  plowing or doing stock pond maintenance, indeed, continuing what it is  they have always done.   There is a difference between filling a river and a difference  between plowing the corner of a field. These exemptions were  constructed to address that difference.   The ongoing expansion of enforcement, indeed, the reinterpretation of  clear exemption, is not what has been going on for 40 years as  asserted, but only in recent years under the previous administration  have they reinterpreted these laws; otherwise, you wouldn't have these  farmers and others in such a fuss over what they have done for many  decades.   The ongoing expansion of enforcement of the Clean Water Act has  chipped away at the rights of landowners and has made it a danger to  farmers to effectively utilize their own property--key word, ``own.''  This isn't somebody else's wetlands. This isn't someone else's habitat.  This is land that belongs to farmers who have been practicing farming  in the way they see fit for many years before this reinterpretation.   It is really ridiculous that a farmer must worry about being slapped  with a fine in the millions of dollars just for plowing on their own  land or a decision to rest that land, let it lie fallow, or wait for  improved market conditions.   In my district, there have been lawsuits against residents for  farming without Federal permission. Cases like these across the country  have cost farmers millions of dollars--yes, millions of dollars--in  legal damages, and they risk running farmers out of business. I don't  know of many farmers who can absorb million-dollar fines very many  times and continue doing what they are doing.    If this amendment is not defeated, these damages to farm communities  will only grow. America's farmers and ranchers deserve our support.  They deserve to be able to make decisions about managing their land,  managing their crops, have crop rotations that make sense to them for  market conditions, or just allowing the land to rest without having to  seek an onerous permit if they let their land rest for a couple years,  this without more regulatory ambiguity and red tape.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, indeed, I appreciate my colleague's comments  and thoughts on this.   We are not talking about conversion to suburbia. We are talking about  a reinstitution of a crop that may have been lying fallow for a few  years or changing from a crop such as a hay crop to wheat.   Indeed, one of my growers up north got in big trouble because they  wanted to put in a wheat crop on their own land, which isn't wetlands  unless we want to start reinterpreting that way by EPA working with  their henchmen in the Army Corps, basically out of the Sacramento  office, to keep coming after him and finding more and more people. This  puts more wind in their sails to come after people who are making an  honest living, not trying to develop houses or suburbia.   Indeed, I would agree with the gentleman on that. And that is going  to require a fairly difficult permit process, especially in my home  State of California, if you want to start turning this ag land into  suburbia. It is not what we are after.   There was a farm bill some years ago called the Freedom to Farm. What  has happened to that? What has happened to that concept?   With clear exemptions in the Clean Water Act for normal farming  practices, not new interpretations that have been put in place in the  previous administration we are still trying to unwind and get their  attention on, that is why this amendment would be damaging towards that  effort.   It is not a fight over clean water; it is a fight over Federal  control. They never intended for this.   It is unfortunate I have to even be here today to defend simply  requiring the bureaucrats to follow the law and the clear exemptions  that were put in place under the Clean Water Act.   Activities of the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers go above the law to  impose these requirements, again, significantly expanding the  jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, which clearly exceeds  congressional intent when they passed the Clean Water Act 40-plus years  ago.   Mr. Chair, again, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for an  agency that works extremely hard to keep our country safe, and that is  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.   While some on the other side of the aisle have called for ICE to be  abolished--yes, that is not a joke, and indeed, have proposed a bill  that they are now running away from, they failed to put their money  where their mouth is on the issue when their bluff was called.   ICE is, in fact, one of the most important components of our  country's interior law enforcement. Without them, even the most modest  level of border security would be difficult. In 2017 alone, the numbers  are staggering: 226,119 illegal aliens removed; 32,598 Homeland  Security criminal arrests; 4,818 gang arrests, including 796 MS-13  members; and 2,370 pounds of the very dangerous fentanyl drugs seized,  which only a small amount is very dangerous to thousands of people.   The statistics should speak for themselves. ICE is critical for our  country and its law enforcement. We should be doing everything we can  to support them instead of threatening and abolishing an agency that  works around the clock to protect our borders and our interior from  these great threats. We should appreciate this branch of law  enforcement, not try and run it out of town.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 35 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 18, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
