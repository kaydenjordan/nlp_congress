 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose House  Republicans' extreme attempt to roll back President Biden's one-time  emergency student debt relief initiative.   This bill would undoubtedly jeopardize the financial well-being of  millions of Americans. This bill is cruel and would rescind life- changing debt relief of up to $20,000. Ninety percent of Americans who  are eligible to receive this relief earn less than $75,000 per year.   The bill would also repeal the student loan payment pause and force  borrowers to unexpectedly confront months of accumulated payments and  interests. Forty-three million borrowers have benefited from the pause  and saved on average $150 per month in  [[Page H2533]]  interest. At a time when tuition continues to rise exponentially,  countless students and graduates are being crushed by tens of thousands  of dollars in student loan debt.   President Biden's cancellation would be transformative for millions  of Americans who sought to build intergenerational wealth and improve  their economic circumstances through education. While House Republicans  try to make it harder for young Americans to survive, my Democratic  colleagues and I will continue to fight for much provided relief.                            ____________________
