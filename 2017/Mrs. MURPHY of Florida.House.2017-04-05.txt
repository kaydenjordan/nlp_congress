 Mr. Speaker, on February 1, I introduced  legislation to prohibit individuals whose primary role is political,  like Steve Bannon, from serving on the National Security Council or its  main subgroup, the Principals Committee. The bill has obtained 183  cosponsors and received significant public support. The majority of the  American people clearly believe that our national security policymaking  process should not be contaminated by partisan politics.   Today, the Trump administration responded to this message, removing  Mr. Bannon from the NSC and the Principals Committee. I am incredibly  proud of this development, which is clearly in the interest of our  Nation's security.   Today is a victory for democracy because it proves that the people,  when they speak up and speak out, can change policy for the better.                            ____________________
