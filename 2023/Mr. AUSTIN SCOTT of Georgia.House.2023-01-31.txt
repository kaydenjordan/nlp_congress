 Madam Speaker, I rise today because our  veterans deserve access to care at every corner of the country as they  have selflessly defended this country.   After Express Scripts, who manages the TRICARE benefit on behalf of  the DOD, instituted network changes that cut out thousands of community  pharmacies last year, my office received dozens of calls from veterans  who are unable to access their prescriptions.   Our local pharmacies have the drugs these veterans need now, but  unless there are changes from the DOD that provide access that is  actually adequate, our veterans cannot access the medications they need  from community pharmacies.   While the DOD drags their feet, veterans are being refused lifesaving  medicines and offered unacceptable alternatives to the care they used  to be able to receive.   Mr. Kimsey, a veteran from Warner Robins, Georgia, is one of the many  patients in my district who this new rule affected. Mr. Kimsey is a  cancer patient at Central Georgia Cancer Care and is taking a chemo  drug. He has been on this medication for about a year and was told that  TRICARE would no longer pay for the medication at the local pharmacy.  He called my office after trying to fill his prescriptions and only had  five pills left of this critical drug.   The new DOD-approved pharmacy said they could mail the drug to him in  10 days, but he couldn't wait 10 days. This is just one example of why  community pharmacists are so vital to patients, especially in rural  areas.                            ____________________
