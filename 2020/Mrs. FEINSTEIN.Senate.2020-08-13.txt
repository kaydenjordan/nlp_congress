 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Snow  Water Supply Forecasting Program Authorization Act, which I introduced  today with Senator Harris. Representatives Josh Harder, John Garamendi,  Jerry McNerney, Grace Napolitano, T.J. Cox, and Ami Bera--all Democrats  from California--and Diana DeGette and Joe Neguse--both Democrats from  Colorado--have introduced identical companion legislation in the House.   Airborne snow observatory, ASO, technology is a snow monitoring tool  that provides precise measurement of depth and water content for every  square meter of snow in a watershed. The technology measures snow depth  and water content using an airplane-mounted light detection, LiDAR,  instrument coupled with an imaging spectrometer.   When combined with conventional snow surveys, ASO provides a near- perfect picture of snow water content.   By near perfect, I mean that ASO estimates snowpack and runoff  forecast with 96 to 99 percent accuracy. This is much better than  current practices, which only measure snowpack and runoff with 50 to 90  percent accuracy.   These forecast accuracies are achieved by comparing LiDAR  measurements of bare ground topography in the summer with multiple  measurements of snow depth during the winter. The greatest accuracies  are based on once-a-month flights in watersheds earlier in the winter,  and twice monthly flights during the spring runoff period.   The much more precise measurements of snowpack that ASO provides will  be critical in better managing competing missions of western water  storage reservoirs for flood control and water supply amidst a changing  climate and growing population.   For example, in a single year, 2018, Turlock Irrigation District used  this technology in the Tuolumne River watershed to save 150,000 acre- feet of water supply.   Because they knew precisely how much snow was in the upper watershed  of the Tuolumne, Turlock was able to avoid a release of 150,000 acre- feet of water from Don Pedro Reservoir that otherwise would have been  required for flood control.   Without ASO technology, Turlock would have had to assume for safety  purposes that the melting snow in the upper Tuolumne watershed was at  the high end of a wide range of guesstimates using conventional  snowpack technology. With the possibility of a big snowmelt, Turlock  would have had to release the extra 150,000 acre feet of water.   With water in California often costing $1000 per acre foot or more,  errors in water-storage management can cost hundreds of millions of  dollars in unnecessary releases from reservoirs and extra groundwater  pumping.   Additional ASO flights to better measure snowpack often have a high  return on investment, by one estimate as much as 40:1 for water supply  benefits, and 80:1 for all benefits, including hydro, recharge, flood  control, and ecosystem benefits.   After several years developing and refining the deployment of  snowpack measurement technology, in December 2019, NASA concluded  management of the-ASO program and transferred it to the private sector.  While consistent with NASA's traditional approach to developing new  technologies, this transfer reduces the certainty for Federal support  of a program with significant public benefits, including improved water  conservation, supply and delivery forecasts across the West.   The bill establishes a snow pack forecasting program at the Bureau of  Reclamation within the Department of the Interior.   The Bureau shall implement the program in two phases:   No. 1, the first step is to coordinate with other Federal agencies on  how they will work together to improve analyses of snowpack depth. This  interagency process will result in a report due to Congress by October  21, 2021.   No. 2, following the completion of the report, the Bureau will cost- share with States, water districts, other Federal agencies and other  partners on increased LiDAR flights and other activities in particular  watersheds.   This program is expected to benefit many Western States, including  but not limited to Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains; the Front Range  of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico; and the  Colorado River tributaries in Utah and Arizona, and the Pacific  Northwest.   Fifteen million dollars would be authorized for the program from  fiscal years 2022 to 2026.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                            ____________________
