 Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman Dwight Evans  for, once again, hosting this very important Special Order and for  really continuing this fight for racial and economic justice both here  in the House of Representatives but also in his congressional district.  So I thank the gentleman very much for his tremendous leadership.   Fifty years ago at the height of the civil rights movement, violence  erupted in cities across America. Over generations, systemic racism had  produced what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called a tale of two cities.  One city was bright and full of opportunity for a select few, and  another city was shrouded in darkness and locked in a never-ending  cycle of poverty.   African Americans, suffocating under the pressure of institutional  racism and discrimination, took to the streets.   After race riots erupted in Watts and Chicago; Newark, New Jersey;  and Detroit, our government took notice. President Johnson convened the  Kerner Commission, which Congressman Evans laid out, which had three  goals to investigate the root cause of the unrest.   Many activists and civil rights leaders were concerned that the  Commission wouldn't reveal the true facts. But to our surprise--and I  remember this very clearly--the report was brutally honest.   According to the report, White racism was responsible for the rising  tensions and explosive violence ripping our Nation apart. So that  should have been a wake-up call.  [[Page H1364]]                                     time  2030    Racism had created two societies: one Black, one White, separate and  unequal. The report identified the problem and proposed a series of  targeted solutions that could right this terrible wrong.   According to the report, there were three options for our government:   One, do nothing, which would result in more riots and economic  devastation and racial division in our country;   Two, we could make robust investments into African-American  neighborhoods and schools;   Three, take racism and discrimination head-on, removing  discriminatory barriers that lock African Americans into poverty and  prevent them from accessing the basics and a basic standard of living.   Option three, of course, could have drastically changed the lives of  millions of African Americans. Sadly, the Kerner Commission's report  was largely ignored. Again, Congressman Evans laid that out.   Instead of investing in education, employment opportunities, livable  wages, raising incomes, and pathways out of poverty, this country,  unfortunately, has allowed institutional racism to divide this Nation.  Of course, we have made some progress, but this updated report clearly  shows that is not nearly enough. We really are still a divided country.  As a result, the findings of the 1968 Kerner Commission's report remain  constant to this very day.   In 1968, almost half of all students of color, primarily African  Americans, went to majority-White schools. Today, that number has  plummeted to 20 percent.   In 1968, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.7 percent.  Today, 7.5 percent of African Americans are unemployed.   In 1968, African Americans were 5.4 times as likely as Whites to be  in prison or in jail. Today, African Americans are 6.4 times as likely  as Whites to be incarcerated.   Five decades have passed and economic inequality still prevents the  African-American community from accessing the American Dream.   I represent the 13th Congressional District of California, which  includes Alameda County. While some are witnessing and experiencing  enormous wealth and economic growth in my district, 43 percent of  African-American children in Oakland are living in poverty, 23.6  percent of African Americans in my district are locked in poverty, and  the average income for African-American families in the San Francisco  Bay Area is $46,571 a year, compared to White families, who make more  than $109,000. That is in my district in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This gap is one of the hugest gaps in the country. It is a total  disgrace.   We should be leveling the economic playing field for African  Americans across the Nation. Instead, we throw Black workers meager  wages and apply trickle-down economics that only benefit the rich.   Our Federal Government should provide the impetus, incentive, and  investment for good-paying jobs for African-American workers. Instead,  this administration is attacking unions and produced a budget that guts  job training programs and a tax law that makes it easier to ship jobs  overseas.   We should be investing in affordable housing, which, yes, is a basic  human right for everyone, including the African-American community.  Instead, this administration is weakening fair housing laws and  rationing off affordable housing funding.   The majority of this administration's proposed budget--the cuts,  especially--will disproportionately negatively impact African Americans  and people of color. This really is a twisted and sick reality that  shouldn't be possible in the United States of America.   But members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here tonight to say  that we continue to be determined to change this reality because, yes,  Black lives do matter. We are here to tell the truth about what is  dividing America: racism. It is manifest in many forms in our policy,  in our budget, in our funding priorities, and in many, many ways.   In January, a group of nearly 100 religious leaders came together to  issue a unity declaration on racism and poverty. Mr. Speaker, I include  in the record a letter, a document, entitled, ``Unity Declaration on  Racism and Poverty,'' and a document entitled, ``Circle of  Protection.''                  Unity Declaration on Racism and Poverty         As leaders from diverse families of U.S. Christianity, we       are called by the Spirit to work together with new urgency       against the resurgence of racism and the persistence of       poverty in America. We see around us an increase of harmful       attitudes and policies toward people of color and people in       need. That painful reality and the current push for trillions       of dollars in cuts to anti-poverty programs are bringing us       together in a new way. While we have different positions on       other questions, we are united on the gospel and biblical       teaching on poverty and racism--feeling invited to do so by       the grace of God in Jesus Christ.          We believe that racism and poverty are theological issues         The integral relationship between poverty and racism       unifies us against both. They are both issues to which the       gospel of Jesus Christ speaks--which also calls us to love       our neighbors, without exceptions. Our unity on these issues       is because they are theological issues for us, not merely       political or partisan ones. These fundamentally biblical       concerns challenge all of us and both of the major political       parties.        Racism is a sin that goes back to the founding of our       nation. At its root, racism is in conflict with the opening       declaration in Genesis 1, that we are all made in the image       and likeness of God. Racism literally throws away the       biblical principle of imago dei--the image of God in all of       us, with no exceptions. Racism is a sin against God and all       of God's children. Therefore, the whole counsel of God calls       us to preach against the sin of racism from all of our       churches' pulpits and call for repentance.        The body of Christ is perhaps the most diverse racial       community in the world. When people of color in the body of       Christ suffer--while many white members of the body of Christ       do not acknowledge their pain--we are violating the principle       laid down in 1 Corinthians 12: that we are one body with many       parts, who suffer with and honor one another. As Galatians       instructs us, ``there is no more Jew or Greek, bond or free,       male or female, because we are all united as one in Christ''       (3:28).        The historical sin of racism lingers on in America today,       continuing and evolving in our social systems of economics       and education, policing and criminal justice, housing and       gentrification, voting rights and suppression, in our racial       geography, and, painfully, in the continued segregation of       our churches, which adds to our own complicity. Racism is       more than individual behavior, language, and overt hostility       toward particular people. Racism is systematic and structural       in America and harms people of color in very specific,       measurable, and tangible ways.        The failure to defend the lives and dignity of people       living in poverty, by individuals or governments, is also a       sin against God, with 2,000 verses in the Bible clearly       outlining God's fundamental concern for people who are poor,       vulnerable, and oppressed, instructing the people of God to       protect and help them and holding political leaders       responsible for them. Jesus says, in Matthew 25, that how we       treat the ``least of these'' is how we treat Christ himself.        The world and our country have made progress against       poverty in recent decades. It is possible to make further       progress--perhaps virtually end--hunger and extreme poverty       in our time. We see the alleviation of material misery as an       experience of God's loving presence in our own time, and       believe that God wants us to seize this opportunity.                To our churches: What we are doing and can do         Most of our churches are active in helping people in need,       struggling people within their congregations or in their       communities. We need to do more, but many of our churches       directly help millions of people every day. Local church       leaders often work to bridge the racial divides in our       communities, and many are searching for authentic and       specific ways to address the rise of white supremacy.        Since the God of the Bible requires social justice and       charity, our churches and many of our members also work to       influence public policies. Christians have a wide array of       political viewpoints. But a majority of the leaders of       national church bodies have spoken out repeatedly against       cuts to programs that provide help and opportunity to hungry       and poor people in our country and around the world. We have       also spoken out against renewed expressions of white racism,       ethnic nationalism, and hateful attitudes toward people of       color, immigrants, refugees, Jews, and Muslims. Many of us       are active in support of immigration reform, criminal justice       reform, and voting rights for all.        We are deeply troubled by the budget proposals coming from       Congress and the president. They outline more than $2       trillion of cuts in programs for hungry and poor people in       our country and around the world. These cuts would hurt       struggling people of all races, including millions of low-       and middle-income people who need safety-net programs at some       time in their lives. The hardest hit would be African       American, Latino, and Native American communities, where the       poverty rate is already high, and among people in the poorest       countries in the world.        The threat over the coming year of this broad assault on       anti-poverty programs that  [[Page H1365]]       support families struggling to make ends meet is unifying       us--bringing us together in a more vigorous, multiracial       Christian movement to maintain a circle of protection around       all people in poverty and God's children of color in       particular, who are disproportionally impacted.     To Congress and the White House: Our united appeal for healing and                      reform in our nation's politics         We appeal to the president and Congress to work together       for the common good. We especially call upon political       leaders who are also people of faith to protect all the       people in our country and world who are struggling with       economic deprivation and frustration, hunger and poverty,       disability and disadvantage--and racial bigotry that often       contributes to inaction and hard-heartedness.        God's love for all people moves us to reach out to people       and leaders all across the political spectrum. We respect and       pray for all those who are in authority--that our nation and       world ``may lead a quiet and peaceable life'' (1 Timothy 2:1-      2). Conservative and liberal people, and those with differing       political philosophies, may disagree on how to live up to our       nation's ideals, but our loving God calls all of us to work       together for liberty and justice for everyone.        We appeal to all people, especially Christians, to actively       work against racism and poverty--in their personal and local       engagement and as advocates for public policies that foster       racial equity and healing, shared prosperity, and peace in       our country and worldwide. The spiritual power of a fresh,       energetic, multiracial Christian movement against both racism       and poverty is our prayer. So help us God.

As Christians, we are grounded in God's love for all people,       and we feel called to ask our churches and political leaders       of both parties to work together to overcome racism and       poverty which are theological, biblical, and gospel issues       for us, not merely political or partisan ones.        This moment in time and the clear movement of the Spirit       have brought diverse multi-racial church leaders together       over the last several months for dinner conversations and       times of prayer. Out of those moving times together, we       developed a Unity Statement on Racism and Poverty. It has       attracted many more racially and theologically diverse church       leaders and is now  [[Page H1366]]       embraced by the Circle of Protection, the broadest group of       Christian leaders focused on poverty. The leaders who have       signed this statement are from African-American, Hispanic,       Asian-American, Native American, Evangelical, Catholic,       Pentecostal, and mainline Protestant churches; and many       national faith-based organizations. We are all committed to       help build a fresh, newly energetic, multi-racial Christian       movement to make the integral connection between racism and       poverty and seek the spiritual power to end both. We are also       committed to working in alliance with other faith communities       on the crucial intersection of racism and poverty as it is       worked out in public policies. While the Circle of Protection       is a Christian group, we believe this statement reflects the       values and principles of people of diverse faiths.        We are purposefully sending you this statement before you       go to your respective retreats. In addition to reading this       statement thoughtfully, we ask for the following three       things: first, we ask you to discuss this statement and the       issues central to it--racism and poverty--at your retreats;       second, we ask you to incorporate these concerns into your       policy decisions and legislation in 2018 and beyond; third,       we ask you to convene meetings with faith leaders in your       communities to plan follow-up action on these issues in your       states and districts. Racism and poverty are systemic issues       that are central to the Bible and the teachings of Jesus.       Therefore, they are critical to policy choices made by       political leaders of faith and conscience. We will be       following up with you directly to see how we can be helpful       and useful to you as you consider these deeply biblical and       theological issues.        We believe if we Christians from diverse backgrounds and       traditions were known, not mostly for our divisions, but for       our unity in a shared commitment to faithfully address both       racism and poverty--together--it could be powerful force--      both for our churches and the country. So help us God.      Rev. Jim Wallis,        President and Founder, Sojourners;      Dr. Barbara Williams-Skinner,        Co-Convener, National African-American Clergy Network and       President, Skinner Leadership Institute;      Rev. David Beckmann,        President, Bread for the World;      Rev. Carlos Malave,        Executive Director, Christian Churches Together USA (in his       personal capacity).     Mr. Speaker, I want to share a passage from the unity  statement that was developed. This was an ecumenical group of over 100  religious denominations: ``Racism is more than individual behavior,  language, and overt hostility toward particular people. Racism is  systematic and structural in America and harms people of color in very  specific, measurable, and tangible ways.''   Mr. Speaker, the Kerner report, unfortunately, was ignored, and 50  years later, we are still feeling and reaping the consequences. The  difficult truth is that, until we address the impact of the middle  passage and slavery of generations of African Americans and believe  that truth and reconciliation must happen, 50 years from now, two  cities will have destroyed the very fabric of our Nation.   As the unity declaration goes on to say: ``Racism is a sin that goes  back to the founding of our Nation.''   We know what is plaguing our society, and we know what to do about  it. The time for talk is over. It is time we do what is right for all  Americans. Yes, Black lives do matter.    Mr. Speaker, in many communities, housing was segregated. We  passed fair housing laws. Affordable housing now is out of reach for  many African Americans. This administration is now gutting all of our  fair housing programs, our public housing programs, our Section 8  programs.   The banks, of course, did target African-American communities for  these subprime scam loans. Unfortunately, any equity that had been  built in the homes that we purchased after 1968 is gone. So the wealth  gap is huge. It is greater than what it was probably in 1968.   When you look at the number of African Americans who were unemployed  in 1968, I believe it was a little over 5 percent. Now we are looking  at 7 percent.   When you look at the incarceration rates for the war on drugs, the  marijuana laws in this country, especially in the eighties and the  impacts of that, we have so many of our young African-American men  incarcerated for misdemeanor and felony charges for marijuana  distribution and use. We are looking at mass incarceration that has  taken place since 1968 of African-American young men and women.   So, yes, we have made a lot of progress. I stand here as the 100th  Black Member of Congress. Mr. Evans is here. We have a Congressional  Black Caucus that has increased in size. We have many, many allies in  our fight. But I think what we haven't addressed is the issue of racism  and institutional racism, because it is so subconscious for so many  people until many decisions are made which negatively impact the  African-American community.   So from 1968 to now, we have made some progress. We have some great  professionals, people doing wonderful things in our community. We have  great leaders. We have great scientists, lawyers, doctors, teachers,  firefighters, and workers. We have so many people who have been able to  lift themselves into the middle class, but we have left so many behind.   That is the point, I think, that, while this new report shows that  some of us have progressed, we didn't do what was necessary to bring  everyone along with us, to lift everyone out of poverty in the Black  community and provide for a level playing field for equality, for  parity, and for a pathway into the American Dream.   That is really very sad and very shameful, but I have a lot of hope  that our young people and that we here in the House and that the  country really begin to understand that we have to address the root  causes of what has happened in this country as it relates to the middle  passage and slavery, and to understand that what we see today in these  respects that cause these economic and racial disparities go right back  to the unfortunate, devastating, and horrific middle passage.    Mr. Speaker, several years ago, we established the Whip's  Task Force on Poverty, Inequality, and Opportunity. For so many years,  I wanted to see our caucus talk about more issues relating to low- income and working people and people of color. I really appreciate our  whip, Steny Hoyer, and our leader, Nancy Pelosi, for rallying around  this concept of looking around all these issues of poverty, inequality,  and opportunity.   We put together this task force to begin to look at the policies that  not only we need to support that are lifting people out of poverty, but  what we need to do to fight against some of the policies and funding  priorities that would lead more people into the ranks of the poor.   This task force now has over 100 people. We have meetings with  experts, with organizations that are doing wonderful work throughout  the country in communities of color and low-income communities and the  Black communities, really demonstrating that there are some grassroots  efforts and community efforts that, while here in Congress we haven't  been able to change many policies, at the grassroots levels and the  community level there are some wonderful people doing some great things  to help lift people out of poverty and into the middle class.   So we try to highlight and showcase those organizations and  individuals so that we can replicate them around the country, so that,  until we can get the policies right, we can support those efforts that  are taking place that are really doing a wonderful job.
