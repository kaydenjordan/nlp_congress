 Madam President, since the founding of our  Republic, the Senate has existed to encourage extended debate and  protect the rights of the minority party.   Over the centuries, as various political parties have risen and  fallen from power, the Senate's rules have been respected and followed.  One of those rules is the legislative filibuster, which protects the  minority party's rights by requiring a 60-vote threshold to pass  legislation in the Senate.   Unfortunately, many of today's Democrats in Washington only care  about one thing: radically transforming this Nation into a new  socialist state. And they will use any means necessary to keep their  grip on the Federal Government.   Now we are seeing Democrat leadership in the Congress wield their  historically narrow majority to push one partisan bill after another  without even attempting to get Republican input or support. Instead of  working together with their Republican colleagues, they are searching  for ways to make it easier to jam through progressive, socialist  policies without any compromise. Just look at the majority leader's  most recent statements on the filibuster.   Last week, the majority leader wrote a letter to all Democrat  Senators explaining his plans to fundamentally and permanently alter  the rules of the U.S. Senate and change the legislative filibuster. His  statements could not be more hypocritical or self-serving.   The legislative filibuster, which has been in place for decades, has  been repeatedly defended as a vital and necessary rule to protect the  minority party's rights, including by Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kamala  Harris, and even Senator Schumer.   In 2017, Senator Schumer urged then-Majority Leader McConnell to  ``find a way to build a firewall around the legislative filibuster,''  which is the most important distinction between the Senate and the  House.   He went on to say:         Without the 60-vote threshold for legislation, the Senate       becomes a majoritarian institution like the House, much more       subject to the winds of short-term electoral change. No       Senator would like to see that happen, so let's find a way to       further protect the 60-vote rule for legislation.    These are the direct quotes from the Senator from New York. He called  the filibuster the most important distinction between the Senate and  the House, and now he is turning his back on them.   Of course, my colleague from New York isn't the only one caught in a  bind here by previous statements and actions. Just remember that, in  2018, the current Senate majority whip, Senator Dick Durbin, said doing  away with the legislative filibuster ``would be the end of the Senate  as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding  Fathers.''   He further admitted: ``We have to acknowledge our respect for the  minority, and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition  and its procedure.''   Or remember in 2017, when 32 Democrats signed a bipartisan letter  urging Senate leadership to keep the sacred part of the Senate intact.  Most of those same Senators who defended minority party rights are  still in office today, but only one has expressed any opposition to  Senator Schumer's plans to destroy the filibuster, now that he is in  the majority.   And just last Congress, most of the Democrat caucus used a filibuster  to block a police reform bill from my Republican colleague Tim Scott  and a bill that would have protected newborn babies who survived  attempted abortions.   So my Democrat colleagues think the filibuster is great when it works  in their favor, but they can't stand it when it blocks their radical  socialist agenda, an agenda we know the American people do not support.   So why the change of mind? Why are they willing to be so blatantly  hypocritical and so obviously flip-flop? Because they know if they pull  this off and pass this radical, dangerous bill to federalize elections,  it will all but secure their power into the future. That is what we are  talking about here.   Democrats want to push through this bill that will completely upend  our current election system, and they are willing to abandon their  principles and flip-flop on the filibuster if it means permanently  maintaining power.   Senator Schumer admitted it earlier today on MSNBC. He said the quiet  part out loud and explained that Democrat Senators are saying things  like ``I'll lose my election'' or ``We'll lose our majority'' if they  don't change the filibuster to pass their election takeover bill.   Democrats say this is about ``voting rights.'' It isn't. The right to  vote is more readily accessible and easily exercised by eligible voters  across the country than ever before. This is really about federalizing  our elections and enacting policies that they think will give them an  advantage in future elections. And all along the way, they will revel  in their hypocrisy and self-righteously pretend that they are  ``protecting democracy.''   But make no mistake, a change to the filibuster won't protect  democracy. It will ruin it.   Democrats in this Chamber can posture all they want, but the American  people see them for what they really are: self-serving, power-hungry  politicians.   We all know that if the Democrats' bill was good, if it included  policies that would actually improve our Nation's elections, it would  pass. But there is nothing in the bill worth voting for. The Democrats'  bill is an assault on American elections. It will fuel voter fraud,  waste taxpayer dollars on political campaigns and attack ads, and make  it nearly impossible to conduct fair elections that our citizens can  trust.   We need an end to this self-serving hypocrisy, and we need Members  who will stand up for what is right. I am urging my Democratic  colleagues to see past their party's own partisan, short-term  interests, and I ask them to consider the health and future of our  democracy. That is what the American people deserve.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, yesterday marked 6 months  since July 11--a day when brave Cubans all across that island marched  for democracy, cried out for freedom, and sent a clear message that the  time was up for the illegitimate communist regime.   From Havana to Santa Clara to Santiago de Cuba, the message of  ``Patria y Vida!'' could be heard from the people. Cuban families and  demonstrators stood against the revolution's motto of ``Patria o  Muerte'' to once again declare that the revolution had failed.   That failed revolution promised prosperity and equality for all, but  the only equal thing about it was poverty, suffering, and oppression  for all. We watched as families gathered outside the headquarters of  the Cuban Communist Party to chant ``Cuba isn't yours!'' Their message  was clear: It is time for a new day of freedom and democracy in Cuba.   Instead of listening to the cries of their people, the communist  Cuban regime lashed out with violence and the oppression it has used  for more than 60 years to silence opposition to its reign. The regime  and its thugs kidnapped innocent democracy activists and kept others  trapped in their homes. Right now, hundreds of Cubans have been  indefinitely detained or unjustly sentenced to prison simply for  demanding basic human rights.   Some of these protesters are facing prison sentences as long as 30  years. One of them is Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of the pro- democracy UNPACU group and a dedicated freedom and human rights  activist. Since his detainment, I have had the chance to talk to his  family several times. Each time we speak, the stories they tell me are  more heartbreaking.   Jose Daniel is being tortured by the communist regime in an attempt  to end his life. He is suffering from severe headaches, mouth bleeding,  malnutrition, cough, and insomnia--all products of the cruel torture  and inhumane treatment from the regime.   We can also think about Felix Navarro, another longtime freedom  activist who helps lead a pro-democracy group on the island. He was  arrested, not for demonstrating but for asking police about the status  of some of the members of his group who had been detained.   Reports indicate even young teenagers are being detained  indefinitely.   The unjust imprisonment, beatings, and torture of the Cuban people is  abhorrent. It is inhumane, and it cannot be tolerated. It is clear that  these actions stem from the regime's paralyzing fear over the freedom  movement spreading across Cuba. They are terrified that there is a new  day of freedom on the rise for the Cuban people, so they resort to  total oppression and to the silencing of any mention of independence or  freedom.   As the greatest beacon of freedom and democracy in the world, the  United States must stand against the communist regime and with the  Cuban people. I am thankful that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State  Brian Nichols recently called for the immediate release of the July 11  demonstrators. Along with his calls, we need the voices of President  Biden and Secretary Blinken, and their calls need to be coupled with  action that actually pressures the illegitimate communist Cuban regime  now.   It was only a couple of weeks ago when I called the White House to  talk about the case of Jose Daniel Ferrer. The first time I called,  they asked me to leave a message, so I did. When I called the next day,  the White House hung up on me.   Throughout his entire first year in office, Joe Biden has been  shamefully silent about Cuba. Just like he does with communist China,  Biden's strategy on Cuba is to do the bare minimum. Even while the  protests were ongoing, he did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the  Cuban people.   Compare that to the Organization of American States. After I spoke  with them a few weeks ago, Secretary General Luis Almagro issued a  statement demanding the immediate release of all arbitrarily imprisoned  political prisoners. He expressed special concern for the well-being of  Jose Daniel Ferrer and urged the Cuban regime to allow a humanitarian  mission that can immediately verify the state and situation of  political prisoners in the country.   Why can't Joe Biden make that same request? Where is the President?  He has had 6 months to help provide internet to the Cuban people to  help disseminate information and help the freedom movement, but he has  done nothing. His silence is appeasement, and those of us who love  freedom will not simply sit by idly while he refuses to act.   As long as the illegitimate communist Cuban regime continues to deny  the people their freedom, democracy, and basic human rights, I am going  to fight alongside them and demand action.   Today, the Senate can do something. Today, the U.S. Senate can pass a  resolution honoring Cuban activists like Jose Daniel Ferrer, condemning  the Cuban dictatorship's repression, and calling for the international  community to stand with the Cuban people. I have introduced a  resolution that does exactly that, and it is something that everyone in  the Chamber should agree with.   I am thankful for Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Braun for  cosponsoring this resolution. I am also thankful for Mario Diaz-Balart,  Congresswoman Salazar, and Congressman Gimenez for introducing the  companion resolution in the House.   We must make sure our message to the Cuban people is clear: America  has not and will not forget you. We have seen your bravery and courage.  We have heard your calls for freedom. You have risked everything for  the freedom of Cubans across the island. You are an inspiration to us  all.   I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in Spanish.    Mr. President, I am glad to see this resolution  pass.   I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Braun,  for cosponsoring this resolution and Congressman Diaz-Balart,  Congresswoman Salazar, and Congressman Gimenez for supporting this  resolution in the House.   In my roles as a U.S. Senator and the Governor of Florida, I have had  the honor of meeting and speaking with countless Cubans who have risked  their lives to flee Castro's brutal regime. Many of them came here with  nothing, scarred by the oppression of the regime but hopeful for a new  life. With what little they had, they started businesses and families  and built thriving communities and are a major part of the economy of  Florida.   We have all seen their resolve to fight for freedom, support their  families, and contribute to their communities. They are an example of  the American dream and a testimony to the ills of communism and  socialism. The Cuban people are a source of inspiration for all of us.  They show us what can be accomplished when you have freedom and  opportunity.   That is why we continue to fight for the end of communism in Cuba and  for the freedom and liberties of every Cuban family. It is why we  should all join them and say ``Abajo la Dictadura!'' ``Patria, vida y  Libertad!''                            ____________________
