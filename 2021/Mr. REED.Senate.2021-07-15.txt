 Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Collins in  introducing the Green Retrofits Act of 2021, which seeks to boost  energy efficiency in multifamily residential homes across the Nation.   The legislation would accomplish this goal through two complimentary  paths. First, the bill would authorize a public-private partnership  program to make energy efficiency upgrades to properties currently  receiving assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD). Second, it would direct the Secretary of HUD to  create a program to distribute grants and loans for energy efficiency  and home health upgrades in multifamily homes.   One of the most important investments we can make for our environment  and our economy is in energy efficiency. Indeed, building a cleaner,  more efficient energy system will increase America's global  competitiveness, support job growth, and save families and businesses  money through reduced energy consumption--all while reducing our carbon  footprint. Further, investments in efficiency can be undertaken quickly  and provide immediate benefits.   According to the U.S. Energy Information Association, more than half  of energy consumption in U.S. households is for two basic needs:  heating and cooling. As our constituents in Maine and Rhode Island know  all too well, these bills can get quite high during New England  winters, and no one should be forced to choose between staying warm in  the winter and buying groceries and medicine for their families.  Improving the efficiency of building components such as heating,  cooling, and lighting systems will help households lower their energy  bills, reduce health and safety risks, and improve the quality of life  for residents.   Our legislation is supported nationally by the National Center for  Healthy Housing, and in my state by the Rhode Island Office of Energy  Resources and Rhode Island Housing. These state agencies have both made  significant strides in clean energy and energy efficiency policy and I  am glad this legislation will provide more resources to bolster those  efforts.   With our economy still recovering from the pandemic, and the threat  of climate change continuing to mount, it is more important than ever  that we take steps to reduce costs for American families and decrease  energy consumption.   I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 2362. A bill to require rulemaking by the Administrator of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency to address considerations in  evaluating the need for public and individual disaster assistance, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs.
