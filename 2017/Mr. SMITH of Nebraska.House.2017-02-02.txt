 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution to repeal a rule which would arbitrarily revoke the Second  Amendment rights of certain Social Security beneficiaries. The  inability to manage one's Social Security benefits does not correlate  with the capacity to judiciously use firearms.   By adding Social Security beneficiaries to the NICS list with no  judicial review and forcing them to go through an appeals process to be  removed, this rule would also violate the due process rights of these  Americans.   I would also like to focus on the component of this rule which would  inhibit the ability of Social Security disability beneficiaries to be  approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to  work with or around certain materials.   Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan agreement we should be investing in  and rebuilding our infrastructure. There is also bipartisan agreement  we should be empowering people receiving benefits, like disability  insurance, to return to work if they are able to do so.   However, this rule will create a new barrier for beneficiaries  seeking to return to work in industries like construction by forcing  them to navigate a complex appeals process before they can be  reemployed.   Let me say again, if we do nothing about this rule, it will prevent  law-  [[Page H900]]  abiding Americans who are able to do so from getting off the disability  rolls and returning to work.   We can work together on constructive ways to prevent those who would  do us harm from having access to firearms and explosives. This rule is  not the way to do so.   I urge support for the resolution.
