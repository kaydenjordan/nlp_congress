 Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates American  Heart Month, I want to highlight the groups and individuals working to  ensure that south Florida is filled with healthy hearts.   Organizations like the Ft. Lauderdale-Miami chapter of the American  Heart Association work tirelessly every day to raise awareness and  support patients, as well as caregivers. The members will be hosting  the Miami Heart and Stroke Ball to help fund lifesaving research and  prevention programs in our community.   I would also like to recognize the medical researchers, the doctors,  and the nurses at the Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute and so many  other medical centers that are working to pioneer innovative treatments  that save lives in south Florida every day.   This American Heart Month, let us unite as a community to promote  exercise, healthy eating habits, and frequent checkups to ensure that  south Florida is heart-healthy throughout the entire year.                            ____________________
