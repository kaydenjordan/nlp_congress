 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I  have spoken with constituents, business owners, and community leaders  over the last few weeks who are apprehensive about their health and  financial security.   As a practicing physician, I have spoken with numerous infectious  disease physicians, scientists, and epidemiologists about the present  COVID-19 threat.   While there are certain provisions in this bill that are not  necessary, I would rather not dwell on its imperfections, and I will  support it.   Instead, I would like to thank House and Senate Members, as well as  Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump, for negotiating a bipartisan  deal in a timely manner to provide relief to the American people.   The CARES Act provides desperately needed funding for those who need  it in this unprecedented time in this Nation's history.   Families, small businesses, churches, and community institutions  receive the funding that they need to stay viable while we continue to  fight the outbreak of COVID-19.   I urge employers to keep their employees employed and access the  benefits that this bill provides to keep them financially afloat.
