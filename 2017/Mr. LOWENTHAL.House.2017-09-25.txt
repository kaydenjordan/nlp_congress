 Madam Speaker, last week, people across the Nation and  around the world heard the heart-wrenching story of my constituent,  Helen Huynh.   Helen is bravely fighting leukemia. She desperately needs a stem cell  transplant, which requires a compatible match. Helen's sister, Thuy, is  a 100 percent match, but she lives in Vietnam. She has been denied a  visa to come to the United States for this potentially lifesaving  procedure. She has been denied now three times.  [[Page H7476]]    This is outrageous, and I am doing everything I can to make sure this  wrong is corrected. Mark my words: it will be corrected. I am working  with Helen's family, the State Department, and the Department of  Homeland Security to make sure that we are successful in bringing Thuy  to Helen as soon as possible.                            ____________________
