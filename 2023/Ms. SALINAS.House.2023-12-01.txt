 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our brave  servicemembers and their families.   America's veterans have sacrificed so much for our freedom, and for  that, I am deeply grateful, but words alone are not enough.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to honor the pledge we made to  military families and ensure that they get the benefits that they  deserve.   When my constituent, Shirley Thomas, suddenly stopped receiving her  VA benefits, she reached out to my office for help. In just 3 short  weeks, my team was able to restart Shirley's benefits and secure back  payments for the months that she missed.  [[Page H6068]]    I recently visited Shirley and reiterated my commitment to helping  military families like hers, because supporting our servicemembers  means supporting them long after they come home. It means providing  them with safe, affordable housing; expanding educational opportunities  to help veterans pursue their career goals; improving home care  services for elderly veterans; and so much more.   Today, and always, I will keep fighting to do just that.                            ____________________
