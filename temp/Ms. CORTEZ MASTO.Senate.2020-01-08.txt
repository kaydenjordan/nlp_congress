 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the career and service of Ms. Dana Bennett, who will soon  retire as president of the Nevada Mining Association. Ms. Bennett is  the first woman to lead the Nevada Mining Association, serving as the  State industry's educational and advocacy leader, as well as its chief  representative in national and international outreach. As we  commemorate her retirement, her countless contributions to the great  State of Nevada are worthy of recognition.   Ms. Bennett began her career of service to Nevada as a principal  research analyst with the Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau, LCB, where  she worked with both parties and committee staff in the State senate  and assembly for over 9 years. One of her more notable achievements  during her time at the LCB was identifying an error in the 1929 bill  that established the design of the Nevada State flag. Ms. Bennett's  sleuthing resulted in a design change to the Nevada State flag,  ensuring that it fully complied with the law and producing the flag  that we still proudly fly today.   In 1998, Ms. Bennett left the LCB to start her own legislative and  policy research services company. She went on to represent such clients  as the Nevada Broadcasters Association, the Nevada State Medical  Association, the Associated General Contractors of Las Vegas, and many  more. Ms. Bennett successfully ran this company, Research by Design,  from 1998 to 2004, before being offered the position of director of  government affairs at R&R Partners--one of Nevada's premiere public  relations and government affairs firms.   In 2006, Ms. Bennett left R&R to pursue a graduate degree at Arizona  State University, ASU. During her time in graduate school, Ms. Bennett  served as a policy analyst at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy;  a research assistant at the ASU School of Historical, Philosophical and  Religious Studies; and a research historian at the Arizona State  Archives.   In January 2011, Ms. Bennett returned to Nevada to once again serve,  this time as senior researcher for Governor Sandoval, eventually  becoming the Northern Nevada regional director for the Governor's  Office of Economic Development. As regional director, Ms. Bennett was a  catalyst in the overhaul and redevelopment of that State agency, where  she created the new State plan for excellence in economic development  and worked to improve collaboration between the State and its regional  development authorities to better facilitate economic growth in Nevada.   In December 2014, Ms. Bennett was named president of the Nevada  Mining Association. Through this role, Ms. Bennett has worked  tirelessly to advocate for the mining industry in Nevada and educate  people about the importance of mining and its impact on both the State  and global economies. From her time at LCB, to becoming the first woman  President of the Nevada Mining Association, Ms. Bennett has been a  trailblazer for women in Nevada, helping break the glass ceiling in  industries often dominated by men.   Through all of Ms. Bennett's incredible work and public service, she  has gained an intimate understanding of the policy and initiatives that  aim to improve the lives of all Nevadans. It is my sincere hope that  Ms. Bennett will continue to be an advocate for the people of Nevada  and their interests. Today, I celebrate the many contributions of Ms.  Dana Bennett. Nevadans are fortunate to have had her leadership,  knowledge, and voice during her service to both the State and the  country.                            ____________________
