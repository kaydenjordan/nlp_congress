 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 849, I call up  the bill (H.R. 5665) to establish in the Department of State the Office  to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 5665.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5665, the Combating  International Islamophobia Act.   Before I continue, let me insert in the Record a Statement of  Administration Policy, which begins by stating: ``The administration  supports passage of H.R. 5665, the Combating International Islamophobia  Act.'' And ``Our country's commitment to defending freedom of religion  and belief goes back centuries, and the administration strongly  believes that people of all faiths and backgrounds should be treated  with equal dignity and respect around the world.''                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 5665--Combatting International Islamophobia Act--Rep. Omar, D-MN,                             and 56 co-sponsors         The Administration supports passage of H.R. 5665, the       Combating International Islamophobia Act. Religious freedom       is a fundamental human right. This freedom is enshrined in       the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is also part of       the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Our country's       commitment to defending freedom of religion and belief goes       back centuries, and the Administration strongly believes that       people of all faiths and backgrounds should be treated with       equal dignity and respect around the world.        The Administration also supports language in H.R. 5665 that       calls attention to instances of forced labor, reeducation, or       the presence of concentration camps, such as those targeting       Uyghur and other minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous       Region of the People's Republic of China.        The Administration looks forward to working with Congress       to ensure the Secretary of State has the necessary       flexibility and permissive authority to designate such an       office and special envoy and to provide for an annual report       monitoring concerning acts of Islamophobia in foreign       countries.    Madam Speaker, I could not agree more. The world is seeing  an alarming rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, and we are  witnessing those same trends, unfortunately, here in the United States  of America.   In recent years, anti-Muslim bigotry has been on the rise with  mosques being vandalized and Muslims beaten and attacked and elected  officials on the receiving end of death threats and other hateful  rhetoric all due to their Muslim faith.   Bigotry is unacceptable, and it is incumbent on all of us to condemn  it wherever and whenever it occurs.                                time  1815    The great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ``Injustice  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' Not only must we address  anti-Muslim bigotry here in the United States, but we are also  obligated to confront that bigotry wherever and whenever we see it  happening around the world.   In 2019, New Zealand witnessed the worst terrorist attack in that  nation's history when a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim  worshippers and injured 40 others at two mosques.   Just last week, here on the House floor, we discussed the horrific  atrocities being committed against Uyghur Muslims in China and the  Rohingya Muslims in Burma. We did it in a bipartisan way with my good  friend and colleague Mr. McCaul. That is who we should be, and that is  what we should represent because freedom of religion is a fundamental  human right, and no one should be the target of discrimination because  of their faith.   Prior to considering H.R. 5665, the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs held numerous hearings, including with Secretary of State  Anthony Blinken, U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and leading  academics across the country that discussed and better informed our  understanding of anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamophobia.   With the passage of H.R. 5665, the establishment of an office at the  State Department to help combat the scourge of Islamophobia, we take an  important step toward addressing this problem. That is why I am proud  to support the Combating International Islamophobia Act. This important  legislation would do three very, very important but simple things.  First, it would establish an office to monitor and combat Islamophobia  at the State Department. Second, it would provide the authority to the  executive branch to appoint a special envoy for monitoring and  combating Islamophobia. And third, it will help to improve State  Department reporting on threats to Muslims around the world.   Now, several of my colleagues on the other side have stated that they  oppose this bill, that the bill does not define Islamophobia, but I  believe, and I think they seem to have an awareness, as we all do, for  Islamophobia when they criticize the bill for not doing enough to  address Islamophobia against the Uyghur population in China.   Madam Speaker, discrimination and bigotry are abhorrent, and  combating them is something which we should all be able to do together.  That is why I am so heartened to see this important piece of  legislation being led by a Muslim Member of Congress and a Jewish  Member of Congress. I wish I could say by a Democratic Member of  Congress and a Republican Member of Congress. That would be the right  message to send to the world.   Discrimination and bigotry bring out the worst in humanity. I know  that my friend and colleague feels the same way. I know he does, as do  many of my colleagues on the other side. But we have to stand up and  say it right here on the floor so the world knows what we stand for. If  left unchecked, they can lead to terrible atrocities, to crimes against  humanity, and even to genocide. So this legislation will help shine a  light on this problem and help address the global rise of Islamophobia  at a time in which Islamophobia remains rampant.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all Members of this House to  support this very timely and important bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar), the sponsor of this most timely bill.    Madam Speaker, let me just reply to Mr. McCaul earlier  that the anti-Semitism legislation was introduced on January 3 of 2019,  passed the House on January 11 of 2019. There were no hearings that  were held that last Congress before we passed the vote, and there was  no markup, as we had in our committee this year at all.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Schakowsky), the cosponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, we want to take down the words. I ask that  the words be taken down.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, we are not here to talk about  criticism. We are here to talk about persecution. We are here to talk  about anti-Muslim hate. We are even here to talk about genocide. And we  should know it when we see it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Representative from  the great State of Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  great State of Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McCaul for his statements. Yes, we work very  closely together, as well as many Members in this House, especially on  the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strong fighters on both sides of  the aisle for human rights.   The question that presents itself with this plain and simple bill  that simply calls for us to establish an office to monitor and combat  Islamophobia at the State Department is: Do we all agree? I think I  have heard my colleagues on the other side say that Islamophobia is  wrong. That means you know that Islamophobia exists.   You know it when you see it. You know it when you feel it. You know  it when you talk about the Uyghurs, the Rohingyas, or right here in the  United States of America. There is a definition right there. You see  it. They have said it. We have said it. Islamophobia exists.   What we need to do is call it out. What we need to do is lock arms  and stand together. This is an important bill. The camera of history is  rolling on us. It is an important bill, and it is a bill of  consequence. It should be of consequence to every human being on the  planet, no matter your religion or no matter your race.   It is important to nearly 2 billion Muslims in the world. We need to  focus on what this bill does. Some of the proudest moments of mine--I  live in and represent one of the most diverse districts in all the  United States, in the most diverse county in the United States. I have  seen ugliness raise its ugly head, whether it is racism, anti-Semitism,  or Islamophobia.   But the proud moment is when I see Muslims and Jews walking arm-in- arm against Islamophobia and against anti-Semitism, when I see people  of all races and nationalities standing together and not being silent.   Inaction is unacceptable. We cannot stand idly by as atrocity after  atrocity is inflicted on people of the Muslim faith, or any faith, for  no reason other than bigotry against their religion.   Freedom of religion is a human right. We can and must do better at  combating Islamophobia here at home and abroad. I wish it was today,  but I keep dreams and hopes alive that we will lock arms--we have good  people here--and say in unison, as I have seen people do in my  district, that we are going to call out Islamophobia wherever we see  it, the same with racism and the same with anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, this bill that everybody is watching--we travel a lot on  our committee. We know that people watch what is happening on this  floor. They take it to their gut. I hope that they look at this bill  and know that we are going to call it out and not accept it. Silence  will not be accepted.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6256) to ensure that goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang  Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China do not enter  the United States market, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6256         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT IMPORT PROHIBITION                     APPLIES TO GOODS MINED, PRODUCED, OR                     MANUFACTURED IN THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS                     REGION OR BY CERTAIN ENTITIES.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6256, the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act introduced by my good friend, colleague,  and chair of the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern.   Last week, Mr. Speaker, we passed Chair McGovern's original  legislation on the House floor. I heard my Republican friends comment  that this bill was being slow-walked by the House Democrats; that we  were supposedly passing Chairman McGovern's bill to stall and negotiate  the Senate bill. Even if we did reach agreement, my colleagues across  the aisle surmised that the President would not support the compromise  package.   Here we are, less than 6 days later, and a compromise between the  House and the Senate versions has already been negotiated. Just a few  hours ago, unsurprisingly, the Biden administration announced that it  would sign this vital piece of legislation.   The biggest difference between the two packages was the House called  for implementation in 120 days; the Senate wanted to wait 270 days. We  have negotiated them down to 180 days. The crucial protections of this  law will come into effect months earlier because of House Democrats.   Let me be clear, this is a good thing because it is a bipartisan  measure. I am glad that such important legislation will pass with near  unanimous support from both parties. That is what this should be.   Since 2017, the People's Republic of China has systematically carried  out mass detention, torture, political indoctrination, restrictions on  religious practices, and inhumane atrocities against Uyghurs and  members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.   We have seen the People's Republic of China expand its extensive  program of oppression and transform it into a system of state-sponsored  forced labor. Under the guise of vocational training or poverty  alleviation, authorities in Xinjiang have forced thousands of adults  and children to work against their will and under threat of punishment  to produce goods and raw materials that are then woven into  international supply chains and then to our homes.   This bill, which has passed the House before, prohibits the import of  goods and merchandise from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove the  products did not come from forced labor, imposes sanctions on officials  facilitating the use of forced labor against Chinese ethnic minorities,  adds important financial disclosures for public companies that do  business in the region, and also calls for a diplomatic strategy to  address forced labor in Xinjiang.   This is a straightforward bill. It signals that America will not  tolerate forced labor, and products made from forced labor shall not  enter the American marketplace. In 2021, for any country to utilize  forced labor systematically and to oppress and exploit its population  is unconscionable, unacceptable, and, indeed, un-American. We cannot  and will not stand idly by.   This legislation is critical to showing that we are putting human  rights at the center of our foreign and economic policy. I support this  bill, and I look forward to continuing to work.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Barr, Mr. McCaul, and my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle for coming forward and speaking up, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the sponsor of this bill and chairman of  the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a great member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 6256, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, is an opportunity  for this body to send a resounding message to the world. We are engaged  in a strategic competition with China around the world, and our stance  on this issue, I believe, will define why our system is better. We  aggressively oppose forced labor and Islamophobia, and we will back up  our values with our actions.   In this major piece of legislation, we are doing it together,  Democrats and Republicans, working with Ranking Member McCaul and  others, because it is the right thing to do. It is the right message to  send.   So let us do it; let us get it out; let us stand tall; let us be true  to our values. Let not China get away with Islamophobia. Let's make  sure we wipe out Islamophobia, racism, and anti-Semitism from all  corners of this place that we call the planet Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
