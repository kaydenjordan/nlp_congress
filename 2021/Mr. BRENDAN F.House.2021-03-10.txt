 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic  day. Among other things, today, in this bill, we will be voting to cut  child poverty by 50 percent in the United States of America.

The only  thing better is getting to vote for it a fourth time.   To the American people: Help is finally on the way.  [[Page H1269]]
