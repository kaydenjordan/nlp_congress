 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7666 the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well- Being Act is a significant bill that will help support our mental  health workforce, increase access to pediatric mental health treatment,  and help make schools safer.   This bill will bolster substance use disorder prevention, treatment,  and recovery resources. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has worked  on this for many months, held hearings, and reported it out by a voice  vote in May.   Recognizing children's mental health has been negatively impacted by  school closures, ineffective lockdowns, and increased violence. This  bill provides specific resources to help communities respond to the  children's mental health crisis. This legislation also supports  community mental health services for children with serious emotional  disturbances through crisis-care service and early intervention  activities.   The need to strengthen resources for children's mental health has  been further heightened after the horrific school violence we have seen  in Uvalde.   This bill also works to reauthorize the Garrett Lee Smith Suicide  Prevention Program, provide funding for a suicide prevention lifeline,  and update a major block grant that States use to provide support to  those with serious mental illness.   In addition to supporting those with mental illness, the legislation  helps those with substance use disorders. Kentucky has seen a drastic  rise in overdoses throughout the pandemic and, nationally, the CDC  estimates that drug overdoses exceeded 107,000 between November 2020  and November 2021.   Many of these drug overdoses have been caused by synthetic opioids,  like illicit fentanyl poisoning, which were involved in about 70  percent of all Kentucky overdoses in 2021.   Ultimately, fighting the drug overdose epidemic will require a two- pronged approach: Equipping our law enforcement with the tools they  need to keep these deadly poisons off our streets and providing  recovery and treatment resources.   Through the passage of this bill, we are advancing the second part of  this  [[Page H5776]]  approach by increasing access to critical treatment and recovery  resources for people from all walks of life and every stage of life.  This includes resources for moms and pregnant women by supporting care  for maternal health and substance use disorders, which are among the  leading cause of death for pregnant and postpartum women.   In addition, this legislation also has a provision led by  Representative Bucshon, alongside Representatives Miller-Meeks, Axne,  and Pappas, to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers to help those  with opioid use disorder seek the care that they need as quickly as  possible.   The Timely Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Act removes a Federal  requirement of having to live with opioid disorder for more than 1 year  to be admitted for in-person treatment. I am proud that my bill, the  Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services Block Grant  Act of 2022, which I have worked together with my colleagues, Messrs.  Tonko, McKinley, and Ms. Wild, is also included in this bill.    The legislation would deliver more coordinated substance use disorder  care as well as explicitly reauthorizing funding for recovery support  services, which include workforce training and others.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Advanced Research  Projects Agency-Health Act, or ARPA-H Act. I know this has been an  important priority for researchers, industry, and, most importantly,  patients who are waiting for life-changing medical technology to  improve or even save their lives.   This legislation will authorize the establishment of ARPA-H within  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency will  specifically be charged with helping to foster high-risk, high-reward  treatments and cures for diseases with clinically unmet needs.   Some of my colleagues may be concerned about a new agency, and that  is where a number of Republicans on the Committee on Energy and  Commerce were early in October when this legislation was introduced.   ARPA-H was funded at $1 billion in the previous appropriations bill  in 2021. To ensure that funding was used for the best possible result,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce for the past several months has  worked hard to ensure that ARPA-H has a clear mission. As a result, it  passed out of committee with a strong 55-to-3 vote.                                time  1615    We most notably ensure this newly created agency remains separate  from the NIH. We limit administration costs associated with setting up  ARPA-H to maximize research investments, which would require a  strategic plan and transparent reporting on projects; define the number  of offices; and require that the majority of offices within the  organization be exclusively devoted to biomedical research and  development.   In order to ensure this agency is fostering the development of  innovative, transformative health technologies that are not being met  by Federal programs or private industry, the technologies the agency  should pursue are very explicitly defined in the legislation before us  today.   The legislation puts guardrails in place to ensure that priority  access is granted to U.S. researchers over researchers abroad. There  are additional requirements for international researchers to work in  collaboration with a U.S. counterpart if they receive ARPA-H funding.   Importantly, the bill makes clear that funding is prohibited from  going to nondomestic recipients of a malign foreign country, most  notably Chinese research labs or Russian research labs. This is a  significant step to ensure the United States' intellectual property  isn't being stolen by our adversaries and to ensure we remain the world  leader in biomedical research and innovation.   As the Republican leader on the Health Subcommittee, I am leading  efforts to strengthen oversight of NIH-funded research. It is  unacceptable that some Federal grants have been supporting foreign  researchers with ties to governments of adversarial nations like China.  We must prevent this from happening moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I emphasize the need to pass this bill. The funding has  already been appropriated in a previous year. If we don't pass this  bill and don't authorize this agency to move forward, then this will  erode our oversight role in Congress. Funding decisions made by ARPA-H  must require diligence to ensure that resources are being spent as  appropriately and as effectively as possible.   The Biden administration ARPA-H organizational chart, without this  bill, has 14 offices, less than half of which are actually dedicated to  research. This gives us insight into how the Biden administration would  manage this new agency without congressional guidance. It is just  appropriate that the legislative branch sets up the way this money is  being spent.   That is what the bill before us today does. It puts ARPA-H on the  right track, gives Congress the opportunity to set high standards, and  promotes greater biomedical research and innovation for patients.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working together. I thank our  staff for the excellent work they have done. I encourage the passage of  this because if we don't pass it, the money is still going to be spent  but without congressional guardrails.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), who is the Republican leader of the full  committee.    Mr. Speaker, as the chair of this committee, Mr. Upton  made his signature issue the 21st Century Cures, and not just passing  that which has changed people's lives already but being able to work  with Ms. DeGette and all the others to say that this is something we  all need to work on together in a bipartisan way and make a big  difference.   Now as chair emeritus, this is, I think, his signature piece. He may  have other pieces of legislation, too, but this is the one that I have  worked on with him in the very beginning in the Oval Office with the  President. We worked together to say: Can we do something big that is  really going to change the lives of people in this country?   He has done it. He has done it his entire career. He is a mentor of  mine, and, unfortunately, at the end of this year he is going to do  something different than being here in Congress. He will be missed for  his voice and being a champion of this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to him so that he can speak on this  bill for himself. The gentleman certainly has left a legacy here with  the previous legislation and this piece of legislation. So let's work  together to move it forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is important we are here today.   I thank the chair of the other subcommittee whom I have the privilege  to work alongside as the Republican leader. She has been a champion of  ARPA-H as it first came out and at the first meeting at the White  House. We have discussed quite a bit about where it should be and what  the guardrails should be.    I know the funding got out in front of it. We all really wanted  Congress to have a say in how this agency operated and not the  executive branch the way, unfortunately, getting in front of  authorization does.   I appreciate the hard work. I appreciate the work of the colleagues  who have spoken and everybody else who is working on this together on  our staff.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we pass this bill. I urge  my colleagues to vote for the bill tonight, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, even though  I am not opposed to the bill.    Mr. Speaker, the Chair of the subcommittee kind of went  through what the amendment says. Another thing that we need to make  sure is reinforced is that the amendment would ensure that agency and  precious U.S. taxpayer dollars can never go to nondomestic recipients  organized under the laws of a covered foreign entity as defined by the  National Security Act of 1947. This includes China, Russia, Iran, and  North Korea. So I want to make sure we understand that.   I said this on the debate on the bill that the Chair and I were  talking back and forth. And I understood the mission of what we wanted  to accomplish with ARPA-H, but I was concerned about the application of  it and how it would actually be put into place. We had a lot of  discussions based on that.   This amendment really does define as best as we can define in  legislation, without vague terms, what we want ARPA-H to do. This  amendment ensures that 85 percent of the money goes to research and not  to administration and growing an agency. We think that this really does  narrow and, as we said earlier, put guardrails. This amendment is what  accomplishes that with the bill. I am for this amendment, and I  encourage its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
