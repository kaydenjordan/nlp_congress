 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Library Week.   Libraries are the cornerstone of our communities. They provide access  to knowledge and services. They expose us to ideas and information that  help us better understand ourselves, each other, and the world around  us. They connect our children to literature, media, and tutoring  services. During the pandemic, they have played a critical role in  ensuring access to the internet and technology.   I am so grateful for the exceptional libraries in my district, from  the Cuyahoga County Public Library and the Cleveland Public Library to  the Akron-Summit County Public Library, and all the libraries in  between. I am grateful for their dedicated library workers who support  northeast Ohioans from all walks of life.   This National Library Week, I thank our libraries and librarians for  all they do to support an informed, connected community. I urge my  colleagues to support robust funding for these centers of learning and  opportunity.                            ____________________
