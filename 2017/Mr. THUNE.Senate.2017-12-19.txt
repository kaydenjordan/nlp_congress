 Mr. President, relief for Americans is on the way. This  evening, we will vote on the first comprehensive overhaul of our Tax  Code since 1986. In 1986, I was a young Senate staffer. I watched as  that tax bill passed on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I was a 25-year- old staffer back then.   In a couple of weeks, my wife and I will welcome our third grandchild  into the world, so it seems only fitting, after 30 years, that we go  about the business of reforming the Tax Code because a lot has changed  in this country. A lot has changed in this country in the past 30  years, but the one thing that hasn't changed is the Tax Code. Our Tax  Code needs to be updated and modernized to reflect the times in which  we live.   Since President Reagan signed the last overhaul into law, our Tax  Code has ballooned into an unwieldy, complex maze that costs American  taxpayers an incredible amount of time and money and acts as a drag on  economic growth and job creation.   I will say that when I was elected to the Senate, I came here, as  most of us do, wanting to do big things. We want to do consequential  things. We want to do things that will impact the American people in a  beneficial and a positive way, and that is certainly the case with tax  reform. I sought to get on the Senate Finance Committee for that  reason. The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax, trade,  healthcare, and issues that really impact and affect the American  people's everyday lives.   In 2011, I had the good fortune of getting on the committee, and ever  since that time we have been working aggressively, planning for this  very day. The suggestion by our colleagues on the other side that  somehow this cropped up all of a sudden, overnight, is absolutely  inconsistent with the facts. Since I got on the Finance Committee in  2011, we have had no fewer than 70 hearings on tax reform and tax- related issues.   In 2015, the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, created five  working groups. I was fortunate enough to chair one of those working  groups. They were bipartisan, and they were tasked with looking at all  aspects of the Tax Code, broken down into five different sections, and  making recommendations for tax reform. We went about that in a very  diligent way. We spent weeks and months developing ideas, reported  those recommendations to the full committee, and those recommendations  today serve as the foundation for the legislation we are considering.  That was a bipartisan process, and the Democrats participated in that.  A lot of the suggestions are bipartisan ideas. The foundation for this  legislation frankly, in many respects, originated with those working  groups that were worked upon by both Republicans and Democrats. So we  stand here today with a piece of legislation that has a lot of  bipartisan substance in it, even though the Democrats have refused to  participate in the process.   We started out with two major goals on tax reform. One was to put  more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans and to create a tax  code that would foster economic growth and make American companies  competitive again in the global marketplace. Those are the two goals.  The bill before us today--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--succeeds on both  fronts.   The bill provides immediate, direct relief for hard-working  Americans, starting next month. It lowers tax rates for Americans in  every income bracket. It nearly doubles the standard deduction,  simplifying the code, meaning that fewer people will have to itemize.  Across the country, it varies State by State, but, on average, less  than one-third of the people across the country itemize today. Well,  this will reduce that number even further. Less than 10 percent of the  people in this country will have to itemize because of the doubling--or  near doubling--of the standard deduction. It doubles the child tax  credit and significantly increases the refundable portion of the  credit, which will provide important additional help for low-income  families, and it maintains the earned-income tax credit.   All of this means that American families are going to see a  significant drop in their tax bills for next year. Just as a case in  point, a family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000 per  year will see a tax cut of over $2,000, and that represents a 58- percent reduction over what they are paying today under current law. If  you are a single parent with one child and have an income of $41,000,  you are going to see a $1,300 reduction in your taxes, which represents  a 73-percent reduction over what you are paying today under current  law.   So the idea, as has been advanced by the other side, that somehow  middle-income taxpayers don't benefit from this is absolutely false. It  is inaccurate because these are objective facts. A doubling of the  standard deduction, a doubling of the child tax credit, and a reduction  in rates mean that people in all income groups are going to see  significant tax relief. Just to put a fine point on that, this is based  on the latest analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation. They assess  and look at how these proposals will translate in terms of income  groups and who gets impacted by that.  [[Page S8098]]    I want to point out that if you look at income by level here-- different groups and their incomes--as you can see, every income group  receives a significant tax cut. In fact, lower income Americans receive  the largest tax cuts, and that, again, is according to the Joint  Committee on Taxation. The point made earlier by my colleague from the  other side was that somehow this was going to be a huge tax shift in  terms of who is going to pay taxes after all this is said and done.  Well, if you look at the tax burden--and by that I mean who pays taxes  in this country, the share of taxes currently borne by each different  income category--as you see from this chart, which is broken down by  quadrant, 25 percent of the filers are in this category, 25 percent in  this category, and 25 percent with $50,000 to $100,000 in income, and  then the final quadrant of 25 percent is those making $100,000 and  above. Well, if you look at those in the lower income categories--and  this is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation--their share of  the tax burden relative to what it is today is actually the same or  lower. So those in lower income categories, those making $20,000 to  $50,000 a year--and that represents about 25 percent of filers today-- pay 4.3 percent of total taxes in this country. After implementation of  the bill, they will pay 4.1 percent of total taxes in this country.  Their overall tax burden will have decreased after passage of this  legislation.   If you take the next category, from $50,000 to $100,000, they pay  today, under current law, 16.9 percent of the total tax burden in this  country. After this legislation has passed, they will be paying 16.9  percent of the total tax burden in this country.   What about those making $100,000 a year and more, which represents  about 25 percent of all filers? Well, according to the Joint Committee  on Taxation, on which these distribution tables are based, those in  that income category who are paying today 78.7 percent of all the taxes  in this country--after this is passed, they will pay 79.1 percent. So  their overall tax burden actually goes up after this legislation is  passed and enacted into law.   Interestingly enough, this is the most recent analysis by the Joint  Committee on Taxation. This is the distribution table that they just  put out. The category that has the biggest increase in terms of overall  tax burden is those making a million dollars a year and more. Today  they pay 19.3 percent of all the tax burden, all the tax liability in  this country. After this is all said and done, they will pay 19.8  percent. So their taxes--those with a million and more--are going up  under this legislation.   So this idea--they keep saying it on the other side, but just because  they keep saying it doesn't make it true. The facts tell a completely  different story. These are the facts. Again, I have come back to the  point I made earlier; that is, let's put it into language that people  in this country understand. When they do their taxes, they are going to  see a doubling of the standard deduction and they are going to see a  doubling of the child tax credit. If you are a family with kids in this  country, that means that for every child you have, instead of getting a  $1,000 child tax credit, you will get a $2,000 child tax credit. Couple  that with the lower rates--and the marginal rates are going to be a 10- percent rate, a 12-percent rate--and where those kick in at different  brackets, you are going to see a significant reduction in taxes across  all income groups. That is just the reality. I think it is important  that we at least, as we are talking about this subject, talk about it  in terms of the facts.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also preserves elements of the current Tax  Code that have been working for Americans. Under this bill, homeowners  and those aspiring to own a home will still be able to deduct their  mortgage interest if they itemize on their taxes. Individuals who  donate to charities, to churches, and educational institutions will  still be able to claim those contributions as an itemized deduction.  Working Americans will retain all the current options for saving for  retirement, from individual retirement accounts to the various types of  employer-provided retirement plans, like 401(k)s.   This bill also provides families with permanent relief from  ObamaCare's burdensome individual mandate, which is a tax on lower  income Americans. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Americans will no  longer be required to buy health insurance that they don't want and  can't afford or face significant financial penalties, which today  disproportionately fall on those who make less than $50,000 a year.   This bill also restores the deduction for major medical expenses to  where it was before ObamaCare. For this year and next, Americans facing  the burden of significant medical expenses will once again be able to  deduct any expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross  income. I hope that eventually we will be able to make that change  permanent.   That is not all this is going to do. This is not just going to help  Americans now; it is going to help them for the long term. It is going  to give them access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that  will set them up for a secure future. How does it go about doing that?  By rebuilding our broken Tax Code into a modern tax system designed for  a 21st-century economy.   In order for individual Americans to thrive, American businesses need  to thrive. Thriving businesses expand. They hire new workers. They can  afford to offer those workers higher wages. But our current Tax Code  has not been helping businesses thrive. On the contrary, it has been  strangling businesses large and small with high tax rates and  provisions that discourage growth and drive those good-paying jobs  overseas. Plus, our outdated tax structure has left American businesses  at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.   This legislation changes all of that. This bill lowers tax rates  across the board for small and medium-size businesses, farms, and  ranches. It provides a 20-percent deduction on passthrough income,  reducing the top effective tax rate on this income to no more than 29.6  percent. It permits businesses with gross receipts of up to $25 million  to use the cash method of accounting and to expense their inventory  costs. It allows businesses to expense new investments in machinery,  equipment, and building improvements. And it expands the amount of  startup and organizational expenses that new businesses can write off  up front, freeing up cash flow to get the business up and running.   Accelerating businesses' ability to recover the money they invested  in things like property, equipment, and inventory will encourage new  business growth and help existing businesses--including farms and  ranches--expand their operations, create new jobs, and grow the  economy.   The bill also helps family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches by  providing substantial relief from the death tax. I would have preferred  to eliminate what I think is a confiscatory tax once and for all. But  in this legislation, we double the current exemption to over $11  million, and by doing that, this bill will take a vast majority of  family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches out of the tax's  crosshairs. Too many of these businesses have wasted tens of thousands  of dollars a year on costly estate planning simply to avoid the death  tax and preserve that family business for another generation. That is  money that these individuals would rather be investing in their  businesses and their workers. This legislation allows these businesses  to save critical capital for their businesses instead of forcing them  to spend it to protect themselves from the heavy hand of the  government.   In addition to improving the playing field for small businesses, the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will boost our economy by lowering the tax rate  for larger businesses. Right now, America's global businesses pay the  highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. By reducing the  corporate tax rate to 21 percent, this bill will allow American  businesses to compete and win in the global economy. Just as important,  this bill brings the U.S. international tax system into the 21st  century by replacing our outdated worldwide tax system with a  territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at  a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.   We haven't talked a lot about this, but one of the most important  reforms in this bill is the changes we make to  [[Page S8099]]  the international tax system. This bill also eliminates the incentives  in our current Tax Code that encouraged companies to shift jobs,  profits, and manufacturing plants overseas. This bill makes it easier  for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in  growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities here in America.   Lowering the corporate tax rate and transitioning to a territorial  tax system will boost wages, jobs, and opportunities for American  workers employed by our Nation's global companies. It will also  increase wages, jobs, and opportunities for workers at the countless  small and medium-sized businesses throughout our country that make up  the supply chain for America's global companies. That is a resounding  win for American workers and businesses and for our economy overall.   As I said earlier, this bill is the product of literally years of  work by Members of both parties. I am excited to be here as we get an  opportunity to take this bill across the finish line later today.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.
