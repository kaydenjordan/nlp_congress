 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of my legislation, H.R. 700, to name the Elwood, Illinois,  post office after Larry Walsh, Sr., a public servant and a dedicated  member of the Will County community.   Mr. Walsh was raised in Joliet and was a graduate of Joliet Junior  College and a lifelong resident of Elwood, Illinois. Larry loved the  State of Illinois and devoted his life to making it a better place.   He first began his career in public service as a member of the Elwood  School Board and continued to serve his community as an elected Jackson  Township supervisor, a member of the Will County Board, and an Illinois  State Senator representing the 43rd District, a time during which he  was widely reputed to have spent a certain amount of time playing poker  with his colleague, then State Senator Barack Obama.   Larry finished his career in public service as the Will County  executive, a position he held from 2004 until his passing in 2020.   Larry was a family man and a devoted farmer, a voice for disability  issues, senior citizens services, and agricultural workers.   He championed the largest infrastructure improvement investment in  Will County's history, alongside modernizing his county's public safety  resources. Simply put, Will County is a better place today because of  the decades of work that Larry devoted to it.   The Lawrence M. ``Larry'' Walsh Sr. Post Office will be a justifiable  source of pride and a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life  to local government and his community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation, one of the collegial and noble things that Congress can do  for a collegial and noble man.
