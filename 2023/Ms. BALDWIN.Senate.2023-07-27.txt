 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The author has not truly revealed what the amendment does.   On all of our Federal buildings, we often see many different flags-- the U.S. flag that we all join in pledging in this body but also, in  certain States, the State flag. We see the MIA flag. I will tell you,  in Madison, WI, at the State capitol, during the month of June, it  adorns the Pride flag.   This really is thinly veiled. Let's be clear that this is about not  being able to fly the Pride flag.   I was so proud last year to work across the aisle with both Democrats  and Republicans to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. It was a  milestone for equal rights for all Americans. But like so many other  Americans in leading this march toward equality, I am reminded of how  much work we have yet to do.   LGBTQ+ Americans are our neighbors, our loved ones, our constituents,  and our colleagues. They serve in our Armed Forces and in the Federal  Government, making sacrifices every day for their country. They work in  our Federal buildings, our post offices, and in our own offices. They  serve in our military and put their lives at risk for our country.  These Federal buildings connect Americans to their government--a  government of, by, and for the people. But, for too long, LGBTQ+  Americans have felt unwelcomed and sometimes unsafe in these spaces-- these spaces that are meant to serve them too.   I think the American people are getting tired of politicians who make  their support for our military servicemembers and their families  contingent upon pushing a discriminatory agenda whether that be about  women's rights or LGBTQ+ rights.    I urge opposition.
