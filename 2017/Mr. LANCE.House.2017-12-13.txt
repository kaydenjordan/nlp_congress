 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, and I thank Chairman Hensarling and  Representative Poliquin for their leadership on this issue.   We must be scrutinizing the financial dealings of senior Iranian  political and military leaders. It is in the national security interest  of the United States to understand the international web of finances  that supports terror operations and other nefarious causes.   I am pleased that this bill includes an amendment I proposed to  target the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, a position  currently held by Ali Akbar Salehi, to the list of Iranian leaders  named in this legislation.   Given Iran's violations of international law and its clear ties to  international terrorism--it is, after all, the leading state sponsor of  terrorism across the globe--we should be monitoring the finances of the  head of its nuclear program to ensure compliance with sanctions and  other laws.   For years, the Iranian regime has been mired in institutionalized  corruption, to the detriment of the people of that great country. In  the nexus of nuclear weapons, state-sponsored terrorism, money  laundering, secret financial agreements, and mass pilfering from the  Iranian people is cause for great alarm. This legislation is a response  to all of that. It is completely bipartisan in nature. It is the way we  should act in the House of Representatives in a bipartisan capacity.  The national security interests of the United States know no partisan  bounds.   Mr. Chairman, we need all of the tools at our disposal to investigate  the finances of this terrorist regime.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on Mr. Poliquin's legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.
