 Madam Speaker, I rise to add my voice and  support to restaurant owners in Buffalo and Western New York standing  up today to call on Congress to approve additional restaurant relief.   Congress authorized, through the American Rescue Plan, the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund, providing $28.6 billion to help restaurants hit  hard by the pandemic. While the program was able to help over 101,000  small business owners, over 63 percent of eligible applicants, more  than 177,000 restaurants the Small Business Administration deemed  qualified for funding received nothing.   According to the National Restaurant Association, the restaurant  industry sales in 2020 were down by $240 billion, and restaurant  employment dropped 3 million below expected levels. Restaurants support  jobs, fuel our local economies, and as gathering places for families  and friends, help to build stronger communities.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of swift replenishment of  the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.                            ____________________
