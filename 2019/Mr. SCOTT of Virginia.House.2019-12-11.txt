 Madam Speaker, farmworkers toil under  difficult and dangerous conditions for long hours and low pay to ensure  America has a safe and plentiful food supply.   Because of the scarcity of domestic farm labor, for decades, the  agricultural sector has depended largely on the labor of migrant  workers. The vast majority of crop workers in the United States were  not born here and are undocumented or here on guest visas. Though these  workers perform incredibly difficult work under hazardous conditions,  they are often unable to seek recourse when their rights are violated.  A pathway to citizenship, when accompanied by appropriate oversight  measures, could help reduce these dedicated workers' justifiable fear  of reprisal for asserting their rights. Farmworkers are integral to our  communities and our economy. Creating a pathway to citizenship for  these individuals--who work to feed us and our country year after  year--as well as their families is both an economic and humanitarian  necessity.   I support legalization of vulnerable, undocumented workers and a path  to citizenship. However, in exchange for legalization for some  undocumented farmworkers, this bill would depress labor standards for  H-2A workers. Because weakened labor standards for H-2A workers could  adversely impact the domestic workforce, this bill could negatively  impact the economic security of all farmworkers.   Wage cuts for many H-2A workers in turn would depress wages for all  farmworkers, The adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), which is often the  binding wage paid to H-2A workers, is designed to ensure that wages  paid to H-2A workers do not depress wages for U.S. farmworkers. This  means the AEWR must be high enough to reflect wages paid in the local  labor market. This bill would change the way the AEWR is currently  calculated over the first ten years to reflect average wages paid to  farmworkers in the region according to their specific occupation,  rather than the average wage paid to farmworkers across all  occupations. However, the bill fails to require the use of data that  actually reflects local wage conditions. Additionally, while setting  limitations on how much AEWR wages can decrease after an initial one- year freeze, the bill imposes caps on wage increases from year to year,  limiting whether AEWR can truly reflect wages paid in the local labor  market.   As a result of these changes to the AEWR, the majority of H-2A  workers would see their wages actually go down, albeit modestly, while  others would see the growth in their wages capped. I have opposed  similar efforts proposed by the Trump Administration that would depress  wages.   This year, I was pleased to lead the House passage of H.R. 582, the  Raise the Wage Act, which would boost wages for millions of lower-wage  workers. I am confident that in the next ten years, we will enact a  meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, boosting wages for  workers across our nation including farmworkers. However, I am  concerned that H.R. 5038 will create artificial barriers to wage  growth, or worse, lead to wage cuts, continuing to leave farmworkers  relegated to low pay and economic insecurity.   Our country's wage and hour laws are designed to ensure that workers  are guaranteed a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. But this right  is only as strong as a worker's ability to hold employers accountable,  especially in court. Unfortunately, this bill creates obstacles that  may delay farmworkers' ability to access their day in court, when they  have been victims of wage theft. While I welcome extending coverage of  the the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA)  to H-2A workers, adding a mediation requirement to both the MSPA and  the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is problematic. This bill enables  employers to impose three months of mandatory mediation when an H-2A  worker brings a civil suit under these laws, even if the worker does  not consent to the mediation and wants his or her day in court. This  undermines the voluntary nature of mediation and provides bad actors  with an avenue for delaying or denying wage recovery. This delay could  prove significant for farmworkers who may be in this country for a  limited amount of time to participate in litigation. This is especially  fraught given that, in contrast to MSPA, the FLSA provides for recovery  of unpaid wages and liquated, or double, damages and recovery of  attorney's fees, plus costs. This provision may also pull domestic  farmworkers or other visa classifications of workers into required  mediation where there are collective or class actions, thereby  undermining incentives for other workers to join with H-2A workers to  seek redress.   This September, I supported the passage of H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act,  to ban forced arbitration in many areas, including employment, because  it could delay or totally block workers' access to courts. We should  promote legislation that protects workers' fundamental right to have  their day in court, not delay it.   This bill denies newly legalized farmworkers and their families  access to key social safety  [[Page H10081]]  net programs, such as Medicaid and subsidies under the Affordable Care  Act. Denial of benefits that can promote economic stability, coupled  with the bill's wage suppressing provisions, threatens to create a  long-term pool of economically vulnerable workers. While most of these  individuals do not currently have access to these benefits due to their  immigration status, leaving immigrant workers who are granted legal  status under this legislation without access to social safety net  programs establishes a dangerous precedent that access to health care  and other basic necessities can be traded away for a path to legal  status.   This legislation weakens the current recruitment and hiring standards  for U.S. farmworkers. A reduction in employers' obligations to hire  U.S. workers under this bill will undermine one of the core principles  of the H-2A program: that H-2A workers should fill in gaps in the farm  workforce that U.S. employers are truly unable to fill, rather than  merely replacing U.S. workers that employers could attract with  reasonable efforts. I raised concerns with similar efforts to modify  recruitment standards by the Trump Administration earlier this year.   Agricultural work is hazardous, and workers in this sector have few  legal health and safety protections. Ensuring that H-2A workers and all  farmworkers have safe, healthy working conditions is critical. I am  pleased that this bill requires H-2A employers to maintain heat illness  prevention plans and requires H-2A employers in the dairy industry to  maintain workplace safety plans. However, as presently written, some  provisions are ambiguous and would be difficult to enforce; other  provisions have weak minimum requirements that would limit their value.  As this legislation moves forward, I would urge the inclusions of  stronger health and safety standards.   Strong labor protections are vital to protect both H-2A workers, who  are vulnerable given their temporary status, and domestic farmworkers,  whose employers may be disincentivized to provide employment. This is  especially true given that farmworkers have historically been carved  out of labor and employment laws, leaving these workers with fewer wage  protections and rights to bargain for better working conditions.   While this bill does make some improvements in immigration law, I  look forward to supporting a version of this bill that more accurately  reflects strong labor standards.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Chair, I would first like to thank Chairman Neal, Chairman  Pallone, the Speaker of the House, and other Democratic leaders for  their leadership in lowering skyrocketing drug costs.   The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act is a historic  proposal to improve the health and well-being of all Americans. Not  only does this legislation lower drug costs for taxpayers and seniors  on Medicare, but it also reduces drug costs for businesses and families  across the country, allowing employer-sponsored plans to access the  same cost savings negotiated for Medicare.   In fact, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,  H.R. 3 will save households and businesses more than $160 billion over  the next 10 years. In my district, this means savings for approximately  600,000 people in public and private health insurance programs.   H.R. 3 will save the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, and  these savings will be reinvested in healthcare priorities. These  priorities include funding new cures through the National Institutes of  Health; funding community health centers, which serve 29 million  Americans across the country; and combating the opioid epidemic.   Simply put, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act will  lower prescription drug costs for workers today while investing in a  healthier future for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation and deliver on our bipartisan promise to lower  healthcare costs for the American people.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.     Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Davis), the distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor and chair of the Subcommittee on  Higher Education and Workforce Investment.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor, who, prior to her service in  Congress, was a practicing physician.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor and a former National Teacher of  the Year.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from  Connecticut an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I just want to comment about a letter that we received  from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  This letter states, in part: ``Enactment of H.R. 3 is needed because:   ``It directs our government to stand on the side of all Americans and  protect us from price gouging by directly negotiating for lower  prescription drug prices.   ``It creates a new $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drugs  for people on Medicare.   ``It reinvests Federal savings into much-needed new Medicare benefits  to cover dental, vision, and hearing.   ``The cost of inaction is too high. It is calculated in the suffering  of individuals who are forced to ration their medicines or choose  between buying medicines or paying for housing and groceries.  Prescription drug companies must be made accountable. We urge you to  send a clear message that Congress is on the side of all Americans by  directing the government to directly negotiate for lower prescription  drug prices. Please vote in support of H.R. 3.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to comment on a letter we received from the AFL- CIO, a legislative alert. It says, in part, that ``3 in 10 adults  report that they were unable to take their medicines as prescribed at  some point in the past year because of the cost, often worsening their  medical condition, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Yet  according to AARP, the average annual cost of prescription drugs rose  nearly 58 percent between 2012 and 2017. Prices in 2019 increased for  3,400 drugs on the market, with an average price increase of 10.5  percent, a rate roughly five times the inflation rate. . . . `'   ``The Lower Drug Prices Now Act takes bold action to address this  relentless rise in drug prices. . . . `'   ``H.R. 3 reinvests the estimated $500 billion in Federal savings in  historic improvements to Medicare benefits and other important  healthcare programs. Medicare part D prescription drug coverage is  substantially improved by the addition of a $2,000 out-of-pocket  maximum. Medicare benefits are further expanded by the inclusion of  vision, dental, and hearing benefits. To help low-income seniors, the  legislation expands subsidy eligibility to make premiums and out-of- pocket costs more affordable.   ``Other investments in healthcare include $7.7 billion to support  community responses to the opioid crisis and $10 billion for National  Institutes of Health biomedical research toward the discovery of  breakthrough drug therapies.   ``The Lower Drug Prices Now Act will provide crucial assistance to  working families who are currently unable to afford the medicines they  need, while simultaneously making important investments to address  other healthcare priorities. We urge you to vote for this bill.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I will point out that the question of availability of drugs in the  United States came up at a hearing we had on this legislation. It was  pointed out that the target negotiated price will be approximately 120  percent of the international average. That is a lot better than the  two, three, five, as much as 60 times higher Americans are paying for  the same drugs here than in other countries.   At that price, at 120 percent, that will be the highest price, and we  will be the biggest market. They certainly won't take a drug away from  the biggest market paying the highest price, so we don't have to worry  about availability.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, last year, Congress made a promise to lower skyrocketing  drug costs and strengthen our healthcare system for Americans. H.R. 3,  the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, delivers on that  promise. The legislation not only lowers the costs of prescription  drugs for taxpayers and those enrolled in Medicare, but it also lowers  the costs for workers, businesses, and families.   It improves the quality of healthcare by expanding Medicare benefits  to include vision, dental, and hearing benefits, and it limits the out- of-pocket copays and deductibles to $2,000.   It strengthens public health by investing in community health  centers, and it provides historic funding for evidence-based student  trauma services and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Both  of these initiatives will help support children who have suffered abuse  or trauma related to substance use disorder and the opioid crisis.   The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act is a long-overdue  step to improve healthcare and the lives of Americans across the  country, both today and for decades to come.   Again, I thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Neal, Speaker Pelosi, and  other Democratic leaders for bringing this legislation to the floor,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this priority for the  American people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Hayes) having assumed the chair, Mr. Levin of California, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3)  to establish a fair price negotiation program, protect the Medicare  program from excessive price increases, and establish an out-of-pocket  maximum for Medicare part D enrollees, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
