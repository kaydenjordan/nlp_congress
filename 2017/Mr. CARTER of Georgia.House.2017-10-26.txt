 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  71st Rescue Squadron of the United States Air Force, which is stationed  at Moody Air Force Base in the first District of Georgia.   They responded as part of the 23rd Wing effort by mobilizing their  personnel and equipment in order to help the victims of Hurricane  Harvey in Texas.   The 71st Rescue Squadron successfully evacuated 308 flood victims and  38 family pets. They repositioned 15 rescue crafts and teams to access  difficult areas, saving 1,100 lives.   In addition, they moved 83 tons of cargo and delivered 23,000 gallons  of fuel, which was used to conduct helicopter search and rescues.   Because of their dedication to this country, this group received the  That Others May Live Squadron of the Year Award for the Air Force.   Thank you, 71st Rescue Squadron, for your extensive efforts to help  the citizens of this country.                            ____________________
