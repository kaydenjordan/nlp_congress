 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of  women, girls, and children.   I would like to talk about the Equality Act. It is a bill that we  will be voting on this week. It is a bill that was passed before, but  it is a bill that needs to be struck down. This is a bill that will add  sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under the  Federal 1964 Civil Rights Act.   We live in a nation--thank God--that declares all of us equal. There  should not be discrimination of anyone in the United States of America,  and I fully believe that. But I ask everyone to take pause and truly  consider what the Equality Act will do, because it has very serious  consequences.   You see, women have come very far in America and our rights are  extremely important. The work of our grandmothers and mothers to  declare women as equal and push our way into the workplace and into  sports has been a remarkable achievement.   Voting, being able to own businesses, achieve education the same as  men in America is a gift that I feel so honored and blessed by. I know  that every American woman treasures this.                                time  1100    You see, the Equality Act will change all of that, because it will  put trans rights above women's rights, above the rights of our  daughters, our sisters, our friends, our grandmothers, our aunts. It is  too much.   Mr. Speaker, you see, as a woman, I have competed in sports, and I am  so thrilled that I was able to do that, but I competed against  biological women. It is a wonderful thing to be able to compete and  prove yourself. Competition is a great, great thing. Little girls all  over the country play sports. They play their hearts out, they  practice, they enjoy time with their friends, then they compete at  higher levels where they can earn scholarships, where they can go to  college and achieve and receive an education through playing a sport  for their university or college.   There are women that move on into professional sports fields and do  remarkable things, incredible things for women. For example, Florence  Griffith Joyner became the fastest woman in the world in 1988 when she  ran the 100-meter dash in 10.49 seconds. I could only dream of being  that fast. But in 2019, Matthew Boling caught the fastest high school  100-meter time ever in 9.98 seconds, an entire half-second quicker than  the fastest woman in the world.   Biological women cannot compete against biological men. Biological  little girls cannot compete against biological little boys. And they  shouldn't have to.   I have a daughter that is a D-1 athlete. We traveled the country for  10 years where she competed at the highest level. She earned her  scholarship, and now she plays fast-pitch softball. And I can't tell  you how much fun I had watching her play this weekend, and she had a  home run. But if she has to compete against boys in her sport, not only  will they be on her playing field and she has to compete against them;  they will be in her locker room; they will be in her showers; they will  be in her bathroom; they will be in her hotel room when she travels  with her team--all under the Equality Act. This is wrong.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't about political parties. It is not about  Democrat, Republican. This is about right and wrong. This is about  girls' and women's rights.   Furthermore, it affects women in prison. Trans men, biological men  that identify as women, will be put with women in prison.   Battered women's shelters, women that have been beaten and abused by  men will have men in their battered women's shelters.   Drug rehab centers--and the list goes on and on.   Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to stop discrimination of a class of  people, but it is another thing to completely violate and destroy the  rights of girls and women in order to achieve this. This bill must be  struck down. It is completely wrong.   Furthermore, we are in an institution where it says, ``In God we  trust.'' Well, it says in Genesis: God created us male and female. In  his image, he created us. Science has two sets of chromosomes that  prove male and female.   Mr. Speaker, 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria  completely outgrow it after puberty. The Equality Act will force  doctors and nurses to perform mastectomies on girls that want to have  their breasts removed. It will force doctors also to perform abortions,  because according to the Equality Act, a doctor cannot say no.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone please pause and consider, and vote  ``no'' for the Equality Act. We can't do this in America, and it needs  to stop with political parties.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the debate here  for the rule, there seems to be quite a disagreement between each side  over what exactly this bill says, so for a parliamentary question, I  would like to request that the entire bill be read.    Well, then, let's read some of the rules. You  keep saying it doesn't violate religious freedoms when, in fact, it  does. It says so directly here in the bill in these sections, and it is  a shame that we aren't reading the exact text because it is the text  that matters. It doesn't matter what you have to say or what I have to  say. It is the actual wording.   In section 1107, it actually talks about: ``The Religious Freedom  Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim concerning, or a  defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for  challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.''   This bill, in the text, also specifically talks about: ``With respect  to gender identity, an individual shall not be denied access to a  shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing  room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.''    Mr. Speaker, in the wording in the text of  the bill of the Equality Act, it also says: ``With respect to sex,  pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition shall not receive  less favorable treatment than other physical conditions.''   As a parliamentary question, what does that mean? Does that mean that  anyone can demand an abortion? And it is discrimination to be refused  this medical service?
