 Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Montana  for his powerful message. I can assure him that I believe strongly in  the same approach as he does with regard to life.   I rise to discuss an issue of vital importance to our society, and  that is the intrinsic value of human life. Very shortly, every Senator  will have an opportunity to stand up for human dignity and condemn  infanticide when we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act. This should not be a difficult vote for any of us.   I believe in the value of every innocent human life, beginning at the  moment of conception to natural death. Life is a gift from God that  should be respected and treated with dignity from the very beginning to  the very end.   I have worked to enact pro-life policies throughout my time in public  service based upon this principle. While working as Governor, I signed  legislation to ban abortions in South Dakota, except when necessary to  save a mother's life.   ``Humanae Vitae,'' written by Pope Paul IV and later expanded upon in  ``Evangelium Vitae,'' written by Saint Pope John Paul II the Great,  teaches that there can be no true democracy without a recognition of  the dignity of every person. It goes on to teach that respect and  dignity must be given to each human life for true peace and freedom to  exist.   We must demand respect for the rights of all. This includes those in  the womb, as well as mothers carrying a child who are facing difficult  challenges. Both deserve our utmost compassion and care. While this  should be common sense to everyone, we recognize that in this country  there are individuals who are pro-life and individuals who are pro- choice.   While I and millions of other pro-life Americans continue to work to  end all abortions and support measures that strengthen the dignity of  life, recent actions at the State level have been deeply troubling.  Pro-choice individuals are actually now supporting measures that will  allow doctors to commit infanticide even after a baby has been born  alive. For example, last month, the State of New York repealed section  4164 of the State's public health law which provided protections for an  infant born alive after a failed abortion. Subsequently, in Virginia,  legislation has been introduced that would legalize abortion up to term  and even after the birth has begun. In Rhode Island, the Governor has  vowed to sign legislation legalizing abortion even after the child is  viable.   These examples of abortion extremism at its worst--radical, abhorrent  acts of infanticide--should horrify all of us. While I am troubled by  the thought of any baby being killed at any stage, at a bare minimum  every one of us should be able to agree that infanticide--or the  killing of a baby after it has been born alive--is unacceptable. This  is a separate issue from abortion, which is abhorrent in itself.   In the history of the world, the true test of a society is how well  we treat the most vulnerable among us. That is why we must pass this  legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, of which  I am an original cosponsor, and I would like to thank Senator Sasse for  bringing this legislation forward.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act simply protects  newborns who survive abortions by requiring appropriate care and  admission to a hospital. When a failed abortion results in the live  birth of an infant, our legislation makes clear that healthcare  providers must exercise the same degree of professional skill to  protect the newborn child as would be offered to any other child born  alive at the same gestational age. A baby who survives an abortion  deserves the same rights under the law as any other newborn baby and  should receive proper medical care, not to be left to die or be killed.   It is also worth mentioning that President Trump stood up for life  during the State of the Union Address earlier this month, calling on  Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions of  children who feel pain in the mother's womb. President Trump urged:         Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes       innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All       children--born and unborn--are made in the holy image of God.    I couldn't agree more. All life is sacred. We must seek to protect  and save lives whenever possible, however possible. I urge my  colleagues to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   I yield the floor.
