 Madam Speaker, a Rasmussen poll  conducted on October 2 of 2019 found that a sky-high 69 percent of  independent voters were ``angry'' at the media, and over 60 percent of  all voters share that anger.   These voters are not upset at the media because they are balanced and  fair, they are upset because the media is biased and telling them what  to think--or not telling them at all.   The results of this astounding poll didn't appear in the Nation's  largest newspapers or the most watched TV news programs and was hardly  mentioned on social media.   The media's credibility is already at a record low. The road back to  credibility for the media is to give the American people the truth and  let them make up their own minds.                            ____________________
