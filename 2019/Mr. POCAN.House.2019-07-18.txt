 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott for yielding.   I do find it interesting to sit and listen to a debate today where  people who make $174,000 a year and half of which are millionaires are  telling people they should be satisfied trying to exist on $15,000 a  year, which is the very reason we are here today: to try to raise the  wage for 33 million people, a quarter of the workforce in this country.   No family in the United States can live on $7.25 an hour and make  ends meet.   In my home State of Wisconsin, you would have to work 93 hours a week  at minimum wage in order to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment, and  there is not a single county in the country where a worker earning the  minimum wage for 40 hours a week can afford a two-bedroom apartment.   I come to Congress with 3 decades as a small businessowner. Small  business owners know our workers are our customers, our neighbors, and  our community members.   When workers have more money in their pockets, they have more money  to spend to care for their families and stimulate our economy.   This is especially true in rural areas, where workers have only a  handful of employment options. If the primary employer in a rural town  is a multibillion-dollar corporation like Walmart, they can afford to  pay their workers $15 an hour instead of holding down wages for the  entire community.   Congress recently set a new record for the longest stretch in U.S.  history without a hike in the minimum wage: 10 years. It is long past  due that we show workers respect by putting more money in their pockets  and support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the United Food  and Commercial Workers.                                                            UFCW,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      To All Members of the U.S. House of Representatives.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the United Food and       Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) which       represents more than 1.3 million hard-working Americans in       food and non-food retail, pharmacy, food processing, and       manufacturing, I urge you to vote for the Raise the Wage Act       (H.R. 582) and vote against any amendments that would weaken       the bill. UFCW will be scoring this vote.        The Raise the Wage Act will raise the federal minimum wage       from $7.25 to $8.55 this year and gradually increase it over       the next five years until it reaches $15 an hour in 2024.       After 2024, the minimum wage will be indexed so that it       continues to rise along with a typical workers wage. The       Raise the Wage Act will also end unfair exclusions for tipped       workers, people with disabilities, and youth so that they,       too, can benefit from a decent minimum wage.        Raising the minimum wage will be good for the economy and       stimulate consumer spending. Today's low-wage workers earn       less per hour than their counterparts did 50 years ago but       productivity has nearly doubled in that time. If the minimum       wage had been raised at the same pace as productivity growth,       it would be over $20 an hour today. Increasing the minimum       wage would generate $144 billion in additional wages and most       of those extra earnings would be spent in grocery stores and       other main street businesses because lower-paid workers spend       a greater proportion of their earnings.        The Raise the Wage Act would deliver long-overdue raises to       a large segment of the workforce. Gradually raising the       federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would lift pay for nearly       40 million workers--26.6 percent of the U.S. workforce. A $15       minimum wage would begin to reverse decades of pay inequality       between the lowest-paid workers and the middle class.        Raising the minimum wage would significantly benefit       workers of color and women. Nearly two-fifths (38 percent) of       African Americans and one-third (33 percent) of Latinos would       get a raise and 56 percent of women workers would benefit.        Across the country, there is overwhelming momentum in favor       of raising wages for our nation's lowest-wage workers. Since       2014, twenty-one states, plus D.C., have approved minimum       wage increases. California, Massachusetts, New York, and the       District of Columbia have approved raising their minimum       wages to $15 an hour and Washington, Oregon, Colorado,       Arizona, Missouri, Michigan, and Maine have approved minimum       wages ranging from $12 to $14.75 an hour.  [[Page H7105]]         UFCW opposes a regional minimum wage. Regional minimum       wages bake-in low wages to already low-wage places. Rural       counties and Southern cities where wages have been depressed       for a variety of social, political, and economic reasons       would effectively have their low-wage status locked in. The       power of the minimum wage to boost worker incomes, and thus       consumer buying power, would be legislatively kneecapped for       the areas that could most use a boost in local consumer       demand.        Raising the minimum wage is long overdue. I call on every       member of Congress to vote for the Raise the Wage Act and       enact this import piece of legislation as quickly as       possible.            Sincerely,                                                Ademola Oyefeso,                             International Vice President, Director,                       Legislative and Political Action Department.
