 Mr. President, the Senate is getting started on  another busy week in which we will complete more important business for  the American people. We will confirm a number of well-qualified  nominees, as well as a number of treaties that pertain to international  commerce and keeping our economy strong.   First, the nominations. Later this afternoon, we will build on 2\1/2\  years of confirming talented, capable jurists to our Federal courts and  vote to advance the nomination of Judge Peter Phipps for the Third  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Judge Phipps is a graduate of the University of Dayton and Stanford  Law School. His impressive professional record includes time in private  practice, a clerkship on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and 15  years of decorated service with the Department of Justice.   At DOJ, while handling sensitive and high-profile cases in the  Federal Programs Branch, Judge Phipps left a lasting impression on  colleagues and opposing counsel alike. Litigators who worked both with  him and against him have written to the Senate to praise his ``piercing  intellect, deep knowledge of the law . . . and personable relations  with everyone in the courtroom.''   A number of his former DOJ colleagues attest that his ``ability to  master complex issues quickly made him the sort of lawyer other lawyers  would turn to with questions or for counsel.''   Listen to this. Leon Panetta, the former Secretary of Defense to  President Obama, has worked with Judge Phipps in the past and has great  things to say about his ``legal acumen, dedication, attention to  detail, and integrity.'' He says: ``I believe that Peter will serve  with honor and highly recommend his confirmation.'' That is President  Obama's Secretary of Defense.   Given all this, it is hardly surprising that when Judge Phipps was  first nominated to serve as district judge for the Western District of  Pennsylvania, the Senate confirmed him on a voice vote. This body saw  what everybody else had seen--an impressively qualified, intellectually  excellent individual who firmly understands what the job of a judge  does and does not entail in our constitutional system.   So I am sorry that this nominee who earned a voice vote to his  current position will now require a cloture vote this afternoon, but,  nevertheless, I look forward to voting to advance his nomination today  and voting to confirm him later in the week. I urge our colleagues to  join me.   Following that nomination, the Senate will tend to another of this  body's unique responsibilities--the ratification of treaties. For the  better part of the last century, the United States has engaged in  bilateral tax treaties with foreign trading partners. These measures  cultivate robust trading relationships and put in place important  clarifications to ensure that American businesses can avoid double tax  burdens.   Today, America is engaged in about 60 such treaties with major allies  and developing partners alike. Together, they account for literally  trillions of dollars in foreign investment across our country.   This week, there are several more awaiting consideration. The Senate  needs to act on treaties with Spain, the Swiss Federation, Japan, and  Luxembourg. I have heard from job creators  [[Page S4814]]  in my State of Kentucky about the importance of creating more certainty  by getting these treaties approved, and I expect my colleagues have  heard similar things from employers in their States as well. So these  measures should be taken up and ratified without delay.   On behalf of American workers and entrepreneurs, I hope each of our  colleagues will join me in voting yes this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, earlier this year, Hart County in my  home State began a yearlong celebration of its bicentennial  anniversary. This southcentral county is the proud home to an abundance  of Kentucky history and culture. As they mark this impressive  milestone, the people of Hart County, KY, are also ready to lead our  Commonwealth toward its bright future.   The county was established in 1819 and named for a brave Kentuckian,  [[Page S4817]]  Captain Nathaniel Gray Smith Hart. A brother-in-law of Henry Clay and a  Lexington lawyer, Hart bravely served the young Nation in the War of  1812, when he was captured and killed at the Battle of the River Raisin  in the Michigan Territory.   Its local history is deeply intertwined with the geography. Early  settlers planted roots near present-day Horse Cave because of the  fertile soil. Like many Kentucky communities, the economic success of  burley tobacco drove the local economy, putting food on family tables  and shoes on children's feet. The Green River opened access routes for  commerce throughout the country, and the establishment of the Mammoth  Cave National Park, the world's longest known cave system, has made  Hart County a destination for tourism.   The strategic construction of Louisville & Nashville Railroad through  both Horse Cave and the county seat of Munfordville in 1859 brought new  waves of economic growth. However, at the outbreak of the American  Civil War, the railroad's location also made it a target. Segments of  the track were attacked by both Union and Confederate troops, and the  county was the site of three battles. It is also the home of two Civil  War generals, Thomas J. Wood fighting for the Union and future Kentucky  Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for the Confederacy. Each September, the  community remembers its place in this chapter of American history  during the Hart County Civil War Days.   Through the years, Hart County has continued to prosper. The building  of I-65 through the county has bolstered the area's growth and opened  new opportunities for tourism and economic activity. Local leaders are  especially proud of the recent expansion of Sister Schubert's famous  bakery and the opening of the Green River College and Career Academy.  The county's best days are still ahead.   With a rich heritage and a promising future, Hart County certainly  has a lot to celebrate. Along with the families and leaders of the  county like Judge Executive Joe Choate, it is my privilege to mark this  great occasion. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in celebrating  200 years of historic achievement in Hart County.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to join my fellow  Kentuckians in Simpson County as they celebrate their bicentennial  anniversary. Along our Commonwealth's southern border with Tennessee,  Simpson County is home to two centuries of rich history and cultural  heritage. Today, I would like to mark this impressive milestone.   The county was named in tribute to a brave Kentuckian who made the  ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation in the Battle of the River  Raisin during the War of 1812, Captain John Simpson. A prominent  Kentucky lawyer and state legislator, Simpson served as the speaker of  Kentucky's House of Representatives in 1810 and 1811. The following  year, Simpson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, but  postponed taking his seat to join the Army, where he was killed serving  our young Nation.   The county's rich history and fertile land has helped grow a strong  agricultural tradition, with tobacco, corn, and hay planted in the  soil. Interestingly, Simpson County was also known as a popular dueling  ground in its earliest days. The county's proximity to the state line  apparently drew a number of prominent individuals for these so-called  affairs of honor. Even Sam Houston, the future President of the  Republic of Texas and U.S. Senator, is said to have fought and won a  duel there in 1826.   As with many communities throughout Kentucky, Simpson County  residents were sharply divided during the American Civil War. Residents  served on both sides of the conflict, and troops skirmished in the area  following attacks on two trains on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad  lines in 1863. The war left a long-lasting impact on Simpson County's  economy and post-war recovery.   For many years, residents thrived from a primarily agricultural  economy. In fact, Simpson County was known as one of the largest mule  markets in the world. Midway through the 20th century, local leaders  sought to expand the county's economy with the help of the completion  of I-65, which runs through Franklin, the county seat and its largest  city. That growth continues to this day.   Residents have planned a year full of festive events for Simpson  County's bicentennial year. In remembering their proud history, they  will also celebrate the community's great potential ahead. With the  leadership of Judge Executive Mason Barnes and other dedicated  Kentuckians, this vibrant community will continue to succeed in our  Commonwealth. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in marking 200  years of Simpson County heritage and wishing them well for many more  prosperous years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 16; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the Phipps nomination. Finally, I  ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2 p.m. to allow for  the weekly conference meetings. I further ask that notwithstanding  provisions of rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Phipps nomination  expire at 3 p.m. tomorrow; and, finally, that if confirmed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:16 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 16, 2019, at 10 a.m.  [[Page S4827]]                                ____________________
