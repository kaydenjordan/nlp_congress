 Madam President, I am so excited. This is perhaps the  highlight of this long and painful and tortuous night.   Again, if it wasn't complete abdication of Senate procedures and  esteem, I would walk over there and hug my colleague from Alabama.   And I will tell you right now--thank God--because there are some  people who have said that there are Members of this deliberative body  that want to defund the police, to my horror. And now this Member has  given us the gift that finally--once and for all--we can put to bed  this scurrilous accusation that somebody in this great, esteemed body  would want to defund the police.   So let's all of us--100 people--not walk but sashay down there and  vote for this amendment and put to rest the lies. I am sure I will see  no political ads attacking anybody here over ``defund the police.''   And I would ask unanimous consent to add something else to this  obvious bill. Can we add also that every Senator here wants to fund the  police, believes in God, country, and apple pie. Thank you.   (Applause.)    Voice vote. Voice vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3113
