 Mr. Speaker, 20 million people in South Sudan, Somalia,  Yemen, and Nigeria are on the brink of famine. We saw this coming. The  warning signs were there long before January of this year.   I am so proud that Republicans and Democrats joined together to  include an additional $1 billion in the FY 2017 omnibus bill to address  these famines.   Our citizens and our farmers have always been generous in times of  such grave need. They know that we have to protect children from hunger  and the  [[Page H4433]]  violence of war. They know that we need to support diplomacy and  development to avoid future catastrophes.   Our united effort must continue in FY 2018, but the President's  budget eliminates the Food for Peace and the McGovern-Dole programs,  and reduces funding for disaster assistance. I only hope President  Trump and Secretary Tillerson will come to their senses. We must not  stand by and watch millions of children and families literally starve  to death. We must act, and we must lead.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin as well and echo what Mr. Woodall said in  praising Brian Cooper for his many decades of service to this body. We  appreciate all of his years of service. We appreciate all of the years  he drove back and forth to work from Baltimore. And we appreciate the  incredible patience that he has demonstrated over the years by having  to listen to us time and time again.    One of the great joys of serving in this body is that you meet some  remarkable people. Brian Cooper is certainly a remarkable person, and  he will be missed. And I think on behalf of everybody here, we want to  say: thank you.   Mr. Speaker, let me rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the  underlying legislation.   My colleague, Mr. Woodall, just referenced all of the times we passed  it, it went over to the Senate, and it didn't go anywhere. Maybe we  should take a hint from the Senate that it is not a good bill and we  ought to kind of reconsider some of the aspects of this bill.   But here we are again on the House floor with yet another regulatory  rollback. It is shameful that the leadership of this House continues to  waste precious time on bills that seem to address the concerns of Big  Industry over the needs of our constituents, especially as we have so  much that needs to be accomplished.   By the way, whatever happened to regular order? Do you remember when  committees held hearings and markups?   The Agriculture Committee, on which I serve, did not hold a hearing.  It held a markup, but it did not hold a hearing. And the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, the committee with primary jurisdiction  over this bill, held no hearing and did no markup.   And let's talk about amendments. The majority made in order less than  half of the amendments submitted--two amendments--but they blocked  through completely germane amendments. Members jumped through all of  the hoops, they dotted all of the Is, and they crossed all of the Ts.  These were properly drafted amendments, and they were blocked because  the Republican majority was afraid to vote on them.   Now, what were these amendments?   Well, an amendment to prohibit the discharge of toxics in such  circumstances where they would be harmful to pregnant women or harm  fetal or early childhood development. The amendment protects pregnant  women and children. Blocked.   An amendment to create an exception for communities that use a source  of drinking water where a Federal or State emergency declaration has  been issued due to a threat to public health, such as heightened  exposure to an identified contaminant. Blocked.   An amendment to ensure existing Clean Water Act protections apply to  waters that a State has already determined are polluted by pesticides.  Blocked.   They were blocked because they would have passed.   Why are my colleagues afraid of protecting pregnant women, and  ensuring clean drinking water?   That is what these amendments were about. They were germane. The only  reason why they are not in order is because you chose to block them in  the Rules Committee.   I would say to my Republican friends: You are not running this  institution. You are ruining this institution. This is supposed to be a  deliberative body. Let's start acting like it. And that means bringing  germane amendments to the floor, letting us have a debate, letting  Republicans and  [[Page H4435]]  Democrats debate, and then vote on those amendments.   There is not a single reason at all other than the fact that the  Republican leadership did not want these amendments to pass that they  were not made in order. That is not the way this place is supposed to  work.   And speaking of a bad process, late last week, Billy House at  Bloomberg News broke the news that the House may need to vote again on  this devastating TrumpCare bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article by Billy House.                   [From www.bloomberg.com, May 18, 2017]         House May Need To Vote Again on GOP Obamacare Repeal Bill                              (By Billy House)         House Republicans barely managed to pass their Obamacare       repeal bill earlier this month, and they now face the       possibility of having to vote again on their controversial       health measure.        House Speaker Paul Ryan hasn't yet sent the bill to the       Senate because there's a chance that parts of it may need to       be redone, depending on how the Congressional Budget Office       estimates its effects. House leaders want to make sure the       bill conforms with Senate rules for reconciliation, a       mechanism that allows Senate Republicans to pass the bill       with a simple majority.        Republicans had rushed to vote on the health bill so the       Senate could get a quick start on it, even before the CBO had       finished analyzing a series of last-minute changes. The CBO       is expected to release an updated estimate next week.        ``Unaware,'' said Representative Jeff Denham of California,       with noticeable surprise Thursday, when advised that his       party leaders still hadn't sent the bill over to the Senate.       Denham was one of the House Republicans who ended up voting       for the measure, after earlier in the week opposing it.        ``I am on the whip team and we have a lot of conversations,       but we have not had that one. So I am going to look into       it,'' said Denham, a member of the party's vote-counting       team.                             Downplaying Concern         One senior GOP aide downplayed any concern over the       potential trouble from the CBO report, depicting it as       hypothetical, and saying that leaders will cross that bridge       if they need to.        According to several aides and other procedural experts, if       Republicans send the bill to the Senate now and the CBO later       concludes it doesn't save at least $2 billion, it would doom       the bill and Republicans would have to start their repeal       effort all over with a new budget resolution. Congressional       rules would likely prevent Republicans from fixing the bill       after it's in the Senate, the aides said.        In the Senate, the bill must hit separate $1 billion       deficit reduction targets in the jurisdiction of the Finance       Committee and the chamber's health committee. Republican       aides said failing to meet those numbers would force the       House to fix the bill even if the legislation meets the       overall cost-savings target.        If Republican leaders hold onto the bill until the CBO       report is released, then Ryan and his team could still redo       it if necessary. That would require at least one more House       vote of some sort.        Ryan told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday       that he doesn't think the House will need to vote again on       the health law. ``We just want to, out of an abundance of       caution, wait to send the bill over to the Senate when we get       the final score,'' Ryan said.        That vote could be cloaked in some kind of arcane       procedural move, but it would still be depicted as a proxy       for yet another vote on the same bill--and reluctant       Republicans will once again be forced to decide whether to       back it. Only this time, they would also be saddled with the       CBO's latest findings about the bill's costs and impacts.        Republicans had a sizable deficit reduction cushion--$150       billion--before several amendments were added to the bill at       the last minute, including changes allowing states to       legalize much skimpier health insurance plans.                              Budget Assumptions         It's unclear what assumptions the CBO will make about what       states will do with that newly created flexibility. If       millions of people sign up for much cheaper, minimal       insurance, that could trigger billions--and potentially even       hundreds of billions--in costs over a decade because of the       House bill's health insurance tax credits.        ``We've got to wait for the CBO score,'' said Greg Walden       of Oregon, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce       Committee, which authored much of the bill. ``To prove that       you meet the reconciliation test.''        But other senior Republicans weren't aware that leaders had       been holding onto the bill.        ``I had no idea,'' Dennis Ross of Florida, another member       of the vote-counting team, said Thursday, adding that the       prospect of another vote ``does concern me.''        GOP leaders never said publicly they were planning to hold       on to the bill for two weeks or longer.                             Democrats' Criticism         ``Every school child knows that when you pass a bill in the       House, you send it to the Senate,'' said Louise Slaughter,       the ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee. ``You       don't hide it in a drawer somewhere for two weeks, while you       wait for information that you should have had before you       passed it.''        The speaker and other Republicans urgently pushed their May       4 floor vote, despite a polarized Republican conference,       using the frantic final hours to win over holdouts. Even so,       20 Republicans still voted against the bill. After the bill       squeaked through, Ryan and other senior Republicans dashed to       the White House for an unusual celebration of a one-chamber       vote.     Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure everyone understands  that. We thought we were through with it here in the House, but we may  not be. After Republicans used emergency procedures on more than one  occasion to rush their bill through the House of Representatives, we  found out that Republican leaders had yet to send a bill over to the  Senate for its consideration. Instead, they have been hiding the bill  for nearly 3 weeks.   What happened to the urgency that my colleagues were talking about a  few weeks ago?   We heard from our Republican friends that the sky would fall if we  didn't act upon TrumpCare immediately. It had to be done right then and  there. We couldn't slow down long enough to hear from the nonpartisan  experts at the Congressional Budget Office. We couldn't slow down  enough so that people could actually read what was in the bill. We  couldn't slow down enough to do hearings or to get estimates on how  this massive bill would impact the healthcare of millions of Americans.   I think it has become clear to all of us, Mr. Speaker, that the only  reason to rush through this process was to trick their own Members into  voting for this disastrous bill. It was to keep their Members from  seeing the CBO score before they voted for the bill, because if they  had seen it, many of them may not have voted for it. Republican  leadership couldn't risk transparency, and they wouldn't let the facts  get in the way of passing TrumpCare.   We expect CBO to release their final analysis tomorrow. Finally, we  will know how many millions of Americans will be kicked off of their  healthcare because of these reckless and heartless Republican policies.  We will find out how devastating this bill will be for millions of  Americans with preexisting conditions. And we will finally learn just  how big that tax cut for wealthy Americans is going to be.   I guess my question to Republican leaders of this House is: What was  the rush? If you were going to have to hold up the bill over here until  the CBO score was released anyway, why couldn't we just have waited to  receive this very important information before we asked the House to  vote on this terrible bill?   Oh, wait. I know why the Republican leadership needed to move  TrumpCare so fast, so that the bill's namesake--President Trump--didn't  throw a temper tantrum. That is what this was all about. So he wouldn't  call them out in one of his infamous Twitter rants.                                time  1245    But it wasn't about good legislating. It was a lousy process  basically designed to prematurely shove a bill through that is bad for  Americans, all for some headline or temporary political gain.   Now, if you have been watching the news lately, you will notice that  our 45th President hasn't been generating the best headlines, what with  ``this Russia thing''--those are his words--constant leaks of  information from his staff to the press, never mind the President's  leaking of sensitive classified information on national security  matters.   President Trump needed a win for himself, even if it is a loss for  the American people. As we all know, it is all about him.   Now, I remind my Republican colleagues that they work for the  American people, that the ultimate boss for all of us is our  constituents, not the President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has made a habit of completely  skirting regular order and rushing through legislation crafted behind  closed doors with no opportunity for meaningful debate and  consideration, and this TrumpCare bill is a prime example.  [[Page H4436]]    We had emergency meetings, backroom deals, and fixes to the fixes to  the fixes, and what we were left with is a lousy product that we may  have to consider again. My Republican colleagues should be ashamed of  themselves.   Process matters. We are on the Rules Committee. If you don't believe  process matters, you ought to get on a different committee. It matters  for the integrity of this institution, and it matters if we are to  prevent lousy legislation.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say a few words about the Trump budget  that was just released this morning.   We are still digging through the text and combing through the  details, but from what we have already seen, it is devastating. Reports  indicate that this budget makes the deepest cuts to Federal programs  that help the most vulnerable, the poorest of the poor. Mr. Speaker,  that is nothing to be proud of.   At a time when our crumbling infrastructure needs repair, our kids  need access to affordable education, and our workers need training to  move into high-tech jobs, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on  these critical investments that will move our country forward. But this  budget plan does just that.   Since we are on the floor to talk about an antienvironment bill  today, I should note that the Environmental Protection Agency is among  the agencies hardest hit by President Trump's ruthless proposal.  Through massive cuts to the EPA, the Trump administration is paving the  way toward dirtier air and more polluted water. But my Republican  colleagues don't seem to be too concerned with that. They have been  proposing cuts to EPA for years and years and years.   Mr. Speaker, of all the rotten provisions tucked into this document-- and I could go on and on and on--I find the most troubling to be the  radical assault on people living in poverty.   You know, it is easy to sit in an office at OMB and concoct plans to  throw people off of SNAP and off of Medicaid and kick them out of their  housing. This plan does just that. By any reading, by any measure, that  is what it does. We are reading about a $274 billion cut to our safety  net, on top of the over $800 billion cut to Medicaid included in the  TrumpCare bill.   These are real people, Mr. Speaker. They are our constituents. They  are our neighbors and our friends. Our kids go to school together.   But given some of the proposals I have seen from this majority party,  I have to wonder whether some of my colleagues might never have talked  with anyone living in poverty. I would say to them, life is very  different when you leave your country club. Life is very different. It  is very hard for people struggling in poverty. Being poor in this  country is hard work, and you ought to know that by now.   My Republican colleagues have made a habit of belittling the poor  instead of trying to understand their struggles. They work hard, Mr.  Speaker--often at more than one job--to put food on the table for their  kids and to find a roof over their heads. They are exhausted from work  and from worry.   We see them every day, serving tables, washing dishes, hauling away  trash, cleaning offices, mowing lawns, stacking heavy loads, taking  care of people's children, comforting the sick. Theirs are the faces in  the bus windows going home from work at 2 in the morning. Theirs are  the faces arriving at work at 5 in the morning the next day. They  deserve our respect, not the disdain shown to them and to their  families in this disgraceful budget.   I would like to remind my colleagues that poverty and hunger in rural  areas is often as bad as, and sometimes even worse than, in cities. So  I find it highly offensive that this budget slashes our safety net for  the very people that President Trump promised to protect, the very  people who put President Trump in office.   You know, I heard some of the rationale for this budget from the  White House, saying: Well, you know, people who are on SNAP ought to  work.   Well, let me just say for the Record so it is clear to everybody here  that the majority of people on SNAP are children, are senior citizens,  are people who are disabled. Of those who can work, a majority of them  work. They work, but they earn so little that they are still stuck in  poverty.   Why aren't we having a debate about increasing wages in this country?  Why is the debate focused on how we make the lives of those in poverty  even more miserable?   You know, budgets are moral documents, and this is the most  heartless, reckless, and damaging plan I have ever seen. It is immoral.   The President's Budget Director talked yesterday about compassion for  taxpayers and for Trump supporters. Well, give me a break. You know, I  would tell Mr. Mulvaney I don't think that word means what he think it  means.   Compassion, that is feeding starving children, helping a father get  back on his feet after a job loss, helping a mother get back on her  feet after a job loss, cleaning up poisoned water, ensuring everyone  has a chance at living a healthy life regardless of how much money they  have. That is compassion, not turning our backs on these people.   Tax cuts for the wealthiest among us at the expense of the public  safety net is cruel. It is coldhearted and, Mr. Speaker, I am sick of  it. I assure you that is not compassionate.   So I hope my Republican colleagues will have the courage to stand up  against this administration and do what is right for the American  people.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Throughout his campaign, President Trump made promises that he would  not cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. Now we have come to  find out that he has broken every one of those promises.   The Trump budget includes more than $800 billion in Medicaid cuts in  the GOP healthcare bill and then adds additional cuts on top of that,  with total Medicaid cuts of over $1 trillion over the next 10 years.   Furthermore, the Trump budget guts Social Security disability  insurance which, as of 2015, covered 10 million recipients.   The Trump budget also slashes funding for SNAP, our Nation's first  line of defense against hunger, by $193 billion. That is a 25 percent  cut. SNAP is the program that provides people food. That's it--food.   We have 42 million people in this country who are food insecure--42  million. We should all be ashamed of that. And the answer is to cut  SNAP by 25 percent?   Oh, and by the way, the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per  meal.   And let's not forget that the Republicans' healthcare disaster takes  $75 billion out of the Medicare trust fund, shortening the life of the  trust fund.    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    If the gentleman wants to yield me some of his time, I  am more than happy to go on for as long as you would like.    So, Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing that, instead of  protecting our most vulnerable, President Trump and the House  Republicans continually insist on tax breaks for big corporations and  the wealthiest Americans.   Mr. Speaker, we need to hold President Trump to his word. Therefore,  I am asking that we defeat the previous question. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would  change the rules of the House to prevent any legislation from being  considered if it would result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits  under the Social Security Act, if it would increase either the early or  full retirement age to receive Social Security benefits.  [[Page H4437]]    This would prevent any legislation from being considered if it would  privatize Social Security. We would prevent any legislation from being  considered that would result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for  individuals entitled to or enrolled for benefits under Medicare or  result in a reduction of benefits or eligibility for individuals  enrolled in or eligible to receive medical assistance through a State  Medicaid plan or waiver.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I would just simply say to my colleagues  that I urge everybody in this House to remember why we came to Congress  and who sent us here. Our primary obligation is to the people of this  country, and they did not send us here to make their lives more  miserable.   When you look at the priorities in the President's budget, when you  look at the impact that the healthcare bill, the TrumpCare bill that  the House of Representatives passed, when you look at the impact it is  going to have on tens of millions of Americans in this country, these  bills will devastate people.   So we need to get back to what is important. It is not about propping  up the President during his difficulties. It is not about playing to  the cheap seats at the Heritage Foundation or some other rightwing  think tank. Our primary obligation is to people of the United States.  This budget and the priorities of this Republican majority and the  priorities of this President undercut the security and the economic  well-being of every single person in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to defeat the  previous question and a ``no'' vote on the rule.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman that a  number of amendments that are germane were offered in the Rules  Committee to protect the health and safety of women and children, and  they were not made in order. So amendments were offered and they were  blocked. I just point that out for the Record.    Will the gentleman yield?    I would just say that the bill has changed over the  years, and I voted against it in committee.   I guess the question is: If we are all in agreement that we want to  protect women and children, what was the harm in making in order an  amendment that would have done that?   It was perfectly germane, and the Rules Committee decided not to make  it in order. I think that is a question that the gentleman hasn't  answered.   I appreciate that all the people on the Agriculture Committee are  experts, but you know what?   There are other people who know a lot about science, pesticides, and  agriculture who were not on the committee. And just because a committee  takes action--I mean, if that is the new rule now: if you are on the  committee, you can't offer amendments. Well, that is an unfortunate new  approach that the Republicans are taking.    Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Again, hearing the gentleman say that we all want to  protect the lives of pregnant women and children, I just want to ask as  an inquiry: Is the amendment by Eddie Bernice Johnson that prohibits  the discharge of toxins in such circumstances where they would be  harmful to pregnant women, or could harm fetal, or early childhood  development, which is perfectly germane, is that made in order? Is that  part of the rule?    Well, I don't think it is. I would just simply say to  the gentleman, if he wants more cooperation, then maybe we ought to  open the process up, and actually listen to what the Democrats have to  say too.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
