 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill that sends  a clear signal about United States policy with respect to  discrimination, especially violent, murderous discrimination against a  whole class of people because of their ethnicity and/or religion.   But the significance of this bill is much more profound; it moves us  forward in terms of our self-definition as Americans.   Our history is pockmarked with violent discrimination against groups  that ``got in the way.'' Groups that challenged us to improve on the  prevailing self-definition at the time.   From Native Americans who were dehumanized, Chinese Americans denied  citizenship and naturalization as a group in our immigration laws,  African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Irish-Catholics discriminated  against by Abolitionists.   The intent of this bill goes to our self-definition as a nation,  something every generation must revisit.   By enshrining this in our State Department as a priority policy, that  will be propounded with other nations, we make ourselves better too. We  live up to our ideals as a people.   I hope we rise above the partisan temptations to score points at the  expense of a whole class of people, at the expense of people all around  the world who we have never met but count on us to do the right thing  on their behalf.   This bill is important for those people who can't find their own  voice, because they have been denied it, but let's use ours on their  behalf. It will save lives and it will improve our own sense of  identity, who we are, what it means to be American.
