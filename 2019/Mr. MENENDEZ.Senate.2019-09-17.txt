 Madam President, I rise today to once again call for  this body to act on commonsense gun safety legislation. Time and again  we have witnessed unfathomable carnage at the hands of assault-style  rifles and high-capacity magazines. It is a horror movie we have seen  over and over.   As parents bury children, as infants lose parents, as America grieves  the senseless loss of life, the NRA just tightens its grip on the  President and the majority leader.   I am heartened by the grassroots movement that has grown across our  Nation in recent years, and, likewise, I am encouraged by the many  polls indicating that Americans overwhelmingly want action.   Americans are tired of having their voices drowned out by the NRA.  They are tired of a Congress that fears NRA attack ads more than the  next mass shooting, and they are tired of being told time and again  that this is a mental health problem or a violent video game problem  when we know it is a gun problem. It is time for real action in the  Senate.   Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed universal  background checks for every gun sale--the kind of measure that would  have stopped the shooter in Midland, TX, from bypassing a criminal  background check if it had been a law.   Just last week, the House Judiciary Committee passed the Keep  Americans Safe Act, my legislation to limit the sale of ammunition to  no more than 10 rounds. We know that a magazine that holds 30 or 60 or  even 100 rounds of ammunition, like the Dayton shooter's did, is not  for hunting or self-defense or protecting your home. High-capacity  magazines are designed for one thing, and that is high-capacity  killing.   It is true that no single law is going to prevent all gun deaths. It  is also true that we can prevent some gun deaths, and reducing magazine  size is a proven way to do so.   What will it take for the majority leader to take action? I am not  the only one asking this question. Indeed, on September 3, the  Washington Post published an editorial calling on the majority leader  to act. They asked: ``Would any volume of bloodshed convince the  Kentucky Republican that Congress faces a moral imperative to act?''   Alongside their call for action, the Post also published a staggering  list of names--names of fellow Americans who have lost their lives in  mass shootings, many involving high-capacity ammunition. I will read as  many of these names as I can in my allotted time today: Cassie Bernall,  Steven Curnow, Corey DePooter, Kelly Fleming, Matthew Kechter, Daniel  Mauser, Daniel Rohrbough, William ``Dave'' Sanders, Rachel Scott,  Isaiah Shoels, John Tomlin, Lauren Townsend, Kyle Velasquez, Jennifer  Bragg Capobianco, Janice Hagerty, Louis ``Sandy'' Javelle, Rose  Manfredi, Paul Marceau, Cheryl Troy, Craig Wood, Derrick Brun, Dewayne  Lewis, Chase Lussier, Daryl Lussier, Neva Rogers, Chanelle Rosebear,  Michelle Sigana, Thurlene Stillday, Alicia White, Naomi Ebersol, Marian  Stoltzfus Fisher, Lena Zook Miller, Mary Liz Miller, Anna Mae  Stoltzfus, Ross Abdallah Alameddine, Christopher James Bishop, Brian  Bluhm, Ryan Clark, Austin Cloyd, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, Daniel Perez  Cueva, Kevin Granata, Matthew G.

My time is almost up, but I haven't even reached the names of those  who died after Newtown nearly 7 years ago.   I will close with one last point. It is heartbreaking to know that  some of the people on this list might be alive today if we only had the  courage to pass the Keep Americans Safe Act or to establish universal  background checks or a new assault weapons ban. It is just as  heartbreaking to know that more names of more sons and daughters,  mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, friends and colleagues will  end up on this list in the days ahead should the Senate continue to  fail to act. That is the truth. That is the truth.   Every day without action is another closer to America's next mass  shooting. The time to save lives is now.   I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post's entire list of  mass shooting victims be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 3, 2019]   How Many More Names Will Be Added to the List Before Mitch McConnell                               Acts on Guns?                          (By the Editorial Board)         Rodolfo Julio Arco, 57; Kameron Karltess Brown, 30; Raul       Garcia, 35; Mary Granados, 29; Joseph Griffith, 40; Leilah       Hernandez, 15; Edwin Peregrino, 25.        Add those seven individuals, randomly slaughtered Saturday       by a shooter in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa,       to the toll of those lost to America's gun insanity. And then       pose this question:        What if there was a mass shooting in the United States not       once or twice or four or six times monthly, but every single       day, a big one, the kind that electrifies social media and       squats for days on Page 1--would that be enough to move       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from his insistent       inertia on gun safety? Would any volume of bloodshed convince       the Kentucky Republican that Congress faces a moral       imperative to act? Thirty-eight people were slain in three       such shootings in August--in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, as       well as West Texas--and still Senate Republicans and       President Trump refuse to act.        The list below, far from comprehensive, is tragic, in part,       because it is so far from inevitable. No, no single law would       end gun violence. But there are reasonable, obvious measures       that would help.        For example: Ban the sale of military-grade assault       weapons. Unneeded by civilians, they are a blight on the       nation, their ready availability a national disgrace.       Eliminating them would slow the growth of this list. It would       save lives.
