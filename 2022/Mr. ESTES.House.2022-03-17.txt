 Madam Speaker, the United States is the greatest market in  the world to do business with. Our consumer spending is double that of  the European Union, and more than triple that of China. Every country  on Earth wants to do business with America.   As we deal with the unjust invasion of Ukraine by Russia and continue  to modernize our Nation's trade deals, like we did with the USMCA, we  must keep in mind that the American marketplace is not something that  is a right. It is a privilege for those that uphold international  order.   For far too long, many have overlooked repeated abuses by certain  trading partners. For whatever reason, they decided it was okay for the  United States to do business with those that lie, cheat, and steal in  violation of international law.   This has been a terrible mistake. Trade, when done right, is a  critical boost to the economy and our families. When done poorly, it  enriches our adversaries at the expense of those who do uphold the  international system.   It is clear that the unjust invasion of Ukraine by Russia cannot  stand. Congress must make clear to the world that normal trade  relations with the United States must be reserved for honest brokers  that adhere to international order. This is the moment when  irresponsible trade with the United States without consequence comes to  an end.
