 Madam Speaker, the New Jersey Fringe Festival is hosted  by the local Eagle Theater in Hammonton in southern New Jersey.   The festival is a driver in the cultural boom taking place in this  town. The Eagle Theater is south Jersey's only year-round professional  Equity theater and is dedicated to redefining regional theater through  innovation, enlightened production techniques, and the development of  eclectic theatrics.   The Eagle Theater originally opened its doors in 1914 as a silent  movie theater and was a playhouse from 1914 until 1944. Since then, the  theater has built itself to be an award-winning, culturally diverse  epicenter boasting state-of-the-art technical equipment and hosting a  core of theming artists dedicated to experimental storytelling through  medium-advancing technology.   It enriches south Jersey culturally and creatively, and I commend  them for what they do. South Jersey is proud of them; New Jersey is  proud of them; and the United States of America is proud of them.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
