 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize our Nation's law  enforcement officers.   They serve as the human shield between peace and chaos, preserving  our way of life and upholding the rule of law.   Our police officers are the first people we call when we are in  danger. When our safety is threatened, they respond without hesitation.  Their unwavering commitment to public service and willingness to  confront the unknown is a testament to their strength and humanity.   We also must remember that our police officers are not just uniformed  personnel. They are our neighbors, our friends, our family. They share  our joys, our sorrows, our dreams, and our challenges. They deserve not  only our gratitude but also our unwavering support.   As we observe National Police Week, let's honor those dressed in blue  who put their lives on the line each and every day for us.   When we are standing united and when we support those who protect us,  we maintain peace and we maintain safety. We strengthen the bond that  makes us one Nation, indivisible.                            ____________________
