 Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I  share the passing of a great Nevadan, a dedicated advocate, and my dear  friend John Reynolds Klai II of Las Vegas. John passed away on  Saturday, September 2 with his husband Jon, loving family, and beloved  dogs Bruno and Dexter at his side. John leaves behind an incredible  legacy as an impactful community leader and champion for equality and  justice.   John was born and raised in the small town of Osnabrock, ND. His  smalltown values guided his generous spirit and deep love of community.  After taking an engineering class at the University of North Dakota's  College of Business, John realized a knack for architecture. Upon  graduating with a bachelor of architecture from North Dakota State  University, NDSU, John moved out west to Las Vegas to join Marnell  Corrao Associates. In 1995, John and his business partner Dan Juba  founded Klai Juba Architects, now Klai Juba Wald Architecture +  Interiors. Over the last 40 years, John has made significant  contributions to building Las Vegas, leading projects at Mandalay Bay  Resort and Casino, the Forum Shops at Caesars, and many local  landmarks.   Outside of his distinguished career, John devoted his time and  resources to supporting architecture programs at NDSU and the  University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV. He thoroughly enjoyed his time  serving as a volunteer adjunct faculty member in UNLV's hospitality  design graduate program. He also made regular trips back to Fargo, ND,  to teach students at NDSU. To honor John's service to the program, NDSU  awarded him with an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 2018.   John's service to his community extended beyond educating the next  generation of architects. He volunteered much of his time to many great  institutions, both in Nevada and across the country. John was heavily  involved with the LGBTQIA+ Community Center of Southern Nevada, helping  the community organization to celebrate diversity, empowering everyone  to live as their authentic selves, and supporting others through  difficult times.   John and his husband Jon Sparer, also an architect, met in Las Vegas  in 1981. They made Las Vegas their home and were married in 2014. They  shared a deep love of travel, trekking across the world and most  recently across North America in their motor coach with their puppies.  John is survived by his loving husband, his daughter and son-in-law,  two grandchildren, and many more family members and friends.   I met John over 25 years ago through our synagogue, and I will  forever cherish his unwavering friendship and support. He stood up for  what was right, fought against what was wrong, and always put others  ahead of himself. John was a beloved member of the Las Vegas community  and will be deeply missed. May his memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
