 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from New Mexico, the Honorable Melanie Ann Stansbury, be  permitted to take the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Madam Speaker, I have the distinct honor to rise today  as the dean of our delegation to introduce the newest Member of the  House of Representatives from New Mexico's First Congressional  District: Melanie Stansbury.   Melanie was born in Farmington and grew up in the North Valley and  west side of Albuquerque. She is from a hardworking family that  typifies millions of New Mexicans. Melanie's mother supported her  family as a seamstress and heavy equipment operator. Her family owned a  landscaping and irrigation business, where she worked growing up.   After graduating from Cibola High School, she attended St. Mary's  College in California and went on to graduate studies at Cornell  University. She came home and served our State as a science instructor  through the Museum of Natural History, visiting schools across the  State.   Before she was elected to office, Melanie served our Nation here in  Washington at the Office of Management and Budget, and the U.S. Senate  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.   Congresswoman Stansbury has been shown to be a dedicated public  servant, and I know she does not take her new role lightly. I pray that  God will guide her in her decisions, strengthen her during trials, and  bless all of us in public service with wisdom and grace.   Today, please help me welcome the newest Member of the House from the  Land of Enchantment, Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury.
