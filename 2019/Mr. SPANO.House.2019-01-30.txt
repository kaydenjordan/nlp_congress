 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of  school choice. Last week was National School Choice Week when  individuals from all over the country gathered to raise awareness of  different education options available to parents and their kids.  [[Page H1320]]    In my home State of Florida, we are blessed to have access to  traditional public schools, charter schools, magnet schools, private  schools, online learning, and home schooling. These diverse programs  provide kids with different opportunities to excel in the learning  environment that works best for them.   I think specifically of Hunter Frost, a young man with autism who I  have gotten to know very well. Hunter attended Pepin Academies, a  tuition-free charter school in our district that specializes in  teaching students with learning and learning-related disabilities.   Hunter thrived at Pepin Academies, graduating third in his class. He  went on to receive his associate's degree from Hillsborough Community  College with an A average and has been accepted by my alma mater, the  University of South Florida, where he plans to begin this fall.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have Hunter as an intern in my office,  and I look forward to his success and to seeing him excel in college  and beyond.                            ____________________
