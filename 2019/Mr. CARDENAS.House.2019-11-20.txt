 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the great work  of the House of Representatives. For the last 10 months in the 116th  Congress, the House of Representatives has passed 18 healthcare bills,  5 gun safety bills, 81 education bills, 47 national security and  defense bills, 45 environmental bills, 36 immigration bills, 40  infrastructure and transportation bills, and much more.   My point, Madam Speaker, is that we are continuing the work of the  American people. We never lost sight of our promise and commitment to  the people of this great country.   We are constantly fighting back the White House's attempt to take  away healthcare from millions of Americans, and we are working to lower  prescription drug costs.   We will continue supporting our military and ensure that they have  all the resources that they need to keep Americans safe.   We will not allow this President to keep us from fulfilling our duty  to make our economy stronger, our  [[Page H9066]]  schools safer, and to protect us from tyranny.                            ____________________
