 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of my colleague,  Representative Walter Jones, Jr.   For 24 years, Congressman Jones represented the people of North  Carolina's 3rd Congressional District with pride and integrity.   In his quarter century in service to our great country, Congressman  Jones was a steadfast voice and advocate for North Carolina.   He was unafraid to put people before politics. He was a dedicated  public servant.  [[Page H2350]]    And he was a principled leader.   He stood firmly for what he believed--and wasn't afraid to admit when  he made a mistake.   2 Corinthians 5:8 reminds us that `to be absent from the body is to  be present with the Lord.'   I pray that my friend has now found the peace he sought.   To his wife, Joe Anne, and his daughter, Ashley--please know that  Walter left an indelible mark upon our state and nation.   Let all Members of the estimable body learn and profit from the  example of Congressman Walter Jones, Jr.   He will be missed.                            ____________________
