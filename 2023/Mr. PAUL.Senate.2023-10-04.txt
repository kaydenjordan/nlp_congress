 Mr. President, Senator Dianne Feinstein served the State of  California in the Senate for over three decades. During that time, she  emerged as a leading figure in the fight against America's use of  torture on terrorist suspects and exposed the CIA's inappropriate  spying on Congress.   One of her legacies will be her investigation into the torture of  suspected terrorists after 9/11. She did what Congress is supposed to  do: hold the executive branch accountable to the Constitution, to our  laws, and to the American people. Her efforts culminated in a report  over 6,000 pages long documenting a plethora of disturbing  interrogation practices. When the report was released, Senator  Feinstein stated, ``I came to the conclusion that America's greatness  is being able to say we made a mistake, and we are going to correct it  and go from there.''   Although Senator Feinstein was generally an ally of the intelligence  community and the surveillance state, she declared war on the CIA and  accused the Agency of improperly accessing a Senate computer network to  tamper with her inquiry into the detention and interrogation program.   An investigation proved Senator Feinstein correct. The CIA's  Inspector General concluded that employees improperly accessed--spied-- on the Senate Intelligence Committee's network. Then-CIA Director John  Brennan, who initially declared that the CIA ``wouldn't do that'' and  called the accusation ``beyond the scope of reason,'' apologized to  Senator Feinstein for infiltrating her committee's computer network.   My colleagues would do well to emulate Senator Feinstein by demanding  an end to unconstitutional surveillance, defending the separation of  powers, and learning to adopt a healthy suspicion of the intelligence  community.                            ____________________
