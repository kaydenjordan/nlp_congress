 Madam Speaker, my district is home to Coast Guard  Station New York and is the largest Coast Guard station on the East  Coast. This legislation authorizes $1.2 million in needed repairs to  ensure their mission and day-to-day operations continue. I thank  everyone for this bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, to say that Don Young was an amazing man would be an  understatement. He was one of the first Members I met as a freshman. He  advocated to help me to get on the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure. I know how much he loved the Coast Guard. I know how  much he loved Alaska. And it is so fitting that we are naming this  legislation after him.
