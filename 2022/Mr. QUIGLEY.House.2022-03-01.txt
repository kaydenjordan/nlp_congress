 Madam Speaker, I have had the privilege of representing  Ukrainian Village in Chicago for over 10 years. In that time, we have  become friends.   From my friends, I have learned about the beauty of Ukrainian  history, culture, and the courage and strength of the Ukrainian people.  In the past days, the whole world has seen that strength and courage.   Ukraine has bravely beaten back the onslaught of premeditated  invasion by an evil autocratic leader. In response, there has been an  outpouring of support from the entire world.   But I rise today, Madam Speaker, because our thoughts and prayers are  not enough. Of course, those expressions of support matter. They  hearten a resistance that is outgunned and outnumbered, and they tell  the Kremlin that the world is watching. But when you are at war, you  need more than just thoughts and prayers.   The people of Ukraine need us to use every tool at our disposal to  help them repel Russia's invading forces. I know many Americans want  our country to stay out of this conflict. We have endured 2 years of a  pandemic that has taken thousands of lives and stretched pocketbooks to  their breaking point. No one wants a conflict that could make our lives  even more difficult.   I understand the desire to hunker down and wait for it to go away,  but the message is this: You can turn off your TV and try to ignore the  crisis, but that will not stop it from having an impact on you. While  it may seem like the battlefields are a world away, the repercussions  of this fight are on our doorstep.   The reality is that this conflict will worsen supply chain issues and  increase inflationary pressures. And anyone who believes that Putin  will not turn his attention to the rest of the world is badly mistaken.  Indeed, he already has. He is already responsible for massive  cyberattacks against the United States, and he interfered in two of our  elections.   Let's remember, two generations of Americans fought for a new world  order in which democracy prevailed over autocracy. For more than six  decades, that victory has held. Now, it is threatened by Vladimir  Putin.   We must ensure that the sacrifices of our forebears were not in vain.  Surely, other autocrats with desires to carve out expanded borders at  the expense of sovereign democracies are watching the extent of Western  resolve.   Ukrainian President Zelensky has begged the West for military aid.  The U.S. must hear these pleas.   Thankfully, the response has begun. President Biden recently  authorized an additional $350 million defense aid package for Ukraine,  bringing the total commitment of U.S. security assistance to $1 billion  this year alone. And NATO has begun to send weapons and equipment for  the first time in history.   The European Union is shipping arms to Ukraine. Germany is supplying  antitank weapons and missiles. Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands, and  others have joined.   While we are inspired by the Ukrainian military's ability to hold  firm, they need more help to keep the Russian onslaught at bay.   As co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I have spent months  calling for harsh sanctions against Russia, in addition to military aid  for Ukraine. I am relieved to see many of these sanctions being  imposed.   President Biden has led a historic response in which the West has  presented a united front on behalf of Ukraine. Every wave of sanctions  has come from a coalition of states: halting Nord Stream 2, imposing  sanctions on Putin and his allies, and kicking a number of Russian  banks out of the SWIFT system.   These are all important steps. Yet, more needs to be done.   I know some of our allies are hesitant to impose economic penalties  that may harm the Russian people. Indeed, the Russian people are not  the enemy. Like the Ukrainians, they have been dragged into this war  through no choice of their own. Unfortunately, it is clear that Putin  will not truly feel the consequences of his actions unless sanctions  impact the entire nation of  [[Page H1180]]  Russia. It is time to impose the harshest sanctions available.   Some leaders have said that we should wait to impose more. My  question to them is: If not now, when?   Ukrainians are dying in defense of their country. As we speak, their  capital is surrounded by Russian forces; 500,000 Ukrainians have  already fled their homes; soldiers have died; civilians have been  killed; children have been murdered. The time for action is now.   Madam Speaker, I have visited Ukraine many times. I have seen the  beauty of their fields, the blue of their sky. I have shaken hands with  their people, heard their praise of democracy, and stood next to their  leaders. The Ukrainian spirit I saw this weekend in rallies in Chicago  is the same Ukrainian spirit I saw in Kyiv when I visited shortly after  the Maidan.    Just 2 years ago, I met with the mayor of Kyiv right here in this  building. We shared stories about the cities we represent, Chicago and  Kyiv, sister cities. I promised during that meeting that the U.S. would  always stand with Ukraine. We must live up to that promise.   Until we do, ``Glory to Ukraine,'' ``Slava Ukraini.''                            ____________________
