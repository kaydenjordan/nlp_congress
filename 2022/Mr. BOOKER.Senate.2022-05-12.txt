 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I rise not expecting to give a speech today, but I want  to, first and foremost, recognize the Chair, who is my ``mother''  Senator, and I want to thank her for her incredible service to this  institution.   I want to thank, which I rarely do, the staff who works here and runs  the Senate every day, but I rise today to talk for a moment about  groups that we don't talk about enough on this floor. We usually talk  about everybody from law enforcement to our military, but we don't talk  about artists.   We are a nation that even from our founding during Revolutionary  times, there were extraordinary artists who expanded the moral  imagination of this country and helped us to see a nation that could be  free from British rule and domination.   In every point of American history, from protest movements to battles  for suffrage, we have had artists who have painted these pictures of an  America, a vision for what could be, but even more than that, they have  healed us during difficult times. They have pulled us together with  their inspiration. They have called out injustices. They have brought  light to the dark places of our country.   You know, Picasso talked about art being something that helps to  shake the dust off the soul of humanity, but I think it does more than  that. As an African American, I have seen art in the tradition of  healing, of providing hope, of even calling out with specificity the  instructions on how to be free.   We remember the song that Harriet Tubman pointed to:       Wade in the water, wade in the water, God is going to trouble             the water.    That is the tradition that sourced my family. From enduring the pain  of a nation that was unequal and divided, often in church with gospel  songs, there was healing; there was hope. And even the poetry in the  Harlem Renaissance spoke to an America that could possibly be if we  just never stop believing.   As the great poet Langston Hughes said:       America never was America to me,      [But] I swear this oath--      America will be!      Who made America,      Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,      Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,      Must [make] our . . . dream [live] again.      O, yes, I say it plain,      America never was America to me,      And yet I swear this oath--      America will be!    I lean on poetry and song today just to get myself up in the morning.  I have seen how artists have come to visit us here in the Capitol and  Senators from  [[Page S2471]]  all backgrounds thanking them for providing for them the soundtrack of  their lives. And God, humor, the comedians of old, I remember sneaking  into balconies--in my house--and watching over the balcony my dad,  quietly not thinking his children were listening, put on records by  Richard Pryor, whose humor helped to heal his troubled heart, make him  laugh at the absurdities of a nation that still had not fully fulfilled  itself.   And so I bring this thought and this heart to say thank you to  artists, thank you to this institution for what we did in a bipartisan  way to make sure we were funding the venues of this country, the stages  where so many artists were able to continue to work during the  pandemic. We fund the arts. It is funding that often has to be pushed  or fought for, but I say it is the funding that in many ways helps to  sustain and source the soul of a nation because without art, we would  have lost our way a long time ago.   Now, this week I had this moment where you have just got to pinch  yourself, and I know that the Presiding Officer has had this moment,  too, where you get this call from White House staff, and they say: Hey,  we have got some extra seats in the President of the United States' box  at the Kennedy Center to come see a performance by a group called  Freestyle Love Supreme.   And I said no immediately. I am so busy. I have got so much work. I  had a night that was ending relatively early. But my staff said to me,  you know, a guy, Chris Jackson--he was George Washington in  ``Hamilton''--is going to be there as well, and I had gotten to know  him because he was so generous. I saw him in ``In The Heights.'' He  invited me backstage, gave me such love. I saw him in ``Hamilton.''  Even when I had someone I was trying to date with me, he made me seem  special in her eyes. I will never forget that. He was a good wingman.   So I went to go see them perform, and I was just blown away by the  performance. I hope that while they are here, people get a chance to  go. But what blew me away was how they reaffirmed that message to me.  At a time that I am troubled with what is happening in our life, with  decisions in the Supreme Court, with challenges, with the economy, they  touched on a lot of those issues with humor and artistic genius, and I  found my spirit being lifted. I found camaraderie with strangers.   You see a whole crowd of people being pulled together around ideals  of empathy and love and affirmation of our most core, cherished values  as a nation, like freedom and protest.   I am honored that this group is visiting the U.S. Senate right now-- for many, their first time being in this sacred space, this hallowed  Hall--to get a chance to witness what we do every day.   And I just want to say thank you to them, and I want to give tribute  to all of the artists in America who do so much for the soul of this  Nation and inspire us every day not to stop believing in tomorrows that  can be better than what we have in the present.   I yield the floor.
