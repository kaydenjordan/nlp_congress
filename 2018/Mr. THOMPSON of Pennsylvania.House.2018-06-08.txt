 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, too many Americans find  themselves in dangerous and life-threatening situations as a result of  domestic violence.   Victims need access to emergency shelter, crisis counseling, and  advocacy services.   That is why I was proud to introduce H.R. 6014, the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Act of 2018, with my colleagues,  Representatives Gwen Moore, Elise Stefanik, and Lisa Blunt Rochester.   Since it was enacted in 1984, the Family Violence Prevention and  Services Act has addressed domestic violence through community-driven  solutions and a network of programs and services dedicated to  responding to domestic violence across the country.   One example is the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The hotline  operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is available in 170  languages. It provides crisis intervention, counseling,  [[Page H4984]]  and safety planning, and can directly connect calls to a seamless  referral system of more than 4,500 community programs across the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation. Domestic violence has no place in our society, and we must  stand up for victims and work to eradicate domestic violence for good.                            ____________________
