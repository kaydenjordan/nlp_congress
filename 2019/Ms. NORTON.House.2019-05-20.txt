 Mr. Speaker, women who celebrate 100 years of suffrage  this year have in common with the residents of the Nation's Capital  this: denial of equal rights in their democracy, requiring decades of  fighting.   It took 132 years since the Nation's founding for women to get the  vote.   It has taken 218 years, and still counting, for D.C. residents to  achieve statehood, which includes voting rights and all the rights that  come with equal citizenship.   We are grateful that as we move forward to a formal vote on  statehood, the House has already endorsed D.C. statehood in H.R. 1.   Today, women set the pace in our democracy, outvoting men in national  elections. D.C. residents yearn to join them in showing that those who  are denied their rights know how to use them after fighting to achieve  them.                            ____________________
