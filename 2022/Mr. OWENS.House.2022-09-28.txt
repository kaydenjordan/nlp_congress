 Mr. Speaker, on December 2, 1982, the medical team from  the University of Utah successfully implanted the first permanent  artificial heart in the world.   Forty years later, Utah remains a trailblazer in healthcare  innovation. Over the past 2 years, I had the pleasure of visiting many  Utah businesses at the forefront of the healthcare industry. Ortho  Development Corporation, Xenter, Canyon Labs, and Ultradent are among  the leading biotech firms that call Utah home.   BioHive, a collaboration of 1,100 companies representing Utah's life  science and healthcare innovative ecosystem is the driving force behind  the Beehive State's success.   Additionally, the bioscience industry in Utah supports 130,000 local  jobs, accounts for 8 percent of GDP, and produces hundreds of patents  for lifesaving medical devices.   Behind these extraordinary accomplishments are the pioneering spirit,  grit, and kindness of Utahns. I am proud to represent my State and know  that we will continue to lead the Nation.                            ____________________
