 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my hope and  expectation that the Trump administration and Congress will resolve the  few outstanding issues so that Congress can take a strong bipartisan  vote to modernize NAFTA, our outdated trade agreement with Canada and  Mexico, and replace it with USMCA, a better agreement that will benefit  America's workers, farmers, businesses, and families, while also  fortifying our relationship with our two closest neighbors.   As a member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, I believe well- negotiated trade agreements can improve our economy and our security,  but I also know poorly negotiated trade pacts can hurt America's  workers and make it harder to maintain broad-based support for the  concept of freer and fairer trade.   USMCA fixes flaws in some NAFTA chapters based on the lessons we have  learned since NAFTA was enacted in 1994. It also adds new chapters to  reflect the reality that the world has undergone major changes in the  last 25 years.   I support the deliberative and productive negotiations taking place  between the administration and House Democrats. I think both sides are  working in good faith with the shared goal of getting the best possible  agreement over the finish line. Each side realizes inaction is not an  option because NAFTA must be revised.   I also support bipartisan and bicameral efforts by the Florida  delegation to protect our farmers who grow seasonal produce from unfair  competition.   When it comes to USMCA, it is important we move swiftly and with a  sense of urgency, but it is just as important that we get this right.                            ____________________
