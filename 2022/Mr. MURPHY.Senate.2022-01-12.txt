 Mr. President, I wish it were the case that everyone  agrees that what happened here on January 6 was an abomination, but  that is simply not true. That is simply not true. Many of my Republican  colleagues will say the right things on the Senate floor--occasionally  will whisper the right things to us when the cameras aren't watching.  But a recent poll--a nonpartisan Monmouth University poll--asked  Republican voters whether or not they thought January 6 was a  legitimate protest. And guess what. Half of Republican voters in this  country say that the invasion of this Capitol that involved chants for  the death of the Vice President, a gallows outside the U.S. Capitol-- half of Republicans believe that that was a legitimate protest. Seven  out of ten Republicans today don't believe that Joe Biden is the  legitimate President. They believe that Donald Trump won the election,  despite the fact that he lost by 7 million votes.   And the reason for that is mostly that the leader of the Republican  Party, Donald Trump, has been legitimizing violence, urged those  protests and that insurrection attempt, cheered them at the end of the  day on January 6, and also because we have seen mostly silence from  mainstream Republicans who know better but don't want to pick a fight  with President Trump.   So, yes, we are worried about the future of our Republic. We are  worried about the future of our Republic because a mainstream political  party has gotten behind the idea that power matters more than  elections; that violence is a legitimate means of protest.   So this idea that everybody agrees that January 6 was an abomination  just isn't true. It is not true, and that is, in part, why we are so  worried.
