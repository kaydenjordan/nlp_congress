 Madam Chair, I think the comments made by my  colleague were perfectly appropriate. We have to deal with China and a  whole series of issues, but to say that we should not collaborate with  them on basic scientific research, that as was bluntly stated, could  literally help us cure cancer is not something that is in our best  interest.   We also have to realize that China is a major factor in the world. We  would like to get to a more peaceful relationship with them. Cutting  off all contact doesn't make sense. Even at the height of the Cold War  when we were aggressively trying to stand up to the Soviet Union, a  bipartisan group of legislators kept dialogue up between the two  countries.   Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that this amendment goes too  far and I urge opposition.    Madam Chair, the ignorance contained in  these comments is really breathtaking. Transgender people who have  normal, regular healthcare are no more likely to commit suicide than  anybody else.   Basically, the statistics he is showing say once somebody identifies  as having a problem, they are more likely to have a problem.   I mean, that would be like saying, we have identified that  servicemembers who complain of PTSD symptoms are more likely to commit  suicide.   The point is to get proper care for transgender people, and you won't  have  [[Page H3509]]  these issues. It is the ignorance that has prevented them from getting  that proper care.    By the way, the overwhelming majority of transgender people don't  need any of this any more than any of us do, but when they need it,  they need it, just like when anybody else does.   To Ms. Jacobs' point, we need to recruit people. Being bigoted  against transgender people takes a huge population out of the  recruitment.   This is a very simple, easy thing to do and deal with. Again, I  really want to emphasize not every transgender person needs this care.   If you have a problem, yes, you are more likely to have a problem,  but that is true of anybody regardless of your gender. We need  transgender people to serve in the military. This amendment will make  that more difficult and should be defeated.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Let's be clear on what this amendment is doing. It is taking  healthcare services away from servicemembers and their families. That  is what this is doing. It is denying them access to healthcare.   The only way this amendment makes sense is if you believe that  transgender people do not exist. That is the only way this makes sense.  Unfortunately for the makers of this amendment, transgender people  absolutely exist. This denial of their existence hurts certainly  transgender people, but if you are a servicemember and you have  somebody in your family who needs this care, you are going to get out  of the service now because the military is saying that your child  doesn't actually exist, doesn't actually need the same healthcare that  every other child needs.   Again, it is repeated over and over again, oh, this has nothing to do  with defending the country. Making sure that we have the best people  serving in the military is the number one thing to do with defending  this country. We are now taking a huge chunk of the population, anyone  who has a transgender family member or even anyone who thinks they  might at some point, and saying: You are out, don't serve. No matter  how capable, no matter how qualified you are, we are going to make it  impossible for you to serve primarily because of the colossal ignorance  that a lot of people have about what transgender means.   You can listen to the sarcasm in their voices: They don't know if  they are a man or a woman. That is not what transgender is, okay? It is  both a very legitimate psychological and physical issue that some  people have to deal with, just like in the special needs services. I  have met with servicemembers who had a child who had any manner of  different problems. They were able to stay in the military because  their child could get the care they needed. We are taking all those  people and kicking them to the curb because we are ignorant of what  transgender is and the importance of dealing with it.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to please oppose this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    President Biden's policy on Ukraine has been  clear and it has got two pieces: First, do what we can to support  Ukraine, to make sure that a sovereign democratic Ukraine survives;  second, don't go to war with Russia.   So it is the red herring of all red herrings to say that U.S. troops  are going to be put into this conflict. The conflict has been going on  for over 18 months. We have very carefully not dragged U.S. troops, or  even NATO troops, into this conflict.   What we are doing is we are supporting a sovereign democratic Ukraine  against a tyrannical dictator who is trying to take over that country  through violence. If Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he won't stop at  Ukraine.   I also am interested in the sponsor of this amendment's remark that  the U.S. shouldn't care about what goes on in the rest of the world  which, I guess, means we shouldn't care about what is going on in  China.   The purpose of all of this is deterrence. We want to deter Russia  from going further than Ukraine. We want to deter China from thinking  they can use military force to claim sovereign territory.   Deterrence is what will stop U.S. servicemembers from winding up  dying in a war. We need to support Ukraine.    Mr. Chairman, just building off of that is  really important. I think the President and a whole lot of people have  over and over explained what we are doing in Ukraine.   We should not fight every war everywhere. I agree with that. That is  why I strongly supported getting us out of Afghanistan long before we  actually did. There was not a strategic interest there and, also, U.S.  lives were being lost in Afghanistan. That was what was at stake.   In Ukraine, along with 53 other countries in the world, we are  supporting an effort to protect a sovereign democracy against a  dictatorship. Those are core U.S. interests.   The Ukrainians are doing the fighting. All they are asking for is our  support. If we can deter that type of aggression, it does advance U.S.  interests. It does protect U.S. servicemembers from having to fight.   We don't want to fight at home. We don't want to fight anywhere in  the world, but you have to stand up to dictators who are willing to  push that if you are going to get to that place. That is what we are  doing in Ukraine in a very effective manner.   Let's not abandon Ukraine at this point. They deserve our support.    Mr. Chair, I actually think the gentleman is  correct. China and Russia are very closely aligned, and if you are  concerned about Chinese aggression in the world, you must also be  concerned about Russian aggression.   I also note that when he quoted me on what the policy was, he  conveniently left out the first part. He mentioned that we don't want  to get into a war with Russia, but he left out the first part, which is  ``preserve a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.'' President Biden and his  team have done an excellent job of this.   Nobody thought Ukraine could survive this long, but thanks to their  courage, their willingness to fight, and 53 nations that have coalesced  to help them, they have been able to preserve a sovereign, democratic  Ukraine.   I want to place a strong emphasis on that. I know Americans are  rightly worried. Is it just us standing up for these principles in the  world? In Ukraine, it is not. It is 53 nations that are contributing  across the board, 53 nations that believe preserving economic and  political freedom requires us to not let an autocrat like Vladimir  Putin run over Ukraine. Please oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it is one of the great myths  of this situation that we don't have a mission.   The Biden administration has laid out a very, very clear plan, as I  said at the outset, and that plan is to do everything we can to help  preserve a sovereign democratic Ukraine without going to war with  Russia. That is the administration's plan, and they have made it clear  over and over and over again.   There are a lot of different people that have different opinions.  This amendment does not ask for   Joe Wilson's plan. This amendment  asks for the White House--the administration's plan, which we already  have. If you want to get Joe's plan, he is sitting right there, and I  suggest you ask him.   The administration has a very clear mission. That mission doesn't  have anything to do with regime change or trying Vladimir Putin. These  are all things to discuss. The mission in this conflict and the reason  we are supporting Ukraine is to preserve a sovereign democratic  Ukraine, which means helping them take back as much of their territory  that they can. How much they can take back is hard to say.   We are supporting them and because we supported them, there is a  sovereign democratic Ukraine. We are also at the same time having  conversations with Ukraine and trying to have conversations with Russia  about getting to the peace table. Right now Vladimir Putin isn't  willing to do that. He wants to destroy Ukraine. We are helping Ukraine  protect themselves. The mission is clear.   Using this excuse of a report to cut off the funds for the mission is  not the right approach. You can disagree with the mission if you want.  I understand that. It is a democracy, and we can have that  conversation, but let's please stop saying that there isn't clarity.   There is absolute clarity. President Biden, Jake Sullivan, Chairman  Milley, and Secretary Austin have said over and over and over again  that we are helping Ukraine defend itself so we can preserve a  sovereign democratic Ukraine and stop Russia from wiping them off the  map. That is the mission.   Thus far, it has been successful. We want to help them retake more  territory.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, we haven't  actually used the lend-lease provision yet, so there is nothing to  exercise oversight on. It is not clear whether or not it will be used.   Mr. Chairman, I want to address the larger issue which has been  raised, and that is the idea that there is a lack of accountability for  the funds going to Ukraine. Number one, that is a big Russian-Putin  propaganda talking point; and, two, completely wrong. It has been  investigated by the IG and a bunch of other folks and determined that  that is not happening.   These weapons are going precisely where they are supposed to be  going. We know this because if they weren't, Ukraine would have lost a  long time ago. They are under attack from a military roughly five times  the size of theirs that is much more well-armed and much more well- equipped.   In order to defend themselves, they have to effectively use the  support that the United States, and again, 53 other nations are  providing to them. They have been effectively using that, which is how  they have been able to retake some of the territory that Russia took  from them a year and a half ago and protect the rest of the country  that Putin was trying to take.   Let's not buy into this myth that somehow this money is being wasted  and is not proper oversight. There is a legitimate argument to be had  about what you feel about the importance of Ukraine, but it is not  based on this money being wasted.   The money has been incredibly effectively used. That is why Ukraine  has been able to defend itself. Again, I believe we should help Ukraine  defend itself, which is what we are doing. As with all the other  amendments along these lines, I urge opposition to this one.    Mr. Chair, I want to answer the most  important question: What does this have to do with national security?  It has to do with unit cohesion and with recruitment.   Interestingly, the survey data shows that almost three times as many  people say they are worried about joining the military because of their  concerns about discrimination as say that they are worried about the  military being too woke.   That is the point of this. The training is to make sure there is unit  cohesion, number one, and number two, that we can recruit from the  entire country.   It really comes down to whether or not you believe that we have a  history of discrimination against people of color, the LGBTQ community,  and women.   If you think that that just didn't happen and we don't have to worry  about it, then I guess this approach makes sense, but the history of  our country tells a very different story.   We need to address this in order to make sure that if you are a  woman, if you are a Black person, if you are trans or gay, the military  is going to give you a fair shake.   Let me remind everybody here. Just 13 years ago, we finally allowed  gay people to serve in the military. Every single Republican voted  against that. Every single one.   Do we really think that our national security would be stronger if we  drove all the gay people out of the military? We need all the  resources, all the talents from this country, and regrettably, we  haven't always done that. In what is shown, we need to address these  issues.   Now, the Republicans exaggerate this. They act like this is all we do  in recruitment. I have spent a lot of time with a lot of military  people. This is not all we do in training the military. It is something  that needs to be done to meet our recruitment goals.                                time  1645     Mr. Chair, what this amendment before us  says, it says you cannot teach that the Constitution is a racist  document.   As Mrs. McClellan pointed out, the Constitution says that Black  people are three-fifths of a person. The problem here is that we are  not allowing with this amendment to have an honest discussion. Within  the military, within society as a whole, you can't have a functioning  unit, a functioning institution if you don't understand this history  properly.   This amendment requires us to literally whitewash history. If you are  a Black person thinking about serving in the military, and you know  that is the military you are walking into, you are going to be worried  about it.   What DEI does is it gives an opportunity to assure people that they  will be treated equally, assurance that they are needed precisely  because of amendments like this.   Our country has a rich and complicated history. A lot of it is very  good, but we need to be honest about what it is if we are going to  recruit from the diverse population that we need to recruit from.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it is obvious to me that the  Republican majority doesn't understand what diversity, equity, and  inclusion is, so I am going to attempt to explain it this way.   We need to be intentional in recruiting from populations that have  been historically discriminated against.   I will use myself as an example. I grew up in a neighborhood that was  95 percent White. My friends were White. My family was White. I moved  into a responsible position. I started to hire people.   Typically, you either hire people you know, or you hire people who  you know know. That is where you get it. I looked around, and I was  hiring a bunch of White people, all right. That is who I knew.   What I did is I affirmatively reached out to groups that worked with  Black people or Hispanic people or gay people. When I had openings, I  said, okay, who have you got? I don't have those relationships, and I  built those relationships.   That is what diversity, equity and inclusion is, and it is sorely  needed in a country that at least until about 30 or 40 years ago was  really racist, okay.   To correct that, we have to work with communities, diverse  communities, to make sure that we recruit the people diversely.    We are not missing our recruitment goals  because we are trying to expand the people we are recruiting.   We are missing our recruitment goals primarily because of COVID, and  also, by the way, because a lot of Republicans are running around  talking about how terribly weak our military is. If they would stop  spreading that message, maybe people would believe in our military and  join.   That is what DEI is. Eliminating it is a huge mistake.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I think it is important to point out in this amendment that our  allies have very much stepped up in the war in Ukraine. This was about  a week ago now. The stats may be a little bit different. The United  States actually ranks 13th in terms of percentage of GDP that we have  committed to help Ukraine. That means of our 53 partners, 12 others  have been doing more than we have.   My biggest concern about this amendment is twofold. One, it  undermines that level of support and seems to imply that our allies are  not doing that. Second, along with several other amendments here, it  can be interpreted as being anti-NATO. I am worried more about the  other amendments than I am worried about this one, but make no mistake  about it, the NATO alliance has served the United States' interests  very, very well for its--quick math off the top of my head--roughly 75- plus years of existence, and we should not be undermining that.   This particular amendment, not as problematic, but the idea that our  allies are not contributing or the idea that the U.S. doesn't benefit  from our contribution, I think, is mistaken, based on our place in the  world.   Right now, as we look to confront Russia and China, nothing is more  important than our allies and partners. We need to work with them to  build the coalition that is going to be able to stand up for a rules- based international order and for the peaceful resolution of our  differences. I do not wish to undermine those alliances, and I hope we  do remember the contributions of our allies.    That is basically all I have to say about this. I don't think I have  any speakers.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this is part of a troubling  battle that we have frequently on the Armed Services Committee.   As the military, whether it is the Air Force or some other branch, is  trying to move forward, they discontinue different programs. There are  always people who like those programs, and we step in and block it and  make it difficult for the military to make the decisions they need to  make.   At this particular moment in history, this is enormously important,  because innovation, new weapons technology, is absolutely crucial. Our  information systems, just to give one example, are not where they need  to be in order to manage all of the information that is now flowing,  make sure that it is protected, and it gets to who needs to get it in  real time.   We need to upgrade all of those systems. We need to improve our  unmanned systems, drones, develop counter-drone technology, missiles,  and counter-missile technology. All of that is dependent upon new,  innovative technologies that we need to adopt and implement.   That costs money if we can't discontinue previous programs. We have  held onto many, many programs way  [[Page H3543]]  past the point at which they are actually useful, because it impacted  somebody's district somewhere. That is always going to be the case. I  am basically opposed to us stepping in and blocking these things and  tying the hands of the military to upgrade and innovate in the way that  they need. I am in opposition to this.                                time  1930    Mr. Chairman, I also want to explain something just quickly. I am  going to yield to Ms. Frankel in a minute. She is not going to talk  about this. She is going to talk about something else. For everyone's  information, she can do that. Basically, it is your time and you can  talk about whatever you want. I think you can stand up and mumble  gibberish for 2 minutes if you are so inclined. You have 2 minutes do  it, it is their time, not related to this, but it is still a perfectly  lawful way to handle this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, and I yield myself 2 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this is my favorite amendment.  It sort of drives home the point.   When we talk about history, you have to understand the history of how  these bases were named. We had the Civil War. We got rid of slavery. We  tried Reconstruction. Reconstruction did not go well.   Then there was a concerted movement in this country to make sure that  we continued to establish white supremacy as the way we were going to  approach this country. A lot of fascinating books have actually been  written about this. It was a very well-coordinated effort.   There was an effort to rename all these bases after people from the  Confederate war to celebrate white supremacy. The Ku Klux Klan grew up  all over the place. I can't remember the name of the guy, but a guy  from my area just wrote a fascinating book about the Ku Klux Klan  taking over the State of Indiana and the battle and fight that went  into that.   All of these bases that are named for our history, as you describe  it, are monuments to white supremacy. If you don't support white  supremacy, or if, God forbid, you are Black and not White, and you are  going to serve at a base that is a monument, historically  [[Page H3544]]  it is exactly why it was named that. It was named that as part of an  overall concerted effort to establish white supremacy. But we are just  going to let that go.   That is the kind of thing that undermines good order and discipline  in the military. This is the kind of thing that makes people who aren't  White feel like they are not included.   I do not believe for 1 second that the United States of America is an  essentially racist country or that white supremacy is currently the  policy that we are trying to advance. What I cannot understand is why  so many people serving in this body don't want to stand up for that  basic principle and want to continue to celebrate the worst parts of  our history instead of the best parts.   These monuments are supposed to reflect our values. This is not a  value we should be reflecting. Oh, by the way, this is why we still  need diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, to try to educate  people on these very fundamental facts that they ought to know.   Please, if you supported all the others, please oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. McClellan).    Mr. Chairman, I believe we have the right to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, I actually agree with what the gentleman has listed in  terms of what this great country has done.   What is beyond belief is why in the name of God would we choose to  celebrate the particular aspects of our history that don't reflect  those values that the gentleman just explained.   I want to talk about all the great things that the United States of  America has done. I don't want to talk about our history of white  supremacy. I want to understand it and make sure that we don't ever  repeat it.   I have an enormous amount of respect for the chairman of the  committee, but I want to make sure everyone understands what we are  voting on here. This is to prohibit the use of Federal funds to carry  out the recommendations of the base naming commission.   So to say, ``They are done. It doesn't really matter. This is going  to block what they did. This is going to stop the ability to change  those names,'' this commission was passed on a bipartisan basis to make  sure that this is implemented. This amendment would gut that and go  against that bipartisan agreement and the work that they have done.   Please understand what you are doing. As I said earlier, it is  something we should not be doing.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I can't say it any better than my  colleague said it, so I will primarily associate myself with her  remarks.   The bottom line is, we have interests in Afghanistan. She mentioned a  lot of the humanitarian interests. There are also national security  interests. ISIS is present in Afghanistan. We have considerable concern  about what they might do in terms of posing a transnational threat. We  have taken strikes against there.   There are many conceivable situations where we might need to work  with Afghanistan in focusing on this issue, on humanitarian needs or  national security needs. If it requires Congress to do it, it ties the  hands of the President to basically be able to implement the policies  that we will need to protect our interests. There is no need to have  this requirement.   Mr. Chair, I join my colleague in urging a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, let's be clear. There is no money  in the authorizing bill for Afghanistan, so the gentleman's worries are  misplaced. In fact, if he wasn't bringing up this amendment, we  wouldn't even be talking about it. So that last little bit there was  completely wrong, totally confusing, some big, impassioned plea about  how dare we pass an authorizing act that funds the Taliban.   I assure all Members there is no money in this bill for funding the  Taliban. This amendment has got nothing to do with the authorizing  bill. It goes way beyond that. We are not doing what the sponsor of  this amendment just said we are doing.   I don't know. Maybe he wishes to withdraw the amendment at this point  since it is pointless to his argument, but I just want to be clear to  the Members who will have to vote on this, it is not in the bill. This  amendment has nothing to do with that.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, this prohibits the President from  funding anything, including all of that other stuff, so it goes beyond  what is in the bill. He implied that in the bill we are funding this.  The executive branch is a different thing. His amendment would prohibit  the administration from doing anything. That is the objection to it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, the point of all this is  whether or not sustainability should be an objective that we work  toward in our building materials. What this amendment does is it  undermines the ability to get to that goal of sustainability.   Now, sustainability can mean a lot of different things. Mr. Rogers  focused on the aspect of how timber can be used. There is an aspect of  sustainability that focuses on whether or not what you are building  will enable us to sustain the planet. It is sort of widely accepted  that the way we are using carbon-emitting--all kinds of different  issues--is jeopardizing the health of the planet long term. That is  something that we ought to think about and we ought to be concerned  about.   If this amendment passes, you are putting your thumb on the scale in  a different way, saying the sustainability isn't important, you are  going to focus on other issues.                                time  2120    Actually, Mr. Garamendi is very good on other issues. As the chairman  of the Readiness Subcommittee, he always pointed out: Don't look at the  upfront cost. Look at the sustainability costs.   What does it cost to maintain what you are doing? What is the long- term cost going to be?   The market may be very good at figuring out what is going to be  cheapest right now today in this second, but then we pay over the long  term.   This amendment basically guts our ability to contemplate that long  term, to contemplate what sustainability would look like and what those  long-term costs are.   It is good to be on the same side as the chairman on an amendment. I  am with him. We should reject this amendment. Please vote ``no.''    Mr. Chairman, I really would just associate  myself with Chairman Rogers' remarks. These technologies are crucially  important to developing the capabilities that we need to be able to  compete with China, deter our adversaries, and have a strong military.   I understand that there are controversial decisions that are made;  what is the right technology going forward? We will never be perfect  about this. We have gone through this in DOD in many instances.   Gosh, we spent a lot of money on the F-35 that didn't quite work out.  We spent a lot of money on a lot of different programs that didn't work  out perfectly.   Targeting electric, solar, new green energy I realize is being done  because of the politics around it, but I would hope that we could put  aside those political debates on that to recognize the crucial need  that we have for these technologies in the military.   If the gentleman's amendment passes, I guess we would have to take  down the satellites. I mean, how is this going to work, exactly? This  is a really, really bad idea, and I hope we will vote ``no.''  [[Page H3558]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The gentleman's amendment requires the DOD to generate a report and  provide all documentation to Congress on the decision to withdraw from  Afghanistan, the attack at Abbey Gate, in coordination with State,  provide the number and immigration status of those evacuated from  Afghanistan, and U.S. support or interference with nongovernmental  groups assisting with the evacuation.   There is nothing particularly narrowly crafted about this. It is very  broad. The larger problem, this is all information, as Mr. Crow  indicated, that has been turned over repeatedly to multiple different  commissions and multiple different entities.   I do not doubt that the families still have questions. To the extent  they have questions, we should try to answer them. Those questions are  not going to be answered in the documentation that the gentleman is  asking for, and I know this because these documents have already been  turned over, already been made available; and as the gentleman just  said, the families still have questions. I completely respect that. We  should find ways to answer those questions.   This amendment isn't going to do that. It is not going to answer  those questions. It is simply asking for documentation that has already  been provided in multiple forums. I will grant you that it depends on  the forum, but we have got the inspector general. Mr. Crow went through  the list of all the different people who have seen this.   And remember, right now, the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs  Committee, which is not being remotely shy about pursuing this  information, is leading an investigation on precisely that issue.  Therefore, this is duplicative and will not answer the questions that  the gentleman just raised, so I don't support this amendment. I agree  with Mr. Crow that there is no apparent purpose for it. This  information has been provided, and if we pass this amendment, it  implies that it hasn't. That is wrong, dishonest, and we shouldn't do  it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds. The  weight of law is important if the information hasn't been turned over.  That is what the weight of law does. It compels them to do it.   Again, I will emphasize, the answers that the gentleman seeks--and I  applaud you for having those conversations with the victims. I hope you  can answer those questions. I hope somebody can, but this amendment  does not advance that conversation at all.   I appreciate the fact that the gentleman has had some time to talk  about this very important issue, but the amendment is simply seeking  information that has already been provided.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 15  seconds.   As far as the opportunity to have it again, as I understand it, that  subcommittee on Foreign Affairs is still going. They are very, very far  from done, so those questions have a very obvious forum and multiple  other forums in which to continue to answer those questions.    Again, this amendment implies the Department of Defense is  withholding something. They are not.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to  Mr. Crow.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Strickland).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Strickland).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what DEI is, and  there are certainly examples and there are many anecdotes of bad DEI,  of DEI that goes too far in the opposite direction, as has been  described over and over and over again.   But the basic idea that we need to make sure that our military is  inclusive and focus on diversity and equity, as we have argued  throughout the day today is inarguable.   There is a history of racism. There is a history of sexism. There is  a history of bigotry.                                time  2200    As was pointed out, we wouldn't even allow trans or gay people to  serve in many instances. Now that we have allowed Black people to serve  in the military, they are not getting promoted at the same level.   If we are going to recruit from the diverse population that we have  in this country, we have to at least focus on it. If folks want to  focus on some minor bad aspect of it, we can talk about that, but what  you are doing is you are completely eliminating like 10 times--talk  about shooting a dead horse. We have now shot this thing like 15 times  in the course of the day. You are completely eliminating any  consideration of this Nation's history and how we are going to recruit  and retain members of the military.   These amendments are terrible ideas for the national security of this  country, and I, once again, urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
