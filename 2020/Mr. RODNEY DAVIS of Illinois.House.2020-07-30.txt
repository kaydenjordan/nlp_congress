 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of Dennis Shackelford, who passed away last week.   I got to know Dennis very well during my first campaign for Congress  when he ran for State Representative in 2012. Though he was  unsuccessful in his campaign, our friendship continued.   Dennis was a small business owner for 30 years, running Hallmark  stores across central Illinois, including in my hometown of  Taylorville. After that successful career as a small business owner, he  continued working in the banking industry in the Springfield, Illinois,  area.   Dennis served his community being elected to the Lincoln Land  Community College board in 2013, and later he rose to chairman while  serving students across central Illinois. Dennis was also elected a  trustee for Rochester Township.   Dennis was a great friend, deeply involved in his community, whether  it was coaching baseball, youth baseball, or mentoring high schoolers,  and countless others throughout his life.   My condolences extend to his wife, Judy, his son, Andrew, and his  three daughters, Amy, Lindsey, and Emily as well as his extended  family. Dennis was one of a kind and will be deeply missed by all.                            ____________________
