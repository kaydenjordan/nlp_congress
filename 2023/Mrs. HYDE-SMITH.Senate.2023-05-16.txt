 Mr. President, this week our Nation commemorates the  2023 National Police Week and honors the brave men and women of law  enforcement who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  As a nation, we will pay tribute to those who have given their lives to  protect our communities and join in mourning their loss with their  families and loved ones.   As we recognize National Police Week and remember these fallen  officers, we must acknowledge the critical role that law enforcement  officers play in keeping our communities safe. They leave their homes  and families every day not knowing if they will return. The amount of  courage, dedication, and passion that demands cannot be overstated. It  is important to remember, too, that their families also demonstrate  exceptional courage, as they support their loved ones knowing the  circumstances are sometimes life and death.   My State of Mississippi is blessed with amazing law enforcement.  These men and women in blue are not only hometown heroes, but also are  an integral part of our communities. Every loss of an officer is deeply  felt by all. I would like to specifically remember and honor the nine  fallen officers from Mississippi whose names have been added to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial this year. These officers  died heroes in service to their communities, and we will forever be  grateful for their sacrifice.   We remember: Steven Michael Robin and Branden Paul Estorffe of the  Bay St. Louis Police Department, who were shot and killed while  conducting a welfare check, and Marzell Jerome Brooks of the Brookhaven  Police Department, who passed from COVID-19 during the commission of  his job duties.   We remember: Myiesha Breanna Stewart of the Greenville Police  Department, who was shot and killed during a vehicle pursuit of a  suspect who fled the scene after a shooting; Lee Dan Vance, Jr., of the  Hinds County Sheriff's Office who died after contracting COVID-19  during an outbreak among employees and inmates; and Robert Edward Moak,  Sr., of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office, who was killed by a  suspect who he had testified against in court.   We remember: Kennis Winston Croom of the Meridian Police Department,  who was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call,  and Jeffrey Ray Turney of the Pontotoc Police Department, who succumbed  to COVID-19 after contracting the illness during the commission of his  job duties.   Lastly, we remember Johnny Raymond Patterson of the Verona Police  Department, who was struck by a vehicle while directing traffic.   To honor their memory, we must put our words into actions by ensuring  our officers have the resources and tools they need to do their jobs  safely and effectively. It is critical they have adequate support for  training, equipment, and technology, as well as policies that  prioritize officer safety and well-being.   For my part, I will continue to be an advocate for law enforcement  professionals and provide support where possible and do all I can to  honor the legacy of those lost in the line of duty.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering and honoring these  brave officers in Mississippi and across the Nation during National  Police Week and throughout the year. It is my prayer that their  families and loved ones find comfort in knowing that their sacrifices  will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
