 Mr. President, I recently introduced the RECHARGE  Act, S. 2241, with my friend and colleague, Senator Whitehouse, and we  are very pleased that this bill, as amended, is included in the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as Section 40431.   Section 40431 amends section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C. 2621(d) in order to establish a new  requirement that all public utilities--investor-owned utilities,  customer-owned cooperatives, and public power utilities--must consider  establishing EV-specific rates for residential customers, EV drivers,  and commercial customers, who operate public and fleet EV charging  stations, to promote greater electrification in the transportation  sector.   Lowering emissions in the transportation sector will hinge upon the  electrification of our country's motorized vehicles. Large investments  in electric vehicle, or EV, charging infrastructure of the type  included in other sections of this legislation will provide a catalyst  for mass EV adoption.   The successful adoption of EVs will depend not only upon modernizing  America's grid and charging infrastructure, but also upon updating our  electricity sector rates, so that the infrastructure funded by this act  can operate in an economically sustainable manner for decades to come.  The commercial rates present today were not designed with the unique  electricity load profile of a growing EV fleet in mind.  [[Page S5927]]    Public EV charging stations, and particularly high-powered DC fast  charging stations designed for highway corridors and for heavier-duty  EVs like buses and trucks, face a distinct set of hurdles imposed by  the current regulatory system and traditional, demand-based electricity  rates.   Most prominent among barriers to deploying commercial EV charging are  demand charges, which are electricity rates set by public utilities on  their customers, including EV charging station owners, based on the  maximum amount of power, kW, drawn for any given time interval,  typically 15 minutes, during the billing period, multiplied by the  relevant tariff demand charge.   Demand charges are designed to capture the marginal costs imposed on  the grid by high-capacity, high-utilization infrastructure such as  factories. However, when traditional demand charges are levied upon  high-capacity, low-utilization infrastructure such as EV charging  stations, they can place a disproportionate cost burden on the station  owners.   The high-powered, fast-charging stations our Nation needs to serve  the EV driving public, public and private fleet vehicle operators, and  the trucking industry have different load profiles than most commercial  entities, with periods of dormancy punctuated by spikes in activity.  And unlike most commercial operations, their demand profile is driven  by real-time customer activity. So it is difficult for these stations  to optimize their load profiles.   The burden of demand charges varies by State and by region and can  fail to accurately reflect the marginal costs imposed on the system by  EV charging stations. For example, in the Colorado PUC Electric Vehicle  Working Group Report published in 2019, the Colorado Public Utilities  Commission found that demand charges result in the annual cost to  operate a direct current fast charging, DCFC, station in one Colorado  utility territory being 35 times higher than the cost in a neighboring  service territory. The problem will only worsen for the still higher- demand and lower-utilization application of EV truck charging.   Demand charges, if not reformed, may also introduce new issues of  inequity as America electrifies transportation. For example, homeowners  are able to charge an electric vehicle on very affordable residential  utility rates, which currently average $1.16 per gasoline gallon  equivalent according to the Department of Energy. But those who live in  multiunit housing and rent their abode, a population that is  disproportionately low-income and minority, often cannot charge an EV  at home. They will charge their EVs at public charging stations, and  those public charging stations must pay much higher commercial utility  rates, including commercial demand charges, which make up as much as 90  percent of public charging station's utility bills according to RMI.   In recent years, some States and utilities have recognized this  inequity and taken steps to reform their utility rates, to reduce and  reform commercial demand charges and to adopt rates designed for low- load or electric vehicle charging infrastructure. These utilities and  regulators should be commended for their forward-leaning approach to a  complicated issue. Utilities in Colorado have begun to do this, as have  utilities in quite a few other States.   Section 40431 requires only those States and utilities which have not  already done so to take up the issue of how demand charge rates affect  EV charging in order to encourage new private-sector investment in EV  charging stations.   These States and utilities are allowed 2 years to consider the  establishment of new rates that A, promote affordable and equitable EV  charging options; B, facilitate deployment of faster charging  technology that improves the customer experience; C, accelerate third- party investment in EV charging infrastructure; and D, appropriately  recover marginal costs.   Our intention is to ensure that alternatives to traditional, demand- based electricity rates are made available to EV charging station  owners with appropriate oversight by State public utility commissions.  To remove any doubt, section 40431 does not empower, encourage, or  allow State public utility commissions to regulate the prices that  third-party owned EV charging stations charge their customers for EV  charging services. Those prices are set in a competitive marketplace  that benefits consumers, and this legislation does not affect that  marketplace.   Section 40431 should prompt forward-looking change at the State and  utility level which appropriately reflects and accommodates the real  differences in geographies, electricity markets, and business  environments which exist between and within States and utility  territories. It ensures that attention will be paid to this problem  nationwide, but also that each State and utility can decide how to  address the problem its own way. Ultimately, it should lead to new rate  designs that enable the private sector to make economically sustainable  investments in the high-powered charging stations that will help  drivers, fleet operators, and truckers go electric, while more  appropriately reflecting the actual marginal costs added to the grid by  EV charging stations.                            ____________________
