 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barton for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of language that was  added to the IMPROVE Act that would protect access to critical  equipment for individuals with disabilities.   In November of 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  issued a rule stating that accessories used on complex rehabilitative  wheelchairs would no longer be part of the fixed fee schedule and would  be subject to competitive bidding pricing, decreasing access to  customized wheelchairs and accessories relied on by adults and children  with disabilities.   My language included in this legislation will include a commonsense  clarification to ensure those in the Medicare Program do not have to go  through the difficulty of adjusting to the new rules and pricing  arbitrarily set by CMS. This will ensure that they have reliable and  consistent access to the equipment they need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect those with disabilities  and their access to the resources they rely on.
