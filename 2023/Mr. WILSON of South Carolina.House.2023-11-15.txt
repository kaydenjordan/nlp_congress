 Mr. Speaker, the poor decisions of  Biden and far-left Democrats are failing American families and  destroying jobs.   According to an October poll, about two-thirds of Americans report  rising household expenses. More than 70 percent described the national  economy as poor.   A Bankrate survey shows that 50 percent of Americans say their  financial situation is worse since Biden became President, as inflation  has risen to a 40-year high, in contrast to President Donald Trump who  created a record job environment.   Bidenomics is hurting American families. America has 6.5 million  people who remain unemployed. Prices have risen 17 percent since Biden  took office. Families are paying more than $700 per month to buy the  same exact goods and services they did just 2 years ago, according to  the chief economist at Moody's Analytics.   Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to fight to  reduce inflation and create jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders  creating an imminent attack on American families.                            ____________________
