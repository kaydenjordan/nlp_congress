 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R.  3942, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act.   The spread of e-cigarettes is a public health crisis. I have had  multiple conversations with parents who are seeing their children  become addicted to tobacco products, and, as a mom, I refuse to stand  idly by as a new generation of children become addicted to this  substance.   We have seen multiple deaths from the use of vaping products and  several hundred lung disease cases in Florida alone. Approximately  5,600 kids in Florida are becoming new daily smokers each year. This is  affecting children regardless of ZIP Code or income level.   For years, e-cigarette companies have targeted our children using  specialty flavors like cotton candy and made their products easy to  purchase online without any age verification.   We have the responsibility to do everything we can to keep this  addictive substance out of the hands of our kids, including requiring  online and in-person verification for e-cigarette purchases.   The health of our Nation's children is at risk because of e- cigarettes and vaping products. The time to act is now.
