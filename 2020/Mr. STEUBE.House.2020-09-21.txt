 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to vote in  favor of my bill, H.R. 1702, the Free Veterans from Fees Act of 2019.   To help foster a culture in America in which all veterans are valued  for their service to our nation, we need to do our part to assist those  who have served in our military. One way we can honor our nation's  heroes is to assist them when they visit national war memorials as they  remember all those who fought and are not here today.   Throughout the year, several veterans' groups and Gold Star Families  visit national war memorials here in Washington, D.C. by honor buses  and honor flights through various veterans' organizations. To obtain a  permit for their visit, oftentimes veterans' groups must pay  administrative fees and other processing costs related to visiting  memorials that have been built not only as a testament of their  sacrifice, but also to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for  our nation.   This common sense bill would waive the application fee for any  special use permits for veterans' demonstration and special events at  war memorials on land administrated by the National Park Service in the  District of Columbia.  [[Page H4568]]    The Free Veterans from Fees Act has bipartisan support and has been  endorsed by AMVETS, a veteran organization that represents 250,000  members nationwide.   I thank the House Committee on Natural Resources for holding a  hearing on this bill and I am pleased to see it on the legislative  calendar. You may also remember this bill was passed through the  Committee and through suspension on the House floor last Congress, and  we hope that we can get this bill passed under suspension this  Congress.
