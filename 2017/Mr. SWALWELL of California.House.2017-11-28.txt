 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2228, the Law Enforcement and Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017.   Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives on the line  each and every day to keep us safe. The resulting stress can take a  tremendous toll on their mental health, and this bill seeks to address  that problem. I am the son of a retired police officer and the brother  of two others currently serving in law enforcement, and so I am  particularly appreciative we are considering this bill today.   In the Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 2228, I offered an  amendment which would have required the Attorney General to study the  specific effects of gun violence on officers' mental health as well as  provide recommendations to reduce such violence. Gun violence is an  epidemic in our society, and law enforcement officers are not immune.  In fact, in 2016, 64 police officers died in firearm-related incidents.  That was up 56 percent over 2015, according to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The potential of facing deadly  violence at every turn only adds to the stress faced by law  enforcement.   I withdrew my amendment during our markup after Chairman Bob  Goodlatte agreed to include language in the Judiciary Committee's  report on the bill reflecting the goals of my amendment. I want to  thank him for following through on that commitment and including the  following language in the committee report: ``In conjunction with the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice must  develop educational resources for mental health providers regarding the  culture of law enforcement agencies and therapies for mental health  issues common to law enforcement officers. In developing these  resources, the Department of Justice should examine the effect of gun  violence on the mental health of officers and what can be done to solve  those aspects of gun violence.'' Incorporating how law enforcement  officers' mental health is affected by gun violence and proposing ways  to reduce such violence as directed by this language will only improve  the resources for law enforcement developed as a result of this bill.   Again I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for putting this directive  regarding gun violence in the committee report. I encourage all Members  to support H.R. 2228.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2228, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
