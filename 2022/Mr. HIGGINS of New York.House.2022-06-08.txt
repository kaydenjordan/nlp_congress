 Madam Speaker, in the House Oversight and  Reform Committee this morning, we heard compelling testimony from  individuals that had been directly affected by gun violence.   The Buffalo Police Commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, and also Zeneta  Everhart provided testimony that is clear and compelling.   The Buffalo shooting that took place, the shooting started at 2:30 in  the afternoon and ended 2 minutes and 3 seconds later; one shooter, one  weapon of mass destruction, 13 people shot, 10 people dead.   We need sensible gun safety legislation in this country. When you  look at the need for background checks, that doesn't violate anybody's  constitutional rights; but it affirms the right of people to live  freely, to live safely, to live in a prosperous way in our  neighborhoods and throughout the country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the rule for the House to consider commonsense measures to protect our  communities and our kids from massacres caused by weapons of mass  destruction.  [[Page H5359]]    In Buffalo, on May 14, the shooting started at 2:30 in the afternoon.  In 2 minutes and 3 seconds it was over: 10 people were killed, 3  injured, 11 African Americans, 1 shooter with a weapon of mass  destruction.   I don't want anybody's guns, but we should at least be able to be  supportive of background checks to ensure that people that shouldn't  have a gun possess a gun. That uplifts the integrity of gun ownership  by taking a responsible position and does nothing relative to  constitutional rights, and represents a collective responsibility.
