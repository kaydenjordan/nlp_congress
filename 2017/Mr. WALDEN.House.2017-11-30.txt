 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3017, the  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act of 2017, sponsored by our fellow Energy and Commerce Committee  member, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley). We thank him  for his leadership on this.   I especially want to thank John Shimkus, the chairman of the  Environment Subcommittee, for his leadership in getting this done,  along with Mr. Pallone and Mr. Tonko, who played key roles, along with  other members of the committee to bring this legislation to the floor  and bring it here with unanimous support from the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   What are brownfields? Well, they are vacant, underused, and often  contaminated properties that are a blight on local communities across  our Nation. The EPA's brownfields program is a successful, results- oriented program, and it provides grants to assess and clean up these  polluted areas.   Since the brownfields program's inception, more than 27,000  contaminated sites have been remediated, allowing communities across  the country to return them to productive use. Cleaning up brownfields  sites increases local tax bases, facilitates job growth and wage  increases, promotes the development of new infrastructure, improves and  protects the environment--all really good public policy goals.   Over 129,000 jobs have been leveraged because of the brownfields  program, and almost 70,000 acres have been made ready for reuse. The  brownfields program has leveraged over $24 billion, a  [[Page H9542]]  significant return on the Federal investment in the program. I read  somewhere it was a 16-to-1 rate of return based on Federal investment  compared to what we get out of the program.                                time  1430    A 2017 study concluded that cleaning up brownfield properties led to  a residential property value increase of up to 15 percent within a mile  of these brownfield sites. Another study found an estimated $29 million  to $97 million in additional tax revenues for local governments in a  single year after the cleanup, which is two to seven times more than  the $12.4 million the EPA contributed to the cleanup of those  brownfields. So, property values go up, local tax revenues go up,  communities are improved, and we create jobs with this very important  program.   In my home State of Oregon, we have had a very active and effective  brownfields program, and we have seen some great success in my own  district. The Old Mill District in Bend--which is pictured here; this  is the site of an old lumber mill--was one of those sites. It is easy  to see--as the debris was here and the mill was crumbling and we lost  all of those jobs--it was transformed into this incredible place with  great recreation. With the reopening of the Deschutes River, we have  movie theaters and restaurants and offices and residential housing all  in this complex now, and it is a showplace. It is a gem of Deschutes  County.   Bend isn't alone. In The Dalles, where I was born, Google broke  ground on an expansion to their data center there on 26 acres of former  mill land that was cleaned up under this program. That expansion of the  Google data center is a $600 million investment, expected to create 50  new jobs.   Also, in my hometown of Hood River, the Port of Hood River just  finished a brownfields cleanup of another former mill site. That opened  up 12 acres of land for future business opportunities in the area.   And in southern Oregon, the city of Grants Pass is in the early  stages of working towards a similar goal. They have successfully  secured assistance through the brownfields program to begin planning  the cleanup and redevelopment of the old Spalding Mill site.   The Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously voted to move this  bipartisan legislation out of the committee. We worked closely with our  friends and colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to make additional improvements on the way to the House  floor.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today because the authorization for the  brownfields program expired in 2006. It is well past time we do our job  as Congress to modernize and reauthorize successful programs like this.  At the end of the day, this bipartisan legislation creates jobs,  promotes infrastructure and economic development, and cleans up our  communities. It is a winning scenario for everyone involved.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who put so much time and effort  into modernizing this program, and I urge them all to support H.R. 3017  as we pass it into law.
