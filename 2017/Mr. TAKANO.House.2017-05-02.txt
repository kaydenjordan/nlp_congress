 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  1180 for a simple reason: the Working Families Flexibility Act does not  give working families more flexibility. In fact, it gives them nothing.   The bill contains no meaningful rights for workers that they don't  already have. Instead, it is employers who get the flexibility and the  power to withhold overtime pay in exchange for a false promise of comp  time in the future.                                time  1615    This bill takes the simple idea that workers should be paid when they  work overtime and creates a more complicated system in which employers  can pressure their workers to accept comp time instead of cash and then  refuse to give them that comp time until it is convenient.   Even the American Sustainable Business Council opposes the bill, and  I include their letter in the Record.                                                American Sustainable                                                Business Council,                                                     April 24, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chairman, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bradley Byrne,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert ``Bobby'' Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairpersons Foxx and Byrne, and Ranking Members Scott       and Takano: On behalf of our members and supporter       organizations, the American Sustainable Business Council       (ASBC) is writing to express our opposition to the Working       Families Flexibility Act (H.R. 1180/S. 801) of 2017.        The misleadingly named bill, as introduced by       Representative Martha Roby, is the wrong way to encourage       employers to offer work-life benefits to their employees.        This bill would create a major liability on the balance       sheet of small businesses whose employees have ``banked''       away their overtime comp hours. This liability then becomes a       scheduling and accounting challenge when employees decide to       trade in banked hours, requiring business owners to make       unexpected shifts in personnel assignments and paychecks.       Obviously, small businesses with fewer resources and       employees would be even harder hit by these onerous       logistical challenges than larger corporations.        It is important that more supporting measures are taken to       ensure the success of small business. In the spirit of       pursuing pro-business legislation, the Working Families       Flexibility Act proves itself to be anything but flexible for       employees and even more burdensome for employers. The sheer       volume of tracking requirements has the potential to result       in improper penalties being assessed by various government       agencies. The bill will stymie, not foster, economic activity       in the private sector.        In addition, this bill would create headaches for any       employer who must track banked hours across multiple       employees and make the required organizational       rearrangements. These factors could put business owners in       the position of making uncomfortable decisions regarding       their employees which could, in turn, lower the morale of       their workforce.        Current law does not deny employers and employees the       ability to develop mutually beneficial flexible scheduling if       they so choose, which makes this an unnecessary new law. If       Representatives Roby is truly concerned about creating       flexibility for working families, there are other, less       onerous options.        The Healthy Families Act, for instance, would provide       workers the right to earn up to seven earned paid sick days       each year to recover from illness, to care for a family       member, to seek routine medical care, or to manage other       unpredictable necessities of day-to-day life. Employers who       provide this type of leave already would not have to provide       additional sick time. This method is a more predictable and       easier approach to implement for employers.        ASBC is a growing national coalition of businesses and       business organizations committed to advancing policies that       support a vibrant and sustainable economy. ASBC represents       over 250,000 businesses and more than 300,000 business       professionals, including industry trade associations, local       and state chambers of commerce, microenterprise, social       enterprise, green and sustainable business, local and       community-rooted business, women and minority business       leaders, and investors.        The Working Families Flexibility Act is a poorly designed       bill for both employers and employees. In the interest of       working families who need true flexibility, and the       businesses who rely on those family members, we urge you to       vote against it.            Sincerely,                                                    Richard Eidlin,                      Co-Founder & Vice President of Public Policy.     Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible deal for working  families. This bill should be called the betrayal of working families  act.   Mr. Speaker, I do not believe my colleagues in the majority are  intentionally eroding the rights of working families. I do not believe  they lack respect or compassion for the millions of hardworking  Americans who feel stuck and powerless in this economy.   But I do believe that, when faced with a choice between protecting  workers and rewarding corporations, they routinely fall on the side of  corporate interests. The evidence is in this bill. The evidence is in  their vote to roll back workplace safety reporting standards. The  evidence is in their vote to block the fiduciary rule, and the evidence  is in the majority's continued resistance to restoring overtime  protections for millions of middle class workers.   President Trump promised to give power back to the people. This  legislation betrays that promise, and it betrays the people who  desperately need a voice in Washington.   I call on my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1180.
