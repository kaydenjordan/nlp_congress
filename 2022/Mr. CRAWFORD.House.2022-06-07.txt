 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Water  Resources and Development Act.   WRDA authorizes projects designed to improve the Nation's water  resources infrastructure, including ports and harbors, inland waterway  navigation, and flood and storm protection.   I am thankful to Chairman DeFazio for working with me to ensure  priorities of my district made it into the final language, and for the  leadership of Ranking Member Graves as we fought for community-driven  water solutions. WRDA is a testament to our ability to still pass  critical legislation and still work in a bipartisan fashion to deliver  results to the American people. I encourage my colleagues to vote in  favor of H.R. 7776.   Finally, let me add my voice to those recognizing Paul Sass, who is  ending his 20-year career on Capitol Hill at the end of the week as the  Republican staff director. Since coming to the T&I Committee with  Ranking Member Graves, Paul has dedicated countless hours to improving,  investing in, and securing our Nation's infrastructure. He has not only  been a valuable asset to the Graves staff, but he has been a resource  to my staff as well and helped lead the committee's commitment to a  safe and efficient transportation system.   I thank Paul for his years of public service, and I wish him all the  best in his next chapter.
