 Mr. Speaker, America's workers do not support the Trump- negotiated NAFTA-2 trade deal.   Just like the original NAFTA, the new NAFTA is half-baked,  repackaged, and broken. It was not written to improve the lives of our  working families in Ohio or in Mexico or in Central America. It was  written to advance transnational corporate interests and the schemes of  very wealthy elites.   In a country whose public and private sectors too often serve the  interests of the rich and powerful and not the average person, this is  the last thing the working people of Ohio and North America need,  regardless of whether they work in the mills or toil in the fields.   The President's promise of higher wages and returning jobs is not to  be believed. NAFTA cannot deliver for the working people unless it  ensures the dignity of labor, of labor rights, and labor enforcement on  this continent.   Our leaders must wake up to the human suffering these trade deals  create, not only for our own citizens as their jobs are outsourced but,  also, people who are exploited in Mexico and the Americas.   When transnational corporations crash together the economies of  first- and third-world countries, without a second thought about the  consequences, it is the working people who get crushed.   The ravages of NAFTA inflicted on the Americas and their workers are  etched across America's communities. Far too many have been devastated  by the outsourcing of factories, many left in economic ruin.   NAFTA was sold as the model of the modern integration of first-world  and emerging-world economies. It was then replicated in Central America  with the so-called CAFTA sweatshop deal, covering nations from which  millions are now fleeing to our border.   When multinational corporate interests dominate negotiations and  place a heavy thumb on the scales of economic justice for labor across  the Americas, trade with our closest neighbors is never a zero-sum game  because too few control the levers of negotiating power.   It is no surprise that nearly a half a million migrants have been  taken into custody at our southern border this year alone--half a  million.   In the past, undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men  from Mexico, but that flow has changed. First, we experienced  immigration from Mexico post NAFTA. There was a hemorrhage.    That has gone down in recent years, but now CAFTA, the gift of CAFTA,  sees Central American families having become the new face of  undocumented immigration.   These landless people, jobless people from the Americas live in fear.   As America exports our transnational-driven trade models, we  knowingly rely upon the human suffering our economic policies inflict  on the poor.   NAFTA and NAFTA-2 were always about cheap labor and bringing down the  benefits of health and pension benefits for American workers.   Undocumented migrants arrive brutalized through trafficking channels.  Indeed, one can easily see, in agriculture alone in the Americas, the  exploitative model of slavery has simply morphed into a new serfdom  under the present system.   Once in the United States, many become undocumented farm workers, and  the Department of Agriculture estimates that about half of our Nation's  farm workers are unauthorized, undocumented.   These workers face great hostility and black-market labor conditions  repugnant to our values. This undocumented status makes workers  especially vulnerable to abuse.   Is the answer to expand our migrant visa worker programs, the H-2A or  H-2B visas? Absolutely not.   Take the tragedy of Santiago Cruz, a Mexican labor recruiter brutally  murdered in a legal labor recruitment office in Monterrey, Mexico.   Santiago was communicating to his fellow Mexican workers who sought  economic opportunity in America that they did not have to pay a coyote  $8,000 to get across the border--a crooked, lone coyote.   Twelve years after his death near the Mexican-U.S. border, Mexico has  not prosecuted his murderer and our country has not raised a voice to  get justice in his murder.   But the greatest injustice is the new NAFTA deal that fails to  address the cancer of undocumented labor in the Americas, especially in  the agriculture industry.   The current migrant worker system is widely abused by employers  seeking a captive workforce. NAFTA-2 must include a comprehensive  strategy to address continental labor, and agricultural immigration  must be a part and central to it, not absent.   The continental enforcement of healthy working conditions and  integration of enforceable labor laws must be central to NAFTA-2. It is  not in it.   That is the ugly exploitation of America's industrialized and farm  workers that we allow to continue.   How morally reprehensible is this?   I ask my colleagues to please take a look at our bill and include a  labor secretariat in the new NAFTA deal. Let's put some justice in  trade.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.   Mr. Chair, the amendment that I offer aims to expand the Department  of Defense's authority to work with the Coast Guard on youth science,  technology, engineering, and math programs.   For several years, I have worked closely with the U.S. Coast Guard to  engage on youth STEM programs. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard came  to me and acknowledged that to continue our efforts, they needed new  authority and advice. The specialties these dedicated public maritime  servants rely upon daily is rooted in science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics, yet they do not have the authority to engage beyond  volunteer status in their communities to build special capabilities in  young people for the future.   Meanwhile, the Department of Defense offers excellent examples of the  benefits of such programming and holds the respective experience in  successful applications, such as the STARBASE program.   Now more than ever, the future of our country, our very prosperity  and security, depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education- reliant workforce. That begins with our youth.   Basic STEM concepts are best learned at an earlier age and are  central prerequisites for career technical training, advanced college- level and graduate study, and success in various workplaces.   Given the Coast Guard's mission of coastal defense, maritime law  enforcement, and maritime operations, the Coast Guard, too, has a  vested interest to advance STEM youth exposure.   With my amendment, we can invest in the future of America's youth and  the Coast Guard itself by expanding the Department of Defense's ability  to work with the Coast Guard on youth STEM programming to transfer  know-how. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
