 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lipinski, for  his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, serving as good stewards of our environment is something  that each and every one of us are called to do no matter who we are or  where we come from.   It is critical in order to preserve public health. The reality is  climate change is real and humans are a contributing factor. Congress  must take serious and reasonable steps to combat it.   As an Eagle Scout and a conservationist who grew up in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, I have always been captivated by the natural beauty of  our open spaces and wild places. We have it all in Bucks County:  preserved farmland, amazing parks, expansive forests, and historic  rivers. I believe that with these natural treasures comes a special  responsibility to care for and protect our natural resources at the  local, State, and Federal level.   Climate change and the irresponsible management of our resources put  a strain on the health of our communities and our children. Clean air  and clean water are essential to the health, safety, and well-being of  the next generation of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, protecting our Nation's open spaces unites us as  Americans. That is why I joined 16 other House Republicans on House  Resolution 195 to encourage American innovation to improve  environmental policy and to protect, conserve, and be good stewards of  our environment.   I introduced the Udall-Eisenhower Arctic Wilderness Act, H.R. 1889,  with Congressman Jared Huffman from California. This bill designates  the 1.5 million-acre land of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a  component of the National Wilderness Preservation System to protect it  from damaging activities like oil and gas drilling.   I have voted to protect the methane rule for stream protections.   The Climate Solutions Caucus will continue to be the group that shows  Washington how to forego the political gamesmanship and get to work on  ways we can improve our environment, address the realities of climate  change, and increase innovation with an eye towards sustainability.   Protecting our environment cannot be partisan, Mr. Speaker. We have  to come together to get this done as Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and  colleague, Andy Biggs, for him joining all of us in this fight to stand  up for terminally ill patients across this country.   Mr. Speaker, each year, more Americans receive the devastating news  of a terminal diagnosis. Even with the amazing work done in American  medical research and development, for too many families, access to  these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at  all.   Thousands of terminally ill patients, like my constituent, Matt  Bellina, suffer needlessly while awaiting final approval for drug  therapies and other medical technologies.   In April 2014, at age 30, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, otherwise  known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS attacks nerve cells in the brain and  spinal cord, causing those with ALS to lose control of their muscles.   Although this disease stopped Matt's career as a U.S. Navy aviator in  its tracks, he persisted and actively involved himself in the ALS  community as a strong advocate for Right to Try legislation.   While the Food and Drug Administration carries out its three-phase  approval process, which can take years and cost billions of dollars,  many patients simply want the chance to try treatments that have  already been demonstrated to be safe.   A bill that was unanimously passed by the Senate will offer them a  chance to extend their lives. The Right to Try Act, S. 204, would  ensure that terminally ill patients, together with their physicians and  pharmaceutical manufacturers, can administer investigational treatments  where no alternative exists. In fact, this bipartisan idea is already  the law in 37 States.   A Federal Right to Try law would prevent the government from blocking  access to potentially lifesaving medications. It would require patients  to first try all other available treatments and be unable to  participate in clinical trials.   I want to note that these provisions only apply to terminally ill  patients. It does not undo the FDA approval process but provides a  potential lifeline for those who cannot wait. Moreover, it requires a  physician to certify that other options are either exhausted or  unavailable.   This bill requires that a product meet a demonstrated level of safety  by attaining FDA phase I approval. We have worked with the drug  companies to ensure adverse outcomes are not used against the ongoing  application for approval. Additionally, patients, doctors, and  manufacturers do not assume any additional liability under this act.   For those patients caught in between the traditional drug approval  delays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and  limited time, the Right to Try simply establishes the freedom for  patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far  outweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their  life.   Mr. Speaker, whether it is a father like Matt courageously battling  ALS, or a brave child living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, they  deserve the right to try.                                time  2100
