 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, once again, in support of the  American Health Care Act. I do this as a doctor for the good of my  patients. We are here today to repeal ObamaCare, to take healthcare  decisions away from Washington bureaucrats and give them back to the  people.   The American Health Care Act will create a patient-centered system  that will lower the cost of health care and serve patients. This act  eliminates ObamaCare's taxes, subsidies, and mandates. It defunds  Planned Parenthood. It puts Medicaid on a budget, and it is the largest  entitlement reform in a generation.   Without Washington mandates driving up costs and limiting access to  care, Americans will have the freedom to obtain quality healthcare  plans that fit their needs at a cost they can afford.   All this talk about preexisting conditions, this bill provides  guaranteed issuance.   Let's not break our promise on repealing ObamaCare. Let's be true to  our word. We owe it to the people who sent us here.   I support the American Health Care Act, Mr. Speaker, and I urge all  Members to do the same.
