 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding the time.   I rise in support of this en bloc package, which includes three of my  amendments.   My first amendment prioritizes funding to support labor reforms in  Mexico that will improve Mexican and U.S. workers' standards of living  so the USMCA can fulfill its promise.   The second prioritizes BUILD grant funding for green infrastructure  projects that will decarbonize and electrify U.S. ground  transportation.   My final amendment prohibits Secretary DeVos from funneling public  school money to private schools through so-called Education Freedom  Scholarships.   These amendments protect workers, promote investments in green  infrastructure, and safeguard public education.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for considering them and I urge my  colleagues to support this package.
