 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a  prestigious journalist and outstanding woman, Ms. JoAnn Merrigan of  WSAV News in Savannah.   With over 20 years in reporting, JoAnn has made quite a name for  herself in multiple States for her high-quality news coverage.   She started her career in Iowa, following around Presidential  hopefuls as they began their journey through the primaries. She also  followed local and State-based elections, providing Iowans with the  information they needed to make an informed vote.   After her term in Iowa came to an end, she relocated to northern  California where she continued to deepen her commitment to journalism.   After surviving the Loma Prieta Earthquake, JoAnn traveled around  speaking to survivors and their families to get a better understanding  of this tragedy.   From there, JoAnn moved her career to Nebraska, and eventually  landing in the greatest city in the world: Savannah, Georgia.   Creating quite a respected name for herself, JoAnn has earned an  outstanding number of awards, including the Edward R. Murrow Award for  Investigative Reporting, a Gabby Award, as well as an award from the  Georgia Associated Press Broadcasters Association in 2013.   Her exceptional career in journalism has commanded the respect of  many, including myself, and I am proud to honor her today on the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in the 1970s when Roe v. Wade was decided, ultrasound  technology was in its infancy. The black and white photos that  expectant parents proudly display on their refrigerators and in social  media posts today weren't widely available back then. The general  public could not see the life that was being created, and the medical  community had no clear consensus on when life began.   I have been blessed with many beautiful grandchildren, and I remember  the warmth and love I felt for them the second I saw those 15-week  ultrasound photos. I am beyond grateful. In fact, it is an answer to  many prayers that our Supreme Court has finally made a decision and has  overturned the catastrophic decision that was Roe v. Wade.   What the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision does  is give the power back to the States where it belongs, allowing them to  decide how they want to approach abortion law. But it doesn't stop  here. We must now refocus our attention in a post-Roe world, to  providing aid to our mothers.   Now, this is very important, Mr. Speaker. The Biden administration  has recently come out targeting pharmacists such as myself, trying to  force them to distribute abortion medication at the risk of civil  rights violations. When I was a member of the Georgia State  legislature, I sponsored legislation to allow pharmacists to act in the  best interest of their patient.   President Biden is using pharmacists as political pawns for his pro- abortion agenda. That is truly despicable. This is not the kind of  leadership that should be coming out of the White House.   Life is the most fundamental human right; we must continue to work to  help make it the best that it can be.
