 I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from New York  (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts  (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I support the bipartisan budget deal that  will extend the debt ceiling and lift the current budgets caps for the  next 2 years.   This important deal will avoid harmful cuts to domestic priorities,  prevent a default on our Nation's debt, and finally allow appropriators  to get to work on this year's appropriations bills to fund the  government.   Despite proposing draconian cuts in his budget, I am glad that  President Trump has agreed to join Democrats in permanently ending the  threat of sequester.  [[Page S5289]]    For too long, sequestration has handcuffed Congress's ability to make  investments in middle-class priorities that advance the health,  financial security, and well-being of the American people.   I am pleased that this agreement goes even further than previous  budget deals by increasing nondefense spending by $10 billion more than  defense spending.   With this budget deal, Democrats have secured an increase of more  than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President  Trump took office.   I am especially pleased that this budget deal will allow us to  continue making the big investments in medical research conducted at  the National Institutes of Health, as well as the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, that will improve and save lives.   Because of NIH funding, new treatments have been developed that  reduced cancer deaths more than 25 percent over past two decades.   Thirty years ago, HIV was a death sentence. Because of NIH funding,  that is no longer the case.   Because of NIH-funded research, deaths from heart disease and stroke  have fallen by nearly 80 percent since 1970.   Because of NIH funding, we are on the verge of curing--yes, curing-- sickle cell anemia.   Consider this: Between 2010 and 2016, the Food and Drug  Administration approved more than 200 new drugs and treatments for use  in the United States; every single one of them was developed with NIH  dollars.   Congress has recognized the importance of NIH, which is why we have,  on a bipartisan basis, provided the NIH with $9 billion in additional  funding over the past 4 years, a 30 percent increase in that time.   This agreement will allow us to continue those vital investments.   Most importantly, this agreement will help prevent another harmful  government shutdown from occurring this fall.   While not perfect, this budget deal will finally allow Congress to  get to work on this year's appropriations bills and invest in the  programs that the American people rely on.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in passing this agreement with  overwhelming bipartisan support.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I rise on my behalf and on the behalf of  Senator Tammy Duckworth to express my condolences to the family of SPC  Michael Isaiah Nance. He and fellow paratrooper, PFC Brandon Jay  Kreischer, of Ohio, gave their lives in service to our country on July  29 in Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan.   The early reports on their deaths are that they were shot by an  Afghan soldier at a military base--a so-called green on blue attack.  The incident is under investigation. Isaiah was 24 years old. Isaiah  was the 96th Illinois servicemember to have been killed in Afghanistan  since our invasion began in 2001, and he is 1 of 2,289 American troops  who have died there since that invasion. He was a proud and outstanding  member of the 82nd Airborne. Since enlisting in 2017, he earned the  Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Infantryman Badge, and he  qualified as a Basic Parachutist.   As a member of the Nance family noted, ``He loved his country and  wanted to serve his country. He died doing something that he loved.''   Isaiah arrived in Afghanistan just a few weeks ago, shortly after a  trip to Europe with his mother Shawn Gregoire. He and thousands of  other Americans who are still there were deployed in support of our  NATO-led mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan Army, a  mission known as Operation Freedom's Sentinel. As fate would have it,  when uniformed Army personnel arrived at his house to break this  terrible news to his family, much of the family had already gathered  after having attended the funeral of the Nances' great-grandfather, Sam  [[Page S5292]]  Forest, Jr., who had served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war.   As one member of Isaiah's family noted, ``It was the worst day in our  family's history.''   Isaiah was raised by his mother and grandparents in Chatham, which is  on the South Side of Chicago. He attended college in Florida. After 2  years, he insisted to his mother that he wanted to join the Army. He  wanted to continue his family's tradition of military service not only  as his great-grandfather had but also as several members of his family  still do in the Chicago Police Department.   He told his mother he wanted to pursue his dream. He promised her  that after it was over, he would finish his degree. Shortly after  enlisting, he completed basic training and earned his wings at the  Airborne School at Fort Benning, GA. He became an Automatic Rifleman  who was assigned to Company B, First Battalion, 505th Parachute  Infantry Regiment of the storied 82nd Airborne Division.   The motto of the 82nd Airborne is ``Airborne all the way.'' Isaiah  lived every bit of this motto in his faithful service to America and  with his family and friends. He enjoyed wrestling, traveling the world,  and cheering for his beloved Chicago White Sox. He was a foodie. He  loved good soul food. Perhaps, most especially, he loved spending time  with his younger brother.   As a member of his family noted, he was ``energetic, athletic, funny,  humble''--all of the things you would want your kid to be.   Every Member of the Senate would be proud to have a son like Isaiah.  All of the Members join me in expressing their condolences to his  family at this painful moment and in grieving with them over Isaiah's  bright light--ended all too soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.          ``We've got a friend in Trump;      He's lifting us out of our slump;      We were down--and life was rough;      Too many regs, were way too tough;      After so many years;      We'd just had enough, but;      Now, we've got a friend in Trump.''    Mr. President, that was a song, sung to the tune of Randy Newman's  ``You've Got a Friend in Me,'' written by a former lawyer for Dream  Center Education Holdings about the prospects for their for-profit  college enterprise under a Trump administration.   Earlier this month, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman  Bobby Scott sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos which  revealed damning new details about just how far Dream Center's  ``friends'' at the Trump/DeVos Department of Education would go to  assist as they collapsed.   Details, including that catchy little ditty, were later reported by  the New York Times in an article entitled, ``Emails Show DeVos Aides  Pulled Strings for Failing For-Profit Colleges.''   I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, July 23, 2019]   Emails Show DeVos Aides Pulled Strings for Failing For-Profit Colleges                    (By Erica L. Green and Stacy Cowley)         Washington.--Dream Center Education Holdings, a subsidiary       of a Los Angeles-based megachurch, had no experience in       higher education when it petitioned the federal Education       Department to let it take over a troubled chain of for-profit       trade schools.        But the organization's chairman, Randall K. Barton, told       the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, that the foundation       wanted to ``help people live better lives.''        The purchase was blessed despite Dream Center's lack of       experience and questionable finances by an administration       favorable to for-profit education. But barely a year later,       the company tumbled into insolvency, dozens of its colleges       closed abruptly and thousands of students were left with no       degree after paying tens of thousands of dollars in tuition.        Making matters worse, the college is accused of enrolling       new students and taking their taxpayer-supported financial       aid dollars even after some of its campuses had lost their       accreditation, which rendered their credits worthless.        Company emails, documents and recordings show that part of       why Dream Center kept going is that it thought the Education       Department, which under Ms. DeVos has rolled back regulations       on for-profit education, would try to keep it from failing.       Mr. Barton emailed other Dream Center executives that the       department's head of higher education policy--Diane Auer       Jones, a former executive and lobbyist for for-profit       colleges--had pulled strings to help the company's schools in       their effort to regain a seal of approval from an accreditor,       despite their perilous positions.        In another instance, Dream Center's chief operating officer       told faculty at an endangered campus that Ms. Jones was       changing departmental regulations to help the schools obtain       accreditation retroactively.        Although the Trump administration did eventually cut off       federal aid to the chain of colleges and precipitate their       collapse, Democrats say the department failed to respond to       warning signs.        Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is       the chairman of the House Education Committee, unveiled a       trove of documents, including internal communication between       executives from Dream Center, in a letter to Ms. DeVos this       month. He said the documents suggest that Ms. Jones misled       Congress about her efforts to help shield Dream Center from       its misdeeds.        ``The actions of Dream Center and the Department of       Education's execution of its responsibility to protect       students raise grave concerns,'' Mr. Scott wrote.        Instead of requiring Dream Center to take action, ``the       department informed Dream Center executives that it would       work to retroactively accredit the institutions during the       periods they had lied to students--rewriting history to erase       Dream Center's deceptive marketing practices,'' Mr. Scott       wrote.        The Education Department has maintained it did nothing       wrong.        ``This story is based entirely on a wrongful premise,'' the       department wrote in a statement. ``The full and complete       timeline shows Dream Center did not receive any unique       benefits from policy decisions made by the department. We       simply worked to try and get as many students into a new       program as possible. While we did not achieve a perfect       outcome, our actions helped thousands of students land on       their feet.''        In a response letter to Mr. Scott on Monday, the       department's acting general counsel, Reed D. Rubinstein,       submitted documentation that he said contradicted the       committee's ``unfair suggestions'' that the department       tailored its policies to assist Dream Center and was not       forthcoming with Congress. ``The Department categorically       rejects these allegations,'' he wrote.        ``Dream Center's management received no special       treatment,'' he said.        President Trump has moved to deregulate any number of       industries, from mining and offshore oil exploration to       chemicals and Internet providers. But Ms. DeVos's efforts to       get the government off the backs of for-profit colleges have       come under particular scrutiny, in part because of the       spectacular implosions of for-profit college chains only a       few years ago, in part because people who once worked in the       sector have led the DeVos deregulatory push.        Dream Center's collapse was the first of the new       deregulatory era. Yet Education Department officials       insisted, repeatedly, that its demise had nothing to do with       the administration's policies or efforts. Ms. Jones told       Congress that she did not even know of Dream Center's       accreditation problems at the time the company said she was       working to get it out of its jam. She also told lawmakers the       policy change extending retroactive accreditation had       ``nothing to do with the Dream Center.''        Those assurances are now being questioned.        ``The documents further suggest that department officials       were not forthcoming to Congress and the public about the       information they had about Dream Center's status and       practices,'' Mr. Scott wrote. He is requesting emails, text       messages and interviews with several department officials,       including Ms. Jones.        The letter and documents ``raise questions about whether       the department took steps to allow Dream Center to mislead       students,'' Mr. Scott said.        From the start, the Education Department overlooked red       flags when, in late 2017, Dream Center took control of more       than 100 campuses with 50,000 students from a for-profit       higher-education company, Education Management Corporation.       Around that time, Dream Center's accreditor, the Higher       Learning Commission, notified the organization that it was       about to change two of its schools' accreditation status. Two       Education Department officials, including the agency's       director of accreditation, were copied on the letter.        In January 2018 the accreditor published a notification on       its website stating that the two Dream Center schools were       not accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It ordered       Dream Center to tell students that their courses and degrees       ``may not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and       universities or recognized by prospective employers.''        Yet for five months, Dream Center kept advertising, ``We       remain accredited.''        By July 2018, Dream Center was running out of cash and knew       its accreditation problems could worsen its financial strain.       Emails from that month obtained by the House Education       Committee indicate that Dream Center officials believed that       the Education Department was maneuvering to help it stave off       catastrophe.        In written responses to questions from Congress, the       Education Department said Ms. Jones was first made aware that       the two Dream Center institutions were not accredited on July       10, 2018. She was unaware of the public notice that the       Higher Learning Commission had issued nearly six months       earlier, according to the agency. She was notified a week       later that the institutions were misrepresenting their       accreditation status and ordered them the next day to stop,       the department said.        Ms. Jones was asked during a House Oversight Committee       hearing this spring whether a policy she had issued later       that month that allowed accreditations to be granted       retroactively was aimed at helping Dream Center. ``Absolutely       not. It had nothing to do with the Dream Center,'' she       answered.        But in company emails, Dream Center executives indicated       the Education Department tipped them off on July 3, 2018,       that a new retroactive accreditation policy was coming, a       week before Ms. Jones said she even knew Dream Center had a       problem.        ``We just got off the phone with DOE,'' Mr. Barton wrote.       ``It appears HLC is in sync with retro'' accreditation.        He said Ms. Jones--whom he directly cited by name--had       worked with accreditors, and ``they will all agree to one       plan with department blessing.''        Mr. Barton did not respond to requests for comment on his       emails.        On July 11, Dream Center's chief operating officer told       faculty in a meeting on an Illinois campus that the       department would allow the schools' accreditor to grant       retroactive accreditation. He said department officials       ``changed their regulation to open the door to letting it       happen,'' according to a recording of the meeting obtained by       the committee. He referred to a conversation with Ms. Jones       the week prior where ``she said everybody was going to be       accommodating.''        Weeks later, on July 25, Ms. Jones finalized the plan       allowing retroactive accreditation, which was a major win for       Dream Center.  [[Page S5302]]       While the schools were already slated for closure,       retroactive accreditation would have shielded the company       from legal action for making misleading statements about its       accreditation status.        Ms. Jones said she had begun to revise that guidance months       earlier to allay longstanding concerns about the department's       policy stemming from a dispute involving an accreditor of a       nursing program. The retroactive policy would have also       allowed students to more easily transfer their credits if       they were earned at an accredited institution.        In response to Mr. Scott's accusations, Ms. Jones said, in       a written statement to The New York Times, ``The retroactive       accreditation policy--which had been under discussion long       before I arrived at the department--decided not whether Dream       Center would live or die, but whether or not students could       transfer their credits for the hard work they had       completed.''        In August, after it became public that the two schools       would close, Dream Center's head of regulatory and government       affairs wrote an email to other Dream Center officials       reminding them that communication should be kept confidential       because ``Diane is really working behind the scenes to help       guide us and keep the accreditors aligned.''        Ms. Jones did not directly address the July 3 and July 11       communication from Dream Center officials, but acknowledged       that she had worked with accreditors. She called the Dream       Center accreditation issue a ``messy and complex situation''       and said the accreditor had sent mixed messages about the       status of Dream Center's schools.        Ms. Jones had acknowledged to Congress that she had       concerns about the organization's capacity to manage its       closures, and was in regular communication with a group of       accreditors to devise a plan to allow Dream Center students       to complete their degrees, known as a ``teach-out,'' after       their campuses closed.        ``My goal was to get as many of the more than 8,000       students to new institutions where they could complete their       programs,'' she said. ``I stand firm in my decision to work       collaboratively with accreditors to hold Dream Center       accountable. That Dream Center executives characterize this       as being about them is disingenuous but not surprising. They       were trying to make it appear they had control of the mess       they had made.''        A group of students, represented by the National Student       Legal Defense Network, filed a lawsuit last year, saying       Dream Center issued ``false and misleading'' statements about       its accreditation status, which broke state laws and caused       ``substantial harm'' to more than 1,000 students.        Mr. Scott also pointed to emails documenting the steps the       Education Department took to help Dream Center get hold of       some much-needed cash to prop up its failing campuses.        In an October 2018 email, Dream Center officials were       preparing to request funding from an escrow account managed       by the department.        The funds were intended to offset taxpayer liabilities if       some of the chain's schools closed or failed. Dream Center       wanted to use part of the money to pay for expenses       associated with closing campuses and helping current students       complete their degrees. The department had in August agreed       to release up to $50 million; Dream Center wanted more.        Dennis Cariello, a Dream Center lawyer, sent an email to       company executives before a meeting with A. Wayne Johnson,       who headed the department's office of financial aid. At the       meeting, Mr. Cariello planned to deliver a ``list of the       asks'' that amounted to $75 million.        Mr. Cariello communicated that Mr. Johnson ``asked that I       review the draw requests--there are a few we can't have in       there--bonuses and future rental payments were issues for       him.''        Mr. Cariello declined to comment on the exchange. The       department had released a total of $40 million from the       escrow account to Dream Center by the end of last year,       according to records it sent in response to questions from       Congress.        Education Department officials have maintained that they       worked tirelessly to mitigate the fallout of the Dream Center       collapse. The department restricted the schools' cash flow       from federal student loans after Dream Center went into       receivership in January, barely a month before it cut off       federal student loan funds to Argosy University. That final       move was considered the death knell for the company.        But until then, Dream Center executives had reason to       believe they had friends at the Education Department. In       January 2018, just as Dream Center's schools lost their       accreditation, Ronald L. Holt, a regulatory lawyer on the       Dream Center team, sent a presentation to Dream Center       executives on the state of higher education a year into the       Trump administration.        It Included a song he wrote titled, ``You've Got a Friend       in Trump,'' to the tune of Randy Newman's ``You've Got a       Friend in Me,'' used in the movie ``Toy Story.''       We've got a friend in Trump      He's lifting us out of our slump      We were down--and life was rough      Too many regs, were way too tough      After so many years      We'd just had enough, but      Now, we've got a friend in Trump     Mr. President, back in 2017, Dream Center Education  Holdings, the spinoff of a Christian charity with no previous  experience in higher education, announced its intention to acquire the  campuses of the failing for-profit giant Education Management  Corporation, EDMC, and convert them to nonprofit status.   Among EDMC's most notable brands were the Art Institutes and Argosy  University.   I joined several of my Senate colleagues at the time, raising  concerns about Dream Center's ability to effectively manage this higher  education enterprise in the best interests of students and taxpayers.   Despite our concerns, Secretary DeVos's Department of Education gave  its preliminary approval to the transaction in October 2017, without  conditioning that approval on any restrictions or protections for  students and taxpayers.   The Department's failure to protect students and taxpayers at this  critical juncture set up a chain of events that left thousands of  students harmed and millions in taxpayer dollars wasted.   In November 2017, as part of its own approval of that transaction,  the Higher Learning Commission, HLC, removed accreditation from Dream  Center's newly acquired Art Institute of Colorado and the Illinois  Institute of Art effective January 20, 2018.   HLC transitioned these schools to ``candidates for accreditation,''  during which time they could still receive Title IV funds.   HLC noted that the loss of accreditation could have serious  consequences for current and prospective students and that students  ``should know that their courses or degrees are not accredited by HLC  and may not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and universities  or recognized by prospective employers.''   Because of these risks, HLC required Dream Center to provide students  with ``proper advisement and accommodations.''   But Dream Center failed to comply with these requirements and instead  continued to falsely advertise to students that these institutions  ``remain accredited.''   In June 2018, when several news articles brought the  misrepresentation to light, I wrote to the Higher Learning Commission  asking them to investigate.   I also sent a copy of that letter to the Department of Education.   Then, in August 2018, an article by David Halperin alleged that the  top DeVos postsecondary education official, Diane Auer Jones, directed  Dream Center to continue to represent the Illinois and Colorado  campuses as accredited while she worked behind the scenes to  orchestrate retroactive accreditation.   As Chairman Scott put it in his recent letter, it was an attempt at  ``rewriting history to erase Dream Center's deceptive marketing  practices.''   And, it required changing Department regulations.   I wrote to Secretary DeVos in August about these troubling  accusations.   In a December 4, 2018, response, signed by then-Assistant Secretary  for Legislation and Congressional Affairs Peter Oppenheim, the  Department denied the allegations.   Instead, Mr. Oppenheim's letter asserts that Ms. Jones didn't learn  about the misrepresentation until July 17, 2018.   In response to subsequent written questions, Secretary DeVos further  stated to me that Ms. Jones first learned that HLC had withdrawn  accreditation from the Illinois and Colorado campuses on July 10, 2018.   But, according to emails obtained and released by Chairman Scott, Ms.  Jones appears to have been already working to change Department  regulations to allow Dream Center to obtain retroactive accreditation  before these dates.   A July 3, 2018, internal Dream Center email reads, ``We just got off  the phone with [the Department of Education]. It appears HLC is in sync  with retro-[accreditation].''   Diane Jones is specifically mentioned in the email as being the  Department official working with accreditors to facilitate this.   As reported by the New York Times, in a recorded meeting on July 11,  2018, Dream Center's chief operating officer told faculty in Illinois  that the Department was working to change its regulations to allow  retroactive accreditation.  [[Page S5303]]    As evidence, he specifically referred to a conversation the week  before with Ms. Jones.   These revelations raise the prospect that Secretary DeVos, Ms. Jones,  and other Department officials may have misled me and other members of  Congress in their responses to questions on this matter.   Ultimately, the Dream Center debacle led to thousands of students  being lured into a predatory enterprise on the verge of collapse.   The question is, to what extent did the DeVos Department of  Education, and Ms. Jones in particular, inappropriately aid and abet  Dream Center's exploitation of students and bilking of taxpayers as the  company collapsed.   In February of this year, House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations  Subcommittee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and I asked the Department's  Office of Inspector General to investigate the Department's role in the  Dream Center collapse.   Now, the revelations accompanying Chairman Scott's letter, raise  serious questions about the Department's truthfulness with Congress and  a potential attempt to cover up inappropriate involvement by Ms. Jones  or others.   In his letter, Chairman requested transcribed interviews with several  Department officials, including Ms. Jones, and a host of documents and  correspondence.   I call on Secretary DeVos to immediately comply with these requests,  to direct her Department to fully cooperate with Chairman Scott without  delay. Anything less and we will be forced to ask what exactly  Secretary DeVos is trying to hide.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell you  about a remarkable young man from my hometown of Springfield, IL. His  name is Matthew Blade. In late May, Matthew graduated from Lutheran  High School in Springfield as his class valedictorian. He was also the  president of his senior class, president of his school's Spanish Honor  Society and an Illinois State scholar. He was involved in theater and  Madrigal singers and his school's praise band. He was a member of  Students Against Destructive Decisions. Outside of school, Matthew  volunteers at a local food pantry, and he is an Eagle Scout.   If Matthew Blade had done nothing more, he would be exceptional. What  makes Matthew's accomplishments even more extraordinary is that Matthew  Blade spent half of his high school years battling bone cancer.   He first felt the pain in his left arm when he was 15 years old, a  sophomore. At first, he thought he might have pulled a muscle playing  soccer. When the pain didn't go away, Matthew went in for x rays, then  an MRI. The same day he underwent the MRI, Matthew and his parents,  Doug and Tricia, received the devastating diagnosis. The pain in  Matthew's arm was not a sprained muscles; it was most likely  osteocarcoma, a type of bone cancer.   What Matthew did next tells you a lot about his character. He went to  school, didn't tell anyone about his diagnosis, took a biology exam-- and aced the test.   But Matthew wasn't able to keep his diagnosis private for long. Over  the next 9 months he underwent 18 grueling chemotherapy treatments.  Each time, he had to be hospitalized for 4 or 5 days. His mom Tricia  never left his side. Matthew lost his hair and his eyelashes. When he  was up to it, he went to school, often pulling an I.V. bag on a pole.  When he was too sick for school, he kept up with his lessons from home  or from his hospital bed.   What got him through those hard times, he said, was his faith,  prayers, the love of his family, and ``great doctors and nurses'' at  St. John's Hospital in Springfield and Children's Hospital in St.  Louis. His other saving grace, he says, were his friends, who never  treated him differently and helped him to feel like a normal kid, even  at his sickest.   Matthew undergoes scans every 6 months to monitor his health. His  latest scans, in June, showed ``no detectable cancer.'' These days, his  hair has grown back. He is playing soccer again. He is working this  summer as a counselor at a church summer camp, working with little  kids, ages 5 to 7.   But the cancer changed Matthew in some ways. Early in his treatment,  he had to have a 6-1/2 inch section of his left humerus bone--the long  bone in his upper arm--removed, so he can no longer lift his left arm  above his head. After the surgery, Matthew had to wear a sling, which  made playing his guitar impossible, but Matthew adapted. He learned how  to play the ukulele.   Before his diagnosis, Matthew wanted to be a lawyer. Now, he wants to  be a pediatric oncologist, to help other kids with cancer. He is  looking forward to starting college in the fall at St. Louis  University.   In his valedictory remarks, Matthew told his classmates: ``Life--like  a hike through the mountains--is full of peaks and valleys. The more  time you spend in the valleys, the sweeter the peaks will seem.'' By  his example, Matthew Blade has taught his classmates--and really, our  whole town of Springfield--how to endure life's valleys, and how to  cherish its peaks.   I want to wish Matthew all the best on his accomplishment, and I know  I am not alone in saying that I can't wait to see what he does with the  rest of his remarkable life.                            ____________________
