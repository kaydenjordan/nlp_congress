 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am committed to lowering healthcare  costs, expanding access to high-quality care, and supporting research  and innovation. The healthcare system in the United States needs more  reform and accountability. However, we shouldn't ruin it by turning it  into a government-run healthcare system, whether you want to call it  government-run healthcare system, Medicare for All, or single payer, or  even socialized medicine.   A government-run healthcare system is a one-size-fits-all approach.  It results in longer wait times, delayed care, and do-it-yourself  healthcare because you cannot access a doctor.   In February, the Wall Street Journal highlighted the failure of the  United Kingdom's National Health Service, NHS for short.   They wrote:         Now, the state-funded service is falling apart. People who       suffer heart attacks or strokes wait more than 1\1/2\ hours       on average for an ambulance. Hospitals are so full that they       are turning patients away. A record 7.1 million people in       England--more than one in 10--are stuck on waiting lists for       nonemergency hospital treatment like hip replacements.    But I want to quote from the article of the Wall Street Journal,  another one:         Delays in treating people are causing the premature deaths       of 300 to 500 people a week. One in five British people were       waiting for a medical appointment or treatment by NHS in       December.    If you didn't find that article about the United Kingdom alarming, in  May, British Columbia announced that they are sending cancer patients  to Bellingham, WA, in the United States, for treatment.   A Canadian news outlet wrote this:         Health Minister Adrian Dix announced . . . that eligible       breast and prostate cancer patients will be sent to one of       two clinics in Bellingham for radiation treatment. . . . The       unprecedented move to send thousands of [British Columbia]       patients to the [United  [[Page S4343]]       States] over the next two years is an attempt to address the       backlog in [British Columbia] which has one of the longest       waits for radiation treatment in Canada.    Canada is taking this action because its cancer patients face  unacceptable waiting times. Currently, only 82.9 percent of the British  cancer patients who require radiation start treatment within 28 days.  That means that 17 percent of cancer patients are waiting at least a  month or longer to start cancer treatment.   Canada's single-payer healthcare problems aren't found in just one  province. In January, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ontario is  turning to private healthcare options to fix the growing problem with  its single-payer-funded healthcare system. Canada's most populous  province is allowing more patients to go to private treatment centers  for cataracts and joint replacement surgeries and for services such as  MRIs and CT scans.   The Wall Street Journal writes:         [T]he median wait time in Canada last year between referral       and treatment was between 27.4 weeks, the longest on record,       compared with 9.3 weeks in 1993. Ontario reported the       shortest wait times of 20.3 weeks, while the eastern province       of Prince Edward Island reported the longest at 64.7 weeks.    And, finally, back to Great Britain, a YouGov poll recently found  that Britons are ``pulling their teeth out with pliers'' because they  can't access the National Healthcare Service dentists. The poll found  10 percent of the respondents had attempted do-it-yourself dentistry.   I am committed to improving the healthcare system. I am working to  lower the cost of prescription drugs, maintain access to rural  healthcare, ensure our Nation's seniors can have high-quality,  affordable hearing aids, address high maternal mortality rates, and,  lastly, improve the healthcare delivery systems for kids with complex  medical needs. And that is just to name a few.   However, a government-run healthcare system is not the answer.  British and Canadian healthcare systems are plagued by longer and  longer wait times and delayed care. These government-run healthcare  systems are paying for patients to get care in the United States, not  resorting to DIY healthcare. This body needs to be reminded how  government-run healthcare systems are broken and do not work.   In closing, I ask unanimous consent that the articles I referred to  in my remarks be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Senator Grassley Floor Remarks--More Examples of Socialized Health                          Systems Failing Patients                [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 6, 2023]         The U.K.'s Government-Run Healthcare Service Is in Crisis                    (By David Luhnow and Max Colchester)         For more than a decade, the British government has run its       National Health Service, the world's largest government-run       healthcare system, on a tight budget. The NHS prided itself       on being one of the leanest healthcare systems in the       developed world, spending less per head on average than its       large European neighbors--and far less than the U.S.        Now the state-funded service is falling apart. People who       suffer heart attacks or strokes wait more than 1\1/2\ hours       on average for an ambulance. Hospitals are so full they are       turning patients away. A record 7.1 million people in       England--more than one in 10 people--are stuck on waiting       lists for nonemergency hospital treatment like hip       replacements. The NHS on Monday faced the biggest strike in       its history, with thousands of paramedics and nurses walking       out over pay.        The NHS's woes are an extreme example of issues playing out       across the developed world. Healthcare systems, hit hard by       Covid, are under pressure as people live longer and have a       wider range of treatment options. Aging populations mean       costs will keep growing. The U.K.'s experience is a warning       of what happens when supply in healthcare provision can't       keep up with demand.        ``The healthcare system in the U.K. is facing a crisis like       no other I have seen in my career,'' said Nigel Edwards, the       retiring chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, a healthcare       think tank, and former chief executive for the NHS. ``The       U.K. has mistaken cheapness for efficiency in its approach to       health, and it's coming home to roost.''        The NHS has lost thousands of hospital beds in the past       decade in its drive for efficiency. Covid delayed treatments       for patients, resulting in a vast waiting list. Hospitals in       England were already at 98% capacity in December when the       brutal flu season began to take hold. The mass of sick       patients gummed up the system to devastating effect.        Delays in treating people are causing the premature deaths       of 300 to 500 people a week, according to estimates from the       Royal College of Emergency Medicine, a professional       association in London. One in five British people were       waiting for a medical appointment or treatment by the NHS in       December, according to the U.K. Office for National       Statistics (ONS).        The NHS said those excess death figures are likely too high       but acknowledged delays are costing lives. In late January,       the U.K. government announced funding to provide more       ambulances, call handlers and 1,000 extra hospital beds to       relieve the strain on the health system.        Fixing the service will take time, said NHS chief executive       Amanda. Pritchard. The NHS said that over the next year it       aims to cut the average time a heart attack sufferer waits       for an ambulance to 30 minutes.        ``No one should be waiting longer than necessary for       treatment,'' said Will Quince, a minister of state for       health, adding that the government is spending up to $17       billion over the next two years to address issues facing the       NHS and social care services.        Just before 5 p.m. on Nov. 18, the family of Martin Clark       called 999, the U.K. equivalent of 911, after the 68-year-old       father of five began having chest pains. After waiting half       an hour, the family said, they called again and pleaded for       an ambulance, saying Mr. Clark's condition was getting worse.       In another call 15 minutes later, they told the dispatcher       they were going to drive him to hospital themselves,       according to the family, even though the dispatcher       encouraged them to wait for the paramedics.        Twenty minutes after the family had left for the hospital,       the dispatcher left a voice mail to say the service still       didn't have an ambulance to send. Mr. Clark died shortly       after arriving at the hospital.        About a week later, 5-year-old Yusuf Mahmud Nazir died from       what began as a throat infection. His family said they had       taken the boy, who was having trouble breathing, to the       emergency room at their local hospital in Rotherham, which       gave him some antibiotic pills after a six-hour wait and sent       him home. The family said it pleaded with the hospital a few       days later to let Yusuf be admitted and given further tests,       but were told the hospital was full.        By the time the family got Yusuf by ambulance to another       hospital, he had severe pneumonia. He died days later from       organ failure and cardiac arrest.        ``They killed Yusuf--it's as simple as that,'' said Yusufs       uncle, Zaheer Ahmed, who accompanied the boy's family at the       hospital. ``A 5-year-old boy has died of tonsillitis in a       rich, industrialized country. It shows the entire system has       serious issues.''        The Rotherham hospital said in a public statement it had       met with the family, apologized and launched an independent       investigation into what happened. It declined to comment       further.        Almost every day, media reports allege new horror stories:       An 83-year-old woman in Leicester with a suspected stroke       waited more than 18 hours in a makeshift tent outside a       hospital emergency room. A 90-year-old woman with suspected       sepsis waited three days. A man in Wales with diabetes lost       his toe after it turned blue and then black after he sat       waiting for treatment for three days.        The NHS is Europe's biggest employer, with around 1.2       million staffers, and has a budget this year of about $188.6       billion, funded through taxes. It now has 2.9 doctors per       1,000 people, compared with a European average of 3.7. The       U.S. has slightly less, at about 2.6 doctors per 1,000,       according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and       Development.        Aging populations will add to the demand. The elderly       consume between three and five times the amount of healthcare       compared with younger people, according to an estimate by the       OECD. The number of people in the U.K. aged 85 and above is       expected to double to more than 3 million by 2041. The U.K.'s       current population is around 67 million.        Until 2010, governments of all political stripes kept       funding for the NHS growing faster than both population       growth and inflation--with annual increases from 2% to nearly       6% per capita, adjusted for inflation. But from 2010 to 2020,       per capita, inflation-adjusted funding declined very       slightly.        The Conservative government has sharply increased funds to       the NHS since 2020, but most of the money has gone toward the       pandemic, including for vaccines. Inflation is now eating       away at about half the additional yearly funding. Overall,       the inflation-adjusted increase in funding amounts to a 2.9       yearly increase, still below the historic average of 3.4%,       according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank in       London.        Healthcare expenditures, both public and private, amounted       to around 11.9% of the U.K.'s gross domestic product in 2021,       according to the ONS. That compares with 18.3% of GDP in the       U.S. that year, according to government data.        For the first time since the Industrial Revolution,       Britain's ill health is acting as a brake on economic growth,       said Andy Haldane, a former chief economist at the Bank of       England. The growing number of sick people is exacerbating a       productivity crisis within the British economy, he said. The       number of long-term ill people in the U.K. has shot up by       half a million in the past two  [[Page S4344]]       years, to a record 2.5 million, something economists say is       due in part to the NHS's inability to quickly treat sick       people.        The NHS was created after World War II to offer free       healthcare to a war-hit population. Every hospital was       effectively nationalized and put under government direction.       It was a more sweeping overhaul than in any European country.       Some countries, such as Denmark, adopted a similar system,       while others have varying degrees of private care and       publicly funded insurance.        The NHS has long been a point of pride for many Britons,       who have generally received quality care and can simply walk       out of hospital, without paying a bill. Yet seven in 10 now       describe the NHS service as bad, compared with 21% who       describe it as good, according to a YouGov poll.        People can pay to access private healthcare in the U.K.,       and according to the ONS, one in eight adults in Britain said       they paid for private healthcare in the past year because NHS       waiting lists were too long. Several private healthcare       providers have reported a jump in demand.        Still, the overwhelming majority continue to support the       NHS's basic model of a government-run system. Just 3% said       they wanted the system totally privatized, according to the       YouGov poll.        The government started constraining the NHS's budget in       2010, at the same time it launched an effort to make the       system more efficient, such as adding more internal       competition between different parts of the NHS for government       funds.        These changes proved a distraction for management, former       and current officials say. As part of the drive for       efficiency, NHS managers were pressured to keep bed vacancies       low. Recruiting and training was given less priority, and       salaries for doctors and nurses steadily fell behind       inflation.        When the pandemic hit in early 2020, the NHS's centralized       system helped it weather the crisis. The service delayed non-      urgent treatments, and successfully rolled out a mass       vaccination program.        The ripple effects are being felt now. By December, a total       of 401,537 people in England were waiting more than a year       for hospital treatment. The total was 1,613 just before the       pandemic.        Struggles in the U.K.'s elderly care system, which has       major staff shortages and is funded separately from the NHS,       has also meant that many patients who would normally be       looked after at home or in a retirement home instead       languished in hospital wards.        In December, an average of 13,439 beds a day in England out       of the roughly 100,000 available were taken up by elderly       patients medically fit for discharge--up almost a third from       the previous year, according to the NHS.        The lack of space at hospitals this winter, when the flu       began to take hold, had a cascading effect. Ambulances began       to form lines outside of hospitals, waiting to discharge       patients because of a lack of free beds. That delayed the       time it took for ambulances to attend to other people in       need.        By this winter, half of all patients in an emergency ward       waited four hours or more to be seen by a doctor, and a       further four hours on average to get a bed, according to NHS       data.        A study of more than 5 million patients published in early       2022 by the U.K.'s top medical journal, the BMJ, found that       for every 82 people forced to wait beyond four hours for       emergency care, one additional person died who otherwise       would not have. The longer the wait, the worse the outcomes.        ``Every day, I wake up thinking, how much harm is going to       occur to patients that we are responsible for,'' said Simon       Walsh, head of emergency-room services at a London hospital.       ``It's not if harm is going to occur, it's how much.''        The stress of the pandemic and funding squeeze is       exacerbating a staffing crisis in the U.K. As of September       last year, there were 133,000 staff vacancies in the NHS,       compared with 83,000 before the pandemic, according to       government data.        The average fully qualified family doctor in England is now       responsible for 2,300 patients on average, compared with       2,100 in 2018, according to government statistics. Average       pay has fallen by more than a third since 2008, adjusted for       inflation, according to the British Medical Association, a       union for doctors. The number of doctors who are retiring       early has tripled in the past 13 years.        While the overall numbers of nurses have remained stable,       turnover has grown. From mid-2021 to mid-2022, more than       34,000 nurses left their role in the NHS, an increase of 25%       from the previous year, according to the King's Fund, a       healthcare think tank.        Demands for increases in spending are coming up against       economic pressures. The Bank of England projects the U.K.'s       economy will shrink this year, potentially lowering tax       revenues. And as changes in demographics and medical       technology continue to weigh on the NHS, everhigher funding       risks crowding out state spending in other areas, such as       education and infrastructure.        Money alone may not solve the problem, some in the industry       warn. In Wales, the regional government has for most years       since 2000 spent more money per capita than any region in the       U.K. Yet nearly every indicator from waiting times to health       outcomes are still worse. One explanation: Wales is both       poorer and has the oldest population in the U.K.        Focus is turning to whether the system needs to be       revamped. In Scotland, which runs its own NHS, officials have       discussed ideas including further rationing of care or having       wealthier residents pay for care in order to fund free care       for the rest--an option that officials say was discarded.        One former U.K. health secretary recently said patients       should pay to see a doctor. The idea was quickly dismissed by       the government.        Just over a year ago, Akshay Patel, an IT professional in       northern England, made five calls to 999 when his mother,       Bina Patel, developed breathing problems. Initially the call       handler told him an ambulance would be there soon, Mr. Patel       said. His mother's health quickly worsened and she became too       sick to be loaded into a car. He watched his distressed 56-      year-old mother gradually go pale and die. The paramedics       arrived after an hour and were unable to resuscitate her. The       local hospital was a 2-minute drive away.        ``We always believe that the NHS exists for us when we're       in need,'' said Mr. Patel. ``But personally if I had to call       an ambulance. I wouldn't. I don't trust them. I can't.''                                   ____                [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 21, 2023]         Canada Pursues Private Options To Ease Healthcare Backlogs                              (By Vipal Monga)         Toronto.--Ontario is the latest Canadian province that is       turning to private healthcare options in a bid to fix growing       problems with the publicly funded healthcare system.        Canada's most-populous province this past week outlined a       plan to allow more patients to go to private treatment       centers for cataract and joint-replacement surgeries as well       as for services such as MRIs or CT scans. The province will       invest more than 18 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to       $13.4 million, in the private facilities to increase their       capacity.        Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the moves would reduce the       backlog of 206,000 surgeries in the province and free up       public hospitals to concentrate on more-complicated       procedures. Patients wouldn't pay out of pocket, and the       treatments would be covered by the provincial insurance plan,       said Mr. Ford.        British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Quebec have all       in recent years increased the role of private clinics in       their provinces.        Health authorities across Canada have been grappling with       long wait times in emergency rooms, backlogs for surgeries       and shortages of doctors and nurses.        According to the Fraser Institute, a public-policy think       tank, the median wait time in Canada last year between       referral and treatment was 27.4 weeks, the longest on record,       compared with 9.3 weeks in 1993. Ontario reported the       shortest wait time of 20.3 weeks, while the eastern province       of Prince Edward Island reported the longest at 64.7 weeks.        Former government officials have been calling for a rethink       of the way the Canadian system has been structured.        Bill Morneau, former finance minister under Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau, said in a memoir published this past week       that Canada needed to change a system that costs the country       an amount equal to roughly 13% of gross domestic product.        Peter Nicholson, who advised then-Prime Minister Paul       Martin in the early 2000s, said in a policy paper earlier       this month that Canada should look to countries such as       Australia, Germany and Norway, which have used private       healthcare to improve their systems.        Canada's healthcare system is run separately by each       province.        In Ontario, healthcare unions have said Mr. Ford's plan       would enrich the private providers at the expense of the       public hospitals and create a system in which wealthy       residents get better services and treatment. Mr. Ford's       government has said that residents wouldn't have to pay for       procedures covered by the provincial insurance plan, but the       private clinics would be able to sell patients more-expensive       products not covered by the insurance.        Sharleen Stewart, president of SEIU Healthcare, which       represents 60,000 Canadian healthcare workers, said the plan       risks starving public hospitals of resources and siphoning       doctors and nurses into private clinics, which could worsen       outcomes for more-complex surgeries and deepen an already-      acute healthcare labor shortage. ``It will be a two-tiered       system,'' she said.        Job vacancies in healthcare and social services rose to a       record high of about 150,100 in the third quarter of last       year as demand for nurses surged, according to Statistics       Canada. The Canadian healthcare system could be short 44,000       doctors by 2028, according to government projections.        Mr. Ford said his plan is meant to deal with the lingering       impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused delays for       patients who needed treatment for nonpriority conditions or       wanted to have tests done. Hospital wait times have surged       since 2020. Patients in Ontario spent an average of 22.9       hours in an emergency department before being admitted to a       hospital in October, the longest average wait time on record,       according to provincial data.        There are roughly 900 private clinics in Ontario, most of       which only do diagnostic testing; 10 private clinics are       licensed to perform surgeries. More would open under the       government's plan.        During his announcement, Mr. Ford dismissed the concerns       about how treatments  [[Page S4345]]       are delivered. He said something must be done quickly to       reduce the backlog of surgeries in the province. ``A lot of       people out there, they want to have the endless debates about       who should provide care,'' Mr. Ford said. ``All our       government cares about is that you get the care you need       quickly and safely.''        Other supporters said that the plan could provide patients       with more options, give them greater access to timely care       and relieve stress on a system that has begun to buckle.        ``We need to be more effective at deploying resources we       currently have,'' said Allan O'Dette, chief executive of the       Ontario Medical Association, a group that represents 43,000       doctors and medical students and that supports Ontario's       plan. ``Noncomplicated, low-acuity surgeries can easily be       done outside a hospital setting.''                                   ____                    [From the Vancouver Sun, May 16, 2023]   Sending B.C.

Health Minister       Adrian Dix announced Monday that eligible breast and prostate       cancer patients will be sent to one of two clinics in       Bellingham for radiation treatment, starting May 29. The       unprecedented move to send thousands of B.C. patients to the       U.S. over the next two years is an attempt to address the       backlog in B.C. which has one of the longest waits for       radiation treatment in Canada.''

Currently, 82.9 per cent of B.C. cancer patients who require       radiation start treatment within 28 days, Dix said. That's       well below the national average of 97 per cent, according to       figures compiled by the Canadian Institute for Health       Information. ``We want to be at 95 to 100 per cent within 28       days,'' he said. The percentage of British Columbians       receiving timely radiation has steadily declined, down from       93 per cent in 2019. Dix in February announced the government       will spend $440 million over the next 10 years to reduce the       waiting times for cancer treatment. Some of that money will       boost wages for radiation technologists and oncologists as       part of the recruitment drive, Dix said. The province is also       trying to acquire more linear accelerators, a specialized       piece of equipment which delivers external beam radiation       therapy to target and shrink cancer cells. Radiation therapy       is different from chemotherapy, which uses special drugs to       kill the cancer cells. More than 30,000 people in B.C. were       diagnosed with cancer in 2021 and B.C. Cancer projects that       number could rise to 45,000 by 2034. About half of cancer       patients need radiation treatment.''

People across the UK have       had to pull their own teeth out because they can't access or       afford an NHS dentist, a report suggests. Extractions have       been performed with pliers in some cases, while others have       been forced to make a five-hour round trip to see a       professional. The Health and Social Care Committee says       ``urgent and fundamental reform'' is needed--and there is       evidence of pain and distress that is ``totally unacceptable       in the 21st century''. Its report includes figures from a       YouGov poll performed in March 2023 that found 10% of       respondents had attempted ``DIY dentistry''--and of those,       20% did so because they couldn't find an NHS dentist.''
