 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in the 2016 election, we saw a very real threat to our  Nation when Russia interfered in our elections by using a  misinformation campaign through social media and attacking voter  registration databases. While this interference from Russia is  unacceptable, I feel it is necessary to point out that there is no  evidence that any voting machines were hacked in the 2016 or even in  the 2018 elections.   However, this does not mean that there isn't a need for election and  cybersecurity improvements for State election systems. On this point, I  know my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  including the distinguished chairperson of our Committee on House  Administration, we all agree that no one--and I mean, no one--should  interfere with our elections. Every Americans' vote should be counted  and protected.   Last Congress $380 million were appropriated to States to upgrade  their election security. Also, election infrastructure was designated  as critical infrastructure in response to the U.S. Intelligence  Community's reports that the Russian Government attacked.                                time  0930    This allowed the Department of Homeland Security to begin providing  additional cybersecurity assistance to State and local election  officials.   Work has been done to help States improve their election security,  and more work must be done. This is why our committee Republicans, all  of us on the House Administration Committee, introduced H.R. 3412, the  Election Security Assistance Act, to assist States in their election  security strengthening efforts.   This realistic legislation provides $380 million in Federal grants to  States to update their aging and at-risk election infrastructure, while  also requiring State and local officials to have some skin in the game.  We require a 25 percent match to ensure that they understand they are  getting the best equipment that is going to protect their voters'  rights to have their votes counted and protected.   In addition, our bill is the only bill that creates the first ever  Election Cyber Assistance Unit, aimed at connecting our State and local  election officials with leading election administration and  cybersecurity experts from across the country.   Our bill also empowers State officials by providing security  clearances to our election officials to better facilitate the sharing  of information and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to  notify State election officials of cyberattacks and any foreign threats  within the State.   It is common sense that if there is an attempt to hack a State  election, the State election official should be notified, but they are  currently not able to let a State know if it has been attacked. If DHS  is the one that sees this attack from a foreign country, they can't  notify State election officials because, in many cases, they don't have  security clearance.   Our bill clears this up. Those State officials deserve the right to  know who is trying to attack their elections in each State in this  great Nation.   My good friend, Congresswoman Torres, stated at the Rules Committee  hearing on Monday night that she doesn't trust her State election  officials in California to have security clearances. Personally, I  don't feel that way, and I think other Members of Congress may agree  with me.   State officials should know if there is a threat to their election  system, and DHS should be the one telling them.   To sum up the Election Security Assistance Act, our solution provides  much-needed election security improvements and reinforcements for local  election officials, without overstepping the States' authority to  determine and maintain their own elections.   Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the bill we are voting on  today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  [[Page H5216]]  the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, I certainly hope my good  friend from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) changes his mind and wants more  Republican governments, but I don't think that is going to happen, even  today, on the House floor.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), another good friend of mine from  the great State of Florida.    Madam Speaker, look, I respect and  agree with my good friend from Illinois (Mr. Casten), my colleague. We  want to protect our home State. We saw intrusion into our Illinois  State Board of Elections voter registration system. It is something  that had to be addressed.   I am happy to report, after talking with the State Board of Election  officials, they have been given resources already appropriated by a  Republican majority Congress, Republicans in the Senate, and President  Trump last year to effectively ensure that that information is not  vulnerable again.   What we are debating here today is a bill that will put more unfunded  and underfunded mandates on States like Illinois. That is not what our  local election officials in my district asked for.   The reason Illinois was able to protect itself and ensure that it  didn't happen again in the extremely high, historic turnout of the 2018  midterm election was because they were given the flexibility to spend  the HAVA funds that Republicans in Congress ensured that the State of  Illinois had, leading to a Democratic majority in the midterm  elections.   No one is questioning the safety and security of our midterm  elections. No one has told me that any foreign entity hacked into any  institution, voter registration system, or machines. Maybe DHS hasn't  called me, even though I think I have a security clearance, so they  could.   But they can't call our local election officials, under this bill, if  it happens again because they don't have security clearance. That is  why our bill is a better choice.   The one that is on the floor today does not address the concerns of  States like mine, and it certainly does not address the concerns of  States like California.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my fellow House Administration  Committee Republican and one of my good friends here in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), our Republican Policy Committee  chair.    I yield the gentleman from Alabama an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I might consume.   Madam Speaker, I agree with my good friend from Maryland. We as  Republicans and Democrats need to do the patriotic thing and make sure  that our elections are protected.   And I do agree that the Russians tried to interfere in our election  process with misinformation campaigns. But I also want to ask my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if their concentration on  election security happened the day after the 2016 election, why in the  world didn't the administration who was in the White House at the time  when the intelligence analysts were talking about how other foreign  entities, including Russia, were wanting to interfere in our elections,  why didn't they do something about it?   Why are we here today?   Why didn't it happen before the 2016 election, when our intelligence  analysts said nefarious activity was moving against the United States  of America?   They did nothing. The Obama administration did nothing. They let it  go.   Now we are here watching the new Democrat majority that was elected  in 2018, after explosive turnout in our midterm elections, their first  bill, H.R. 1, that every member of the Democratic majority cosponsored  and supported, that is the solution?   The solution is to add millions of taxpayer dollars and then the  first ever corporate dollars into their own congressional campaign  accounts?   No one has ever said that is the solution to too much money in  politics or  [[Page H5220]]  to election security. Not one time have I had a constituent say that to  me.   Now, we have got to come together and do what is right.   We have yet to address any of the issues that were laid out in the  Mueller report. This bill we are debating today does not address any of  them. This is a discussion about what happened in 2016 without a  discussion of what is needed in our States and local election  authorities.   That is what is wrong with this bill, too. It is hypocrisy at its  greatest.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I agree with my distinguished colleague from  California that we do need to have the ability for the Department of  Homeland Security  [[Page H5221]]  and our intelligence officials to notify our State and local election  officials if they see nefarious activity, but right now under the bill  we are debating today, that would not be the case, because in many  cases, DHS won't talk to local election officials or State election  officials because they don't have security clearances.   Our bill, pushed by the Republicans on the House Administration  Committee, would allow the communication to take place.                                time  1015    You know, we hear a lot of talk about patriotism coming up on the  Fourth of July. I believe we are all patriots in this institution, but  I believe, also, we have to govern together.   We were working on a bipartisan solution to election security, and  all of the sudden, we were told no more negotiations. That is not how I  thought this institution worked. I thought we could work together.   Well, I do want to respond to a couple of comments that my colleague  from California made. She may have mentioned H.R. 1. H.R. 1 was the  Democrats' attempt to address not only too much money in politics, they  said; they also wanted to address election security.   Clearly, what H.R. 1 did was do nothing to affect the money that is  coming into politics, and it is not doing enough to ensure that our  elections are not impacted by foreign entities with nefarious  intentions.   Our bill today that we hoped could have been debated but was voted  down on a party-line vote in the House Administration Committee earlier  this week, just a few days ago, we hoped we could have come up with  that, that is a bipartisan solution that would have worked. What works,  our last speaker said, was this. Clearly, that is not what works.   What works isn't voting for a bill like H.R. 1 that votes to put the  first ever corporate money directly into every Member of Congress'  campaign accounts. What works, clearly, is not taxpayer money to fix  that problem when there are not enough corporate malfeasance funds.  That is not what the American people wanted.   And what would have worked would have been the last administration,  the Obama administration, listening to their intelligence agencies and  doing something about nefarious activities before the 2016 election,  not the day after, when Democrats decided to take this issue on.   And then all I ever hear is they are going to blame Mitch McConnell.  Well, I had no idea, before 2016, that the Obama administration ceded  Presidential authority to the Senate majority leader. I had no idea  that happened.   Everything is Mitch McConnell's fault, right? He is the one who told  the intelligence agencies to stand down. Are you kidding me?   And now we hear we should have done something. You are darn right we  should have done something. You are darn right the Obama administration  should have done something. You are darn right they should have done it  when they first heard about it before the 2016 election, and now here  we are to fix it.   And today's bill is clearly not a fix.   We have got some issues, and it is really interesting to see my  colleagues from California come up and not want to address a practice  like ballot harvesting that is illegal in the State of North Carolina,  where a Republican who did it is likely to go to jail for it, but the  same process is legal in the State of California--disastrous.   You want to talk about trying to determine the outcome of elections?  We have put forth amendment after amendment to address ballot  harvesting, with complete party-line votes against making sure the  process that is illegal in North Carolina that a Republican operative  will likely go to jail for is completely legal in States like  California.   And you want to talk about determining the outcome of an election?  Come on.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my  good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I really respect my colleague from North Carolina, and  I do want to correct him a little bit.   I am from Illinois, not Ohio. I would never mistake the gentleman  from North Carolina as being from someplace like South Carolina. But  the gentleman from North Carolina is a good friend.   Look, we all have disagreements on this House floor, but that doesn't  mean we are disagreeable when it comes to having good friendships, and  I thank him for his courtesies and thank him for his friendship.   The State of North Carolina is a great example of why we need to do  better, why we ought to go back to the drawing board.   Let's take this bill off the floor. Let's get back to bipartisan  negotiations, because in States like North Carolina and States like  Illinois where local election officials have bought machines, they  bought machines, maybe they have current optical scan machines, but the  requirement in this bill, as the Oklahoma secretary of state said, the  requirement of this bill to have recycled paper through ballots, many  of the already purchased optical scan machines that would be required  for every local and State election official to purchase after the year  2022 may not be able to read the ballots on recycled paper. So you are  going to have to reinvest hard-earned tax dollars where many local  communities in our great States have already invested in updating their  election security with the most secure election equipment that they  felt was going to protect them.   Washington should not be telling our local officials what to buy,  especially when there are provisions in this bill that make equipment  that would fit  [[Page H5222]]  those guidelines illegal to use or are inoperable even if they have  purchased it. We have got to do better.   We all want to protect this great Nation. We all want free and fair  elections so that every vote is counted and protected. Let's do it  together. Let's do it right.   Let's make sure we address some DHS concerns. Let's put a  cybersecurity assistance unit together like we have tried to do.   Let's outlaw ballot harvesting, because I know we have got bipartisan  support in working together on that issue, especially with my good  friend from North Carolina, Mr. Butterfield. I look forward to working  with him on this. I know he and I both have concerns about this  process, and I thank him for his willingness to sit down and talk.   We can do better. The bill on the floor today is not better. Let's do  it. Let's work together. Pull this bill off the floor. We have got a  lot of other issues to debate today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have  left?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, well, clearly the timekeeper is wrong. I obviously  thought I had more, but I am not able to debate that today. I will go  ahead and close.   I do want to thank my colleague from California and also the members  of the House Administration Committee, where we have an opportunity to  come together, but this bill is just simply another partisan bill by  the majority aimed at federally mandating election standards, like  mandating that States exclusively use paper ballots, effectively  banning any type of digital recording device that would have even a  verified paper backup.   The committee even had one hearing on this issue with Commissioners  from the EAC--remember, that agency that one speaker earlier said was  getting a pittance of dollars, small amounts of dollars over the last  few years. Only in this institution is $380 million given by the  Republican majority here in the House in the last Congress and signed  into law by the President of the United States, only in this  institution is $380 million a little bit. A lot of that money still  hasn't even been spent by our local election officials.   So here we are today debating a bill that is going to basically  commit 1.3 billion taxpayer dollars toward so-called election security.  We still have not addressed the problem that if DHS, if our same  intelligence officials who told the Obama administration that there was  foreign interference in our 2016 elections and the Obama administration  did nothing about it--because, why? Because of Mitch McConnell. It is  Mitch McConnell's fault.   Seriously, come on. Get real here. We are legislators. We are an  equal branch of government. There is absolutely no way any  administration cedes authority to anybody in this legislative  institution.   The Obama administration failed to address the problem of election  interference in 2016, and here we are today trying to make sure that we  fix it. This attempt to fix it is a partisan attempt at ensuring that  our elections authorities and our States and our local election  officials have a top-down, federally mandated approach that is going to  potentially cost them millions of taxpayer dollars that they have  already inserted into their own budgets over the last few years.   Our local officials have told us they want flexibility. Cybersecurity  concerns are where they have invested much of the $380 million that we  put forth in the last Congress.   Let's make sure we spend the money that we have already appropriated;  let's make sure we take a commonsense approach; and let's give our  election officials, Republicans and Democrats from throughout this  great Nation, the ability to address the concerns they know are weakest  in their own system. Let's not have some bureaucrat out here in a  concrete building determining what is going to work best in the State  of Texas, in the State of Illinois, in the State of California, or  anywhere else.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to take from the Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill  passed the Senate with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's  desk immediately for his signature.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  motion to recommit.   For months, we have heard about the interference in our elections and  the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, this report right here.  But nothing in this bill that we are debating today and voting on today  before this body now addresses the concerns that have been raised in  this report.   Mr. Speaker, nothing in the bill we are debating today addresses the  concerns of foreign interference raised in the special counsel's report  that I am holding right now. What we know is that Russia attempted to  interfere in our 2016 election through a misinformation campaign, email  hacking, and by exploring vulnerabilities of registration databases.  This is gravely concerning to every Republican and Democrat in this  institution.   But what does the Federal Government telling States that they must  replace their safe, new, and auditable machines have to do with  addressing these concerns? What does a hand recount mandate have to do  with these concerns? What does recycled paper have to do with these  concerns?   The tremendous costs associated with these Federal mandates only  serve to draw resources away from the real vulnerabilities our States  face.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also represented  that Republicans have done nothing to address foreign interference in  our elections, and that, Mr. Speaker, is simply not true.  [[Page H5244]]    In 2017, this country's election infrastructure was designated as  critical infrastructure, thereby allowing the Department of Homeland  Security to immediately begin offering voluntary assistance to State  and local election officials in the form of cybersecurity advisers,  assessments, threat detection and prevention tools, information  sharing, and incident response.   Additionally, the 115th Congress, last Congress, a Republican- controlled Congress, appropriated $380 million to States prior to the  2018 midterms to bolster election security and $26 million to DHS to  add additional staff and carry out their assessment efforts, allowing  for unprecedented cooperation between DHS and all 50 States and 1,400  localities in 2018.   Earlier this year, $33 million was appropriated to DHS to continue  these assistance efforts, and earlier this week, the Republicans, my  fellow Republicans, Mr. Walker and Mr. Loudermilk, on the House  Administration Committee, introduced our own Election Security  Assistance Act.   So don't tell me we are not taking this seriously.   While so much of the focus has been on foreign interference today, we  must not forget that we had a Member not seated this Congress following  evidence that political operatives illegally harvested unsealed and  only partially filled-out ballots. This practice is legal in many  States, but as we have seen, it is ripe for fraud and abuse.   Republicans have offered multiple amendments to prohibit this  practice in H.R. 1 and, now, the SAFE Act, each failing on a party-line  vote. If we can't agree that this fraudulent practice should be banned,  let us at least agree that foreign nationals should not be harvesting  the ballots of American citizens.   Right now, a Russian operative could walk freely around States like  California, for example, collecting and turning in absentee ballots,  completely altering the outcome of an election. But my colleagues have  shown no interest in addressing this huge vulnerability simply because  it serves their interest only in certain States.   This practice invites a constitutional crisis. America, Mr. Speaker,  is watching this vote right now. My amendment today would require the  chief election official of each State to disclose to the Election  Assistance Commission the identity of any known foreign national who  has physically handled ballots, machines, or has had unmonitored access  to the storage facilities or tabulation centers used to support  elections, or even unmonitored access to election-related information  or communication technology. This takes an additional step in rooting  out foreign interference and lets the process of legislating about  election security finally begin.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit. Vote to  protect our elections from interference from foreign countries like  Russia, China, and all others. Vote to preserve the integrity of our  ballot, and vote to restore the American people's trust in our  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
