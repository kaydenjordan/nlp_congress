 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Workplace  Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the increasingly harsh workplace  conditions that nurses, doctors, social workers, and other healthcare  workers have endured to keep our communities going. But even before the  pandemic, healthcare and social service workers faced a  disproportionate risk of on-the-job violence and injuries.   A few year ago, two workers in Oregon were tragically wounded in a  workplace stabbing at an organization that provides essential services  to youth who are facing addiction, homelessness, and behavioral health  issues. Following the incident, Oregon AFSCME members organized to  improve working conditions that were compromising the quality of  services for vulnerable clients and the safety of the employees.   Workers across the country, like the workers at Outside In, in  Portland, need an evidence-based workplace violence prevention plan  tailored to the needs of the vulnerable populations they serve. Today,  we have a chance to support their safety and well-being in the  workplace.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the  legislation from the Emergency Nurses Association.                                   Emergency Nurses Association,                                                  February 23, 2021.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Courtney: On behalf of the Emergency       Nurses Association (ENA) and our more than 52,000 members, I       am writing to express our support for H.R. 1195, the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act of 2021. This important and timely       legislation will ensure that health care and social service       employers undertake steps to protect their employees and       patients from violence in the workplace.        As you know, workplace violence against health care       workers, including emergency nurses, has become a national       crisis. According to the Occupational Safety and Health       Administration (OSHA), workers in the health care sector       accounted for only 20% of workplace injuries yet comprised       approximately 50% of all victims of workplace assault. The       same study found that between 2002 and 2013, serious       incidents of workplace violence were four times more common       for workers in the health care sector versus all workers in       the U.S.        Unfortunately, assaults and batteries directed at workers       occur at especially high rates in emergency departments       (EDs), which are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and       are required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor       Act (EMTALA) to stabilize and treat all patients. Often,       health care professionals in the ED interact with members of       the public when emotions run high and their behavior can       sometimes become violent. Research has found that emergency       nurses and other personnel in the ED experience a violent       event about once every two months. Further, a 2011 study       reported that one-third of emergency nurses had considered       leaving the profession due to workplace violence.        The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and       Social Service Workers Act will ensure that health care       employers, including hospitals, take specific steps to       prevent workplace violence and ensure the safety of patients       and workers. This bill will require health care and social       service employers to develop and implement a comprehensive       violence prevention plan which must include procedures to       identify and respond to risks that make workplaces vulnerable       to violent incidents. In addition, the legislation will help       ensure that employees are appropriately trained in mitigating       hazards.        Emergency nurses are disproportionately victims of assaults       in the workplace. We would like to thank you for introducing       this important legislation and your leadership on this       critical issue.            Sincerely,                                        Ron Kraus, MSN, RN, EMT,                                                 CEN, ACNS-BC, TCRN,                                                2021 ENA President.     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Courtney for his  leadership on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
