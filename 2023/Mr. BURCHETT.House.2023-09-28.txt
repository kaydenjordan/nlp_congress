 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would do one thing: It will  reduce the salary of the special assistant to the director of  programming at Voice of America to $1.   This amendment follows an internal investigation which concluded the  special assistant to the director of programming at Voice of America  had misused Federal taxpayer dollars and lied on her resume. She was  fired under the previous administration and then rehired at the  beginning of this administration.   Mr. Chair, I submit to you that people who misuse taxpayer dollars  have no business being paid by taxpayers, and they should be fired.   We need to get rid of corruption in our government. My amendment  would do just that. I am requesting to reduce her salary to $1.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I submit to you that the duty of folks that  work for the American taxpayer is not to lie and not to take taxpayer  money illegally.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on this amendment, which  will reduce the salary of the chief management officer for the U.S.  Agency for Global Media to $1.   The chief management officer of the U.S. Agency for Global Media is  responsible for rehiring Setareh Sieg, who knowingly misused Federal  tax dollars and lied on her resume.   Whistleblowers have come forth to shed light on the rampant misuse of  taxpayer dollars, and the chief management officer at the U.S. Agency  for Global Media is responsible for rehiring the individual that did  so.   There should be no place for this conduct in public service, Mr.  Chair. I am requesting the salary of the chief management officer at  the U.S. Agency for Global Media be reduced to $1.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we cannot continue to keep rewarding bad  behavior. This isn't some soccer game where nobody keeps score and  everybody gets a trophy. This is the American government. We are  responsible to the taxpayers for this money.   I submit to you, Mr. Chair, that this type of activity, if we turn  the other cheek, it will continue to run rampant in our society and in  our government, and we have got to start somewhere, Mr. Chair.   We are $33 trillion in debt, and paying people that are doing things  that are illegal should not be the makeup of this government.  [[Page H4791]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would reduce the salary of  the deputy chief executive officer at the U.S. Agency for Global Media  to $1.   The deputy chief executive officer at the U.S. Agency for Global  Media is also responsible for rehiring Setareh Sieg, who knowingly  misused taxpayer dollars and lied on her resume.   Whistleblowers come forward to shed light on the rampant misuse of  taxpayer dollars, and the deputy chief executive officer at the U.S.  Agency for Global Media is responsible for rehiring the individual that  did so.   There should be no place for this conduct in public service, and I am  requesting the salary of the deputy chief executive officer at U.S.  Global Media to be reduced to $1.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, if misusing public Federal tax dollars is  part of our policy, I suggest to you that we need to get a new policy.  [[Page H4827]]    This is what is wrong with this country. It is wrong when we tell our  children, well, it is okay for these folks up here to steal because  they are in the Federal Government. That is why nobody trusts us up  here.   We can cover this up with flowing words, but the reality is it is  wrong to knowingly misuse Federal tax dollars.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment does one thing, it would  prohibit funding for the Art in Embassies program. At a time when the  government is nearing a shutdown, we don't need the State Department  spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on paintings and sculptures.   During the shutdown at the end of 2018, the State Department spent  $84,000 on a Bob Dylan sculpture.   Mr. Chair, I submit to you, I did not know Bob Dylan was a sculptor,  his real name is Bobby Zimmerman. He did have a song out when he became  a Christian for a while that was called ``Gotta Serve Somebody.'' We  need to be serving the taxpayers up here, and obviously we are not.   We are $33 trillion in debt. The State Department can continue its  work without expensive art throughout our embassies. The government  needs to cut its budget, and there is no better place to start than on  unnecessary and high-priced art galleries for the State Department.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Mr. Chair, I submit to you what is disingenuous is the  fact that most of this art is never viewed by the public or the people  coming in. It is put in the embassy back offices. It is not out front.  It doesn't show anything about this country other than we are hiding  this stuff in the back for the well-placed embassy employees, and the  rank-and-file ones never even see it.   I submit to you this is obviously another boondoggle. We need to  start somewhere. This is a good start, Mr. Chair. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment does one thing: It prohibits  funding for the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.   This envoy has provided no discernible value to the American people.  I remind you, he is nonelected. I don't believe he was even confirmed  by the Senate, but Secretary Kerry uses his position in this special  envoy to fly around the world in private and heavy-polluting jets so he  can attend the coronation of King Charles III on the taxpayers' dime.   Somebody please remind me how this is helping the American people or  even addressing his climate concerns. I submit to you it is making them  worse, according to their statistics and facts.   He recently stated the American people would need to contribute  trillions of dollars to fix the climate. Trillions  [[Page H4828]]  of dollars. Mr. Chair, this is nonsense. This special envoy should not  exist. I am asking to prohibit any funds for it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I submit to you that having a  multimillionaire fly around in a private jet does very little for the  image of global climate issues. I also submit to you that he has no  scientific background. He has not been elected nor has he even been  ordained by our U.S. Senate. I submit to you that this is not a good  issue, and tying the hands of this country while the folks in India,  China, and some of these other countries continue to pollute, to me, is  counterproductive.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), my friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
