 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to a share story of the Ridley  School District, which is leading the charge in our community to raise  awareness of the importance of the upcoming Census.   Under the leadership of Kelli Mullany, the director of pupil  services, the Ridley School District has launched a districtwide effort  to ensure a complete and fair count in the 2020 Census.   Ten years ago, Pennsylvania undercounted over 25,000 children,  resulting in a loss of nearly $44 million in funding for critical  programs like healthcare, SNAP, school lunches, affordable housing,  teacher training, and classroom technology. These programs were all  impacted by the undercount.   Since children are among those most likely to be undercounted, it is  particularly important for schools like Ridley to promote a complete  Census count. Community leaders like Kelli are working hard alongside  local churches, preschools, shelters, housing authorities, public  libraries and using social media to spread the word that we all count.   The Census is the basis for how the Federal Government distributes  billions of tax dollars, so we need a complete count. Our children and  our communities can't afford another undercount this year. We all need  to spread the word that the Census is easy, safe, and important.                            ____________________
