 Mr. Speaker, I rise for  what will likely be the last time I address the House.   First, I thank the people of New Mexico for entrusting me to  represent you in Washington, holding me accountable, and giving me  direction. From my first day in Congress to my last, every constituent  or stakeholder who stopped me on the street or walked into my office,  your office, to tell me about their issues and priorities was my boss.  It has been the honor of a lifetime to work with you.   Thank you to our team of brilliant, passionate staff who worked early  mornings, late nights, and weekends because they knew just how  important our work was to the people we served. Our team secured  hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal investments in our State's  economy and returned almost $5 million in earned benefits to New Mexico  veterans, seniors, and taxpayers.   Your dedication to New Mexico changed lives. Lastly, thank you to all  the Members with whom I had the pleasure of serving who helped ensure  that my time here was a success.   Whether it was Congressman Meadows helping me launch an investigation  into SNAP mismanagement in New Mexico, Congressman Cole for helping  pass Care Corps grants to assist caregivers, or Congressman O'Halleran  for working with me to pass the first-ever economic development  broadband grant program in the farm bill, I have worked with and  learned from Members on every part of the political spectrum. And  regardless of our differences, I have found a universal passion for  solving problems and public service.   Every Member here understands the privilege and responsibility of  working in the most powerful institution in the world and the  immeasurable potential of this body to address the problems that we  were elected to solve. Our shared values and commitment to each other  is always and has been this institution's greatest strength.   To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson: Let us never forget that the  differences of opinion are not differences of the fundamental  principles that unite us as Americans. We are all Democrats. We are all  Republicans.   I believe that we can embrace our differences of opinion in a shared  effort to form a more perfect union while never allowing polarization,  politics, and short-term political expediency to undermine our  obligation to make a difference in the lives of those who sent us here.   Always remember that power is short lived, politics is cyclical, and  one day someone else will fill our shoes.   As Congressman Cummings used to say when I served with him on the  House Oversight and Government Reform Committee: We only hold these  positions of power, leadership, and trust for a short period of time.  What better way to honor the great leaders who came before us and the  people who entrusted us to serve in their footsteps than by seizing  every opportunity we have to work together and to pass the reins of our  Nation to future leaders better than we found it.   To all the new Members: Stand tall, no matter how tall you are; be  courageous; don't take ``no'' for an answer; and never stop working to  tear down the roadblocks that stand in the way of advocating for your  constituents who count on you every day.   And to the people of New Mexico, thank you for the honor of  representing the First Congressional District, and thank you for  entrusting me to revolutionize our education system, lead the Nation in  clean energy development, and create an economy that prioritizes  hardworking families as your next Governor. I look forward to  continuing to work for you in your Roundhouse next year.   Mr. Speaker, although I yield back for the final time, I have never  been more hopeful about our future and the next generation of Members  who will stand here, address this Chamber, and commit to the shared  values that form the foundation of progress after I am gone.                            ____________________
