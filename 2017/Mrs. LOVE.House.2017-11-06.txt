 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues at the CBC for the  opportunity to speak at this Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I traveled to Haiti to investigate  sex trafficking, as part of my work on the Financial Services  Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. While I was  there, I had the opportunity to observe conditions as well as meet with  leadership and the President.   What I saw was a nation struggling to rebuild after the 2010 tragedy  that hurt and rattled the nation with an earthquake, a cholera  epidemic, and Hurricane Matthew. What I heard was the nation was not  prepared for the tens of thousands of Haitians that were to return.   Haitian TPS recipients contribute significantly to the United States'  economy and to the Haitian economy. As Haiti works not only to rebuild,  but to rise itself out of poverty that has plagued it for years, I ask  the White House to please take a moment to help our friends and allies  in Haiti and to extend the temporary protective status.
