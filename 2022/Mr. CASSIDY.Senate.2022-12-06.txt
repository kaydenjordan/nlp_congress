 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the  Hilliard Art Museum on being awarded accreditation by the American  Alliance of Museums. This accreditation offers an industry stamp of  approval to the museum, recognizing the hard work of the Hilliard Art  Museum team and the support of the Lafayette community.  [[Page S6997]]    The Hilliard Art Museum opened its doors in 2004. Since its  beginning, Hilliard has offered immersive art education to all who  visit. Students, families, and art enthusiasts come to the museum for  informative collections and breathtaking galleries.   The Hilliard Art Museum was accredited by the American Alliance of  Museums on November 18, 2022, after being vetted for multiple years.  The accreditation process includes collections, organization, and  educational assessments. With the American Alliance of Museums  accreditation, Hilliard will have greater opportunities to grant  funding and new opportunities to borrow art pieces from other museums  and collections.   Congratulations to the Hilliard Art Museum team for this recognition  of their dedication to serving the community through art  education.                            ____________________
