 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  IMPROVE Act. My colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and I  have been working to address a number of the issues that culminated  under this legislation.   For instance, the ACE Kids Act, an effort championed by  Representative Barton, would make strides in addressing the challenges  of children with medically complex conditions.   It sets standards for health home qualifications, so as to ensure  better coordinated care for children in need.   It updates and streamlines the coordinated care provisions for health  homes for children, so that they will have the system and framework in  place to properly respond and work with health systems and  professionals.   Additionally, it overhauls the data collection requirements for  providers and updates the State reporting requirements, so as to  maintain a more comprehensive network of care for children with complex  medical conditions.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a culmination of a lot of hard work  by my colleagues, particularly Representative Barton and the staff of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, and represents a commonsense step  forward in assisting needy children. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2465, the Sickle Cell  Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance,  Prevention, and Treatment Act.   This legislation, which has been sponsored by Senator Scott, makes  important updates to statute so as to better help our medical  professionals understand and treat sickle cell and other blood  disorders.   Sickle cell is a terrible disease, inflicting extremely difficult  effects on those who have this condition. Today's legislation will  allow us to move forward and combat this and other heritable blood  disorders so that we can provide a better quality of life to those who  suffer from them.   We are very fortunate to have some world-class treatment options in  my home State of Georgia at health systems like Emory University. They  are doing incredible work in treating and understanding this disease so  that we can improve the lives of all who suffer from these forms of  diseases.   This legislation supports State health departments, establishes best  practices, improves data collection efforts, and develops strategies  that will hopefully allow us to eventually fully address these  diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on this, and I urge  them to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1318, the Preventing  Maternal Deaths Act.   Unfortunately, we know all too well in Georgia the need to address  maternal mortality rates in the Nation. My home State of Georgia has  one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, and we  learned about the challenges leading to this statistic on September 27  in the Energy and Commerce Committee when we were able to hear from my  colleague and the sponsor of the bill, Congresswoman Herrera Beutler.    As my colleague noted in the hearing, we are seeing an estimated  number of between 700 and 900 maternal deaths per year, a number that  is unacceptable in today's world. A 2015 World Health Organization  report noted that nearly half of these deaths were preventable.   From 1987 to 2009, the number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000  births nearly doubled. That is why this legislation is so important.   Whether it is updates to maternal mortality data collection or mental  treatment options, or the reforms and changes for the maternal  mortality review committees, this legislation is necessary to helping  us curb this trend and reduce the number of maternal mortality deaths.   We can and we should do more, and I hope that this will be one of our  many steps to help us save the lives of mothers across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
