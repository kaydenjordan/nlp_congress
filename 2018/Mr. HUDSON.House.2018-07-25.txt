 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution, H.  Res. 1009, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives  that lack of timely and predictable funding unnecessarily undermines  the mission of the United States Special Operations Command and  jeopardizes the security of the United States.                                time  1500    Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest honors of my life is representing  Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe and home of the Airborne and  Special Operations Forces. The units stationed here represent the best  of the best and have a vast footprint.  [[Page H7646]]    As our Nation continues to fight terrorism around the world while  simultaneously preparing for the threats of near-peer adversaries, our  requirements increase and diversify.   For too long, we have asked our military to do more with less. Now,  we have made great progress with our fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year  2019 DOD appropriations, but every time we fail to pass a Defense  Appropriations bill on time, we do irreparable harm to our Nation's  military. This is especially apparent in our special operations  community.   The men and women at USSOCOM cannot afford another year of CRs. Their  missions require an advanced level of training and preparation as they  operate in some of the most austere conditions in the world.   When USSOCOM is not funded on time, training cannot be conducted,  essential equipment cannot be ordered, and long-term responsibilities  are not met. The effects of 9 years of continuing resolutions have  severely undermined our forces and led to a waste of taxpayer dollars  as we flood the Department of Defense with cash near the end of the  fiscal year and force them to spend it all within a matter of a few  months.   We must never underestimate the most important asset our military  has, and that is the individual. Green Berets cannot be built  overnight. We cannot flip a switch and magically produce Navy SEALs or  Air Force combat controllers or Marine Raiders. The elite units of  USSOCOM are built over multiple years and cannot be stopped and  started.   This resolution would affirm our commitment to stand behind each and  every one of these incredible servicemembers and their families.   Make no mistake, when this body chooses not to appropriately fund  these warriors, we are putting their lives at greater risk. I refuse to  go home and look in the eye of a Gold Star wife of a Green Beret and  say: ``Sorry, your husband didn't get the training he needed, because  we were too busy playing games in Washington.'' That, Mr. Speaker, is  unacceptable.   The time is now for us to come together as a Nation and fund our  military. I urge every one of my colleagues to recognize what is at  stake and put the needs of our Nation before politics.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Cheney for her  efforts on these issues, as well as Chairman Thornberry and Chairwoman  Granger for their unwavering support and commitment to our military and  our special operators.
