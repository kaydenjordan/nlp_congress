 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 91, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 72) removing a certain Member from certain  standing committees of the House of Representatives, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 72.   In 2019, the FBI warned that ``antigovernment, identity-based, and  fringe political conspiracy theories very likely to motivate some  domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent activity.''   In October last year, this House voted nearly unanimously to condemn  QAnon conspiracy theories because they encourage the rejection of  objective reality, deepen political polarization, and undermine trust  in our democratic institutions; but also because they have inspired  real-world violence, bomb threats, vandalism, kidnapping, terrorism,  murder, and insurrection.   Congresswoman Greene of Georgia has a long history of amplifying  dangerous conspiracy theories online and threatening violent, racist,  Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic conduct. H. Res. 72 will ensure that  Mrs. Greene's conduct is not rewarded with seats on two important  committees.   The Congresswoman has said that American citizens who practice Islam  ``do not belong in our government,'' and ``they should stay in their  country.''   Mr. Speaker, this is their country, and it is their government as  much as any American's.   Mrs. Greene has trafficked in dangerous anti-Semitic lies about the  Rothschild family, George Soros, Zionist supremacists, and secret  Jewish plots.   Over millennia, because of baseless, ugly lies, millions of Jews have  been hated, targeted, expelled from their countries, violently  attacked, killed, and exterminated because words lead to action and  death.   Mrs. Greene claimed the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed  [[Page H348]]  26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old kids, was staged. She claimed  the Las Vegas shooting that killed 60 people and injured over 800 was  an orchestrated attempt to weaken gun rights. And she claimed the  shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was a false flag event  and called the survivors crisis actors.   Mr. Speaker, the 17 people who never came home from school in  Parkland on February 14, 2018, were my constituents. Their families'  pain is real, and it is felt every single day.   Yesterday, parents of children slain at Sandy Hook, Mark Barden,  Daniel's dad; and Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mom, wrote a letter to Leader  McCarthy to share how these conspiracy theories impact their families:  ``These vicious lies deny the deaths of our murdered children and bring  death threats and constant harassment to our doors and our surviving  children.''   In 2019, Mrs. Greene created a White House petition to impeach  Speaker Pelosi for treason, emphasizing that it is punishable by death,  and she liked a Facebook comment stating that: ``A bullet to the head  would be a quicker way to remove Speaker Nancy Pelosi.''   In a video statement from December 31, 2018, Mrs. Greene called on  her followers to storm Washington, D.C., in what sounds today like a  prescient forecast of last month's deadly insurrection: Flood the  Capitol. Flood all the government buildings. Go inside. We can end it.  We can do it peacefully. We can. I hope we don't have to do it the  other way, but we should feel like we will if we have to.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what happened.   Conspiracy theories and hate are malignant. They do not fade away. We  must stand up to them and say, Enough.   Mrs. Greene has promised that she will never apologize.   Well, we are here today because Republican leadership has decided to  embrace and elevate Mrs. Greene. They rewarded her with a seat on the  committee of this House that has responsibility for teaching our  children the truth and giving them a safe place to learn it.   Two years ago, the Republican leader spoke on this floor, very  strongly saying, ``I will pledge to you this, from this side of the  aisle, and I hope you understand this clearly, any hatred, we take  action.''   Mr. McCarthy did take action, but it wasn't condemnation. It was  elevation, appointing her to committee seats.   That is why it is necessary to put this resolution to a vote for  every Member of this body because this House must take action. I urge  my colleagues to support this resolution and remove Representative  Greene of Georgia from her positions on the Committee on Education and  Labor and the Committee on Budget.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H. Res. 72.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I also note Republican colleagues purport not to defend any of  Representative Greene's hateful statements or reprehensible conduct,  instead, rely on process. The appeals to process should be recognized  for what they are, an effort to shield her from her accountability for  her egregious language and actions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), my friend and colleague from south Florida who has  come to know the families from Marjory Stoneman Douglas, as well as I,  and the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to make clear that this is not an action by  one party. This is a House resolution. Today, all of us will be voting.   And the Constitution couldn't be clearer. Article I, Section 5 vests  the House with the authority, independent of the Ethics Committee, to  discipline a Member. As a sanction for such behavior, the House may  limit any right, power, privilege, or immunity of that Member. I am  sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are aware of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Ms. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my friend and neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just address some of what we have heard today.   First, we have heard the argument made by our colleagues that this is  something that should go to the Ethics Committee, despite the fact that  we have the authority to be here today to tackle something that our  friends should have tackled.   But then they turn around and say that the Ethics Committee doesn't  have jurisdiction for anything that has been said before a Member is  elected, thereby creating a loop that will result in no accountability,  zero accountability, for any of the horrific sayings, any of the  horrific actions that have been promoted by Representative Greene on  social media and in her words.   We also heard that what we are doing here risks deepening dangerous  divisions. The dangerous divisions that exist in our country resulted  in an attack on this Capitol, putting all of our lives at risk. We are  trying to stop the divisions in our country by not giving a platform to  the kinds of conspiracy theories that helped to inflame them.   We heard that this is cynical and hypocritical. Mr. Speaker, is there  anything more cynical and hypocritical than to be told on the floor of  this House that the minority leader was prepared to take Mrs. Greene  off the committee, not because it was the right thing to do, but  because it was a political decision he was willing to consider?   Finally, we heard that Representative Greene has apologized for this.  She came to the floor today. She acknowledged that 9/11 happened; she  acknowledged that school shootings are real; and she acknowledged that  she learned some things about QAnon that she didn't know before.                                time  1800    There was no apology. There was nothing to address any of the pain  and hurt that she has done to my constituents and gun violence  survivors in every part of this country and the families who lost loved  ones.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be here today. This hateful rhetoric is in  the real world as well, outside the Halls of Congress, not just here.  Memories of the lives we have lost to gun violence are being forsaken  by those who baselessly claim those tragedies were false flag events.  Online rants about anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, and conspiracy  theories have manifested in real and violent acts. It is not a debating  society that we are participating in. This has real impact, in the real  world.   Finally, I close with this, Mr. Speaker: We are worried about  precedent?   So am I. So we should all be. And the precedent of rewarding a Member  of the House by giving her a platform of a congressional committee to  amplify dangerous conspiracy theories is one we should never set.   Leader McCarthy said so himself. I would remind my colleagues again,  2 years ago he said: Any hatred, any hatred we take action.   Unfortunately, the only action taken by Republican leadership has  been to appoint Representative Greene to two powerful committees.   This resolution condemns the practice of promoting extreme  ideologies, conspiracy theories, and antigovernment rhetoric. The  resolution proclaims that there is no place for such conduct in this  Congress or in society. When Mrs. Greene came to the floor today and  compared the media to QAnon, it is a reminder of just how important  this action is that we are about to take. This is why we must adopt H.  Res. 72.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
