 Madam Speaker, last night I was proud to present my  legislative director, Gabriella Boffelli, with the Vermillion Award of  the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, CHLI, named after the  late Steve Vermillion, the former chief of staff to Congressman Lincoln  Diaz-Balart.   This award is presented each year to two staffers who exemplify  Steve's huge heart and dedication to freedom. None are more deserving  than Gaby, and her fellow honoree, Angela Ramirez.   Since starting as an intern in my Miami office 6 years ago, Gaby has  risen through the ranks, year after year, serving our south Florida  community with wisdom, grace, and integrity. Now completing a master's  degree at Johns Hopkins University, Gaby is the consummate public  servant, selflessly working on behalf of our constituents, while  constantly fighting for democracy and human rights in places like  Nicaragua.   It has been an honor to have Gaby Boffelli on my team, and I know  this is just the beginning of an extraordinary career.  [[Page H6134]]    Congratulations, my friend. Felicidades, mi amiga.                            ____________________
