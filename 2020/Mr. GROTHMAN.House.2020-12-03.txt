 Mr. Speaker, this past July, medical research teams at  Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem and New York's Mount Sinai  Hospital released a study indicating that the FDA-approved cholesterol  drug fenofibrate may significantly downgrade the severity of COVID-19.   The medical teams were led by Hebrew University Professor Ya'acov  Nahmias and Mount Sinai's Dr. Benjamin tenOever. During their research,  they found the novel coronavirus and studies conducted on human lung  tissue found that COVID-19 prevents the routine burning of  carbohydrates, which leads to fat in the lungs, which causes people to  die.   What happens is that people take fenofibrate, which is a drug that  was commonly used for high cholesterol treatment, and it stops this  inflammation and improves people's respiratory systems.   Right now, these doctors are not given the support they should be  given by the CDC and the NIH. We have a lot of people dying of  coronavirus, and I think our people should not be too proud to  recognize that sometimes cures are made in other countries.   I strongly encourage the CDC to look at fenofibrate and these two  great researchers.                            ____________________
