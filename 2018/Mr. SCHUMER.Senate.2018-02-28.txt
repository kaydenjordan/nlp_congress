 Madam President, yesterday, I met with a group of  survivors from the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland,  FL. Two weeks after losing classmates, friends, and teachers, these  kids have not given themselves over to grief or cynicism. They  organized and resolved to change their country. They went to  Tallahassee. They traveled to Washington. They are committed, and they  are inspiring.   We just went to the observance of Billy Graham's death in the Capitol  Rotunda, and a man of the cloth probably would have said that instead  of cursing the darkness, these kids are lighting a candle, which is a  beautiful thing to do.   As I was sitting with them, I remembered meeting with the young  people who survived the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. I  remember sitting with parents of the kindergartners and first graders  killed at Sandy Hook Elementary. I still ache for them and their  parents, parents who had presents stashed under the Christmas tree that  were never opened. Photos of those beautiful children still sit on my  desk.   All of them--the students of Stoneman Douglas, parents from Newtown,  parents of the victims in Orlando, Las Vegas, Columbine, Charleston,  and everyday gun violence in cities and towns all across our country-- all of them are calling on us to act. The slow-motion massacre of  American children must end. The time has come to make meaningful  changes to our laws to keep Americans safe from the epidemic of gun  violence.   Let me tell you, the students of Stoneman Douglas will not stop until  we achieve meaningful change. They know small measures will not get the  job done. That is why they told me, every one of them: The Fix NICS  bill is not close to enough of what we need to do. Fix NICS has wide  support in this Chamber. I am a cosponsor. But it is just the first  tiny step that addresses one specific issue. We have a whole host of  other issues to address, not one.   It is true that the records of NICS need to be fixed, but it is also  true that we need to close the gun show loophole. It is also true that  we need to make sure online sales go through background checks so that  felons or those adjudicated as mentally ill or spousal abusers can't  get guns. Over 90 percent of America agrees with that. But our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so afraid of the NRA that  they can't even embrace universal background checks, which 90 percent  of America addresses. Special interest lobbying--the kind of thing  President Trump campaigned against, the NRA is doing it. The NRA is  doing it.   We need to stop writing bills that address only the last shooting and  start  [[Page S1258]]  making laws that prevent the next one. When you have a sick patient,  you don't just treat one symptom; you cure the disease. That is what  universal background checks will do. Fix NICS would be a good thing to  do, but it is a tiny step when we need a giant leap. It can't be the  only thing we do. In fact, the only reason it hasn't cleared this  Chamber already is that the Republican Senator from Utah objected to  it. Such is the vice grip that the ideologues from the gun lobby have  on the entire Republican Party. They are so against what America wants.  They are so against what rank and file Republicans want. Even on  something as limited as Fix NICS, the gun groups find a way to get in  the way.   I believe the priority of this Chamber should be to pass universal  background checks. That would accomplish what Fix NICS does and a lot  more. President Trump has said that he would push ``strongly  comprehensive background checks'' in the wake of Parkland. We Democrats  are calling on him today to keep his word. We sent him a letter asking  him to support existing legislation, bipartisan legislation, to close  the loopholes that allow anyone to purchase a gun at a gun show or on  the internet without a background check. These loopholes make no sense.  Leaving these loopholes unclosed would be as if we checked someone's ID  at the liquor store but not at the bar. That is what you could say  about Fix NICS. It would be as if we checked someone's ID at the liquor  store but not at the bar. We should have the same checks across the  board.   Today, I call on President Trump to come out in support of  legislation that would close dangerous loopholes in our background  check system. The NRA vehemently opposes that, but I say to President  Trump: Show some leadership, buck the NRA. They are way out of touch  with the American people, with gun owners, and rank and file  Republicans. I say to the President: Show some leadership, buck the  NRA, endorse these policies, and you can finally break the gridlock and  get something meaningful done.                            ____________________     Madam President, there is one other matter. I know my  colleagues from North Carolina are waiting, and I salute them for being  here in praise of a former member who just passed from their State,  Billy Graham.   Yesterday, the commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, ADM Michael  Rogers, testified that Putin's efforts to interfere with American  democracy have not abated since the 2016 election and likely have  intensified. According to several reports, Kremlin-linked bots continue  to stoke political divisions in the United States via misinformation on  social media. Here is what Admiral Rogers said:         President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that       there's little price to pay and that therefore [he thinks] `I       can continue this activity.' Clearly what we have done hasn't       been enough.    He is absolutely right. It is extraordinary, confounding, and  dangerous how little the Trump administration is doing about Putin's  campaign to undermine our grand democracy. President Trump refused to  punish Putin after he took office, despite the consensus view of 17  American intelligence agencies that Putin interfered in our elections.  President Trump has still refused to fully implement the package of  sanctions passed by this Congress with only five dissenting votes  combined in both the House and Senate, two here and three there.  Yesterday, when my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, asked Admiral  Rogers, the Director of NSA, if the Trump administration had directed  him to counter Russian meddling, he replied: ``No, I have not [been  directed].''   That is astonishing. A hostile foreign power interferes in our  election, continues to interfere with our democracy, is planning to  interfere in our next elections, and the President of the United States  is hardly lifting a finger. It is as if they were preparing for war and  tanks or planes were lining up, and we decided to do nothing. Cyber  attacks and manipulation of the news media are other ways that hostile  powers attack us.   People have to wonder why President Trump is so soft on Russia, so  unwilling to criticize President Putin, and so slow to stand up for  America and protect our democracy.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, one final word on a pending  judicial nomination, Marvin Quattlebaum. First, for the benefit of the  Senate, I would like to note that the only reason the current  nomination is up, the nomination of Quattlebaum is up is because the  two Republican Senators from South Carolina refused to return a blue  slip for two judges nominated for the same vacancy by President Obama.  Their right as the home State Senators to not return a blue slip was  respected by the Democratic majority, Chairman Leahy, in 2013, unlike  the Republican majority, which has already ignored the blue slip  precedent and confirmed a circuit judge without the approval of both  home State Senators. I want my colleagues on the other side to remember  that their blue slips were respected during the Obama administration  and to think long and hard about continuing to ignore them now that  their party is in the White House.   Second, the nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall  lack of diversity in President Trump's selection for the Federal  judiciary. Mr. Quattlebaum replaces not one but two scuttled Obama  nominees who were African American. As of February 14, 83 percent of  President Trump's confirmed nominees were male; 92 percent were  White. That represents the lowest share of non-White candidates in  three decades.    It is long past time that the judiciary starts looking a lot more  like the America it represents. Having a diversity of views and  experience on the Federal bench is necessary for the equal  administration of justice. After years of improvement, the Trump  administration, as in so many other areas, is taking a giant step  backward--this time, when it comes to the diversity of their  nominations. I will be voting no on the Quattlebaum nomination.   I yield the floor.
