 Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the end of  Dairy Month, which is recognized throughout June. I also rise to  highlight the USDA's new Dairy Margin Coverage program, which is  enrolling farmers right now.   My district in upstate New York is home to hundreds of dairy farmers,  and way too many are struggling to survive with years of plummeting  milk prices.   Now at the mercy of not just a complex pricing system, but also trade  wars, our farmers need real support. I  [[Page H5207]]  encourage all dairy farmers in New York's 19th Congressional District  to begin making coverage decisions.   The Dairy Margin Coverage program is retroactive until the beginning  of the year, with applicable payments following soon after enrollment.   As dairy farmers continue to face low prices and increased market  consolidation, I hope this program will provide much-needed support  during this challenging farm economy.   As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am deeply committed to  supporting our dairy farmers, and I will be closely following  implementation of the Dairy Margin Coverage program. I will continue  fighting to give our farmers the support and the certainty they need.                            ____________________
