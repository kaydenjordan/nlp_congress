 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to talk  about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is benefiting Texas, especially  folks in the 25th Congressional District that I represent.   There are approximately 28 million people lucky enough to call  themselves Texans. Of that, I have the great honor of representing  hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans who wake up and go to  work every day, just like you and me.   For 5 years, I have traveled up and down the 25th District of Texas,  most recently, just last week, where I visited many local businesses  along the way. I have witnessed firsthand the hardships that families  and small businesses face day in and day out due to an intrusive  Federal Government and overreaching administration.   I pledged to these people that I would bring my commonsense business  perspective to Washington in order to jump-start this economy, and I am  proud to say that I upheld that promise.   When I visited these folks last week, there was something different  about them. For the first time in a long time, I had businessowners and  their employees telling me about the positive impacts coming from our  Nation's Tax Code. They were telling me they noticed more money in  their most recent paychecks. One man even told me he plans to use his  extra money to put into his 401(k) so that he can save even more for  his retirement.   This means parents can now plan for their future and start putting  away money for their kids' college funds. It means companies are adding  to their workforce and that those individuals can keep more money in  their pockets.   Ultimately, these hardworking Texans are seeing more jobs, fairer  taxes, and bigger paychecks. I am proud to be their voice in  Washington, and I will continue fighting on their behalf.   In God we trust.
