 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2842.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Nebraska?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 396 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2842.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from California (Mr. Denham) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  0911                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 2842) to provide for the conduct of demonstration projects to  test the effectiveness of subsidized employment for TANF recipients,  with Mr. Denham in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support to talk about H.R. 2842, the  Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 6  million job openings, the highest level since the government started  tracking the data in the year 2000. At the same time, the share of  Americans participating in the workforce is near a four-decade low.  [[Page H5115]]    Moving welfare recipients into employment is a central goal of the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF. Yet only half  of all TANF recipients receiving cash assistance are working or  preparing for work.   Some TANF recipients have a difficult time transitioning from welfare  into a job, so these types of on-the-job work experiences aid in the  transition. The same goes for employers who may be reluctant to hire  welfare recipients with limited work experience or other barriers to  working.   So the question is: How can we bridge the gap? How do we connect out- of-work Americans with all of the employers who want and need to fill  job openings?   H.R. 2842, sponsored by Congressman Curbelo of Florida and  Congressman Davis of Illinois, encourages employers to work with State  and local agencies to hire TANF recipients. States would only be able  to use this money to provide benefits to those who are working,  providing paychecks in lieu of benefit checks, a key tenet to welfare  reform.   Employers would take the lead by partnering with State and local  agencies to hire TANF recipients, providing recipients with highly  valued work experience and on-the-job training, including  apprenticeships.   Earn-and-learn models help people become familiar with the workplace,  gain needed skills, and earn a wage.   The bill reserves up to $100 million for 1 year from the TANF  Contingency Fund, which has already been extended through the end of  fiscal year 2018 to subsidize up to 50 percent of a TANF recipient's  wage for no more than 12 months.   Fifteen percent of the funds would be set aside for career pathway  programs, which combine work, training, and other supports to help  individuals enter the workforce and move up the economic ladder.   Finally, high-quality evaluations would be used to determine whether  these public-private partnerships were effective in helping welfare  recipients move into jobs and retain work.   There is broad support from the employer community for helping low- skilled Americans gain on-the-job experience, and there is plenty of  support here and across the country for tying government assistance to  work or work preparation for those who are able-bodied.   Decades of experience tells us the most effective anti-poverty  program is a job. It is helping low-income Americans earn success  through the dignity of work.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to stand with Mr. Curbelo  in supporting this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0915    Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2842, the Accelerating Individuals into the  Workforce Act, which is better known as TANF.   This important bill modernizes the TANF Contingency Fund to promote  effective job training programs, such as subsidized jobs, career  pathways, and apprenticeship programs. Research is clear. Subsidized  employment, career pathways, and apprenticeship programs successfully  engage people in employment, especially those who have been  unsuccessful in finding paid employment through their efforts.   Further research on past TANF subsidized employment programs document  that these initiatives increase employment and earnings both while  individuals worked in a subsidized job as well as after the program  ended. Also, studies show that States operated these programs that  provided tremendous benefit at very reasonable cost.   Many States used the TANF Emergency Funds to establish effective  subsidized employment programs. Using these TANF Emergency Funds in  Illinois, former Governor Pat Quinn implemented the very successful Put  Illinois to Work program that directly created over 26,000 jobs,  helping close to 5,000 employees in Illinois. Nationally, the TANF  Emergency Funds created 260,000 jobs.   Good subsidized employment programs have three characteristics that  make them an attractive part of TANF: they are able to increase  employment quickly; they help some of the individuals who face the  greatest challenges enter the workforce and stay there; and, when  funded on a large scale, they can help boost local economies. For these  reasons, Democrats have proposed subsidized employment within TANF for  years.   My friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Gwen Moore, initially  proposed allowing subsidized employment in TANF via her RISE Act many  years ago. I embraced her idea in my Responsible Fatherhood bill, and I  am pleased to join with Representative Curbelo on this effort.   If we are truly committed to helping families work their way out of  poverty, we will need to do much more to strengthen TANF. We will need  to ensure that States actually spend TANF money on TANF recipients. We  need to improve access to education and training, critical changes that  both Republican and Democratic witnesses have emphasized over and over  again. We need to improve childcare so parents can actually go to work.   This bill is a good bill. It makes a small, positive step forward on  our path to more comprehensive improvements to TANF. I strongly support  it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), the lead sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), the lead sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), the lead sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), the lead sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts here today of my colleague  from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Curbelo) working together focusing on solutions.   Mr. Chairman, we know that, this day and age, it is very easy to  identify the problems and the challenges that our country faces. It is  a little more difficult to come up with the solutions and bring people  together. I appreciate the efforts of both sides coming together today.   I truly believe that the solutions to our challenges are out in the  communities where needy families live, and we know we have many needy  families across our country for various reasons. America is a big  country. And when you look at the challenges that individuals might  face economically, I hope that we can come together as Americans to  focus on growing our economy, growing opportunity, hoping that we see,  as our number one responsibility, the need to provide for opportunity  in the future.   We can't set certain and determine certain outcomes, but we can  certainly measure the outcomes from our efforts here in Washington.  That is why this bill, very importantly, requires States to report on  outcomes through this program. We know that we need to provide more  flexibility for States. This does exactly that, and, even more so, with  communities.   As we do get the feedback from the States, I hope that we will heed  their advice because they are the folks who are more in touch with the  needs of their various communities around their jurisdictions, all 50  States.   Mr. Chairman, they are experts, and I hope that we can work together  with them here, on both sides of the aisle, in Washington, but also all  across America with very diverse needs for needy families.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a fierce advocate for low- income people.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close if there  are no more speakers. I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I want to, first of all, commend Mr. Curbelo for his leadership on  this issue, and I certainly agree with him that we have found enough  common ground to be here this morning with a bill that we can pass, but  I also agree with my friend from Texas (Mr. Doggett), that there are  many shortcomings to helping individuals actually realize the potential  that they have to move beyond poverty to sustainable employment so that  they can have a level of living and a level of expectation which gives  them the energy that they need to keep moving forward.   There are some improvements that we certainly need to make. We can  allow greater education and training. Every time witnesses come before  us, they always tell us that, no matter whether they are billed as  Republican or Democrat, or with no political stripe. We should improve  TANF for kinship caregivers. We should remove the lifetime ban on  felony drug convictions. Just imagine, that these individuals will  never ever have the opportunity to experience the benefits of this  program, or of this effort.   We should remove the 60-month time limit during recessions, and we  should remove the ban to assist unwed teen parents and other youth who  are displaced.   So clearly, we do have agreement this morning, and I am delighted to  be a part of it, but I certainly hope that my colleagues will look at  those unmet needs that the legislation does not cover.   I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Davis for their  leadership on this issue, and then colleagues from both sides coming  together in a bipartisan way so that we can help more Americans get  back to work.   This bill requires high-quality evaluations to determine whether  these public-private partnerships are effective in helping welfare  recipients move into jobs. These evidence-based results will be used to  inform future policy decisions to reform our welfare system, similar to  the approach taken in the mid-1990s.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important  issues so more Americans can earn a wage and feel the dignity of work.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR.

No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115- 187. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in  the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered  as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report  equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall  not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for  division of the question.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Foxx    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  House Report 115-187.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. It  requires States to coordinate efforts under this bill with other  Federal programs designed to help low-income individuals obtain the  necessary skills to enter employment and climb the economic ladder.   Our Federal welfare system is large, fragmented, and growing in cost.  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates that we  currently operate over 80 programs that provide food, housing,  healthcare, job training, education, energy assistance, and cash to  low-income Americans. Reducing bureaucracy and streamlining a State's  administration of employment and training services to low-income  Americans is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well  as supporting the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment as well as the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. This  amendment provides further information to ensure we have high-quality  evaluations requiring States to measure how many recipients entered  employment in the same field they received on-the-job training. The  more we know about how these programs work and their return on our  investments is important when we make decisions down the road.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment as well  as the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Davidson for his  efforts.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I hope that we can evaluate  all of the programs that we have, coordinate among them, learn more  about their effectiveness, and ultimately respect folks in need and do  all we can that is appropriate to help lift themselves out of poverty.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment.   This amendment simply requires that the high-quality evaluations  include measurements or how many recipients participated in an  apprentice or career pathway program, and any credentials earned along  the way.   Earn-and-learn models--those where an individual is getting on-the- job experience, earning a wage, and learning new occupational skills-- are one of the best types of workforce development models the  government can support. Apprenticeships, in particular, provide a  combination of occupational on-the-job training and related  instruction, helping to improve worker training and address critical  skill gaps that align with the needs of industry.   We know that the best way out of poverty is through work, and  apprenticeships provide a pathway to obtaining a successful career.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as  the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Khanna).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Kilmer    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in  House Report 115-187.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment.   The first hearing I held as chairman of the Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Human Resources was on the geography of poverty. People  often think of poverty only as they see it in cities, not realizing  poverty today is more common than ever in suburban and even rural  areas.   People also underestimate poverty in rural and remote areas, not  knowing the rates of poverty in these areas have, for decades, been  higher than in urban areas.   This amendment ensures the Secretary takes into account rural areas  and Indian Tribes when making recommendations on how to address  employment-related challenges.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as  support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mitchell). The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).   The amendment was agreed to.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings  will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115-187 on  which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:   Amendment No. 4 by Mr. Krishnamoorthi of Illinois.   Amendment No. 5 by Mr. Davidson of Ohio.   The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any  electronic vote after the first vote in this series.                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Krishnamoorthi    The Acting CHAIR.
