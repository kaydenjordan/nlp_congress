 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Corporal William ``Bill'' McMillan, III. Corporal McMillan was a combat  medic serving in Iraq when he lost his life in an IED attack on July 8,  2008.   The death of Corporal McMillan prompted his father, Lloyd, and Brad,  his older brother, to write a poem about his sudden death entitled  ``The Medic's Last Patrol.'' It goes like this:       As your Stryker rolls, you remember many missions through             this long, tough fight.  [[Page H7165]]       You know the last task will come, last work be done, then             home. All right!      You will mount up to take that last patrol with fellows all             well tried;      That honor roll of troopers you have come to know with love             and pride.      You have all talked, laughed, wept, and fought hard, side by             side.      Many times before, you've watched them play, work, fight, and             bleed.      You've patched them up, cheered them on, and sent them back             to lead.      You've been there for them in the dust of day and in the cold             of night.      Then on to the next patrol, with that honored roll. Back one             more time to fight.      You remember. The report was out. They were all about, and             they had planted one to three.      On late guard, near break of day, an IED you see they start             to lay.      You call Sarge, ``Hey! Look close over there. Can you see?''      Sarge runs right out, and starts to shout, ``That's it!'' And             you do the follow me!      Later, you patch the enemy then work smart, fight tough, to             get yourself free.      You ask, ``Is this the last patrol? Is this it for the Sarge             and me?''      Experience kicks in. You both fight hard and win. Clearly,             the last patrol it's not.      You and your team will see lots more patrols, as that's the             soldier's lot.      As you're grouped the next day, the General praises your             brave acts.      You and Sarge got four, and the team got nine more, in those             all-out attacks.      Your team did its job. They fought hard and did so very well.      You've sent the enemy on their last patrol, their justly             deserved death knell.      Now, you are rolling on this new daytime mission. The light             is oh so bright.      Your patrol is off to guard the convoy, checking all that is             in sight.      You laugh at stories told as along you roll and grab a snack.             All right!      Then that flash of light, that blast of might, your eyes they             see now closed so tight.      For four, the last patrol has come. The rest for a moment             numb, a truly terrible plight.      Later, the caisson rolls. The cannons boom. Overhead, the             Blackhawks fly.      We honor you as we stand in place. But we ask, O God! Tell us             why.      We find some comfort as we hear ``Amazing Grace,'' our eyes             very far from dry.      It was a one-way ticket, but we know you're in a better             place.      Now, you are with our dear Lord and holy master.      You have passed from last patrol to honored guard of God's             most holy pasture.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Johnson and  Ranking Member Lucas for their support of this all-important bill.   I rise in support of H.R. 617, the Department of Energy Veterans'  Health Initiative Act.   This legislation authorizes a partnership between the Department of  Energy--the DOE--and the Department of Veterans Affairs--the VA--to  conduct collaborative research in computing, artificial intelligence,  and big data science in order to improve healthcare for all of our  veterans.   The VA hosts one of the largest and most valuable health datasets.  Through its voluntary data collection program, entitled the Million  Veterans Program, MVP, the VA has collected  [[Page H7181]]  detailed health information and genomic data volunteered by over  600,000 veterans.    But the VA simply doesn't have the computing power or expertise to  analyze all of this complex data. In order to learn from their data and  provide better healthcare for veterans, the VA needs access to more  advanced computing capabilities, expertise, and infrastructure than is  currently available at the agency.   As a world leader in high-performance computing, the DOE is an ideal  partner to help the VA meet this need. In its national laboratory  system, DOE hosts 5 of the world's top 10 fastest supercomputers,  including the fastest supercomputer in the world, Summit, at Oak Ridge  National Laboratory.   The DOE also funds research and computational sciences and data  analytics, which can be used to solve a range of complex big data  challenges in the physical sciences. The interagency partnership  between DOE and the VA authorized by my bill is necessary to analyze  this data and ultimately provide better care for our Nation's veterans.   DOE has the capability to securely store, using supercomputers at the  national labs, and analyze the VA's health data to look for patterns.  Learning from these patterns can help us improve the medical treatments  for heart disease, traumatic brain injury, and cancer.   I think we can all agree that we should be taking any steps possible  to improve the medical care of our men and women who have answered the  call to serve. Not only does this bill take that step, but it has  benefit in giving our scientists the ability to analyze complex data  that will help America remain the world's leader in advanced computing.   The bill also requires the DOE to establish data storage facilities  to securely transmit and store data that the VA provides. This will  make certain that privacy and security are maintained for veterans who  volunteer for the programs.   I am grateful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been  able to come together and move this bill forward. Providing better care  for our veterans is a place where we can find common ground, especially  since America's veterans fought to keep us all safe, regardless of our  political party.   In closing, I would like to thank my fellow Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology members who cosponsored this legislation and the  many veterans serving in the House who supported my bill. I also want  to thank Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who has been a strong advocate  of this partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of  improving healthcare for veterans.
