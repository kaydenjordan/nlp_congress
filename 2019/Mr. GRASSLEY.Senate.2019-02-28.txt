 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, when it comes to considering  Presidential nominees, I have said in the past that I don't believe in  playing by two sets of rules.   If the Democrats insist on rejecting President Trump's Cabinet  nominees for petty policy disagreements or insist on rejecting  qualified judges based on an ideological litmus test, they can't expect  kid-glove treatment for the next Democratic President.   However, I urge Senators to end this arms race now. We can start the  disarmament by agreeing to the Blunt-Lankford proposal based on the  bipartisan agreement that was worked out with then-Majority Leader Reid  in the 113th Congress.   I yield the floor.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, before the Presidents Day recess, I  announced that I would introduce legislation if the tax extenders  weren't included in the legislation that we passed at that time that  would keep government open.   Today I am following through on that promise with a bill that I am  introducing with Finance Committee ranking member Senator Wyden of  Oregon.   It is fitting that I am taking this step in the same month as  Groundhog Day, as the subject of my remarks is something that Congress  has had to deal with too many times already.   Next to me is a depiction from the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' which is  about a man named Phil who must relive the same day over and over until  he gets everything right. While we still need to break the cycle of  repetitive short-term extensions, the right thing to do right now is to  extend these already-expired provisions for 2018 and 2019.   As I have said before, the tax extenders are a collection of  temporary tax  [[Page S1598]]  incentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in  order to keep them available to the taxpayers. Currently, there are 26  provisions. At one time there were as many as 50-some. We have done  away with some of them and made some of those laws permanent, but these  26 provisions expired at the end of 2017. They need to be extended, as  well as three others that expired at the end of last year.   Today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns, and  taxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so  that they can file. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term  resolution so that we don't have to have temporary tax policy, but it  is critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are  available for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year  will give us room to take a needed long-term view of this temporary tax  policy.   Many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives, and to be  successful, then, these incentives need to be in effect before  decisions can be made. That is why we should provide extensions for at  least 2 years, to maximize that incentive effect. But it is also  important that we extend these provisions for 2018, even though the  year has obviously already ended. We have developed a very bad policy  and a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year,  and people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will  happen.   As a result, decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based  upon the expectation of extension, and that is a reasonable expectation  because we have done it over decades. In other words, people did what  we wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions  were created. We should not retroactively punish these businesspeople  for Congress's inaction.   Today, a diverse group of organizations, including the National  Biodiesel Board, the American Trucking Associations, and the National  Corn Growers Association, among others, sent a letter to congressional  leaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019  as quickly as possible. I want to quote a few sentences from that  letter:         Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as       it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private       sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we       respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these       expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate       legislative vehicle.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be  printed in the Record.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  February 28, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the U.S. House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,       U.S. House Republican Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,       U.S. Senate Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Republican Member, U.S. House Committee on Ways and           Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Finance Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Democratic Member, U.S. Senate Finance Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, Chairman Neal,       Ranking Member Brady, Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member       Wyden: The following organizations, representing diverse       business, energy, transportation, real estate and agriculture       sectors, are writing to you regarding the pressing need to       address the expired tax provisions (``tax extenders''). We       respectfully ask that at a minimum, the House and Senate       retroactively extend these provisions through 2019 promptly       in order to minimize potentially severe disruptions to the       recently opened tax filing season.        These temporary tax provisions have remained lapsed since       the end of 2017. This has created confusion for the numerous       industry sectors that utilize these tax incentives and has       threatened thousands of jobs in the U.S. economy. The       continued uncertainty with regard to eventual congressional       action on tax extenders is undermining the effectiveness of       these incentives and stands as a needless barrier to       additional job creation and economic growth in the private       sector.        Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as       it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private       sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we       respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these       expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate       legislative vehicle.        We sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter, and       stand ready to work with you to achieve this important       objective.            Sincerely,        Advanced Biofuels Association; Advanced Biofuels Business       Council; Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA); Air-      Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute; Algae       Biomass Organization; Alliantgroup; American Biogas Council;       American Council of Engineering Companies; American Council       On Renewable Energy (ACORE); American Horse Council; American       Public Gas Association; American Public Transportation       Association; American Short Line and Regional Railroad       Association; American Soybean Association; American Trucking       Associations; American Veterinary Medical Association;       Association of American Railroads; Biomass Power Association;       Biotechnology Innovation Organization; Business Council for       Sustainable Energy; CCIM Institute; Citizens for Responsible       Energy Solutions; Coalition for Energy Efficient Jobs &       Investment; Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas (RNG       Coalition); Community Transportation Association of America;       Copper Development Association; Directors Guild of America;       E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs); Education Theatre       Association EDTA; Electric Drive Transportation Association;       Energy Recovery Council; Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy       Association; Growth Energy; and Hearth, Patio & Barbecue       Association.

Mr. President, another very important point I want to  make has to do with the question about whether an extender package  should be offset or not. Around here, the word ``offset'' means if you  have tax provisions that might lose revenue, then do you have other  revenue coming in to take its place? The House has decided that is what  you should do--pay as you go, or PAYGO, as they might call it. It is a  rule of the House.   I have a long record of promoting budget responsibility, and I am as  concerned about the deficit and debt as anyone. However, we also have  bipartisan precedent for treating the extension of temporary tax  policy, like these extenders, just as we treat the extension of annual  spending policy. In neither case do we need offset for such extensions.  In other words, it is all right to spend more money or continue to  spend the same amount of money after a program has expired, and you  don't have to offset it when you have tax law that has been on the  books for a couple of decades, and it is sunset. Why should you have to  sunset that? There are a few people around here who think it is all  right to spend money without offsets, but it is wrong to do tax policy  unless you have offsets.   There are a few specific items in this legislation that I want to  take time to mention. Significant work has already been done to provide  long-term solutions on two extenders--the short line railroad tax  credit and the biodiesel tax credit.   The bill I am introducing extends those credits at their current  levels for 2018 and 2019. I want my colleagues to  [[Page S1599]]  know that I still remain committed to enacting the compromises that  several of our colleagues and I worked with the stakeholders to  achieve.   The bill also includes an extension of a proposal adopted last  Congress that would extend the 7.5-percent floor for itemized  deductions of medical expenses. Without this provision, the floor on  deductions will be 10 percent for 2019. This means that without this  provision, individuals with chronic illnesses and high medical expenses  would have to pay more for healthcare before that excess can be  deducted in the expenses on their 2019 tax returns.   This proposal is a very important priority for one of our best  colleagues, Senator Collins. She deserves a lot of credit for getting  what has turned into a bipartisan proposal to help many Americans  facing catastrophic medical expenses.   Finally, the legislation includes provisions to assist Americans who  have been affected by natural disasters in 2018. This package includes  proposals that we have adopted in prior years to help Americans recover  from natural disasters across our country. For example, the package  would allow increased access to retirement funds and relax restrictions  around charitable giving. I am sure everyone here would like to help  people affected by these natural disasters as soon as we are able to.   I don't want my comments today to imply that each tax extender should  be permanently extended, but the right thing to do now is to provide  extensions for at least 2018 and 2019. In the long term, Congress needs  to decide if these provisions should be allowed to expire or if they  should be phased out or if they should be made permanent as current tax  policy or modified in some way beyond expiring, phasing out, or being  made permanent.   Those decisions need to be made after we resolve the short-term  crisis caused by the current lapse. These provisions have support of  Members on both sides of the aisle. For people who think that things  around here get done only with Republicans fighting Democrats or vice  versa, these provisions have wide bipartisan support.   There is a solid foundation for a long-term package consisting of  many of these provisions in one form or another. We need to get past  today so that we can chart the course for a reliable future for the tax  extenders and give business some certainty.   Just as Phil wants to stop living the same day over and over again, I  think all of us want to break the cycle of short-term extensions of, in  many cases, very popular tax policy. The legislation I introduce today  with the ranking member, Senator Wyden of Oregon, is a critical first  step toward helping taxpayers complete their 2018 returns and helping  us begin work on a long-term solution to temporary tax policy.   I have asked our majority leader to rule XIV this bill onto the  calendar, and I urge the House to send us a tax bill to address the  extenders without further delay.   Just this morning, I had discussions with Iowa Congressmen of both  political parties about this issue to contact the leadership of the  House and the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee on the  importance of moving legislation since the Constitution doesn't allow  the Senate to move tax legislation in the first place.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Peters, Mr. Tillis,          Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Reed,          Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Burr, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Manchin,          Mr. Schumer, Mr. Udall, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hassan, Mrs.          Gillibrand, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 638.
