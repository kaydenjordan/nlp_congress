 Mr. Speaker, this bill includes my  bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act, which requires FEMA to  place greater consideration on the severe localized impact of damage  following a disaster.   I have fought for this critical disaster fairness legislation for  years, and we finally have an opportunity to get it signed into law.  Enacting this language will help level the playing field, help central  and southern Illinois receive greater fairness when disaster happens.   Thank you, Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio, for working  to include this provision. I urge adoption of this legislation and this  bill.
