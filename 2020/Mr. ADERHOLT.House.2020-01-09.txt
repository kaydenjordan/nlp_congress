 Mr. Speaker, I want to, as well, today, pay tribute to  Michael Gerard Fitzpatrick, who, as has been mentioned, served in this  House, representing Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.   It was a privilege to serve with Mike, and, from the first time that  I met Mike here in Washington in the House, I knew he was a man of  character and a man of principle.   Mr. Speaker, I think you have heard from the words that were spoken  this morning before I spoke that, indeed, was the reputation that he  had here in Washington, D.C., as I am sure he had back in the State of  Pennsylvania.   Today, as we pay tribute to Michael and his life, I am reminded, with  just the passing of my own mother-in-law at 5 o'clock this morning,  Shirley McDonald from Huntsville, Alabama, who was struggling from  Parkinson's disease, of just how short life is. Literally, I am  reminded of the shortness of time and the greatness of eternity.   But my mother-in-law, Shirley, and Michael knew that there is a life  beyond this one and that, because of Christ, we can have hope to enter  an eternal life.                            ____________________
