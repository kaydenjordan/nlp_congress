 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize my equal partner in this  Special Order, my very good friend from Texas, Representative Al Green.   Representative Green represents the parents and, for that matter, the  place where Austin Tice, the person about whom we are speaking today,  was born.   He and I have partnered because Austin Tice, though born in Texas,  moved to the District of Columbia. Like many in the House and Senate,  we have grave concerns about Austin Tice and want to express those  concerns and call upon those who are keeping him in Syria to let him  go.   Mr. Speaker, I can't say enough about how strongly bipartisan this  matter is--bipartisan, yes--and bicameral. There are dozens upon dozens  of Members of the House and the Senate who have written the President  to ask him to do all he can to bring Austin Tice home from what we  believe is captivity in Syria.   Despite the difficulties our country is having, as I speak, with  Syria, this, we  [[Page H8778]]  believe, is not a lost cause. In fact, we are encouraged that there are  Americans who Syria has let come home. Sam Goodwin is one. Canadian  Kristian Baxter is another.   So we do more than hold out hope that we can bring Austin Tice home.   So, let me explain who Austin Tice is and why he has attracted such  concern and interest in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.   First of all, I want to pay tribute to his mother and father, Marc  and Debra Tice, who have never lost hope that they can bring their son  home, have visited Members of the House and Senate, and have never  stopped seeking his return to the United States.   Let me tell you why he is of special concern to me. Austin Tice not  only lived in the District of Columbia and will continue to live here  when he returns; Austin Tice was a U.S. marine. He served in the Armed  Forces of the United States.   When he came home, he enrolled in Georgetown Law school and had only  a year to go when he left the law school, because he so yearned to be a  reporter, and went to Syria in the early days of the civil war.   Now, because he didn't speak to a lawyer first, he entered Syria  without a visa. That is why he is being held. It is not the kind of  reason you would expect someone to be held in a foreign country.   After all, Syria holds more American hostages, than any country in  the world or any group that is holding people--we think about half a  dozen.   You wouldn't think that not having a valid visa could be anything but  easily corrected, but he has been there, we believe--now he will turn  38, or he may have turned 38 by now--for 7 years with no word from him.   And that is why we come to the floor of the House tonight, because we  are very concerned because we cannot be in touch with him. Despite  working through the appropriate intermediary, the Czechoslovakian  embassy, we have not been able to receive word.   Austin Tice left for Lebanon, by car, from Damascus. Then he fell  into rebel hands and was detained at the checkpoint. That is the last  we have heard of him.   January 3, the very first day of the 116th Congress, my partner and I  introduced a resolution for Syria to return Austin Tice, and that was  as soon as the House commenced this session.   Frankly, I am concerned that, as I note in our House resolution, that  there has been a video clip on YouTube. That clip shows Austin Tice  blindfolded and being prodded up a hillside by masked militants.   You can imagine, since we haven't heard from him since, why we are on  the floor this evening.   The Syrian Government has not acknowledged that they are even  detaining Austin Tice or his whereabouts. Officials of the United  States, however, believe that Austin Tice is alive, and they believe  that he is being held either by the government of Bashar al-Assad or by  some group affiliated with that government.   The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to  the return of Austin Tice, and we are pleased that so many journalism  organizations are working for his return.   It is important to note that Austin Tice was anything but a  combatant. He was a journalist. He only went to Syria because he wanted  to talk with the people who were living through an awful civil war. He  was freelance, so he wasn't working through any powerful media, and his  concern and his interest in journalism is what drove him, not any  undermining of Syria or even views on the Syrian Government. He was  acting as a journalist to find out what was happening.   Now, we recognize that Syria does not have a policy of never  releasing American citizens. We refer to Sam Goodwin, 30 years old, who  also made a mistake. He crossed--just like Austin Tice, he just made a  mistake. He crossed the border from Iraq into northeast Syria without a  visa because he was trying to visit every country in the world, all the  innocence of that. And it was that kind of innocence that I think we  should assign to Austin Tice because he is much like Sam Goodwin in  that regard.   We call upon the Syrian Government to understand Austin Tice in that  context, the naivete of a young man without legal advice, simply  seeking knowledge, not seeking to undermine a government or to in any  way interfere with the government.   There are others who have been held and who are believed to be in  custody whose families are beginning to speak out. It is important to  note that many families whose relatives are held in Syria do not speak  out because they are concerned that, in doing so, they will be acting  against the best interests of the family member held.    So, you can see how concerned the parents of Austin Tice must be that  they have felt they had to speak out after 7 years.   Bear in mind that the United States has leverage with Syria, because  this country is the largest single humanitarian donor to Syria. We are  providing or have provided more than $8 billion in humanitarian  assistance for those displaced inside of Syria and the region since the  start of that crisis in Syria.   The U.S. Government itself is supporting emergency food assistance,  shelter, safe drinking water, urgent medical care, humanitarian  protection activities, and other urgent relief. And I believe, if the  Syrian Government understands or considers humanitarian aid from the  United States, they will see that they have nothing to lose by freeing  this American citizen.   Last month, the President told reporters that he himself was  interested in working on securing the release of hostages in Syria.  However, we do not know what action the President has taken and call  upon him to become involved, as he said he would.   The only intervention we know of is his intervention into the  captivity in North Korea of Otto Warmbier, but by the time he got home,  it was too late, and he died shortly after being released.   However, we believe that this Austin Tice is alive and can, in fact,  come home safe to us.   We believe that, in any negotiations with Syria, the fate of our  hostages should be front and center. We are pleased that Senator  Lindsey Graham has indicated exactly that as well, again showing the  bipartisan and bicameral concern about those being held in Syria.   On August the 11th of this year, Austin Tice's parents wrote an op-ed  that appeared in papers around the country on the birthday of Austin  Tice. They said: ``We wish we could remind him of how glad we are he  was born, how blessed we are to be his parents, and how truly we  believe the world is a better place for having him in it.''   Those are the words of his parents.   We are on the floor of the House today to speed Austin Tice home.                                time  1945    Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my partner to come to the floor now,  Representative Al Green, who, of course, is the Representative from the  home State of Austin Tice's parents and where Austin Tice was born and  raised.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I don't think there could have been a more  eloquent statement than the statement we have just heard from my good  friend, Al Green.   I am inclined to believe that if the Syrian authorities were  listening, even they could not resist the eloquence, the depth of  Representative Green's very intelligent but heartfelt statement.   I know that statement is much appreciated by Austin Tice's parents,  who have had to go these 7 years alone, with only your help as their  Member of Congress.   I am also grateful to the Members of Congress who, after all, don't  necessarily represent anyone connected with Austin Tice, as Al Green  and I do, for their generosity in coming to the floor. I would like to  call upon Representative Lori Trahan from Massachusetts to ask her to  say a few words at this time.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts  whose relationship with Austin Tice--she didn't know him, but there is  a school tie there.   It shows you that people, when they hear about Austin Tice's  captivity, are inclined to the eloquence of Mrs. Trahan, who just spoke  about him, spoke about him without knowing him, spoke with such  enviable and praiseworthy remarks.   I thank her so much. I know that I speak for his parents in thanking  her as well.   Mr. Speaker, I now want to introduce one of my good friends from the  region. We were so pleased to welcome her into our delegation, and I am  anxious to hear what she has to say because she, too, is neither from  Texas nor the District of Columbia, and yet, with selflessness, she has  asked to express her views on the captivity of Austin Tice.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), my good  friend, at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank my good friend,  Representative Spanberger, for those compelling remarks. Once again, we  are hearing from a Member who, as she says, did not know Austin Tice.   I hope that Debra and Marc Tice, when they see Representative  Spanberger give such eloquent and intelligent and deeply felt remarks,  are comforted to know that they are not alone in seeking the release of  their son.   Mr. Speaker, there are a number of Members, not to mention all of the  many Members of the House and Senate, who have signed on letters to the  President for help with Austin Tice, but it is worth noting again that,  on the very first day of Congress, Rep. Al Green introduced H. Res. 17.   That resolution, introduced with Representative Al Green, sought,  from the very beginning of the 116th Congress, to draw attention to  Austin Tice, and we will not cease drawing just that kind of attention  until we have learned where Austin Tice is and when he is coming home.   The resolution that we introduced expressed concern over the  detention of Austin Tice and laid out many of the factual matters that  the Members have offered here today. In that resolution, we not only  expressed our concern regarding the detention of Austin Tice, we asked  the State Department and the intelligence community and the interagency  Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell to jointly continue investigations and to  pursue all information. We have every reason to believe that that is  being done by our agencies.   We encouraged, in our resolution, the State Department and the  Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs to engage directly with  Syrian officials to facilitate Austin's safe release. In our  resolution, we encourage the State Department to work with foreign  governments known to have diplomatic influence with the Government of  Syria, and we request the State Department and the intelligence  community to continue to work with and to inform Congress and Austin  Tice's family regarding his safe release and his condition at this  time.   We, I think, in bringing this very young man to the attention of the  American people, we have shown our concern and have shown that we  remain hopeful.   In this case, no word is good word; it is word, that he is alive, we  believe. The best word would be word to the parents, Debra and Marc  Tice, that he is on his way home safe and sound.   Let me pledge on behalf of the many Members of the House and Senate  who have written the President, let me assure these parents, Marc and  Debra Tice: This Special Order devoted to your son, Austin Tice, is not  the end of the work we will continue to do until we bring your son,  Austin Tice, home. We appreciate the devotion you have shown as  parents, and we mean to honor that devotion by continuing to do all we  can in the Congress to make sure that Austin Tice is returned to you  safe and sound.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 7 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
