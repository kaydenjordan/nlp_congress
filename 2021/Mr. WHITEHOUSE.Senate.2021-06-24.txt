 Mr. President, I rise today in appreciation of  a lifelong Rhode Islander and a healthcare trailblazer, Dr. Al Puerini.  We wish him well in the next chapter of life.   Al Puerini was born, raised, and trained in Rhode Island. After  graduating from his beloved Providence College and training in family  medicine at Brown University, Al began his practice in Cranston, RI, in  the early eighties. He excelled in his work. He soon began teaching  family medicine at Brown's Warren Alpert School of Medicine and was  elected a fellow at the American Academy of Family Physicians.   But his revolutionary work began in the mid-1990s, when Al helped to  found and then lead the Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians  Corporation as it embarked on an important mission: to reimagine the  way we deliver healthcare. Al and his RIPCPC colleagues combined the  talents of over 150 primary care physicians and over 200 specialists  and negotiated new contracts with local health insurers. Instead of  following the fee-for-service treadmill that encourages doctors to  shuffle as many people through their offices as possible, these new  contracts rewarded providers for the health of their patients. They  also aimed to increase collaboration and communication among  specialists, providers, and hospitals to improve health outcomes.   As these contracts proved effective, Al and his board decided to  think bigger. In 2014, they joined with Care New England to help form  Integra Community Care Network, the largest accountable care  organization, ACO, in Rhode Island. The Affordable Care Act's  accountable care organizations take the principle Al had pursued for  years--paying providers based on the health of their patients--and put  it to use in the Medicare Program. At Integra, primary care providers,  hospitals, specialists, extended care providers, and others all work  together to achieve more coordinated, accountable care. As someone who  fought for ACOs in the ACA, I was thrilled to see Rhode Islanders step  up to that challenge.   Integra now serves more than 1 in 10 patients in Rhode Island. It has  been a national success. Beyond Medicare patients, it works with major  private insurers and Medicaid. It has earned a 95-percent quality  rating from the Federal Government and saved over $20 million in  healthcare costs since 2015. Integra now stands a model for ACOs across  the country.   Even as he built a new national model of care, Al never stopped  serving his patients, his community, and his beloved alma mater,  Providence College. He maintained his Cranston private practice for  over three decades. He was recognized as Rhode Island's ``Top Doc''  twice over that span. He was named a Rhode Island Academy of Family  Physicians Physician of the Year in 2017. And he sustained a passion  for sports medicine, which he cultivated as the Friars' head team  physician from 1988 on. He even earned a spot in the Providence College  Hall of Fame 2 years ago.   Dr. Puerini, congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. You  have shown us how to change the way health care is delivered and proven  to the Nation that the triple aim of better care, lower costs, and  happier and healthier patients is achievable. Thank you for everything  you did to improve the care of Rhode Islanders and for the care you  personally provided to so patients through the years. You made a  tremendous difference.                            ____________________
