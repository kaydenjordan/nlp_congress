 We can all agree that it is wrong to murder a person,  Mr. Speaker, or in other words to take someone's life. So my pro- abortion colleagues need to answer the simple question of when does a  little baby girl's life start?   Does it start at 6 weeks when the baby girl's heart starts beating?  Most pro-abortion advocates oppose the 6-week heartbeat laws, so they  would not consider a heartbeat to be life. What about when a little  baby girl can start to feel pain around the halfway point in pregnancy?  Not a single House Democrat cosponsored legislation that would affect  babies who can feel pain, so it seems they don't believe in life at the  halfway point either.   What about at 21 weeks, Mr. Speaker, when the baby girl could  potentially survive outside the womb thanks to lifesaving medical  technology? It seems simple to say if she could live outside the womb,  she must be alive inside the womb, as well. Yet most pro-abortion  advocates still say we should be able to kill her without a second  thought.   Many of my pro-abortion colleagues also believe we should be able to  abort viable babies even up through birth. Why should abortion doctors  be allowed to kill a baby who has developed organs, a beating heart,  and even the ability to recognize the sound of their own mother's  voice? There is no excuse for aborting babies at birth, but the pro- abortion movement believes this murder should be allowed anyway.   It is time my pro-abortion colleagues start following the science and  realize those little babies are human, alive, and worthy of life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith for the incredible work he is doing.  He may not get his rewards here, but I assure you he will in Heaven.
