 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Magaziner for the warm  introduction. I thank Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, who,  alongside Representative Magaziner and I, make up our small but very  mighty Rhode Island congressional delegation.   Of course, I am grateful for my predecessor, former Representative  David Cicilline. I am grateful for his service to Rhode Island, and I  look forward to our work together in both of our new roles.   To my family, friends, community leaders, and all those who have  supported me along the way, I thank them. Of course, I thank the people  of the First Congressional District and those across Rhode Island for  giving me the opportunity to serve in the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you a story about Rhode Island. Reverend  Mahlon Van Horne was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly in  1885, making him the first Black person elected to serve in the State  legislature. Just think, Mr. Speaker, Reverend Van Horne was elected as  a Black man nearly two decades after the end of the Civil War.    In an 1887 sermon, the Reverend said: ``I believe the day is coming,  is not far off, when in the commonwealth of Rhode Island, the stomping  ground of soul liberty will become the home of the free and the land of  the truly brave--the home of the free, where fair play in all the walks  of life will be accorded.''   Those words are at top of mind for me today.   Reverend Van Horne's dream and the dreams of those who have called  Rhode Island home across generations allow me to stand before you  today, Mr. Speaker.   While we have not arrived at our final destination in this project of  our democracy, I am optimistic. As a Rhode Islander, it is easy for me.  After all, our State motto is ``Hope.'' It is hope that led my parents  to come from West Africa, my dad from Ghana and my mom from Liberia, to  pursue opportunity in the greatest country in the world.   Nevertheless, this is not just my story. It is a Rhode Island story,  and it is an American story. That shared story is why today I am proud  to be the Representative from Rhode Island's First Congressional  District.   Mr. Speaker, what is beautiful about hope is that it cares not about  your race, your religion, your gender, or where your ancestors came  from. This belief has inspired people who arrived in Rhode Island from  Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,  Colombia, Armenia, and, yes, countries in West Africa, and so many  places in between.   I, of course, must acknowledge those whose family branches extend  from the Native Tribes of our shores to the settlers who came for  religious freedom to those who did not choose their journey because  they were enslaved people but whose hope persisted nonetheless.   Together, and why I am here, is that we ensure our great hope for the  future is met with profound action: action to protect and strengthen  retirement security, support our seniors, create economic opportunity  and good-paying jobs, secure reproductive freedom and keep politics out  of the doctor's office, ensure the livability of our planet for our  children and their grandchildren, ban assault weapons and end gun  violence, and stand up to the threats facing our democracy.   So this hallowed space, this House floor, is where we have always had  to work vigorously toward the promise of our Nation's highest ideals  and aspirations, and I cannot wait to work on behalf of the people of  the First Congressional District, everyone from Woonsocket to Newport,  East Providence to Cumberland, Providence to Bristol, and, of course,  the great city of Pawtucket.   I thank Rhode Island for putting its trust in me to bring our values  of hard work, grit, determination, and resilience in the face of  adversity all the way from the Ocean State to the Halls of the United  States Congress. I will work hard for those people in Rhode Island and  those people across this country every single day. I am grateful for  this privilege.                            ____________________
