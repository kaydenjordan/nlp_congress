 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss an important  provision in the tax conference agreement that relates to the 20- percent deduction for certain passthrough income for agricultural  cooperatives.   I was pleased to see that the conference report fairly treats certain  distributions from farmer cooperatives to their patron. This treatment  will ensure that farmers will not see a tax increase at a time of  depressed agricultural prices.   I would like to clarify a drafting change that occurred in moving  from the Senate language to the conference report language.  Specifically, section 199A(c)(1) provides that the term ``qualified  business income'' does not include any ``qualified cooperative  dividends,'' as defined by the bill. I would like to clarify that in  this sentence, the terms ``qualified business income'' and ``qualified  cooperative dividends'' are mutually exclusive and that the intent is  that these terms are to be treated separately under sections 199A(a)(1)  and (2), as they were under the Senate bill.   Also, I believe that the definition of ``qualified cooperative  dividends'' includes ``per unit retains paid in money,'' PURPIMs, paid  under 1382(b)(3).
