 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, the ranking member from  Michigan.   Mr. Chairman, I am thrilled to hear my colleague talk about the  Constitution. I am sorry that the Constitution that he is talking about  doesn't include the right to a jury trial because that is the  Constitution that I read.   And this piece of legislation, H.R. 1215, will threaten that  constitutional right. We have been told there is nothing to worry about  in this bill because it will cover 100 percent of economic costs-- anything that comes with a receipt, we were told.   I am going to tell you what is wrong with this bill and the stories  of four people: a young child who goes in for a simple procedure and  leaves the hospital paralyzed; a young adult who requires the  amputation of his left leg, but the doctor amputates the right leg and  he leaves the hospital with neither; the woman whose physician used his  power to sexually assault her while she is sedated; and the rape of a  nursing home patient by a trusted healthcare provider.    Mr. Chairman, there will be no receipts that will cover the costs  that those four individuals would suffer for the rest of their lives  that could be turned in, compensated, and subject to this artificial  cap.   Why is it that my colleagues believe that they are in a better  position to determine how those wronged individuals should be  compensated for the atrocities that happened to them instead of  allowing a jury of their peers do the same?   This bill is not meant to help reduce costs. This is an assault on  injured people. This is an assault on those who value access to the  courtroom in order to see justice.   I urge my colleagues, in the strongest possible terms, to reject this  anticonsumer, this terrible piece of legislation.
