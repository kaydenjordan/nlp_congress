 Mr. Speaker, let me rise with a great deal of  concern and, as well, righteousness and enthusiasm to support the Safe  Sleep for Babies Act of 2021.   Our children are our most precious resource, and no one knows how to  address parents who have had a child lose their life because of devices  that were sold to them to comfort their babies. The Safe Sleep for  Babies Act of 2021, in particular, is going to help to take those  products off that heretofore have gone without discovery, without  assessment, and without penalty. They are devices that are in cribs and  bassinets that have not been assessed to cause death.    Babies have been losing their lives to frightened parents, shocked  parents, caretakers, and grandparents. What a tragedy to lose that  infant in the early part of their life through no fault of the  caretaker, the parent, and, certainly, that baby.   This legislation, I hope, will find its way quickly through the  United States Senate and as well find its way quickly to the  President's desk.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we have, frighteningly, seen  over the past weeks and months the loss of life of children through gun  violence. We have a responsibility from the very birth of a child, from  its time to come to be with its loving family, to find a way to protect  and preserve its life. Babies, again, are enormously precious.   I think this legislation is long overdue. I ask my colleagues to  support the Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2021. I am glad to join the  Energy and Commerce Committee and its original sponsor, Mr. Cardenas,  to be able to, hopefully, move this bill as quickly as possible.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee and the founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's  Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1314, the ``Stop Tip-Overs of  Unstable, Risky Dressers on Children Act,'' or ``STURDY Act,'' which  directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to adopt a stronger,  mandatory stability standard for clothing storage units within one year  of enactment, following the streamlined rulemaking process that it has  used for numerous children's products.   A tip-over can involve a piece of furniture, often a dresser or other  type of clothing storage unit, falling onto a small child.   These dangerous episodes can lead to a trip to the emergency room, or  even death.   A child is sent to the emergency room because of a tip-over incident  every 60 minutes, and on average, 1 to 2 children die every month.   Children age 2 to 5 are at the highest risk--their motor abilities  allow them to navigate the home by themselves and their intellectual  development makes them curious about objects that might be out of  reach.   In June 2016, IKEA recalled 29 million dressers and chests due to a  tipover hazard;  [[Page H2950]]  at least 8 children died in tragic tip-over accidents and hundreds of  children have been injured by IKEA furniture.   Mr. Speaker, relying upon a voluntary standard for dressers is not  enough to protect our children from tip-overs.   The voluntary standard only tests whether a dresser or drawer will  tip with 50 lbs. hanging from an open drawer.   This standard has not proven stringent enough to reduce tip-overs,  and it also only applies to dressers over 27 inches.   Even as weak as it is, dressers do not have to meet this voluntary  standard.   That is why the STURDY Act is needed; it will help prevent the deaths  of children from tip-overs.   Specifically, the STURDY Act:   1. Mandates testing on all clothing units;   2. Requires testing to simulate the weights of children up to 72  months old;   3. Requires testing measures to account for scenarios involving  carpeting, loaded drawers, and the dynamic force of a climbing child;   4. Mandates strong warning requirements; and   5. Requires the CPSC to issue the mandatory standard within 1 year of  the STURDY Act's enactment.   I strongly support H.R. 1314, the Stop Tip-Overs of Unstable, Risky  Dressers on Youth Act, and urge all Members to join me in voting for  its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my voice in support  of H.R. 983, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act, and I  congratulate the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) for his work,  again, on an enormously commonsense bill.   This is a commonsense and needed bipartisan fix to close a loophole  in Federal law that allows con artists who make in-person pitches to  defraud veterans of their well-earned benefits.   The State of Texas is home to 1.5 million veterans, and the State of  Texas operates a large network of nursing homes for veterans.   All of us have heard stories in our offices, through our veterans'  caseworker, of the horrible, horrible attacks on veterans because of  the benefits they receive. Yes, financial attacks. And they are  attacks. Unlike the battlefield, where they can defend themselves,  these attacks, they cannot.   Veterans at these homes and veterans seeking treatment at medical  treatment facilities may be susceptible to the in-person grifters  falsely claiming that they can facilitate the provisions of additional  veterans' benefits.   This bill would help hold scammers accountable and allow the  Department of Justice to protect the integrity of veterans' benefits  programs. Protecting veterans and their survivors from these types of  in-person scams is particularly important, since so many depend on  service-connected disability payments.   As chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee,  I am focused on addressing fraud and other veterans' issues.   To that end, I ask my colleagues today to join me as I also work on  legislation to buttress veterans' courts and to make them a more  equitable and successful rehabilitation model.   I thank my colleague from the Judiciary Committee, Ted Deutch, for  championing this bill and persisting in his effort.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my voice in support of H.R. 983, the  ``Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act.''   This bill is a commonsense and needed bipartisan fix to close a  loophole in federal law that allows con artists who make in-person  pitches to defraud veterans of their well-earned benefits.   My state of Texas is home to nearly 1.5 million veterans, and the  state of Texas operates a large network of nursing homes for veterans.

Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee and the Chair of its Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 983, the  ``Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act,'' commonsense and necessary  bipartisan legislation that establishes a new criminal offense for  knowingly engaging in or attempting to engage in a scheme to defraud  veterans of their hard-earned benefits.   My state of Texas is home to nearly 1.5 million veterans, and the  state operates a large network of nursing homes for veterans called  Texas State Veterans Homes.   Houston houses over 282,000 of these veterans, many of whom live in  these state-owned nursing homes.   Veterans at these Texas nursing homes or those seeking treatment at  medical facilities are susceptible to in-person scammers falsely  claiming that they can facilitate the provision of additional veterans  benefits when they are actually swindling veterans out of their  benefits.   H.R. 983 will help hold these con artists accountable and provide an  additional tool to the Department of Justice to protect the integrity  of veterans' benefits programs and prevent fraud.   Protecting veterans and their survivors from these types of in-person  scams is imperative since so many depend on service-connected  disability payments, including those in my district in Houston.   I ask my colleagues here today to join me as I also work on  legislation to strengthen veterans' courts and to make them more  equitable and successful rehabilitation models.   I thank my colleague from the Judiciary Committee, Congressman Deutch  of Florida, for championing this bill and persisting in his effort to  protect our veterans with this legislation.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 983, the  Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2694, the  Criminal Judicial Administration Act of 2021.   This legislation reflects another step in our ongoing work commitment  to ensure that justice is administered fairly and equally in this  country.   The first part of the bill relates to our Federal pretrial system. I  thank Mr. Nadler, our chairman; and, of course, the author of this  bill, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).   As we work on changes to our pretrial system, we must also make  certain that indigent defendants who are released on bail pending  trial, who live far away from the courthouse in which they must appear,  can make it to the court for required appearances.   As the chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security  Subcommittee, it is our committee that deals with the criminal justice  system and the system that should be fair to victim and alleged  perpetrator. That means that individuals who are defendants and are  indigent must be able to get to the courthouse in order to assure a  fair justice system.   For out-of-custody defendants, the financial and emotional toll of  making required court appearances is considerable. It can mean taking  time off from sorely needed jobs, sometimes without compensation, or  shifting scarce household resources to make it to court on time and to  avoid rearrest for failure to appear.   These challenges are heightened for defendants who have cases pending  in districts that are far from where they live. This distance can also  lead to unnecessary pretrial detention, as courts wrestle with how to  ensure that defendants who live out of their districts can make  required court appearances. This is a commonsense legislative  initiative.   H.R. 2694 gives courts the ability to direct the U.S. marshals to  provide for roundtrip travel and subsistence for indigent defendants or  those who cannot otherwise afford those costs to attend court during  the pendency of their cases.   This is an important step in our work on Federal pretrial reform,  and, as I said, common sense in fairness of the system.   The second part of the bill promotes judicial economy by allowing  magistrate judges to oversee the entirety of the cases in which they  exercised trial jurisdiction. This administrative step is important for  our overburdened Federal judiciary and our efforts to fairly administer  justice to all individuals. That is certainly the responsibility of  those of us on the House Judiciary Committee.   I thank Representative Jeffries for his work on this bill, which I  encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting today.

I thank Representative Jeffries for his work on this bill, which I  encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  [[Page H2958]]  thank the ranking member for his presentation and the gentlewoman for  her presentation.   I am proud to support H.R. 2922, the Elder Abuse Protection Act,  which has been supported by my colleague from Texas, the Honorable  Sylvia Garcia.   As Chairman Nadler said and detailed, the sheer number of elder abuse  cases is astounding and shameful, and the pandemic has only worsened  the economic and emotional circumstances that so many seniors face.   This problem is particularly grave for linguistic minority groups. My  hometown of Houston has a large Hispanic community, and I am  particularly concerned with efforts to exploit my elder Spanish- speaking constituents.   In Texas, 20 percent of Hispanics are 65 years or older. One study of  this population found that limited English proficiency was a barrier to  accessing medical and social services.   That is why the thoughtful legislation offered by Congresswoman  Garcia is so very important, and its time is now.   I am an enthusiastic supporter of this bill because it would make  permanent the Elder Justice Initiative in the Department of Justice and  require it to translate into Spanish those resources the initiative  makes available to the public. The cost of translating those  educational materials is small compared to the benefit they would  bring. It would be a modest undertaking for the Department of Justice,  given that DOJ already has litigation translation services in place.   Lastly, this bill makes permanent the National Elder Fraud Hotline-- very important. Since March 2020, the hotline has answered tens of  thousands of calls from elder Americans who have called in need of  support, offering a service to get information on how to prevent elder  fraud for the many elder Americans who don't have access to the  internet.   We all know the most vulnerable. These elders who have worked to  build this country deserve to live their senior years in peace and  tranquility and with respect and dignity. They do not deserve to be  taken advantage of by fraudulent individuals, fraudulent schemes, and  fraudulent practices. If we can do anything to help them, we should do  it.   This legislation strongly helps them, and I commend Ms. Garcia for  championing this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in  favor of this much-needed legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager and the chairman of  the full committee, Committee on the Judiciary, and to the manager for  our friends on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 961, the Justice for  Juveniles Act.   This is very close to my heart as the chair of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security working on  these juvenile justice issues. And this is a necessary and important  bipartisan bill that will save incarcerated young persons' lives.   As indicated, chairing the subcommittee, we recently held a hearing  titled, ``Juvenile Justice Pipeline and the Road Back to Integration.''  I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) for this very  effective and important initiative.   During the hearing, we heard testimony from witness after witness who  acknowledged the body of scientific research that has been embraced by  experts and the Supreme Court--and that I have known and seen over the  years as we have written legislation--demonstrating that juveniles do  not have the same cognitive and emotional maturity as adults.   In fact, there is data that says that the brain does not fully mature  until age 25. This bill makes a good change to the Prison Litigation  Reform Act to take into account that the overwhelming majority of  juveniles cannot comply with the law's complex grievance procedures by  themselves. This bill is an important bipartisan step to ensuring  incarcerated juveniles are rehabilitated and given the best chance  possible to reintegrate into society.   Just some statistics that I saw recently when I received a note about  a graduation of foster children from high school, saying about 60  percent of those children not having a complete opportunity in life did  not graduate from high school. And so these children wind up in these  facilities. They should not; they should have a life. And therefore, we  should be able--not associating foster care children with those  incarcerated--but we do know the susceptibility to these children and  others who don't have a steady hand in their life. So this is an  important step.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, for  authoring this bill.   As I worked on this legislation, it is important to note that to deal  with a grievance system, it requires an understanding of the grievance  process. But on a more basic level, it requires that an incarcerated  person be able to read.   According to one study, we know that incarcerated youth are  functionally illiterate in many instances, and the baseline reading  levels vary from grade 1 to 6. That is a plague, if you will, on  children in our society that can have a bright and wonderful life.   In addition, approximately 70 percent of incarcerated juveniles have  at least one learning disability. And we know that because of what  happens in schools in the recently changed State laws where juveniles  have been sent from the schoolhouse to juvenile detention.    Mr. Speaker, this alone justifies the changes in the  bill, which simply allow incarcerated juveniles to go directly to court  to have serious deficiencies in their incarceration, including  allegations of assault, corrected.   As I said, I thank my colleague, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon. As  I work on legislation to achieve more extensive juvenile justice  reform, I support the passage of this bill--commonsense, overdue--and  ask that my colleagues support this as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 961, the ``Justice for  Juveniles Act.'' This is a necessary and important bipartisan bill that  will save incarcerated young people's lives.   The Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee, which I  chair, recently held a hearing titled the ``Juvenile Justice Pipeline  and the Road Back to Integration.''

These requirements not only require an understanding of the grievance  process, but on a more basic level, require that an incarcerated person  be able to read. According to one study, among incarcerated youth, 85  percent are functionally illiterate, and the ``baseline reading levels  var[y] from grade 1 to grade 6.''   In addition, approximately 70 percent of incarcerated juveniles have  at least one learning disability.   This alone justifies the changes in the bill, which simply allow  incarcerated juveniles to go directly to court to have serious  deficiencies in their incarceration, including allegations of assault,  corrected.   This bill is a small but important bipartisan step to ensuring  incarcerated juveniles are rehabilitated and given the best chance  possible to reintegrate into society.   I thank my colleague on the Crime Subcommittee, Representative Mary  Gay Scanlon, for authoring this bill.   As I work on legislation to achieve more extensive juvenile justice  reform, I support passage of this bill today and ask that my colleagues  do the same.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 704, the ``Artistic  Recognition For Talented Students Act,'' or Arts Act,'' bicameral,  bipartisan legislation that directs the Register of Copyrights to waive  the filing fee for an application to register a copyright for a  student's work that has won the Congressional Art Competition or the  Congressional App Challenge.   The Congressional Art Competition (``Art Competition'') and the  Congressional App Challenge (``App Challenge'') are annual district-by- district contests that recognize students' achievements in the visual  arts and in the science, technology, engineering, and math (``STEM'')  fields.   The Art Competition began in 1982 to encourage students' artistic  creativity.   High school students are eligible to participate by submitting two- dimensional artwork, which is typically judged by a panel of local  artists.   The App Challenge stems from H. Res. 77, adopted in the 113th  Congress, which recognized both the importance of STEM achievement to  the country and the importance of encouraging students to appreciate  and pursue career paths in STEM and established an academic STEM  challenge to further those goals.   Middle and high school students are eligible to participate in the  App Challenge by creating a software app using any programming language  and any platform.   Winners of the Art Competition have their work hung in the Cannon  Tunnel for one year, and in the App Challenge, winning apps may be  displayed in the Capitol or on the House's website.   H.R. 704 would add another element to the award winners' prizes-- winning students will be able to file an application to register a  [[Page H2982]]  copyright for their winning artwork or app without paying a filing fee.   H.R. 704's filing fee waiver complements the related aims of both  contests by introducing young artists and innovators to the  intellectual property system and the benefits of copyright protection.   Intellectual property rights like copyright allow artists and  innovators to protect and benefit economically from their work,  incentivizing them to continue to pour time and resources into further  creations and innovations.   Industries that rely on intellectual property have a significant  economic impact and are integral to the U.S. economy.   Despite intellectual property's importance, studies show that  students have low awareness of intellectual property, even if they are  likely to encounter intellectual property later in their careers.   H.R. 704 helps close this awareness gap early on by introducing  students who have shown interest in the arts and STEM to the  possibilities of copyright registration and removing the economic  barrier for pursuing such registration.   As part of the copyright application process, the winning works may  also become a part of the Library of Congress' collections and  archives, 75 further spreading the reach of these students' creations.   Under current law, the Register of Copyrights does not have authority  to waive filing fees for winning students on her own.   Section 708(a)(1) of the Copyright Act prescribes that fees be paid  to the Copyright Office for filing an application for registration of a  copyright, and the Register has only limited authority to waive fees  involving the United States government.   H.R. 704 amends this section to allow such waivers for the student  winners of the Art Competition and App Challenge.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 704, ``Artistic  Recognition For Talented Students Act,'' or Arts Act.''    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1340) to amend title 28, United States Code, to redefine  the eastern and middle judicial districts of North Carolina.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1340         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JUDICIAL DISTRICTS OF NORTH CAROLINA.         (a) In General.--Section 113 of title 28, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and Wilson and'' and       inserting ``Wilson, those portions of Hoke, Moore, Scotland,       and Richmond counties encompassing the Fort Bragg Military       Reservation and Camp Mackall, and''; and        (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Middle District.--The Middle District comprises the       counties of Alamance, Cabarrus, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson,       Davie, Durham (excluding that portion of Durham County       encompassing the Federal Correctional Institution, Butner,       North Carolina), Forsyth, Guilford, Hoke (excluding that       portion of Hoke County encompassing the Fort Bragg Military       Reservation and Camp Mackall), Lee, Montgomery, Moore       (excluding that portion of Moore County encompassing the Fort       Bragg Military Reservation and Camp Mackall), Orange, Person,       Randolph, Richmond (excluding that portion of Richmond County       encompassing the Fort Bragg Military Reservation and Camp       Mackall), Rockingham, Rowan, Scotland (excluding that portion       of Scotland County encompassing the Fort Bragg Military       Reservation and Camp Mackall), Stanly, Stokes, Surry, and       Yadkin.''.        (b) Application.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall not apply to any action commenced or pending in any       judicial district of North Carolina before the date of       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1340.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 would redefine the boundaries of the middle and  eastern districts of North Carolina to place Fort Bragg and Camp  Mackall, a sub-installation of Fort Bragg located roughly 40 miles  away, entirely within the eastern district, a very smart and  instructive decision.  [[Page H2984]]    After having been introduced by both Senators from North Carolina, S.  1340 passed the Senate last week. H.R. 2746, the identical House  companion to S. 1340, which recently passed the Judiciary Committee,  was introduced by a friend and colleague, Congresswoman Ross, and  Congressman Hudson and was cosponsored by every member of the North  Carolina House delegation.   This is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that will improve the  administration of justice in North Carolina.   Currently, even though Fort Bragg sits on the outskirts of  Fayetteville, which is in the eastern district, the base straddles both  judicial districts. The result of this split means that a Federal case  arising on one part of Fort Bragg will be heard at the Fayetteville  courthouse, which is roughly 20 minutes away, while a case arising on  another part of the base could be heard at courthouses more than 2  hours away.   The logistical difficulties resulting from Fort Bragg's split  jurisdiction can extend beyond the inconvenience of unnecessarily long  travel times. In criminal cases, for example, courts have had  difficulty ensuring that defendants have received notice of their  rights. S. 1340 will fix that and fix it now.   I want to thank Ms. Ross for her bipartisan work on this issue and  for her enormous leadership in championing this legislation in the  House.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill. I urge my colleagues  to support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Ross), who is the House sponsor of this very  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good day on the floor of the  House. S. 1340 will improve the administration of justice in the  Federal courts of North Carolina.   This is not only a bipartisan, bicameral effort, but it is also  evidence of Republicans and Democrats working together for the  uplifting of justice.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Representative Ross in  bringing this bill forward, and I hope all of my colleagues will  enthusiastically support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 would redefine the boundaries of the Middle and  Eastern Districts of North Carolina to place Fort Bragg and Camp  Mackall (a sub-installation of Fort Bragg located roughly 40 miles  away) entirely within the Eastern District.   After having been introduced by both Senators from North Carolina, S.  1340 passed the Senate last week. H.R. 2746, the identical House  companion to S. 1340, which recently passed the Judiciary Committee,  was introduced by Congresswoman Ross and Congressman Hudson and was  cosponsored by every member of the North Carolina House Delegation.

I am pleased to support  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 will improve the administration of justice in  the federal courts in North Carolina.   I appreciate the leadership of Representative Ross in bringing this  bill forward, and I hope all my colleagues will support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2679) to amend title 36, United States Code, to revise  the Federal charter for the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2679.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2679, the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association  Charter Amendments Act of 2021, makes important changes to the Federal  charter for the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association.   This legislation is intended to give the Federal Bar Association the  flexibility it needs to operate well into the future without the need  for further congressional amendment.   Among other things, the legislation makes the following changes to  the association's charter:   It requires the board of directors to decide, and specify in the  bylaws, the location of the principal office.   It specifies that the bylaws, not the charter, must provide for the  terms of membership, the responsibilities of the board of directors,  and the election of officers.   It prohibits a director or officer in his or her corporate capacity  from contributing to, supporting, or participating in political  activities.   It expands a prohibition on loans for directors and officers to  include members and employees.   It specifies that on dissolution or final liquidation of the  corporation, any remaining assets must be distributed as provided by  the board of directors instead of deposited in the Treasury.   I thank Mr. Chabot for introducing this important bipartisan  legislation, along with Mr. Raskin.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2679 and, as well,  support this insight and new look at justice, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the distinguished gentleman  who is the cosponsor of this legislation here in the House. We thank  him so much for his leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, we have found ourselves striking a chord for justice and  clarification to an important organization that stands for justice, the  Federal Bar Association. I thank the sponsors of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a number of important changes to  strengthen the charter of the Foundation of the Federal Bar  Association.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 3239.    Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart with the  extended amount of violence in this country that has taken hold of us  through the pandemic, and now we seem to be under siege.   No, it is not one isolated issue or community. It is not one isolated  reason. But it is a heavy burden on our children. Our children have  experienced an enormous amount of violence.   I intend, in my subcommittee, to discuss and have a briefing on both  gun violence and the impact on children, as well as violence, and to be  able to work with the administration on collaborative ways of dealing  with the ending of gun trafficking that has been a source of the mass  spreading of guns.   Laws like permitless guns, though I know they are in 12 States,  create a synergism of opportunity for guns to be spread everywhere, and  then the lack of respect for the dignity of our children so that guns  are not stored. I intend to introduce a gun storage bill.   I ask that if you see something, say something. We must, as a  Congress and America, stop the violence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and courageous  leader who brought us all together so many years ago and, I believe,  built up the Equality Caucus into such an effective spokesperson for  all of those who are voiceless in many instances.   Madam Speaker, I thank   David Cicilline. I remember the journey he  made on the Equality Act. It was a lot of meetings, a lot of  engagement, but he brought us all together. I am very proud to be an  original cosponsor and one that gave insight into the necessity for  that legislation.  [[Page H3001]]    Let me say the very obvious, and that is happy Pride Month. It is an  important statement for America, and it is about Americans.   Madam Speaker, these statistics from Texas would give you just a  bird's-eye view of what our State is like: percent of adults who are  LGBTQ-plus, 4.1 percent; total LGBTQ-plus population, 1,053,000 and, of  course, growing; the workforce, 5 percent.                                time  2120    Those who are workers, 647,000; and the LGBTQ-plus, adults raising  children, 29 percent--just regular Texans, regular Americans. That is  why we stand on the floor of the House today to be able to celebrate  Pride Month. And though many of the occasions we have had in Houston  and around the Nation are virtual, we are still making our voices  heard.   We look forward in Houston to our big Pride Parade, and, of course,  we look forward to recommitting ourselves to making equality in every  aspect of American life real for members of the LGBTQ community.   We have a shared struggle, a collective joy that is found in the  history of that struggle and life experiences that are unique. Unique  because individuals have that experience of the LGBTQ-plus. Experiences  that many of us have not had, but experiences that sometimes ground  themselves in unfair discrimination.   Mr. Cicilline, I heard a Member on the floor just a few minutes ago  indicate how he wanted to amend the Juneteenth legislation. He was  sorry he could not amend it. And I was thinking to myself, well, my  friend, we have been trying to amend it, establish it, declare it, for  156 years, since the Emancipation Proclamation, the second time around  in 1865, in Galveston. And we waited too long. And I would say that we  have been fighting for justice for this community, starting with  Stonewall in Greenwich Village, and I would say that we could not wait  any longer. That was an enormous moment of rising up for your own  dignity and freedom and a watershed moment in the LGBTQ movement,  reigniting the fight for justice and signaling a new chapter of  progress in our country's quest to ensure that fair treatment is the  rule, never the exception.   We appreciate the Supreme Court's decision in the fight to respect  same-sex couples' right to marry--that took a long time--and to love.  Our country's commitment to justice has been maintained by the tireless  work of advocates.   I had been here during the Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and just the  enormous pride when that was removed from the United States military  under President Obama's administration. The auditorium was standing  room only as that was signed to ensure that it never would happen  again.   This a social movement, enshrined with truth and belief, and the  basis of creating all of us worthy of human dignity.   In keeping with this belief, we cannot forget the great champions of  my great State, who have been proud Texans, who have not been afraid,  even in the climate that we live: Sara Fernandez, Judy Reed, Tommie  Ross, JD Doyle, Dalton DeHart, Judge Jerry Simoneaux, and Judge Fran  Watson. But, also, our senior stateswoman, and that is our former  mayor, Annise Parker, who led the cause for the status of LGBTQ in our  community. We thank you, former Mayor Parker.   We thank you for the fight of equality, though we did not make it in  this city when we tried to do an ordinance to indicate that bathrooms  were not important and no one in this community should be characterized  as attacking anyone but just wanting freedom and justice.   I would like to recognize a few organizations that continue to do  great work: The Houston GLBT Political Caucus, Save Our Sisters United,  Montrose Grace Place in the Montrose Center--many of these were  pioneers in doing the work that was so important.   Madam Speaker, I am reminded of the Ryan White Treatment Act. As a  member of the Houston City Council, I was honored to be the only Member  of Congress that came from Houston, Texas, to stand by Ryan White and  his family here in the United States Congress with the late former  Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch, the two cosponsors; stand  right next to him in a sweaty, very small room. I am not sure why they  selected that small room. They must have believed that we were not  coming from everywhere to witness this historic moment of the Ryan  White Treatment Act and to meet Ryan White at that time. It was an  amazing recognition at that time of the need for AIDS treatment.   But sadly to say, I sat by the bedside of many of my constituents  whose families would not acknowledge that they had HIV/AIDS, and they  died alone. What a moment that we lived through. So many died; so many  alone, except for friends who would be willing to be by their bedside.  We have come a mighty long way.   Madam Speaker, very quickly, as I close, that honor continues to go  to those who continue to fight. My meeting with Matthew Shepard's  mother, of sitting with her in my office when we talked about the  Matthew Shepard Act, and being so proud for her to include me in her  book. How heinous to lose your son in that way. How many parents have  had to face that?   But again, I pay tribute to Monica Roberts in Houston, who leaves a  gaping hole in the hearts of the LGBTQ-plus community. Monica worked as  a trailblazing journalist and advocate, never failing to censure the  stories of Black trans people and shining the light on the issues of  those often ignored.   We intend to introduce legislation dealing with the sizeable number  of murders against Black trans persons--mostly women. Ray Hill co- organized the first gay rights organization in Houston in 1967,  fiercely advocating for those living with HIV and AIDS.   And so the more than 46,000 same-sex couples in Texas, a third of  them LGBTQ Texans, who are raising children. This is a new day, but our  work for justice has not ended.   We thank the Williams Institute of the UCLA School of Law.  Approximately 900,000 Texans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender. And maybe one day my State will recognize the fullness of  the equality of all. Thank goodness for the H.R. 5, Equality Act, that  covers Texas as well.   Madam Speaker, in my third closing--with a little bit of humor--but  with all seriousness, I wanted to make sure that I added to this Record  the Texas Tribune article, ``Texas lawmakers advance bills blocking  access to gender-affirming healthcare despite opposition from LGBTQ  Texans, medical associations,'' directly impacting 17-year-old Indigo  Giles, who was able to get surgery before this law, now 19.    Madam Speaker, ending the depression that they faced, ending the  attacks that they felt, feeling more comfortable in their skin--that is  what this month is all about, saying to them, saying to America: We are  pride and we are proud. And we stand together as an extended family of  LGBTQ-plus and all of those who, frankly, recognize that our freedom is  intertwined with your freedom.
