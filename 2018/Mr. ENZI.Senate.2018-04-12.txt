 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for April 2018. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71. This  information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine  whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The  Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional  Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section  [[Page S2114]]  308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   The enforceable levels included in this report reflect all of the  numerical adjustments made to the resolution since its passage. The  information contained in this report captures legislative activity from  passage of the budget resolution through April 9, 2018. The only law  enacted with significant budgetary effects since my last filing, on  February 28, 2018, was the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, P.L.  115-141.   Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1 to 4 of this  report.   Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is  used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the  CBA. For this reporting period, 10 of the 16 authorizing committees are  in compliance with their allocations. As previously reported, the  Senate Veterans' Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions; Finance; and Agriculture, Nutrition,  and Forestry Committees are in breach of their allocations. Since my  last report, several committees' allocations were affected by changes  in the nonappropriations provisions included in the omnibus  appropriations bill. Still, the only new committee creating a breach  was the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which spent  $100 million more in both budget authority and outlays through Division  P of the omnibus, Ray Baum's Act of 2018, than allowed under the budget  resolution.   Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for 2018 are consistent with the statutory limits as modified by the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.   The budget resolution contains two points of order limiting the use  of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS.  Tables 3 and 4 show compliance with fiscal year 2018 limits for overall  CHIMPS $17 billion, and the crime victims fund CHIMP, $11.2 billion,  respectively. This information is used for determining points of order  under sections 4102 and 4103 of H. Con. Res. 71, respectively. CHIMPS  included in the 2018 omnibus comply with the existing limits.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2018,  which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions  under CBA section 311. CBO's estimates, which now include the full  effects of appropriations for this year, show that current-law levels  of spending for fiscal year 2018 are above the amounts assumed in the  budget resolution by $152.2 billion in budget authority and $105.5  billion in outlays. For fiscal year 2018, Social Security outlay levels  remain consistent with the budget resolution's assumption   Current-law revenues continue to be in excess of the levels assumed  by the budget resolution. On-budget revenue levels currently exceed  assumed levels by $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2018, $39.8 billion over  the fiscal year 2018-2022 period, and $94.2 billion over the fiscal  year 2018-2027 period. For fiscal year 2018, Social Security revenues  are $446 million below levels assumed in the budget resolution.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently  shows deficit reduction of $24 million in fiscal year 2018, but deficit  increases of $10 million over the fiscal year 2017-2022 period and $11  million over the fiscal year 2017-2027 period. For fiscal year 2018,  legislation has been enacted that would reduce outlays by $24 million.  Over the fiscal year 2017-2022 period, legislation has been enacted  that CBO estimates will decrease outlays by $13 million and decrease  revenues by $23 million. Over the fiscal year 2017-2027 period,  legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will decrease outlays  by $11 million and decrease revenues by $22 million. Consistent with  recent congressional practice, the direct spending and revenue  provisions included in the non-Appropriations Committee portion of the  fiscal year 2018 omnibus, which increased deficits by $2.8 billion over  10 years are being excluded from PAYGO calculations. This is due to  provisions in the omnibus that mandated the exclusion of those  budgetary effects both from the Senate and statutory PAYGO scorecards.  The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71.   Also included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's  budget enforcement activity on the floor since Congress adopted the  budget resolution. Two points of order were raised since my last  filing. On March 14, 2018, Senator Sanders raised a PAYGO point of  order against S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act. This point of order was waived by a vote of 67  to 31. On March 21, 2018, Leader McConnell raised a PAYGO point of  order against Senator Wyden's amendment, S. Amdt. 2213, to H.R. 1865,  the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of  2017. This point of order was sustained with a vote of 21 to 78 on  Senator Wyden's waiver motion.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2018    2018-2022  2018-2027 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority....................        47        629      1,163     Outlays.............................        47        711      1,249 Armed Services     Budget Authority....................       -33       -102        -76     Outlays.............................       -24        -15        -16 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority....................         0         10        100     Outlays.............................         0         50        100 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority....................       220        -78        -70     Outlays.............................       198        -82        -83 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Finance     Budget Authority....................    21,971     69,492     75,504     Outlays.............................     5,211     14,037      6,435 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Judiciary     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority....................       705        -46        -46     Outlays.............................       205        318        -39 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Intelligence     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority....................     2,100      2,100      2,100     Outlays.............................     1,050      2,100      2,100 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority................    25,010     72,005     78,675         Outlays.........................     6,687     17,119      9,746 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                            APPROPRIATIONS \1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2018                                        ---------------------------------                                           Security \2\   Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          629,000          579,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0           23,259  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2018 budget and is       current through April 9, 2018. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of       H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for       Fiscal Year 2018.        Since our last letter dated February 28, 2018, the Congress       has cleared and the President has signed the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141). That act has       significant effects on budget authority, outlays, and       revenues in fiscal year 2018.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance   Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48); a joint resolution compact relating to the   establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (P.L. 115-   54); the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental   Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-   56); the Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and   Jose Overseas Act (P.L. 115-57); the Department of Veterans Affairs   Expiring Authorities Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-62); the Disaster Fax   Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-63); the   Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 (P.L.   115-64); and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster   Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-72). \b\ Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency   requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Deficit Control   Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes.

Subdivisions 1 and 3 of Division B contain appropriation   legislation: Subdivision 1 provided supplemental appropriations for   fiscal year 2018 for disaster relief and designated those amounts as   being for emergency requirements, and section 158 of Subdivision 3   provided authority for the duration of fiscal year 2018, for the   Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell crude oil from the Strategic   Petroleum Reserve. Division G of P.L. 115-123 provided for the   budgetary treatment of Divisions A-F. \d\ Sections 540-543 of the Department of Homeland Security   Appropriations Act, 2017 (Division F of P.L. 115-31), extended several   immigration programs through the end of fiscal year 2017. Several   continuing resolutions continued those authorities through March 23,   2018, and sections 202-205 of title II of Division M of P.L. 115-141   further extended those programs through 2018. CBO estimates that   extending those authorities for the entirety of fiscal year 2018 will   increase on-budget direct spending by $5 million in fiscal year 2018,   $27 million over the 2018-2022 period, and $53 million over the 2018-   2027 period. In addition, CBO estimates that extending those   authorities will decrease off-budget direct spending by $1 million   over the 2018-2022 period and by $7 million over the 2022-2027 period.   Further, CBO estimates that continuing those authorities will increase   revenues by $2 million over the 2018-2022 period and by $7 million   over the 2018-2027 period. Consistent with the budgetary treatment of   Divisions K-V of P.L. 115-141, the budgetary effects of extending the   immigration programs through March 23, 2018, are charged to the   Appropriations Committee; the effects of extending the programs for   the remainder of fiscal year 2018 are charged to the relevant   authorizing committees. \e\ Pursuant to sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L.   114-255), certain funding provided to the Department of Health and   Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)--in 2017 through 2026   shall not count for the purposes of complying with provisions of the   Deficit Control Act or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment   Control Act of 1974. As a result, the amounts shown do not include   $1,056 million in budget authority or $770 million in associated   outlays in fiscal year 2018 within the following subcommittees'   jurisdictions: $60 million in budget authority and $22 million in   outlays for the FDA (Agriculture); and $996 million in budget   authority and $748 million to outlays for HHS, which includes $500   million in budget authority for state responses to the opioid abuse   crisis and $496 million for NIH (Labor, HHS, Education). \f\ Section 255 of the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services,   and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (Division   H of P.L. 115-141), delayed implementation of the recommendations of   the United States Preventive Services Task Force with respect to   breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention. CBO estimates   that the delay will increase direct spending (budget authority and   outlays) by $14 million in fiscal year 2019 and by $6 million in   fiscal year 2020. In addition, CBO estimates that section 225 will   decrease revenues by $23 million in fiscal year 2019 (of which $6   million will be off-budget) and will decrease revenues by $9 million   in fiscal year 2020 (of which $2 million will be off-budget). \g\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget   Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not   include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.   As a result, current level does not include these items. \h\ Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the   budgetary levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to various provisions of   the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown   below excludes $47,660 million in budget authority, $22,467 million in   outlays, and $150,003 million in revenues assumed in H. Con. Res. 71   for discretionary spending not constrained by the budgetary caps   established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and   subsequently amended, including spending that qualifies for   adjustments pursuant to section 4205 of H. Con. Res. 71.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Budget                                     Authority     Outlays      Revenues ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Initial Senate Resolution........    3,089,061    3,109,221    2,640,939     Revisions:         Pursuant to section 311         -8,600       -8,600     -143,800          of the Congressional          Budget Act of 1974 and          section 3003 of H.
