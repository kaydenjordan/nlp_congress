 Mr. Speaker, I wanted to do something this evening in  light of the angst which is election time. You hear somewhat sort of  the hyperbolic language. I am actually hearing many of our friends on  the left almost sound like it was 5 years ago, talking about  preexisting conditions, ObamaCare. We have all come to a consensus, I  believe, as a political body and as a Nation, we are covering  preexisting conditions.   So one of the things I want to share and I am going to tie this in to  what we are going through in the pandemic and an opportunity to go  beyond what is the debate of the Republican alternative from a couple  years ago on healthcare or the ACA and how I believe we have changed  it.   Remember, the ACA was a financing mechanism. It functionally said who  got subsidized, who had to pay. Our Republican alternative,  functionally, was a financing mechanism. It was who had to pay and who  got subsidized.   What I am begging us all around here to think about is what we pay.  Why isn't this body coming together and moving creative, technology- driven ideas to change the price of healthcare? Because when we are  doing the financing mechanisms, we are not saving our country.   Remember, the single greatest driver of U.S. debt over the next 30  years--and it is really difficult politically to talk about--is  Medicare.   Well, if you are like I am, where you believe we have a moral  obligation to  [[Page H4418]]  protect Medicare and Social Security, we have a moral, ethical  obligation, we also need to be honest about the debt. And I have spent  the previous couple of years coming here and showing the charts of what  was going on. And it was like silence from my brothers and sisters here  because it is so uncomfortable to talk about.   So what I am coming to the floor tonight to do is, I just want to  start the inkling of there are solutions. They are not perfect. They  are going to have glitches, but they start to head us in a direction  where we can change the price of healthcare and by doing that, you save  Medicare. But you also save the country from the crushing debt that is  coming. So this is a moment of optimism.   I am going to grab this board, and this is just part of the thought  experiment I want to engage with. This one we picked up today. This is  brand new.   We understand the next generation of Apple Watch is coming with an  oxygen sensor.   Why is that part of the disruption that helps save the country? I  need you to think creatively with me.   It turns out that there is a study going on that basically looks at  the concept of if we can know your oxygen, your blood oxygen  calculations, we can see your heart rhythm, and those things. But also,  your body temperature, we can calculate if you have a virus, if you are  getting sick.   Now, obviously, the statisticians--the experts--need to build the  model and prove it, but what would happen if the thing you have on your  wrist is functionally a traveling medical lab with you, monitoring your  health all the time, producing the data, using the algorithm and  telling you, Hey, guess what? We believe you have this because we are  monitoring these things.   Is that hopeful?   Is that futuristic?   Is it here?   Because this watch, I guess, is out in the next few months.   But it turns out that type of data coming off the technology we are  able to have on our bodies, this body has not stepped up and gotten  laws, the rules, the regulations, the reimbursements to the point where  technology can help us change the price of healthcare.   So can we stop having just the darn stupid debates around here where  we debate for hours on who is going to get subsidized and who has to  pay? Can we start having honest conversations of what to pay? What can  we as a body do to promote the technology, to promote optionality, to  promote convenience?   So part of my argument here is, we are actually living part of the  disruption right now. A handful of Democrats, and a number of us on the  Republican side, I have had--we have had--some telemedicine bills  around here for years. And no one would hear them. We would do lip  service. We would talk about, well, we are going to allow some  telemedicine, maybe with the VA, but the concept that we were going to  have CMS for Medicare/Medicaid patients--particularly Medicare--allowed  the use of telemedicine. We know we have an army of lobbyists around  here that were very uncomfortable.   If I had one more staffer, lobbyist, even brothers and sisters who  are Members of Congress look at me and say, ``David, we need to do this  slowly. We need to do it incrementally.'' Well, what happened a few  months ago? The pandemic.   And we grabbed some of the language that we have had now for years  and put it into one of the first coronavirus packages. And now  telemedicine is reimbursable to our seniors.   And what's happened?   We have had--and this one goes back to April--it's my understanding  the numbers have gotten dramatically more, but we haven't been able to  vet it--the use of telemedicine with seniors has skyrocketed.  Satisfaction is off the charts. They are happy. The doctors we have  been meeting with and talking to are actually happy and actually will  tell you they are spending more time with their patients, being able to  have a conversation, that patients are willing to share more. We have  the living example of the disruption happening right now. And all those  who kept saying, ``David, let's go slow, let's do it incrementally,''  it didn't happen that way.   We dove in, and it is working. We need to make it better. We need to  make it permanent. Because a lot of folks don't understand, when the  pandemic is declared over, so does this telemedicine. It's over. The  reimbursements, the access, the availability we have given to our  seniors--who we are telling to stay home, to stay healthy--to rural  America, so you don't have to drive, it goes away. We need to make it  permanent.    But I am asking us to now think even broader. Instead of just doing  what I am hoping--we have legislation to do this--to extend  telemedicine, as we have made it available during this time of the  pandemic. Why don't we do that? Let's extend it but let's actually  think broader. What can we do to make healthcare more accessible?   I mean, how many speeches have happened on this floor talking about  accessibility for healthcare, for our poor, for those trapped in  certain urban islands, those trapped in rural America, those trapped at  home.   I want us to get comfortable with the fact that the disruption is  here, the technology is here. There are items like this where it is  functionally a doctor's visit in your medicine cabinet. And it has the  potential for changing the cost of healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, let's go through some of these. We want to protect the  access to telemedicine, so our first piece of legislation is--I am  asking every Member of Congress to think this through. Talk to your  constituents, talk to your medical experts. What has their experience  been like? And are you prepared to take this away from every senior and  American who has had this optionality? Are you ready to take this away  the day the pandemic is declared over?   And then when you have the discussion, the debate with people like me  that actually believe in that technology, we can actually expand the  definition of telemedicine. So it is more than just talking to a doctor  on your phone or doing FaceTime with that medical professional, but it  is also the sensors and the data.   You saw the very first board where we talked about a future watch  that is actually coming in a few months that will be an oxygen sensor,  a pulse rate sensor, a temperature sensor that you will have on your  wrist that can actually do linear conversions because it will have  multiple samples from you. And the algorithm can help tell you if  something is happening to your body.   But also, we need to move pieces of legislation so we can keep this,  keep the reimbursement, keep it legal, keep it with us.   Let's actually take this to what we are experiencing right now.   How many Americans are seniors? We have asked them to stay home. We  have asked them to limit their contacts. We have asked them to be  careful. We have given them telemedicine, but we need to take it to the  next level.   There are now products that are on the market, that are out there  today--we need to start reimbursing them and taking care of them--where  you can actually do your COVID test at home. You can get on that  telemedicine, that phone call, talk to the medical professional, do the  COVID test right there with him on the phone--there are multiple  providers of this--and get your results in a couple of days. This is  instead of asking my father, who is in his mid-eighties, to get in the  car and go wait in line at one of the drive-through testing sites, or  someone else to go wait at a doctor's office or an urgent care office,  or wherever they're doing this; this exists today.   Why aren't we reimbursing them?   Why aren't we making this available today?   If we say we love and care for our most vulnerable populations, why  aren't we thinking of the future?   Why aren't we thinking of the convenience?   Why aren't we thinking of the technology?   We need to do things like this and not be afraid of it.   Yes, it is a disruption for a lot of business models out there that  wants the person coming in to test, to come into their center. But this  is the future. And if we do this right, we can expand access. We can  expand availability, and we can actually change the price curve.  [[Page H4419]]    We can make access to healthcare less expensive. And is this a  Republican goal or Democrat goal? I think it just needs to be an  American goal.   So as we move forward, the impact--and there is a lot of--it is hard  to read this slide, but I guess what I am trying to say here is: As you  look at this, we went from basically only about--oh, excuse me. I had  it wrong.   In 2019, only about 11 percent used any type of telemedicine option.  You called the medical professional, you told them your symptoms, you  got some sort of diagnosis. We have had an explosion since then.   In 2020, now, our numbers, we think, are already old because we wrote  this slide about a month-and-a-half ago on the data we had then. It  went from 11 percent to 46 percent. We are hearing stories that it is  substantially higher than that today.    For those that were arguing for the incremental adoption of the  technology, we hit a pandemic, we got to bathe in the fire, and it  worked. Yeah, there are glitches, but it has worked. Asking people not  to get in their car, not to actually go wait in the waiting room, not  sit--it is here.   How do we expand it?   How do we make it even more accessible?   And how do we broaden the definition of what is telemedicine?   And my argument in many ways here is more than just the simple  adoption of technology. Moving away from the skepticism that, Oh,  seniors aren't going to know how to use it or like to use it. We have  already removed that. We have demonstrated seniors figured it out very  quickly. That sort of cynicism that was out there.   But can we, as a Congress--when we get beyond this election cycle,  where we are busy knifing each other for things that we know are just  rhetorically stale--start giving a damn about the future of this  country, about the availability of healthcare and what we are going to  do to actually do something elegant, where we change the cost curve and  we raise the accessibility? I would think this would make both sides  giddy. We just have to make it legal.   And why I explained that is, a few months ago I was on the floor--and  I have done this multiple times--we were showing some of the technology  that is coming. And one was something that looked like a big kazoo. You  blow into it and it would almost instantly tell you you had the flu.  And the professor who had been working on this, in some of her  writings, she talked about it saying, Then the algorithm could bang off  your medical records, right off your phone, encrypted so it is nice and  safe, and order your antivirals.   Would that make society healthier?   Would it increase accessibility?   Would it lower the price of healthcare?   Of course, it would.                                time  1800    Anyone else know the problem with this technology? It is functionally  illegal today.   The way we reimburse, the way we allow prescriptions to be written,  it is a tough discussion because there are lots of special interest  groups that we need to work with and respect their talents.   But if we know the greatest fragility of future debt in our society  is actually healthcare costs, why wouldn't we embrace something that at  least we haven't completely made partisan yet? That is healthcare  technology and the access and availability it brings to us.   So, my discussion tonight is a very simple one. We have just lived  the experience of COVID, of having so much of our population trapped at  home, fearful to go out. As part of our legislation, we allowed access  and reimbursement to telemedicine. It has been adopted broadly.   Is this one of those moments we are going to take the success we have  had and keep it permanent by not forcing it to expire when the pandemic  is declared over? Are we going to actually be a little bit of futurists  in saying we saw this experiment work for our society--for our country,  for our communities, for our seniors? Could we take the positive part  of this experience and go further?   That going further, what would happen if we do it the right way where  it actually starts to help lower the cost of healthcare and increase  accessibility? It is before us.   So many of us have been heartbroken with what we have gone through  the last few months. We have ached when we have seen people lose their  jobs, hearing of family members who have lost their lives. Are we going  to find some things positive that we have learned over these last few  very difficult months and carry those things forward?   I am going to beg of the body to think this through, that is, the  adoption of technology as part of individual access to healthcare.  Maybe we have to change the name because when we say telemedicine, we  instantly think of looking at my phone and doing FaceTime and not  realizing it also can be the data coming off your watch, the oxygen  patch. Well, now we are about to have an oxygen sensor in the phone.   But how do we make it that telemedicine is the use of technology to  keep us healthy and also to find a financial benefit of lowering the  cost and increasing the accessibility?   This is going to be one of my passions over the next few months and,  if I am blessed to be reelected, over the coming couple of years. We  need to make it permanent. We need to open up the definition.   Things like the home testing, I really am begging the body to think  about that if we do move another COVID bill, that we turn this into  being reimbursable because this is a combination of home COVID tests  that you tie into your telemedicine appointment, and you can get a  result in, I think, one of them, within 48 hours.   This is good stuff. They are out there today. There is a debate about  whether they can be reimbursed. We need to fix this because we all get  behind these microphones, and we wax eloquently of what we think, but  it turns out there are actual solutions around us.   So, that is my pitch. It is not a particularly complicated one. But  with a couple of pieces of legislation that I am blessed to be  sponsoring, and with some of our friends here--and I have some  Democrats who are sponsoring with us, too--I think we are seeing a  vision. We can actually deliver solutions instead of just political  rhetoric.   Mr. Speaker, I think I was supposed to have a friend from Louisiana  coming in. We were going to talk a little bit about the environment of  what was about to just happen in Louisiana. Until he gets here, I did  want to do one story, and let's see if I can tell this without setting  too many people on fire.   I am blessed to be the dad of a little girl that is not even 5 years  old yet. She will be in a couple of weeks. She started kindergarten,  but the starting of her kindergarten was sitting behind a Chromebook  laptop completely isolated, whether it be at home for the first week or  two, and then the second week or two sitting in an empty gym separated  from anyone.   I mean, the picture will rip your heart out. She is sitting behind a  laptop with cardboard walls on the side of her. She would come home and  say: Daddy, please don't make me go. Daddy, I don't like this. Daddy,  please let me go with you.   It was ripping my little girl apart.   Then, this last week, my school district allowed children to be in  the classroom with their teacher. They have taken lots of safety  precautions. I am blessed that, in my area, the statistics have all  fallen within the protocols, the numbers, that it was safe. We only  want schools to open if it is safe.   Overnight, it was as if I have a different little girl. She was  happy. She was joyful. ``Daddy, I have friends.'' The second day, I am  a little disturbed. ``Daddy, I have a boyfriend.'' As the father of a  soon-to-be 5-year-old, that was stressing.   I am wondering how many other Americans have seen this with their  kids, their grandkids? How many young people have we done such violence  to not only their education but their emotional well-being, their  ability to get services?   I desperately ask everyone--because I know in so many school  districts and the country, and even in my community, the issue of  opening schools has become political. It is not science. It is  political.   We see some of the protests from our teachers unions in some spots.  Now, we have protests from our parents.  [[Page H4420]]    We all said we were going to try to address this using math, using  science. But beyond that math and science--that is your benchmark-- please, we need part of the consideration to be the emotional well- being of our kids. It also needs to be the well-being of their  scholastics.   Another project we are doing in the Joint Economic Committee--and I  am going to geek out for a second-- we are starting to do some math  that says we may be damaging millions of Americans in their future  earning power. We are setting them back. We may be damaging millions of  Americans in their retirement.    Because if you come to the tables, these actuarial tables that we  have, and say: What happens if I lost earning power or I lost growth in  my Social Security, in my pension, and even my career path for several  months, for a year? Have we taken a step backward and understood what  other things are happening in our communities?   It turns out one of the linchpins for the next part of the spiking of  employment coming back, people getting back into society and our  communities, is a barrier called daycare and schools. How many parents  are doing their darndest to work from home, but the difficulty is doing  it when your child is in the next room sitting behind a laptop  completely depressed, trying to do teleschool.   We really need to have a tough conversation and be honest with the  numbers and strip the crazy partisan debate over: Is opening schools  partisan?   It is insanity. We have loved and cared for our kids. Let's love on  them. Let's do the right thing.   I am sorry to personalize the story, but I saw it through the lens of  a 5-year-old. I can only imagine what so many others have gone through  with their children.   I mean, I am hearing stories of adolescents--we had another one in my  community just last week--who have taken their lives. Now, I don't know  if that is tied to not being able to socialize or not being able to get  counseling services or just the human relations of being at school. I  don't know. But you do have to take a step backward and think about it.   Are we willing to engage in this type of cruelty to our children, to  those who are trying to build their careers so they can have a healthy  retirement, take care of their family for future investments, for just  the ability to be part of the American Dream? Because we have some  well-organized groups out there that see a political advantage. That is  the definition of cruelty.   Let's take a step backward, go back to our earlier promises that we  were going to do this through science. It is as much as the COVID  statistics in your community and your school district as the human  element of let's take care of our kids, let's actually also take care  of those parents. Let's do the right thing here.   I am so disappointed in so many of my brothers and sisters who are in  the world of politics who are just blinded with a level of rage, that  the need to win the election--well, I have sort of said it.   Let's move away from this sort of cruelty and move back to solutions.  Whether it be my hope that we found a way to make healthcare more  accessible and more affordable to what we are going to do for our  families to allow them to safely go back to school.   My friend from Louisiana is here. I want to share my time with him,  but I also want to understand what is about to happen with the  hurricane.   Didn't you get blasted just a couple of weeks ago with very, very  heavy rains?    Look, I have a soft spot. My mother was from Baton  Rouge. It is one of the reasons I love the food. And every time I hear  your accent, I think of my extended family.   But I wanted to give you some time. Tell us what is happening in your  community, and let us know, beyond thoughts and prayers, what is  needed.   I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
