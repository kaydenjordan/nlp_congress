 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I join in condemning racial discrimination of all  kinds. It should never be tolerated. I wish we had the perfect society  and everybody recognized everybody in a colorblind way, but what this  bill does today is it doesn't address that.   When I heard the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just refer to  calling the virus that originated in China the Wuhan prefecture, when I  heard him say that this is somehow equivalent to the Chinese  Immigration Exclusion Act or somehow equivalent to the Japanese  internment camp experience that we had where over 100,000 Japanese were  removed from their homes and taken to camps, I said: This really is the  woke culture on steroids. This has gone beyond.   If this would have been a condemnation of anti-Asian discrimination,  I probably would have been right there signing this. I lived in  northeast Asia for 2 years. I speak Japanese. I have traveled  extensively in Asia. This doesn't address that. What it does is says:  You know what, we want to do something when we are about 6 weeks out  from an election. That is what this resolution is about. You can't tell  the truth here.   Let's just recite some of the things we know:   The West Nile virus, that is because that virus emerged from the West  Nile district of Uganda, 1930.   The Saint Louis encephalitis virus broke out around St. Louis in  1933.   The Japanese encephalitis virus broke out in Japan in 1870.                                time  0945    Coxsackie, New York State; Marburg, Germany; Hendra, Australia, all  have viruses named after them.   You will always have the ignorant who act out on racial animus. We  condemn that. But let's tell the truth. The Middle East Respiratory  Syndrome virus in 2012. We call that ``MERS.''   This week we learned from Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan that not  only did this virus originate in China, but it may have been  manufactured and released intentionally by the Chinese Communist Party.   So when the media refers to this as the ``Wuhan virus'' or the  ``China virus,'' and other officials, including folks from this party  over here, it is not because they have an existing racist sentiment,  but it is rather to describe its origination as has been done  historically.   This resolution today is even more than a measure to appease the woke  and tolerant and politically correct leftists. It is an attack on  President Trump and all who support President Trump.   It is a crying shame that you can't take the actual issue that you  want to address and address it. You have to expand it that way for  political purposes. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
