 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1808 to amend and improve the  Missing Children's Assistance Act.   Mr. Speaker, again, it is an honor to stand with my friend, Mr.  Guthrie, in bipartisan support of this legislation which, again, makes  some important changes to the existing law for the Center for Missing &  Exploited Children, as my friend said, a program which was created in  1984. Sadly, it has not finished its mission.   Again, the FBI reports every year there are about 460,000 reports of  missing children, and despite the best efforts of programs which NCMEC  has operated over the many years, which include hotlines and public  information campaigns, again, this is still a scourge which afflicts  many families all across the country in Republican, Democratic, rural,  suburban, and urban areas.   Again, this bill will basically update and modernize the language of  the act  [[Page H4455]]  to recognize that there are new forms of threats and risks to minor  children, such as human trafficking and online predators.                                time  1415    So it does three essential things:   Number one, it incorporates new terminology to align the law with  these new threats, which I mentioned above, and strengthens protections  for children at risk.   Number two, it clarifies that NCMEC is a nonprofit entity, which is  an issue that has been ensnared in the courts. And, again, Congress'  passage and enactment of this bill will clarify this critical issue.   And, lastly, it clarifies that NCMEC is a resource that provides  technical assistance not just to law enforcement, but to families,  community groups, schools, and the public at large.   Mr. Speaker, this last aspect of the bill is critically important.  Last year, Congress passed Public Law 114-184, which President Obama  signed into law, the Recovering Missing Children's Act. It was a  measure which I cosponsored with Mr. Paulsen from Minnesota.   This bill actually gave State and local police another tool in terms  of recovering missing children. Incredibly, the Tax Code prevented  State and local law enforcement from getting access to tax returns from  adults who actually had abducted children.   So, incredibly, those adults were claiming these children, who were  in their illegal custody, as a tax credit and a tax exemption, but  State and local officials were barred by privacy provisions in the IRS  code from actually accessing that information. So, on the one hand, you  had one arm of government out looking for children and you had another  arm of government who knew exactly where they were based on the tax  returns which were filed.   Again, NCMEC is in the process of trying to disseminate this new  tool, which an audit of the IRS demonstrated that there are roughly  2,000 tax returns a year where adult individuals are actually claiming  children as a tax deduction, obviously, with their residence and  identity included.   So, again, that is just another example of why we need to update and  modernize the law.   I would just indicate on a personal level, my wife, Audrey, is a  pediatric nurse practitioner. She works at the Children's Medical  Center in Hartford, Connecticut. She is involved in a specialty clinic  that helps children of sex abuse and human trafficking. She said that  NCMEC is a frequent flier in their office. In the really important work  that she and her colleagues do, they constantly use NCMEC as a way of  trying to assist law enforcement in terms of helping children who are  in these situations of human trafficking and who have been victims of  online use of images, which is about as low a depraved activity that is  out there right now. So, again, the work of this center, I can attest  to from a personal level, is extremely important.   This legislation will update, modernize, and give tools to make sure  that all of the good guys out there--the local State police and the  folks in the healthcare sector--can really do everything they can to  help families in this really terrible, horrific situation.   So, again, I applaud my colleague from Kentucky for his great work,  as well as Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott for bringing this  legislation forward. It passed unanimously in committee.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues in the House to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), a city which has been really  challenged with this issue. I know she has been doing great work and  has very powerful thoughts and arguments to make today regarding this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee, and a strong proponent of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams), an outstanding member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In summary, we have heard again a very broad-based bipartisan chorus  of voices in support of this legislation. Again, like in committee,  hopefully, all of us will stand together to support this really  important update to making sure that families get all the help, and law  enforcement get all the help, that they need to eliminate the scourge  of this problem.   I yield back the balance of my time.
