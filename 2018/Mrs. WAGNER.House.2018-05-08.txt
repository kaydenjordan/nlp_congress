 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of a bill that, frankly,  is long overdue. While former CFPB Director Richard Cordray indicated  in testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services that the  Bureau's guidance was ``nonbinding,'' the damage was already done.   The Bureau's attempt to regulate an industry that the Dodd-Frank Act  specifically told them they could not regulate is the very reason our  committee has worked tirelessly to bring accountability to an agency  that has none. Sadly, this guidance has become symbolic for everything  that is wrong with the CFPB.   So why are we here today? Why does this Congress care about guidance  put out in 2013?   Let me read section 1029 from the Dodd-Frank Act: ``the Bureau may  not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement or any other  authority, including any authority to order assessments, over a motor  vehicle dealer that is predominantly engaged in the sale and servicing  of motor vehicles. . . . ''   Unfortunately, we have seen, time and time again, an agency that is  willing to issue regulation by enforcement. Since the 2013 guidance  came out, the Bureau has issued over $200 million in out-of-court  settlements to auto lenders based on guidance that was flawed from the  very start.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, our  staff has issued multiple reports detailing the Bureau's baseless  enforcement agenda. Because of their work, the CFPB can no longer hide  behind, as one report noted, junk science.   I thank the chairman, and I urge all my colleagues to support this  bipartisan effort.
