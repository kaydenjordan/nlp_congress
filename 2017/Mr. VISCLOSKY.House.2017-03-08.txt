 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman  Frelinghuysen on bringing his first full bill to the House floor as  chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have greatly appreciated  his friendship and steady leadership of the Defense Subcommittee.   Further, I also thank our new subcommittee chairwoman, Kay Granger.  She has been a great partner in completing the work on the fiscal year  2017 conference report, and I look forward to working with her as we  proceed.   Finally, I thank the members of the subcommittee and our  extraordinary staff for their wisdom and for their long hours that they  have logged in putting this product together.   The chairman has well described H.R. 1301. I would add that this bill  includes strong positions countering Russian aggression, building  partnership capacity, and supporting readiness. Because it is a product  of bipartisan negotiation, this is a good bill, and I intend to support  it.   Despite my support for this legislation, I am extremely troubled that  we are still working on the fiscal year 2017 Defense bill 5 months and  8 days into the fiscal year.   For nearly 6 months, the Department of Defense has been operating  under two separate continuing resolutions, which wastes the time of  people's lives and leads to inefficiencies in spending. I would  emphasize this is not the fault of the committee. All that has been  absent is the lack of political will on behalf of the majority party.   Even more disconcerting is the fact that the Defense Appropriations  Act is just one of 11 fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills that need  to be completed by the end of next month. There is no excuse for them  remaining unfinished. The investments made through these bills are  vital to so many in our country, and they need equal attention from  Congress and the administration.   It is imperative that we strive every day to prioritize keeping  America safe and supporting our brave servicemembers, but we must also  prioritize educating our workforce, making improvements in public  health, in science, and in our economic and transportation  infrastructure.   If we neglect these investments in our future and in the well-being  and success of current families and future generations, then I am  deeply concerned that we will not have a country worth defending.   Confounding a confused fiscal situation, there is a $30 billion  supplemental request for fiscal year 2017 recently submitted to the  Office of Management and Budget by the Department of Defense, which  should make its way to Congress in the next few weeks. Additionally, as  the administration modifies its fiscal year 2018 budget request, they  are without a predictable base on which to build.   There is very little margin of error, given the few legislative days  remaining before the continuing resolution expires on April 28. I, and  I believe the chairman, do not view that date as another point for  negotiation. It is an absolute deadline, and the value of this bill and  every other appropriations bill diminishes the day they are not  enacted.                                time  1545    In closing, I again appreciate the leadership and the management of  this wonderful work by our chairman, Mr. Frelinghuysen. Going forward,  I will work hard with the chairman. I will work hard with Chairwoman  Granger, with Ranking Member Lowey, and the other members of our full  committee to return the appropriations process to its normal schedule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is a member of the Subcommittee on  Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply follow up on the  chairman's remarks, and I also want to congratulate Mr. Smith on his  life of service to his country. Mr. Pomerantz on our side was also  mentioned. Again, both gentlemen and their service to this country are  a reflection on public service, and I appreciate it very much on behalf  of all of us in this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Ruppersberger), who is also a member of the Defense Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a member of the full Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will end where I began, and that is because I think this will be  the last time that the chair and I manage a Defense Appropriations bill  together on the floor. It has been a delightful relationship, and I  look forward to it continuing as you are chairman of the full  committee.   Again, I thank the staff and look forward to working with Chairwoman  Granger, and I also ask my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
