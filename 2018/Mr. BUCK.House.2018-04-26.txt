 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Stan Cass,  United States Army, retired. Colonel Cass passed away on April 14, at  the age of 84.   Born in Weld County, Colorado, to a family of farmers, Colonel Cass  graduated from Briggsdale High School and attended West Point.   After brief stints in Germany and France, Stan began his first tour  of duty in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot, dangerously traversing the  skies to support infantry troops. He briefly came back to the States to  complete a master's degree before returning to Vietnam to command 300  helicopters in an air cavalry fleet.   After his valiant efforts in Vietnam, Colonel Cass worked in the  Pentagon on the Hellfire missile system, and then returned to Weld  County to take over the family farm.   But he wasn't finished serving. In 2008, he launched the northern  Colorado chapter of Honor Flight, a nationwide nonprofit that  transports America's veterans for visits to our war memorials in  Washington, D.C.   Stan helped transport over 2,500 veterans to Washington over the past  decade, giving our heroes a chance to reflect on and find closure in  their wartime experiences.   Like so many other families in northern Colorado, Colonel Cass very  personally impacted my family. My wife, Perry, has volunteered for the  organization, and my father-in-law, Bill, has gone on one of those  flights as a veteran. They both have been alongside Colonel Cass and  meeting some of the amazing veterans living in our community. Their  humility, endurance, and wisdom have taught us so much.   Colonel Cass dedicated his life to this country and the men and women  who serve it. I offer my condolences to his wife, Cecily, the rest of  his family, and everyone in our community who had the chance to know  this humble, incredible human being. I know there are many.                          Recognizing Randy Bangert     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Randy Bangert,  editor of the Greeley Tribune newspaper.   On April 14, the Colorado Press Association inducted Mr. Bangert into  the Hall of Fame, honoring his incredible 45-year career with the paper  of note in Weld County. Just 3 years ago, he earned the Newspaper  Person of the Year Award from the same association.   The Greeley Tribune is a reflection of Randy, conducting itself with  class and dignity. His goal is to equip the public with knowledge so  that citizens can make things right in their community.                                time  1100    Randy never shies away from telling the truth. If he disagrees with  one of my positions, he lets me know it, and he lets everyone else know  it, too, in his editorial that day. But Randy's critiques are always  fair and respectful. He wants to build consensus to make our community,  State, and country a better place. We need more people who believe in  civility in our public discourse like Randy.   Randy also cares deeply about his community. I know this, because I  see him everywhere around town. This is what makes him such a good  newspaper editor. He knows who he works for, the people, and he listens  to them.   But last year Randy received some bad news. He faces the toughest  battle so far in his life--cancer. The thing about Randy is we know how  he is fighting it. It is the same way he ran  [[Page H3585]]  the newspaper. He is feisty, passionate, caring, and optimistic.   I pray for Randy and his family in this challenging time, and I pray  for our community, as others step up in the big shoes they must now  fill as Randy transitions to the editor emeritus role.   Randy's induction into the Colorado Hall of Fame is important. I  congratulate him on this incredible honor, but what seems more  important is the impact he has had on our community. I thank him today  for the way he has shaped Greeley and Weld County. That impact will  never be forgotten.                            ____________________
