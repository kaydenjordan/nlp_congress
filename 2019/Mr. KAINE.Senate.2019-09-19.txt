 Mr. President. As our Nation ages, we face a growing need  for direct care professionals to care for older adults and people with  disabilities. The U.S. Census Bureau projects the number of people aged  65 and older to more than double between 2015 and 2060, from nearly 48  million to 98 million. Approximately 61 million Americans are currently  living with a disability. By 2024, 5 .2 million direct care workers  will be needed across all care settings.   Direct care workers, such as home health aides and nursing  assistants, are the backbone of the long-term care workforce, providing  daily assistance to millions of older Americans, people with  disabilities, and others with chronic care needs. Direct care workers  help ensure that older Americans and people with disabilities receive  the critical care they need while remaining active members of their  communities. However, direct care workers are often paid low wages and  may face poor working conditions and economic insecurity. The majority  of direct care workers are women and people of color. Some direct care  workers do not have education beyond high school and lack access to a  career pathway or advanced training. Twenty-four percent of home care  workers live below the Federal poverty level and 52 percent of direct  care workers rely on some form of public assistance to support  themselves and their families.   Today, I am pleased to introduce the Direct Creation, Advancement,  and Retention of Employment Opportunity Act, or Direct CARE Opportunity  Act, with Senator Hassan. I am proud to have partnered with my friend  and colleague in the Virginia delegation Chairman Bobby Scott on this  bill, who has also introduced the bill today in the House of  Representatives. The Direct CARE Opportunity Act provides support for  strategies to recruit, retain, and advance the direct care workforce  pipeline. Our legislation would support the implementation of models  and strategies to train more people in the direct care field, while  allowing for local and regional innovation to address workforce  shortages. We encourage retention and career advancement in a high- demand field where workers carry a large emotional burden and face  barriers to economic mobility. Our legislation responds to the needs of  our growing aging population, allowing older Americans, people with  disabilities, and those with chronic illnesses to remain in their  communities while receiving critical care and support, helping prevent  costlier institutional care.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see the Direct  CARE Opportunity Act as a chance to invest in the professionals who  care for millions of vulnerable Americans every day, ensuring they live  with dignity and independence.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Booker, and Ms.          Hirono):   S. 2523. A bill to amend section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act  of 1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty members to qualify for public  service loan forgiveness; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions.
