 Mr. Speaker, New Jersey has one of the ten lowest firearm  death rates in the country. That is because the people of my State have  set the bar high for public safety.   The bill my Republican colleagues just passed would undermine the  will of the people and make New Jersey less safe.   Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey, gun owners who want to carry a concealed  weapon in public must meet stringent public safety requirements and  have a really good reason to carry a concealed weapon loaded while in  public.   The people of my State can feel secure because they know that the  people licensed to carry these guns in public are carrying their guns  safely and responsibly.   Mr. Speaker, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is the peak of  Federal overreach. It is a special interest bill from the NRA that will  overturn laws and undermine the safety of the State of New Jersey.  Today's vote was bad for New Jersey and bad for our Nation.                            ____________________
