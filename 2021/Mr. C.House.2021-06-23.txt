 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, because of its great  weather, beautiful beaches, and low taxes, a friend who once served as  my Congressman liked to say that, for many around the country, Florida  is the reward for a life well lived.   As liberal States continue to run their governments into the ground  and the pandemic has accelerated our ability to work remotely, it is no  longer just retirees who are moving to the Sunshine State in droves. In  fact, nearly 330,000 have relocated there in the past year alone.   With its strategic location along central Florida's I-4 corridor,  Florida's 15th Congressional District is one of the fastest growing  areas in the country. Our current transportation infrastructure is  already inadequate. It is a problem that will only accelerate going  forward unless we act now. I am sure many communities across the  country can relate.   Both sides of the aisle can agree that our Nation's highways,  airports, water infrastructure, ports, and broadband networks are the  arteries of our national commerce and worthy investments of taxpayer  money.   The good news is Republicans are taking the lead to meet these  infrastructure needs. First, we are proposing a major overhaul of our  Federal  [[Page H3077]]  project review and permitting processes. When I formerly served on the  board of the Transportation Planning Organization in my home district,  we routinely had critical needs that waited years for funding. Some of  those have still not been funded. So speeding up that process is a  critical first step.    We are also proposing a $460 billion framework that will make crucial  investments in our Nation's transportation system, water  infrastructure, and broadband networks. This framework represents an  investment in the real infrastructure Americans need, not bizarre  reinterpretations of infrastructure or partisan pet projects.   Congress has talked about infrastructure investment for years. It is  time to put words into action. I hope the President will continue to  listen to voices on both sides of the aisle to enact a bipartisan  solution that our country so desperately needs.    Scott Franklin of Florida.
