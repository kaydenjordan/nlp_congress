 Madam Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record a  statement of a constituent of mine, Staff Sergeant Ashley Carothers,  who is a veteran of the United States Air Force. Staff Sergeant  Carothers served from 2005 to 2013, and thus was subject to the ``Don't  Ask, Don't Tell'' policy for most of her service. I share her story as  we commemorate 10 years since the repeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''  Staff Sergeant Carothers was honorably discharged in 2013 and lives in  the District of Columbia.   This is what she has said about her experience:         During my Air Force career, I lived a double life. I was an       actress portraying a straight Airman on a stage called life       and behind closed doors a very broken human being that       desperately just wanted to be herself. I was a lesbian in       hiding. I was the Airman that did it all, scored as high as       they could on tests, worked to know the job better than the       rest and volunteer for everything that I could in hopes that       my busy life would never uncover the truth. Behind the       curtain I dated but relationships couldn't really completely       build because there was always a sense of getting caught       especially in a mil to mil relationship. Supervisors       constantly questioning you and trying to set you up with the       new guy in the shop and always prying into why you constantly       denied any male advances. The worst part was the feeling of       always being alone while fending off the wolves (male airmen)       and dodging sexual harassment and assault as a woman just       trying to serve her country. I guess it made me stronger in a       weird messed up way as I was able to provide support to       others later in my career, support I never had.        While serving in Germany I had the privilege to be one of       the chapter leaders for the then-underground organization       known as OutServe. Prior to the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't       Tell we had a large number of LGBT service members all over       the European theater that relied on each other for support       and a sense of community. During this timeframe, multiple       individuals struggled further with their military leadership       as those opposed to the repeal expressed their views       verbally, leaving many with anxiety about the future. There       were many late-night phone calls trying to be the voice of       reason in moments of doubt and desperation when options to       turn to mental health professionals were nonexistent for fear       of discharge. Not being able to fight for them and speak       freely and openly to commands for support damaged individuals       beyond repair. If anyone went to speak to a mental health       professional and disclosed the fact that they identified as       gay, lesbian or bisexual, they would be on the chopping block       as they were serving under Don't Ask, Don't Tell. On top of       that, many served in career fields that they had to report       any visit to a mental health professional, further limiting       these individuals who desperately needed assistance. These       individuals had no one to turn to and suffered in silence.       Most even after the repeal couldn't come out as lesbian, gay       or bisexual for fear of mistreatment from their superiors.       Some suffered greatly by coming out to their commands, as       they had to work twice as hard to prove themselves and were       often overlooked for promotion and awards.        Balancing my own life struggles and the struggles of those       that looked to me for support was a pretty demanding time in       my career. My career and health did suffer, but I often think       about what life would have been like if I hadn't been able to       give so much or if the military would have just let humans be       humans by being their true authentic selves in the first       place. The constant jokes, ridicule and mistreatment from       superiors hasn't gone away. On this anniversary, I hope that       those in charge will finally take the right steps and change       the culture.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to share Staff Sergeant  Carothers' story and to remember the thousands like her who were harmed  by Don't Ask, Don't Tell.                            ____________________
