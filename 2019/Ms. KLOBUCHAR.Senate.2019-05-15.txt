 Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  calling for necessary and long-overdue changes in how our country  addresses the cost and affordability of prescription drugs.   You are going to hear today from, in addition to myself, Senator  Blumenthal, Senator Smith, and Senator Kaine, as well as Senator  Durbin, who spoke on these issues earlier, to highlight this egregious  public health issue facing our country.   It is unacceptable that lifesaving treatments and cures are  increasingly out of reach for the people who need them the most. That  is why the Senate must act now to pass legislation that would lower the  cost of prescription drugs. Healthcare represents one-sixth of our  economy, and out-of-pocket costs account for over 10 percent of our  Nation's healthcare spending, from consumers to hospitals and nursing  homes.   One report found that between 2012 and 2016, the price of branded  prescription drugs increased 110 percent. That is not 11 percent; that  is 110 percent. Even drugs that have been available for decades, like  insulin, are no longer affordable. It is outrageous, it is dangerous,  and it has real consequences for real people.   For most Americans, this is deeply personal. I know it is for me. I  will never forget the frightening day when we learned my daughter had a  nut allergy. She was a toddler, and we were actually in a cabin. We  were out in the middle of nowhere, and she ate a cashew for the first  time. Her throat started to close up, although we didn't really know  that was what was happening.   I still remember us driving as fast as we could through the woods for  about 45 minutes to the closest emergency room, where finally they were  able to help her. That was when we discovered that she had a nut  allergy.   She now keeps an EpiPen with her at all times. So when the price of  an EpiPen increased by three times the original amount, I knew just how  dangerous that cost increase would be to the people who rely on the  medication, and I spoke out.   It wasn't just me. It was moms and dads across the country who spoke  out. They spoke out by writing letters. They spoke out on email. They  spoke out on their Facebook pages. They spoke out on social media. It  was literally a nationwide effort to take this on. We successfully  worked to bring that cost down, but companies shouldn't just respond  when there is outrage over social media.   By the way, not every drug has a constituency like that of parents  who have  [[Page S2868]]  kids that have nut allergies. There are a lot of rare drugs for which  maybe only hundreds of families understand what a price increase means.  There are drugs that have constituencies who are disabled or people who  aren't going to be able to basically mob the halls of Congress to make  a change.   Besides that, I don't think that is how we want to make change,  anyway. Wouldn't it be better if we responded in a policy way, in a  bipartisan way, and simply made some changes to the policies of our  government and of our country to bring down the price of prescription  drugs--not just the drugs that are most famous but for all drugs.   There are many examples of why prescription drug pricing is now out  of control and why we have to take action. For instance, a Wall Street  Journal article reported that the price for a multiple sclerosis drug  went up 21 times in a decade--21 times. No one could explain that  except that it allows the company that makes that drug to profit big  time.   A Stat News story reported that the price for a leukemia drug was  raised four times over the course of a single year, and it now costs  nearly $199,000 a year.   We know that the price of certain insulin products rose 700 percent,  accounting for inflation, in two decades. When the State of the Union  happened this year, I invited a guest, and that guest was a woman named  Nicole Smith Holt, and it was her son, a young man named Alec, who was  a 26-year-old restaurant manager. He worked in my State. He worked  hard. He was a good guy, and he was on his parents' health insurance  until he was 26. When that health insurance ended, when he could not  get that health insurance, he then had to pay for the insulin himself  since he was a diabetic. It was $1,200 a month. He was unable to afford  his insulin. So what did he do? Sadly, he did what too many people are  doing in America right now. He started rationing that insulin. He  rationed that insulin, and he died waiting for his next paycheck. He  was a restaurant manager in the suburbs of the Twin Cities.   His mother sat at the State of the Union, looking down at the  President, looking down at the Congress, to make the point that she  needed action, and in the memory of her son Alec, she was going to make  sure that action happens.   Congress has a duty to act, and the President should support these  efforts. Committees in the House of Representatives, for the first  time, have already advanced proposals to reduce the cost of  prescription drugs, and we should be moving similar legislation here in  the Senate.   Yes, it is true that there are two pharma lobbyists for every Member  of Congress. That is a fact, and for years they have felt that they  owned Congress. That has to change. They do not own me, and they do not  own the people who are speaking up today.                            ____________________     While we await for Senator Schumer, I want to mention  just a few examples of what we are talking about here with drug  prices--a woman named Paula. Paula has been prescribed a treatment for  her multiple sclerosis. It costs over $5,000 a month. She has been  getting copay assistance from a grant but does not know how she is  going to afford it and whether she is going to be able to afford her  lifesaving medication.   Julie, another example, is covered under her husband's employer plan.  She currently has to pay a $500 copay for a drug that she needs--the  same drug that was once offered in a generic form for $50, a fraction  of the new cost. The generic drug has been discontinued, creating an  impossible choice between paying $500 or not filling her prescription.  Because of the high cost, she goes without this drug.   Diane--Diane has an EpiPen for bee stings and is unhappy with the  high cost. She says:   [[Page S2869]]              Now that I am retired, it is horrific how I have to buy       them in a pack of two, and they cost more than before. The       prices have just skyrocketed. Every year I throw away       something that is so expensive that I cannot use. It is way       overpriced.    Angie, from Savage, MN, is a mother, a wife, and a teacher. In May of  2018, she was admitted to a hospital, where MRI scans showed brain  lesions. She was eventually discharged from the hospital and was  instructed to follow up with a neurologist. She received a multiple  sclerosis diagnosis. She was prescribed a new medication that is also  one of the most effective drugs available today for treating MS.  Payment for the expensive drug was denied.   These are just examples of the people we see every day.   I yield the floor.    I thank the Senator from Virginia for his thoughtful  remarks and the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, as well as  Senator Smith, my colleague.   The time for action is now. We have all cited numerous examples of  people who, literally, are taking drugs that, in the case of insulin,  was $17 a vial and is now $1,213 a month. That is simply outrageous. We  have people who can't afford drugs that they used to just take as  commonplace, and there were no changes made.   So for me, a lot of this is what happens when you have monopolies,  what happens when you don't have competition. So the answer is to look  at all of the measures we could take to ensure that there is better  price negotiation and more competition. One of them, as Senator Kaine  mentioned, is Medicare negotiation, unleashing the power of 43 million  Americans. That is a lot of people. Seniors are good at getting deals.  That is 43 million people. Yet they are banned from negotiating with  Medicare to get better deals for themselves. That should change.   We need less expensive drugs from other countries--safe drugs. That  would certainly create more competition. We had bipartisan support for  a proposal like that. Senator Grassley and I have the bill that would  take one country, Canada. In Minnesota and in the Presiding Officer's  State of North Dakota we can see Canada from our porch. The point is  that we see those less expensive drugs right across the border. We  should be able to have that competition.   Then, look at the CREATES Act and some of the other ways of stopping  pay-for-delay and stopping, as Senator Blumenthal was describing, these  patent abuses to try to make sure we have more competition. I think  there is starting to be general agreement on this issue that we have to  take on these pharmaceutical prices. The time for describing the  problem is still here because it seems like some of our colleagues  don't get it, but the time for action is certainly now.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
