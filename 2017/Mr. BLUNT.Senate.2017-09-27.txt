 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Tax Reform     Mr. President, we are looking at an outline for tax reform  that helps working families in ways that those families haven't seen  for almost a decade now--a decade of buying power that didn't go up and  obligations that did, with more government requirements and less take- home pay. So we are going to be here for the next few weeks talking  about what we can do to reverse that situation so that the opportunity  for those families is reversed and that eventually we also reverse our  competitiveness so that we create better jobs.   There are two ways to get more take-home pay. One is for the  government to take less out of it--and I am for that--and the other one  is to do things in the Tax Code to make us more competitive so that  there are better jobs with better pay to start with. If we combine  those two things--better jobs and better pay--with the government  taking less out of that higher paycheck, that is really where families  would like to be. We are going to be here talking about this in a way  that drives toward a result.   The Senator from West Virginia is here, and she is basically going to  start that effort today, as we really now have enough specifics on what  the Finance Committee is looking at in the Senate and the Ways and  Means Committee in the House and what the White House is looking at. We  can begin to explain to American working families why this is the right  course for them and for our country.   I am pleased to be joined here by Senator Capito.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.    Mr. President, when the Senator from West Virginia talked  about the 40 percent that can come out of your hard work, the 2 days a  week of a regular 5-day workweek--and many families are wishing they  could get back to a 5-day workweek because they have really been  stagnant in terms of the opportunities for their families for a long  time. It is a good way to think about how hard families work just so  the government can get more of their money.   This is a discussion about how the government can take less of your  money. For everybody listening who wonders, ``Well, if the government  is going to take less money--I thought the government already had a  deficit''--we need to work on that. One way to work on that and the  best way to work on that is to have more taxpayers--not higher tax  rates but more taxpayers. We are looking at some tax changes here that  would allow more taxpayers to share the burden, hopefully paying taxes,  as I said earlier this afternoon, on a bigger paycheck to start with.  You can take less money out of that paycheck, and the government gets  more money because we have more people paying those taxes and more  growth.   The 70-year average on growth since World War II is 3.4 percent.  Every year, the economy was that much bigger than the year before. That  ought to be achievable. For 70 years, we achieved that. We should be  able to get back to that again if we do the right things. But for the  last 8 to 9 years, that growth has been less than 2 percent.   Our problem is with jobs that aren't growing as they should in terms  of what they pay and the government is not having the money it needs to  defend the country and do other things. A lot of that could be solved  by an economy that is thriving again. There has been 10 years of not  seeing that happen.   We combine good tax policy with good regulatory policy, which means  the regulatory excesses of the last few years clearly are being brought  back under control. The Federal Government is beginning to look at  regulation and being sure it is commonsense regulation again. Consumer  confidence is growing. Every single month we look at those numbers, and  they generally have been better each month than the month before. They  certainly have been better the last 7 months than they were in any  previous 7-month period of time for some time now. When we have a good  tax policy and a good competitive policy, then before you know it,  things begin to happen.   On stagnant income, you can see a study here that says, well, maybe  the income hasn't gone up, but because things are a little less  expensive and inflation has been so low and so many of the things  families need are less expensive, they really have more money than they  used to have. Try to explain that to mothers and fathers who are trying  to buy five pairs of tennis shoes for five kids. You as a parent are  trying to do something for your family every week or so that is a  little bit extraordinary. If you don't have extra money, you cannot do  any of that.   Over 75 percent of full-time workers in America say, when asked, that  they are living paycheck to paycheck. Over 20 percent of Americans say  they have zero savings. A much higher number says they have less than  $400 or $500 in savings. These are people whose parents and  grandparents worked hard to save whatever they could and would like to  see that ability happen again.   We need lower taxes. We need better jobs. New jobs are impacted in  Missouri, where 97 percent of all our businesses are small businesses.  Most new job creation is created by small businesses. We ought to be  sure that no matter what we do in the Tax Code, we do it in a way that  allows small business to compete with big business in an effective way.   As for competitiveness, in the last 15 years, I think we are not as  competitive as we used to be. Our corporate taxes used to be right in  the middle. With corporations competing around the world, we were right  in the middle. The middle in 2003 was 30 percent; our tax rate was 35  percent. The middle in 2015 was 22 percent; our tax rate was 35  percent. If you are going to compete, if you are going to create jobs,  you are going to have to be sure you know how to compete.    Mr. President, you and I were able to see--at least I was able to  see--for the first time yesterday, not being on the Finance Committee,  the page that is generally agreed to as our starting point. There were  lower rates for families, in fact, doubling the individual exemption.  Today, if you are a couple, you start paying taxes after the first  $12,000 of income. Under this proposal that exemption doubles to  $12,000 each, so you would start paying taxes only after you have made  the first $24,000. It is sort of a new tax bracket here--the zero tax  bracket. It is the tax bracket in which you don't pay income taxes on  the first $24,000, and then you start paying in a simpler system after  that.   People would like the tax system to be simpler. People would like to  have that postcard filing opportunity, where you say: This is how much  money I made, here is my W-2 form that proves it, here is my standard  exemption, and here is whatever else I am going to be allowed to  exempt--my contributions to church, other charities, my mortgage  payment. Those appear to be exemptions that will be left in the Code,  but everyone would understand those. Suddenly, you have about three  lines, and maybe, by the time you get to those three lines, your tax  obligation goes away.   The amount of money people pay to get their taxes figured out in  America would be the gross national product of lots of countries. We  need a system that is simpler than that.   The death tax--you know, if you are a family farm or a small business  and someone has stayed on that farm with you from your family or stayed  in that business with you from your family, it is very hard to figure  out, when the mom or dad dies, who created what wealth as you work side  by side to create the wealth. By the way, you don't  [[Page S6173]]  have any wealth that you haven't paid taxes on already. You don't have  anything you have accumulated that you haven't paid taxes on multiple  times. There is an opportunity here to say that we are no longer going  to go through that after trying to tax family farms and small  businesses. The death tax is exactly that, and it doesn't work.   We are going to work to make America more competitive, American jobs  more competitive. Again, one way to create more take-home pay--the best  way to create more take-home pay--is better jobs to start with. We can  have those better jobs if we work hard to be focused on competition, on  regulation that makes sense, on tax policy that not only is simple but  that everybody believes is fair. We have the greatest compliance of any  country, I believe, in the history of the world, but people are less  likely to comply if they don't think that the tax policy is fair and  easily understood and means the same to everyone else. You shouldn't  have to have the greatest accountants in the world to figure out what  your taxes are or, frankly, to figure out what somebody else's taxes  likely are. Fairness is important here, simplicity is important here,  and competition and better jobs are important here.   (The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the Chair.)   We need better jobs for working families. I think that should be the  flag that flies highest as we begin to look at how we reduce the tax  burden and increase the opportunity for more people to be paying taxes  because we have more people with better jobs.   I know two of the leaders here. That guy who just left the Chair, the  Senator from North Carolina, and the Senator from Georgia have been  real advocates for what we are trying to do now and also advocates for  getting it done. We not only need to have this debate; we need to get  this done.   In my view, this needs to be done this year. It needs to be impacting  our economy by the first quarter of next year. I would suggest that  nobody in this body understands the importance of competition more than  the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.
