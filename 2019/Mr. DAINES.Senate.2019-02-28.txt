 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Patrick Armstrong, Jr., of Heart Butte, for his dedication  to Glacier County.   A member of the Blackfeet Nation, Mr. Armstrong was born and raised  in Browning, MT, where he attended Browning Public School Systems, K- 12. He has been an educator at Browning Elementary for 5 years, where  he currently teaches fourth grade. Patrick and his wife, Anna, have  three children.   Mr. Armstrong has always been actively involved in sports and has  been officiating for 20 years. Since then, Patrick has been heavily  involved in officiating high school basketball. He was recently  nominated as this year's boys basketball official of the year by the  National Federation of High School Association, Montana High School  Association, and the Montana Officials Association. To be nominated for  this award, you must exemplify upstanding character. Mr Armstrong is a  prominent mentor in his community. He is a humble man who knows the  value of a strong community.   I congratulate Patrick on his role in bringing together and growing  the Browning community.                            ____________________
