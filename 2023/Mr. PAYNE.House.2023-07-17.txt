 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how Democrats are  putting people over politics and working to support all Americans. We  are lowering the everyday cost of living for working families. We have  brought inflation down significantly from the pandemic-related highs.  We have capped the price of insulin for America's 37 million diabetics,  and we continue to fight to lower prices for other lifesaving  medications.   We have created more than 13 million jobs since President Biden took  office, and we are fixing the roads and bridges that Americans use to  travel on throughout the country. My colleagues on the other side of  the aisle were against this proposition, and many voted against it. Now  I see them at home taking pictures in front of bridges and roads being  fixed. Pretty interesting.   In addition, we are making communities safer. We have passed  legislation to protect America's children and expand background checks  to keep dangerous weapons off the streets.   I have said it before and I will say it again: I am extremely proud  that my party works for the American people and not special interests.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Illinois for  the opportunity to discuss this term that was used in this very Chamber  just last week: colored people. It is a term used to describe African  Americans during a debate that was negative.   Colored people is a term that we hadn't heard in quite some time.  Colored people are what the signs above water fountains outside of  bathrooms in train stations and in bus stations said. It was a part of  life that African Americans had to deal with to show the separation,  the inequality, and the second-class citizenship that we were relegated  to for so long.   Was it a mistake?   I am sure the gentleman from Arizona feels it was now, but sometimes  the truth comes out. It was during a discussion on diversity in the  military and how we don't want to spend--or the loyal opposition  doesn't want to spend--military dollars on diversity and inclusion.  Let's separate the Armed Forces again: Whites over there, colored  people over there.   Let's go back and let's Make America Great Again. That is what that  is all about. It is going back to someone's good old days when they  were comfortable, when they felt they were supreme, and when they  thought that they had the upper hand. We don't want equality, we want  to go back to the good old days. Let's Make America Great Again. We  don't want diversity in the military. That is not for the military to  decide. Let's go back.   It is an insult. I was here, Mr. Speaker. I was on the floor when the  gentleman was discussing this. I rise today to discuss the derogatory  term colored people. I support the need for diversity in programs  nationwide.   Last week, a MAGA House Republican from Arizona used the term colored  people to describe African Americans and other minorities. He used the  term very comfortably, although I think it slipped out.   He used it when he discussed his amendment to reject diversity  initiatives in the military. He said that this amendment would prohibit  discrimination in the Armed Forces. Clearly, he needs to enroll in one  of the diversity courses that he wants to ban.   Discrimination has a long history in our country, including hiring in  the Armed Forces. His amendment rejects the success of diversity hiring  initiatives in the military, and it could return our country to a time  when race was the only factor in who got hired and who got promoted in  the military.   Let me return to his use of the term colored people. Historically,  the term colored has always been used to separate the races into two  classes and justified the discrimination that would follow such a  separation.   It made it legal to have that discussion. It made people comfortable  because someone has to be on the top, and someone has to be on the  bottom in this country.   We have been used against each other for years. The ruling class, the  rich, have always pointed to people on the bottom at each other so they  fight for the crumbs while they stay aloof and get the riches.   Colored was also a way to describe African Americans, and it has its  roots in slavery. Laws and official documents defined slaves as  negroes, mulattos, and other colored people.   After slavery, Southern States enacted the Jim Crow-era segregation  to deny African Americans their rights. Stores and institutions used  the term colored to identify bathrooms, water fountains, and other  facilities, as I stated, and these facilities were always inferior and  usually unsafe.   However, the Arizona Republican and his colleagues did not want to  talk about the past--this past. They want to live in a fantasy where  such discrimination never happened, and it didn't exist. However, it  did happen, and discrimination like this is still happening to me, my  colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, and millions of African  Americans nationwide. Even the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives is not safe from it.   This is why diversity programs are so vital to our national  interests.   Mr. Speaker, I could continue on. I could go on forever, but I know  there are other Members who would like to express their outrage on this  issue.   We cannot go back.   We are not going back.   To people who live in that space, just know that you need to be very  careful because that is a slippery slope.
