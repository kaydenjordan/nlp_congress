 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, believe it or  not, yet again, it is infrastructure week here.   For decades, our country has been calling for investment to bring our  infrastructure into, not just the future, but at this point, the  present.   For months, we have been meeting, both Democrats and Republicans, to  get this bill to work for all of us. Now, it is time to take action and  pass it for the American people. The stakes could not be higher.   Nevada, where I am from, has been ground zero for this pandemic. We  are ground zero for the effects of climate change. But, more  importantly, we are ground zero for the promise and the economic  opportunities in this bill.   Roads, bridges, access to broadband, electric vehicles, electric  buses, clean energy, water solutions for the West, all of this is  needed and all of it will benefit my State and every corner in this  country. That is why we have to put politics aside, come together, and  pass this legislation now.   I came to Congress because I was tired of the bickering and the  dysfunction and the gridlock. I was tired of politics as usual.   Safer roads and bridges, these are not partisan political issues. We  have the opportunity to pass these investments for every single  American and create millions of good-paying jobs and strengthen our  recovery and get our economy back on track. The time to deliver  solutions is now.                            ____________________
