 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Additional  Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act.   The Biden administration, Congress, and the American people have been  unflinching in our support for the people of Ukraine. Under desperate  circumstances, the Ukrainian people have valiantly resisted Vladimir  Putin's illegal, unjust, and unprovoked invasion of their country.   Today, the House of Representatives has another opportunity not only  to stand with the people of Ukraine but to stand together with our  fellow democracies against this authoritarian aggression by passing  this supplemental.   As chair of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I know how  critical it is to continue our commitment to provide Ukraine with  robust security assistance.   At the same time, we must provide the Department of Defense with  additional tools to respond to the Russian aggression. That is why we  have included $20.1 billion in this legislation, including $6 billion  for the Ukrainian Security Assistance Initiative to provide equipment,  weapons, and training to the Ukrainian military. We have included $9.1  billion to replenish stocks of the U.S. military equipment that has  been donated to Ukraine.   Last month, I had the opportunity to travel to Germany and Poland and  visit with our deployed servicemembers. Today, I am pleased that we  have included flexibility for the Department of Defense to provide  hardship pay for those deployed in the EUCOM region.   This legislation also includes funding for desperately needed  humanitarian relief for Ukrainian families who have been displaced  within Ukraine or have fled to neighboring nations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican colleagues to join us in a show of  bipartisan unity. Let us stand together. Let us pass this bill. Let us  defend democracies everywhere from Russian aggression.
