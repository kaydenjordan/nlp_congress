 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Holland Virtual  Tech High School.   This program was brought to my attention by a gentleman named Louis,  who talked about it and the positive impact it had on his family during  one of my telephone townhalls recently. Since 2015, the program has  served as an alternative credit recovery school on the campus of  Holland High School in Holland, Michigan.   The fully accredited program offers a unique online learning  environment designed for students who struggle in a traditional  classroom setting or have fallen behind in their schoolwork due to  unforeseen circumstances. Together, teachers, guidance counselors, and  support staff at the school work with the students to develop an  individualized graduation plan.   Through these efforts, nearly 400 students have graduated from the  program. That represents countless lives positively impacted, even more  doors opened, and endless opportunities created for these young men and  women.   Upon completion of the program, students receive a Holland Public  Schools diploma that meets all requirements of the Michigan Merit  Curriculum. The program has played an integral part in increasing the  overall Holland High School graduation rate by 5 percentage points over  the last 2 years.   Students who graduate are equipped with the skills to successfully  transition into their postsecondary lives, whether that be continued  education, apprenticeships, or directly into the job market.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone who is involved with Holland Virtual  Tech High School. Keep up the great work.                            ____________________
