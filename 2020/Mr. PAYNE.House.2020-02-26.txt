 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly great person  in my district, Council President Joyce Watterman, who was honored in  my celebration of Black History Month.   Ms. Watterman is the first African American woman to be elected  council president for Jersey City. Right now, she is working to improve  disabled parking, increase affordable housing, provide a safe  environment for our children, and empower prisoners to better their  lives.   In addition, she has one of the strongest commitments to promoting  diversity and inclusion throughout the district. She is an active  member of the local NAACP and co-chair of the Diversity and Inclusion  Advisory Board.   This is not my only tribute for Ms. Watterman. I honored her during a  special Black History Month celebration on February 21. She is a  tremendous asset to my district and deserves all these accolades and  more. She is a truly great public servant through her ministry in  church and her public office.                            ____________________
