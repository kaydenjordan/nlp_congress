 We will stop the steal.        (Applause.)         Today I will lay out just some of the evidence       proving that we won this election and we won it by a       landslide. This was not a close election. And after this,       we're going to walk down--and I will be there with you--we're       going to walk down--we're gonna walk down to the Capitol.        (People chanting: ``Yeah. Let's take the Capitol.'')        Unidentified Male. Take it.        Unidentified Male. Take the Capitol.        Unidentified Male. We are going to the Capitol, where our       problems are. It's that direction.        Unidentified Male. Everybody in. This way. This way.         Tens of thousands of votes. They came in in       duffel bags. Where the hell did they come from?        (People chanting: ``USA.'')        Sergeant at Arms: Madam Speaker, the Vice President and the       United States Senate.        (Applause.)        Unidentified Male. Off the sidewalk.        Unidentified Male. We outnumber you a million to one out       here, dude.        Unidentified Male. Take the building. Take the building.        Unidentified Male. Let us in.        Unidentified Male. Fuck these pigs.        Unidentified Male. Join us.        Unidentified Male. Let us in.        Unidentified Male. That's enough. There's much more coming.         The Constitution says you have to protect our       country and you have to protect our Constitution. And you       can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't       it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go       by very different rules.        So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.        Unidentified Male. Talking about you, Pence.         When we fight, we fight like hell. And if you       don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country       anymore.        Unidentified Male. Fuck DC police. Fuck you.         So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania       Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we are going to the       Capitol, and we are going to try and give our Republicans--      the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our       help. We are going to try and give them the kind of pride and       boldness that they need to take back our country.        Unidentified Male. Get the fuck out of here, you traitors.         There has never been a time like this where such       a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of       us--from me, from you, from our country. This was a       fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of       these people.        We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You're very       special. You've seen what happens. You've seen the way others       are treated that are so bad and so evil.  [[Page S591]]         I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.        (Audience chants: ``USA.'')        Your lies in your own cities, your own counties. Storm your       own capitol buildings. We take down every one of these       motherfuckers.        Hang them!    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, the President was impeached by the U.S.  House of Representatives on January 13 for doing that. You ask what a  ``high crime and misdemeanor'' is under our Constitution. That is a  high crime and misdemeanor. If that is not an impeachable offense, then  there is no such thing. And if the President's arguments for a January  exception are upheld, then even if everyone agrees that he is culpable  for these events, even if the evidence proves, as we think it  definitively does, that the President incited a violent insurrection on  the day Congress met to finalize the Presidential election, he would  have you believe there is absolutely nothing the Senate can do about  it--no trial, no facts. He wants you to decide that the Senate is  powerless at that point. That can't be right.   The transition of power is always the most dangerous moment for  democracies. Every historian will tell you that. We just saw it in the  most astonishing way. We lived through it. And you know what? The  Framers of our Constitution knew it. That is why they created a  Constitution with an oath written into it that binds the President from  his very first day in office until his very last day in office and  every day in between.   Under that Constitution and under that oath, the President of the  United States is forbidden to commit high crimes and misdemeanors  against the people at any point that he is in office. Indeed, that is  one specific reason the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification  of powers exist: to protect us against Presidents who try to overrun  the power of the people in their elections and replace the rule of law  with the rule of mobs. These powers must apply even if the President  commits his offenses in his final weeks in office. In fact, that is  precisely when we need them the most because that is when elections get  attacked.   Everything that we know about the language of the Constitution, the  Framers' original understanding and intent, prior Senate practice, and  common sense, confirms this rule.   Let's start with the text of the Constitution. Article I, section 2  gives the House the sole power of impeachment when the President  commits high crimes and misdemeanors. We exercised that power on  January 13.   The President, it is undisputed, committed his offense while he was  President, and it is undisputed that we impeached him while he was  President. There can be no doubt that this is a valid and legitimate  impeachment, and there can be no doubt that the Senate has the power to  try this impeachment. We know this because article I, section 3 gives  the Senate the sole power to try all impeachments. The Senate has the  power, the sole power, to try all impeachments. ``All'' means all, and  there are no exceptions to the rule. Because the Senate has  jurisdiction to try all impeachments, it most certainly has  jurisdiction to try this one. It is really that simple. The vast  majority of constitutional scholars who studied the question and  weighed in on the proposition being advanced by the President, this  January exception, heretofore unknown, agree with us, and that includes  the Nation's most prominent conservative legal scholars, including  former Tenth Circuit Judge Michael McConnell; the cofounder of the  Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi; Ronald Reagan's Solicitor General  Charles Fried; luminary Washington lawyer Charles Cooper, among  hundreds of other constitutional lawyers and professors.   I commend the people I named--their recent writings to you in the  newspapers over the last several days. And all of the key precedents,  along with detailed explanation of the constitutional history and  textual analysis, appear in the trial brief we filed last week and the  reply brief that we filed very early this morning.   I will spare you a replay, but I want to highlight a few key points  from constitutional history that strike me as compelling in foreclosing  President Trump's argument that there is a secret January exception  hidden away in the Constitution.   The first point comes from English history, which matters because, as  Hamilton wrote, England provided ``the model from which the idea of  this institution has been borrowed.'' And it would have been  immediately obvious to anyone familiar with that history that former  officials could be held accountable for their abuses while in office.   Every single impeachment of a government official that occurred  during the Framers' lifetime concerned a former official--a former  official. Indeed, the most famous of these impeachments occurred while  the Framers gathered in Philadelphia to write the Constitution. It was  the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the former Governor-general of the  British colony of Bengal and a corrupt guy. The Framers knew all about  it, and they strongly supported the impeachment. In fact, the Hastings  case was invoked by name at the convention. It was the only specific  impeachment case that they discussed at the convention. It played a key  role in their adoption of the high crimes and misdemeanors standard.  And even though everyone there surely knew that Hastings had left  office 2 years before his impeachment trial began, not a single  Framer--not one--raised a concern when Virginian George Mason held up  the Hastings impeachment as a model for us in the writing of our  Constitution.   The early State constitutions supported the idea too. Every single  State constitution in the 1780s either specifically said that former  officials could be impeached or were entirely consistent with the idea.  In contrast, not a single State constitution prohibite trials of former  officials. As a result, there was an overwhelming presumption in favor  of allowing legislatures to hold former officials accountable in this  way. Any departure from that norm would have been a big deal, and yet  there is no sign anywhere that that ever happened.    Some States, including Delaware, even confined impeachment only to  officials who had already left office. This confirms that removal was  never seen as the exclusive purpose of impeachment in America. The goal  was always about accountability, protecting society, and deterring  official corruption.   Delaware matters for another reason. Writing about impeachment in the  Federalist Papers, Hamilton explained that the President of America  would stand upon no better ground than a Governor of New York and upon  worse ground than the Governors of Maryland and Delaware. He thus  emphasized that the President is even more accountable than officials  in Delaware, where, as I noted, the constitution clearly allowed  impeachment of former officials.   And nobody involved in the convention ever said that the Framers  meant to reject this widely accepted, deeply rooted understanding of  the word ``impeachment'' when they wrote it into our Constitution. The  convention debates instead confirm this interpretation. There, while  discussing impeachment, the Framers repeatedly returned to the threat  of Presidential corruption aimed directly to elections, the heart of  self-government.   Almost perfectly anticipating President Trump, William Davey of North  Carolina explained impeachment was for a President who spared ``no  effort or means whatever to get himself reelected.''   Hamilton, in Federalist 1, said the greatest danger to republics and  the liberties of the people comes from political opportunists who begin  as demagogues and end as tyrants and the people who are encouraged to  follow them.   President Trump may not know a lot about the Framers, but they  certainly knew a lot about him.   Given the Framers' intense focus on danger to elections and the  peaceful transfer of power, it is inconceivable that they designed  impeachment to be a dead letter in the President's final days in office  when opportunities to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power  would be most tempting and most dangerous, as we just saw. Thus, as a  matter of history and original understanding, there is no merit to  President Trump's claim that he can incite an insurrection and then  insist weeks later that the Senate lacks the power to even hear  evidence at a trial, to even hold a trial.   The true rule was stated by former President John Quincy Adams when  he categorically declared:   [[Page S592]]              I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my       body, amenable to impeachment by [the] House for everything I       did during the time I held any public office.    When he comes up in a minute, my colleague Mr. Neguse of Colorado  will further pursue the relevant Senate precedents and explain why this  body's practice has been supported by the text of the Constitution, and  Mr. Cicilline of Rhode Island will then respond to the fallacies  presented by the President's counsel. After these gentlemen speak, I  will return to discuss the importance--the fundamental importance of  the Senate rejecting President Trump's argument for the preservation of  democratic self-government and the rule of law in the United States of  America.   I now turn it over to my colleague, Mr. Neguse of Colorado.   Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, my name is    Joe Neguse, and I represent Colorado's Second Congressional District  in the United States Congress.   Like many of you, I am an attorney. I practiced law before I came to  Congress, tried a lot of different cases, some more unique than others,  certainly never a case as important as this one, nor a case with such a  heavy and weighty constitutional question for you all to decide.   Thankfully, as Lead Manager Raskin so thoroughly explained, the  Framers have answered that question for you, for us, and you don't need  to be a constitutional scholar to know that the argument President  Trump asks you to adopt is not just wrong, it is dangerous. And you  don't have to take my word for it. This body, the world's greatest  deliberative body, the United States Senate, has reached that same  conclusion in one form or another over the past 200 years on multiple  occasions that we will go through. Over 150 constitutional scholars,  experts, judges--conservative, liberal, you name it--they  overwhelmingly have reached the same conclusion, that, of course, you  can try, convict, and disqualify a former President. And that makes  sense because the text of the Constitution makes clear there is no  January exception to the impeachment power; that Presidents can't  commit grave offenses in their final days and escape any congressional  response. That is not how our Constitution works.   Let's start with the precedent, with what has happened in this very  Chamber. I would like to focus on just two cases. I will go through  them quickly. One of them is the Nation's very first impeachment case,  which actually was of a former official.   In 1797, about a decade after our country ratified our Constitution,  there was a Senator from Tennessee by the name of William Blount, who  was caught conspiring with the British to try to sell Florida and  Louisiana. Ultimately, President Adams caught him. He turned over the  evidence to Congress. Four days later, the House of Representatives  impeached him. A day after that, this body, the United States Senate,  expelled him from office, so he was very much a former official.   Despite that, the House went forward with its impeachment proceeding  in order to disqualify him from ever again holding Federal office. And  so the Senate proceeded with the trial with none other than Thomas  Jefferson presiding.   Now, Blount argued that the Senate couldn't proceed because he had  already been expelled. But here is the interesting thing: He expressly  disavowed any claim that former officials can't ever be impeached. And  unlike President Trump, he was very clear that he respected and  understood that he could not even try to argue that ridiculous  position.   Even impeached Senator Blount recognized the inherent absurdity of  that view. Here is what he said:         I certainly never shall contend, that an officer may first       commit an offense, and afterwards avoid by resigning his       office.    That is the point. And there was no doubt because the Founders were  around to confirm that that was their intent and the obvious meaning of  what is in the Constitution.   Fast-forward 80 years later--arguably the most important precedent  that this body has to consider--the trial of former Secretary of War  William Belknap. I am not going to go into all the details, but, in  short, in 1876, the House discovered that he was involved in a massive  kickback scheme. Hours before the House Committee had discovered this  conduct, released its report documenting the scheme, Belknap literally  rushed to the White House to resign, tender his resignation to  President Ulysses Grant to avoid any further inquiry into his  misconduct, and, of course, to avoid being disqualified from holding  Federal office in the future.   Later that day, aware of the resignation, what did the House do? The  House moved forward and unanimously impeached him, making clear its  power to impeach a former official. And when his case reached the  Senate--this body--Belknap made the exact same argument that President  Trump is making today, that you all lack jurisdiction, any power, to  try him because he is a former official.   Now, many Senators at that time, when they heard that argument-- literally, they were sitting in the same chair as you all are sitting  in today--they were outraged by that argument--outraged. You can read  their comments in the Record. They knew it was a dangerous, dangerous  argument with dangerous implications. It would literally mean that a  President could betray their country, leave office, and avoid  impeachment and disqualification entirely. And that is why, in the end,  the United States Senate decisively voted that the Constitution  required them to proceed with the trial.   The Belknap case is clear precedent that the Senate must proceed with  this trial since it rejected pretrial dismissal, affirmed its  jurisdiction, and moved to a full consideration of the merits.   Now, Belknap ultimately was not convicted but only after a thorough  public inquiry into his misconduct, which created a record of his  wrongdoing. It ensured his accountability and deterred anyone else from  considering such corruption by making clear that it was intolerable.  The trial served important constitutional purposes.   Now, given that precedent that I described to you, given all that  that precedent imparts, you could imagine my surprise--Lead Manager  Raskin's surprise--when we were reviewing a trial brief filed by the  President in which his counsel insists that the Senate actually didn't  decide anything in the Belknap case. They say--these are not my words.  I will quote from their trial brief:         [It] cannot be read as foreclosing an argument that they       never dealt with.    Never dealt with? The Senate didn't debate this question for 2 hours.  The Senate debated this very question for 2 weeks. The Senate spent an  additional 2 weeks deliberating on the jurisdictional question. And at  the end of those deliberations, they decided decisively that the Senate  has jurisdiction and that it could proceed, that it must proceed to a  full trial.   By the way, unlike Belknap, as we know, President Trump was not  impeached for run-of-the-mill corruption, misconduct. He was impeached  for inciting a violent insurrection--an insurrection where people died  in this building, an insurrection that desecrated our seat of  government. And if Congress were just to stand completely aside in the  face of such an extraordinary crime against the Republic, it would  invite future Presidents to use their power without any fear of  accountability. And none of us--I know this--none of us, no matter our  party or our politics, wants that.   Now, we have gone through the highlights of the precedent, and I  think it is important that you know, as Lead Manager Raskin mentioned,  that scholars, overwhelmingly, that reviewed this same precedent have  all come to the same conclusion that the Senate must hear this case.   Let's go through just a few short examples. To start, all of us, I  know, are familiar with the Federalist Society. Some of you may know  Steven Calabresi personally. He is the co-founder of the Federalist  Society. Actually, he was the chairman of the board in 2019. He was the  first president of the Yale Federalist Society chapter board, a  position I understand Senator Hawley later held.   Here is what Mr. Calabresi has to say. On January 21, he issued a  public letter stating:         Our carefully considered views of the law lead all of us to       agree that the Constitution permits the impeachment,       conviction, and  [[Page S593]]       disqualification of former officers, including presidents.    And by the way, he is not the only one, as Lead Manager Raskin said-- President Reagan's former Solicitor General, among many others.   Another prominent conservative scholar known to many of you, again,  personally is a former Tenth Court of Appeals judge--my circuit--Judge  Michael McConnell. He was nominated by President George W. Bush. He was  confirmed by this body unanimously. Senator Hatch--many of you served  with--he had this to say about Judge McConnell, that he ``is an honest  man. He calls it as he sees it, and he is beholden to no one and no  group.''   Well, what does Judge McConnell have to say about the question that  you are debating this afternoon? He said the following:         Given that the impeachment of President Trump was       legitimate, the text makes clear that the Senate has power to       try that impeachment.    You heard Lead Manager Raskin mention another lawyer, Chuck Cooper, a  prominent conservative lawyer here in Washington. He has represented  former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and House Minority Leader Kevin  McCarthy. He issued an editorial just 2 days ago, very powerful,  observing that ``scholarship on this question has matured  substantially'' and that, ultimately, arguments that President Trump is  championing are beset by ``serious weaknesses.''   Finally, I have gone through a lot of scholars. I will finish on this  one. There is another scholar that I know some of you know and some of  you have actually spoken with recently. Up until just a few weeks ago,  he was a recognized champion--champion--of the view that the  Constitution authorizes the impeachment of former officials. And that  is Professor Jonathan Turley.   Let me show you what I mean. These are his words. First, in a very  detailed study, thorough study, he explained that ``the resignation  from office does not prevent trial on articles of impeachment.''   Those are Professor Turley's words. Same piece. He celebrated the  Belknap trial. He described it as ``a corrective measure that helped  the system regain legitimacy.''   He wrote another article--he has written several on this topic. This  one is actually a 146-page study, very detailed.   In that study, he said that the decision in Belknap was ``correct in  its view that impeachments historically had extended to former  officials, such as Warren Hastings,'' who you heard Lead Manager Raskin  describe.   In fact, as you can see, Professor Turley argued the House could  impeach and the Senate could have tried Richard Nixon after he  resigned. His quote on this is very telling: ``Future Presidents could  not assume that mere resignation would avoid a trial of their conduct''  in the United States Senate.   Finally, last quote from Professor Turley that ``no man in no  circumstance, can escape the account, which he owes to the laws of his  country.'' Not my words, not Lead Manager Raskin's words--Professor  Jonathan Turley's words. I agree with him because he is exactly right.   Now, a question one might reasonably ask after going through all  those quotes from such noted jurists and scholars: Why is there such  agreement on this topic? Well, the reason is pretty simple. It is  because it is what the Constitution says.   I want to walk you through three provisions of the Constitution that  make clear that the Senate must try this case.   First, let's start with what the Constitution says about Congress's  power in article I. You heard Lead Manager Raskin make this point, but  it is worth underscoring. Article I, section 2 gives the House ``sole  Power of Impeachment.'' Article I, section 3 gives the Senate the  ``sole Power to try all Impeachments.''   Based on President Trump's argument, one would think that language  includes caveats, exceptions, but it doesn't. It doesn't say  ``Impeachment of current civil officers.'' It doesn't say ``Impeachment  of those still in office.''   The Framers didn't mince words. They provided express, absolute,  unqualified grants of jurisdictional power to the House to impeach and  the Senate to try all impeachments--not some, all.   Former Judge McConnell, the judge that we talked about earlier, he  provides very effective textual analysis of this provision. You can see  it up here on the slide. I will just give you the highlight. He says-- and I will quote. This is Judge McConnell:         Given that the impeachment of Mr. Trump was legitimate, the       text makes clear that the Senate has power to try that       impeachment.    Now, again, here is what--it is pretty interesting to me at least. We  presented this argument in our trial brief, which we filed over a week  ago, where we laid it out step by step so that you could consider it  and so that opposing counsel could consider it as well.   We received President Trump's response yesterday, and the trial brief  offers no rebuttal to this point--none. In fairness, I can't think of  any convincing response. I mean, the Constitution is just exceptionally  clear on this point. Now, perhaps they will have something to say today  about it, but they did not yesterday.   There is another provision worth mentioning here because there has  been a lot of confusion about it. I am going to try to clear this up.  This is the provision on removal and disqualification. We all know the  Senate imposes a judgment only when it convicts. Up on the screen, you  will see article I, section 3, clause 7. With that in mind, the  language says that if the Senate convicts, the judgment ``shall not  extend further than'' removal and disqualification.   That is it. The meaning is clear. The Senate has the power to impose  removal, which only applies to current officials. And, separately, it  has the power to impose disqualification, which obviously applies to  both current and former officers. But it doesn't have the power to go  any further than that.   Now, as I understand President Trump's argument, they believe that  this language somehow says that disqualification can only follow the  removal of a current officer, but it doesn't. That interpretation  essentially rewrites the Constitution. It adds words that aren't there.  I mean, after all, the Constitution does not say ``removal from office  and then disqualification.'' It doesn't say ``removal from office  followed by disqualification.'' It simply says the Senate can't do more  than two possible sentences: removal and disqualification.   This, by the way, is not the first time that this direct question has  been debated in this Chamber. One hundred forty-six years ago, during  the Belknap trial, Senator George Edmunds of Vermont was one of the  most prestigious Republican Senators of his time. He sat right where  Senator Grassley sits today. He zeroed in on this exact point during  the Belknap trial.   This is his quote:         A prohibition against doing more than two things cannot be       turned into a command to do both or neither.    And just imagine the consequences of such an absurd interpretation of  the Constitution. If President Trump were right about that language,  then officials could commit the most extraordinary, destructive  offenses against the American people--high crimes and misdemeanors.  They would have total control over whether they could ever be impeached  and, if they are, whether the Senate can try the case. If they want to  escape any public inquiry into their misconduct or the risk of  disqualification from future office, then it is pretty simple. They  could just resign 1 minute before the House impeaches or even 1 minute  before the Senate trial or they could resign during the Senate trial if  it is not looking so well. That would effectively erase  ``disqualification'' from the Constitution. It would put wrongdoers in  charge of whether the Senate can try them.   The third and final reason why President Trump must stand trial: the  provision of article I of the Constitution.   You will see here on the screen that the Constitution twice describes  the accused in an impeachment trial. Here is what I want you to focus  on. The interesting thing is notice the words. It refers to a  ``person'' and a ``party'' being impeached. Now, again, we know that  the Framers gave a lot of thought to the words that they chose. They  even had a style committee during the Constitutional Convention. They  could  [[Page S594]]  have written ``civil officers'' here. They did that elsewhere in the  Constitution. That would, ultimately, have limited impeachment trials  to current officials, but, instead, they used broader language to  describe who could be tried by the United States Senate.   So who could be put on trial for impeachment other than civil  officers? Who else could a ``person'' or a ``party'' be? Well, really,  there is only one possible answer: former officers.   And, again, that actually might explain why, during the Belknap  trial, Senator Thomas Bayard, of Delaware, who later became the  Secretary of State for the United States--he sat right where Senator  Carper is sitting now--he found this point so compelling that he felt  compelled to speak out on it. During the trial, he concluded that the  Constitution must allow the impeachment and trial of people and parties  who are not civil officers, and the only group that could possibly  encompass was former officials like Belknap and, of course, here, like  President Trump.   Just so we are clear, in full disclosure, this is another argument  that was not addressed by President Trump in his rebuttal, and we know  why they didn't: because their argument doesn't square with the plain  text of the Constitution. There is one provision that President Trump  relies on almost exclusively, article II, section 4. I am sure you will  see it when they present their arguments.   Their argument is that the language you will see on the screen  somehow prevents you from holding this trial, by making removal from  office an absolute requirement--but, again, where does the language say  that? Where does it say anything in that provision about your  jurisdiction? In fact, this provision isn't even in the part of the  Constitution that addresses your authority. It is in article II, not  article I, and it certainly says nothing about former officials.   President Trump's interpretation doesn't square with history,  originalism, textualism. In fact, even Chuck Cooper, the famous  conservative lawyer I mentioned earlier, with clients like the House  minority leader, has concluded that this provision of the Constitution  that President Trump relies on ``cuts against'' his position--his  words--and that is because, as Cooper says, article II, section 4 means  just what it says. The first half describes what an official must do to  be impeached--namely, commit high crimes and misdemeanors--and the  second half describes what happens when civil officers of the United  States, including the sitting President, are convicted: removal from  office. That is it.   In Cooper's words:         It simply establishes what is known in criminal law as a       ``mandatory minimum'' punishment.    It says nothing about former officials, nothing at all.   Given all of that, it is not surprising that, in President Trump's  legal trial brief--a 75-page brief--they struggled to find any  professors to support their position. They did cite one professor,  though, Professor Kalt, an expert in this field, who they claim agreed  with them that the only purpose of impeachment is removal. Professor  Kalt's position, which they had to have known because it is in the  article that they cite in the brief, is that ``removal'' is ``not the  sole end of impeachment.'' Actually, in that same article, he describes  the view advocated by President Trump's lawyers as having ``deep  flaws.''   Again, you do not have to take my word for it. You can take Professor  Kalt's word for it, the professor they cited in their brief, filed  yesterday, because he tweeted about it on the screen here. This is what  he had to say. I am not going to read through it in great detail. I  will just simply give you the highlights.         [President] Trump's brief cites my 2001 article on late       impeachment a lot. . . . But in several places, they       misrepresent what I wrote quite badly. . . . There are       multiple examples of such flat-out misrepresentations. . . .       They didn't have to be disingenuous and misleading. . . .    This key constitutional scholar, relied on by President Trump, said  it just right.   I have explained in great detail the many reasons the argument that  President Trump advocates for here today is wrong. I just want to close  with a note about why it is dangerous.   Lead Manager Raskin explained that impeachment exists to protect the  American people from officials who abuse their power, who betray them.  It exists for a case just like this one.   Honestly, it is hard to imagine a clearer example of how a President  could abuse his office: inciting violence against a coequal branch of  government while seeking to remain in power after losing an election-- sitting back and watching it unfold. We all know the consequences.   Like every one of you, I was in the Capitol on January 6. I was on  the floor with Lead Manager Raskin. Like every one of you, I was  evacuated as this violent mob stormed the Capitol's gates. What you  experienced that day, what we experienced that day, what our country  experienced that day was the Framers' worst nightmare coming to life.  Presidents can't enflame insurrection in their final weeks and then  walk away like nothing happened. Yet that is the rule that President  Trump asks you to adopt.   I urge you, we urge you to decline his request, to vindicate the  Constitution, to let us try this case.   Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, my name  is   David Cicilline. I have the honor of representing the First  Congressional District of Rhode Island.   As I hope is now clear from the arguments of Mr. Raskin and Mr.  Neguse, impeachment is not merely about removing someone from office.  Fundamentally, impeachment exists to protect our constitutional system,  to keep each of us safe, to uphold our freedom, to safeguard our  democracy. It achieves that by deterring abuse of the extraordinary  power that we entrust to our Presidents from the very first day in  office to the very last day. It also ensures accountability for  Presidents who harm us or our government. In the aftermath of a  tragedy, it allows us an opportunity to come together and to heal by  working through what happened and reaffirming our constitutional  principles, and it authorizes this body and this body alone to  disqualify from our political system anybody whose conduct in office  proves that they present a danger to the Republic. But impeachment  would fail to achieve these purposes if you created, for the first time  ever, despite the words of the Framers and the Constitution, a January  exception, as Mr. Raskin explained.   Now, I was a former defense lawyer for many years, and I can  understand why President Trump and his lawyers don't want you to hear  this case, why they don't want you to see the evidence, but the  argument that you lack jurisdiction rests on a purely fictional  loophole--purely fictional--designed to allow the former President to  escape all accountability for conduct that is truly indefensible under  our Constitution. You saw the consequences of his actions on the video  that we played earlier. I would like to emphasize in still greater  detail the extraordinary constitutional offense that the former  President thinks you have no power whatsoever to adjudicate.   While spreading lies about the election outcome, in a brazen attempt  to retain power against the will of the American people, he incited an  armed, angry mob to riot--and not just anywhere but here in the seat of  our government, in the Capitol, during a joint session of Congress,  when the Vice President presided while we carried out a peaceful  transfer of power, which was interrupted for the first time in our  history. This was a disaster of historic proportion. It was also an  unforgivable betrayal of the oath of office of President Trump, the  oath he swore, an oath that he sullied and dishonored to advance his  own personal interests.   And make no mistake about it, as you think about that day, things  could have been much worse. As one Senator said, they could have killed  all of us. It was only the bravery and sacrifice of the police, who  suffered deaths and injuries as a result of President Trump's actions,  that prevented greater tragedy.   At trial, we will prove with overwhelming evidence that President  Trump is singularly and directly responsible for inciting the assault  on the Capitol. We will also prove that his dereliction of duty, his  desire to seek personal advantage from the mayhem, and his decision to  issue tweets, further inciting the mob by attacking the Vice President,  all compounded the already enormous damage.  [[Page S595]]    Now, virtually every American who saw those events unfold on  television was absolutely horrified by the events of January 6, but we  also know how President Trump himself felt about the attack. He told  us. Here is what he tweeted at 6:01 as the Capitol was in shambles and  as dozens of police officers and other law enforcement officers lay  battered and bruised and bloodied.   Here is what he said:         These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace.       Remember this day forever!    Every time I read that tweet, it chills me to the core. The President  of the United States sided with the insurrectionists. He celebrated  their cause. He validated their attack. He told them, ``Remember this  day forever,'' hours after they marched through these halls looking to  assassinate Vice President Pence, the Speaker of the House, and any of  us they could find.   Given all that, it is no wonder that President Trump would rather  talk about jurisdiction and a supposed January exception rather than  talk about what happened on January 6.   Make no mistake, his arguments are dead wrong. They are distractions  from what really matters. The Senate can and should require President  Trump to stand trial.   My colleagues have already addressed many of President Trump's  efforts to escape trial. I would like to cover the remainder and then  address the broader issues at stake in this trial.   For starters, in an extension of his mistaken reading of the  Constitution, President Trump insists that he cannot face trial in the  Senate because he is merely a private citizen. He references here the  bill of attainder clause.   But as Mr. Neguse just explained, the Constitution refers to the  defendant in an impeachment trial as a ``Person'' and a ``Party,'' and  certainly he counts as one of those.   Let's also apply some common sense. There is a reason that he now  insists on being called ``the 45th President of the United States''  rather than ``Citizen Trump.'' He isn't a randomly selected private  citizen. He is a former officer of the United States Government. He is  a former President of the United States of America. He is treated  differently under a law called the Former Presidents Act.   For 4 years, we trusted him with more power than anyone else on  Earth. As a former President, who promised on a Bible to use his power  faithfully, he can and should answer for whether he kept that promise  while bound by it in office. His insistence otherwise is just wrong,  and so is his claim that there is a slippery slope to impeaching  private citizens if you proceed.   The trial of a former official for abuses he committed as an  official, arising from an impeachment that occurred while he was an  official, poses absolutely no risk whatsoever of subjecting a private  citizen to impeachment for their private conduct.   To emphasize the point, President Trump was impeached while he was in  office for conduct in office--period.   The alternative, once again, is this January exception, in which our  most powerful officials can commit the most terrible abuses and then  resign, leave office, and suddenly claim that they are just a private  citizen who can't be held accountable at all.   In the same vein, President Trump and his lawyers argue that he  shouldn't be impeached because it will set a bad precedent for  impeaching others. But that slippery slope argument is also incorrect.  For centuries, the prevailing view has been that former officials are  subject to impeachment. We just heard a full discussion of that. The  House has repeatedly acknowledged that fact.   But in the vast majority of cases, the House has rightly recognized  that an official's resignation or departure makes the extraordinary  step of impeachment unnecessary and maybe even unwise.   As a House manager rightly explained in the Belknap case, and I  quote:         There is no likelihood that we shall ever unlimber [the]       clumsy and bulky monster piece of ordinance to take aim at an       object from which all danger has gone by.    President Trump's case, though, is different. The danger has not  ``gone by.'' His threat to democracy makes any prior abuse by any  government official pale in comparison.   Moreover, allowing his conduct to pass without the most decisive  response would itself create an extraordinary danger to the Nation,  inviting further abuse of power and signaling that the Congress of the  United States is unable or unwilling to respond to insurrection incited  by the President.   Think about that.   To paraphrase Justice Robert Jackson, who said that precedent that I  just described would lie about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand  of any future President who decided in his final months to make a play  for unlimited power--think of the danger.   Here is the rare case in which love of the Constitution and  commitment to our democracy required the House to impeach. It is for  the same reason, the Senate can and must try this case.   Next, President Trump will assert that it somehow is significant or  it matters that the Chief Justice isn't presiding over this trial.   Let me state this very plainly: It does not matter. It is not  significant. Under article I, section 3, ``When the President of the  United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.''   There is only one person who is President of the United States at a  time. Right now, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is the 46th President of the  United States. As a result, the requirement that the Chief Justice  preside isn't triggered. Instead, the normal rules of any impeachment  of anyone other than the sitting President apply, and under those  rules, the President Pro Tempore, Senator Leahy, can preside.   And, of course, this makes perfect sense. The Chief Justice presides  because, when the current President is on trial, if the Chief Justice  doesn't preside, the Vice President presides, and it would be a  conflict for someone to preside over a trial that would become  President if there was a conviction. So there isn't that concern when  you have a former President on trial, or, for that matter, when you  have anyone on trial other than the current President, which is why the  Chief Justice presides only in that single case, and why this is  exactly the Presiding Officer the Constitution and the Senate rules  require.   As a fallback, President Trump and his lawyers may argue today that  he should get a free pass on inciting an armed insurrection against the  United States Government and endangering Congress because, as he would  put it, this impeachment is somehow unconstitutional.   So far as I understand it, from reading the pleadings in this case,  this defense involves cobbling together a bunch of meritless legal  arguments, all of them attempting to focus on substance rather than  jurisdiction and insisting that these kitchen-sink objections lead the  Senate to not try the case.   Since they may raise these points, at this juncture I feel obliged,  really, to address them.   He may argue, for example, that he didn't receive enough process in  the House, even though the House proceedings are more like a grand jury  action, which is followed later by trial in the Senate, with a full  presentation of evidence; even though the evidence of his high crimes  and misdemeanors is overwhelming and supported by a huge public record;  even though we are going t put that evidence before you at this trial;  and even though he had a full and fair opportunity to respond to it  before all of you; even though hundreds of others involved in the  events of January 6 have already been charged for their role in the  attacks that the President incited; and even though we invited him to  voluntarily come here and testify and tell his story, a request, as you  know, that his lawyers immediately refused, presumably because they  understood what would happen if he were to testify under oath.    Regardless, President Trump's process arguments are not only wrong on  their own terms, but they are also completely irrelevant to the  question of whether you should hold this trial. That question is  answered by the Constitution, and the answer is yes.   In addition, separate from his due process complaints, President  Trump and his counsel--particularly his counsel--have both said on TV  that to  [[Page S596]]  counter the undisputed evidence of what actually happened in this case,  you will see video clips. They will show video clips of other  politicians, including Democratic politicians, using what they consider  incendiary language.   Apparently, they think this will establish some sort of equivalency  or that it will show, in contrast, that President Trump's statements at  the Save America rally weren't so bad.   Like so much of what President Trump's lawyers might say today, that  is a gimmick. It is a parlor game, meant to inflame partisan hostility  and play on our divisions.   So let me be crystal clear. President Trump was not impeached because  the words he used, viewed in isolation, without context, were beyond  the pale. Plenty of other politicians have used strong language. But  Donald J. Trump was President of the United States. He sought to  overturn a Presidential election that had been upheld by every single  court to consider it. He spent months insisting to his base that the  only way he could lose was a dangerous, wide-ranging conspiracy against  them and America itself.   He relentlessly attempted to persuade his followers that the peaceful  transfer of power that was taking place in the Capitol was an  abomination that had to be stopped at all costs.   He flirted with groups like the Proud Boys, telling them to ``stand  back and stand by,'' while endorsing violence and sparking death  threats to his opponents.   He summoned an armed, angry, and dangerous crowd that wanted to keep  him in power and was widely reported to be poised on a hair trigger for  violence at his direction.   He then made his heated statements in circumstances where it was  clear, where it was foreseeable, that those statements would spark  extraordinary, imminent violence.   He then failed to defend the Capitol, the Congress, and the Vice  President during the insurrection, engaging in extraordinary  dereliction of duty and desertion of duty that was only possible  because of the high office he held.   He issued statements during the insurrection targeting the Vice  President and reiterating the very same lies about the election that  had launched the violence in the first place.   And he issued a tweet 5 hours after the Capitol was sacked in which  he sided with the bad guys.   We all know that context matters, that office and meaning and intent  and consequences matter. Simply put, it matters when and where and how  we speak. The oaths we have sworn and the power we hold matter.   President Trump was not impeached because he used words that the  House decided are forbidden or unpopular. He was impeached for inciting  armed violence against the Government of the United States of America.   This leads me to a few final thoughts about why it is so important  for you to hear this case, as authorized and as, indeed, required by  our history and by the Constitution.   President Trump's lawyers will say, I expect, that you should dismiss  his case so that the country can ``move on.'' They will assert that  this impeachment is partisan, and that the spirit of bipartisanship and  bipartisan cooperation requires us to drop the case and march forward  in unity.   With all due respect, every premise and every conclusion of that  argument is wrong.   Just weeks ago--weeks ago--the President of the United States  literally incited an armed attack on the Capitol, our seat of  government, while seeking to retain power by subverting an election he  lost, and then celebrated the attack.   People died. People were brutally injured. President Trump's actions  endangered every single Member of Congress, his own Vice President,  thousands of congressional staffers, and our own Capitol Police and  other law enforcement.   This was a national tragedy, a disaster for America's standing in the  world, and President Trump is singularly responsible for inciting it.   As we will prove, the attack on the Capitol was not solely the work  of extremists lurking in the shadows. Indeed, does anyone in this  Chamber honestly believe that, but for the conduct of President Trump,  that charge in the Article of Impeachment, that that attack at the  Capitol would have occurred? Does anybody believe that?   And now his lawyers will come before you and insist, even as the  Capitol is still surrounded with barbed wire and fences and soldiers,  that we should just move on, let bygones be bygones, and allow  President Trump to walk away without any accountability, any reckoning,  any consequences. That cannot be right. That is not unity. That is the  path to fear of what future Presidents could do.    So there is a good reason why this Article of Impeachment passed the  House with bipartisan support. The principles at stake belong to all  Americans through all walks of life. We have a common interest in  making clear that there are lines nobody can cross, especially the  President of the United States, and so we share an interest in this  trial where the truth can be shown and where President Trump can be  called to account for his offenses.   William Faulkner famously wrote that ``the past is never dead.'' But  this isn't even the past. This just happened. It is still happening.  Look around as you come to the Capitol and come to work. I really do  not believe that our attention span is so short, that our sense of duty  so frail, our factional loyalty so all-consuming, that the President  can provoke an attack on Congress itself and get away with it just  because it occurred near the end of his term.   After a betrayal like this, there cannot be unity without  accountability. And this is exactly what the Constitution calls for.  The Framers' original understanding, this Chamber's own precedent, and  the very words used in the Constitution all confirm unquestionably,  indisputably, that President Trump must stand trial for his high crimes  and misdemeanors against the American people.   We must not, we cannot continue down the path of partisanship and  division that has turned the Capitol into an armed fortress.   Senators, it now falls to you to bring our country together by  holding this trial and, once all the evidence is before you, by  delivering justice.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, Mr. President, to close, I want to say  something personal about the stakes of this decision whether President  Trump can stand trial and be held to account for inciting insurrection  against us.   This trial is personal indeed for every Senator, for every Member of  the House, every manager, all of our staff, the Capitol Police, the  Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police, the National Guard, the  maintenance and custodial crews, the print journalists and TV people  who were here, and all of our families and friends. I hope this trial  reminds America how personal democracy is and how personal is the loss  of democracy too.   Distinguished Members of the Senate, my youngest daughter, Tabitha,  was there with me on Wednesday, January 6. It was the day after we  buried her brother, our son Tommy, the saddest day of our lives. Also  there was my son-in-law Hank, who is married to our oldest daughter,  Hannah, and I consider him a son, too, even though he eloped with my  daughter and didn't tell us what they were going to do. But it was in  the middle of COVID-19.   But the reason they came with me that Wednesday, January 6, was  because they wanted to be together with me in the middle of a  devastating week for our family, and I told them I had to go back to  work because we were counting electoral votes that day on January 6. It  was our constitutional duty. And I invited them instead to come with me  to witness this historic event, the peaceful transfer of power in  America. And they said they heard that President Trump was calling on  his followers to come to Washington to protest, and they asked me  directly: Would it be safe? Would it be safe? And I told them: Of  course it should be safe. This is the Capitol.   Steny Hoyer, our majority leader, had kindly offered me the use of  his office on the House floor because I was one of the managers that  day and we were going through our grief. So Tabitha and Hank were with  me in Steny's office as colleagues dropped by to console us about the  loss of our middle child, Tommy, our beloved Tommy.   Mr. Neguse and Mr. Cicilline actually came to see me that day. Dozens  of Members--lots of Republicans, lots of Democrats--came to see me, and  I felt  [[Page S597]]  a sense of being lifted up from the agony, and I won't forget their  tenderness.   Through the tears, I was working on a speech to the floor when we  would all be together in joint session, and I wanted to focus on unity  when we met in the House. I quoted Abraham Lincoln's famous 1878 Lyceum  speech, where he said that if division and destruction ever come to  America, it won't come from abroad, it will come from within, said  Lincoln, and in that same speech, Lincoln passionately deplored mob  violence. This was right after the murder of Elijah Lovejoy, the  abolitionist newspaper writer. Lincoln deplored mob violence, and he  deplored mob rule, and he said it would lead to tyranny and despotism  in America.   That was the speech I gave that day afte the House very graciously  and warmly welcomed me back. Tabitha and Hank came with me to the  floor, and they watched it from the Gallery, and when it was over, they  went back to that office, Steny's office off of the House floor. They  didn't know that the House had been breached yet and that an  insurrection or a riot or a coup had come to Congress, and by the time  we learned about it, about what was going on, it was too late. I  couldn't get out there to be with them in that office. And all around  me, people were calling their wives and their husbands and their loved  ones to say goodbye.    Members of Congress in the House were removing their congressional  pins so they wouldn't be identified by the mob as they tried to escape  the violence. Our new Chaplain got up and said a prayer for us, and we  were told to put our gas masks on, and then there was a sound I will  never forget, the sound of pounding on the door like a battering ram,  the most haunting sound I have ever heard, and I will never forget it.   My chief of staff, Julie Tagen, was with Tabitha and Hank, locked and  barricaded in that office, the kids hiding under the desk, placing what  they thought were their final texts and whispered phone calls to say  their goodbyes. They thought they were going to die. My son-in-law had  never even been to the Capitol before.   When they were finally rescued over an hour later by Capitol officers  and we were together, I hugged them, and I apologized, and I told my  daughter Tabitha, who is 24 and a brilliant algebra teacher in Teach  for America now, I told her how sorry I was, and I promised her that it  would not be like this again the next time she came back to the Capitol  with me. And do you know what she said? She said: Dad, I don't want to  come back to the Capitol.   Of all the terrible, cruel things I saw and I heard on that day and  since then, that one hit me the hardest, that and watching someone use  an American flagpole, with the flag still on it, to spear and pummel  one of our police officers, ruthlessly, mercilessly tortured by a pole  with a flag on it that he was defending with his very life.   People died that day. Officers ended up with head damage and brain  damage. People's eyes were gouged. An officer had a heart attack. An  officer lost three fingers that day. Two officers have taken their own  lives.   Senators, this cannot be our future. This cannot be the future of  America. We cannot have Presidents inciting and mobilizing mob violence  against our government and our institutions because they refuse to  accept the will of the people under the Constitution of the United  States. Much less can we create a new January exception in our  precious, beloved Constitution that prior generations have died for and  fought for, so that corrupt Presidents have several weeks to get away  with whatever it is they want to do. History does not support a January  exception in any way, so why would we invent one for the future?   We close, Mr. President.                                    Recess
