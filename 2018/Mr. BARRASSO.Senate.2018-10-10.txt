 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  brief statement before the rollcall is taken.    Mr. President, it is time to vote on America's Water  Infrastructure Act.   I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware, the senior Senator,  Mr. Carper, for his great contributions to this piece of legislation.   It is an important bill that has broad bipartisan, bicameral support.  There are 95 groups that have endorsed it. They represent a broad  cross-section of stakeholders from a wide variety of backgrounds. From  the Sierra Club to the American Petroleum Institute to the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce, they all agree that this important infrastructure  legislation is good for our country, good for our communities, good for  our economy, and good for our environment. The Wyoming Wool Growers  Association, the Arkansas Rural Water Association, and the Milwaukee  Metropolitan Sewerage District have all united in praise for a bill  that will help all 50 States.   The water infrastructure bill passed our committee 21 to nothing, and  it passed the House with a unanimous voice vote. It is time to send it  to the President for his signature. I would just ask our Members to  join us in supporting this important bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Mr. President, along with Ranking Member Carper, I ask unanimous  consent to have an explanatory statement to accompany S. 3021,  America's Water Infrastructure Act, printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Senate Explanatory Statement to Accompany S. 3021, America's Water                         Infrastructure Act of 2018         The following explanatory statement from the Senate       supplements and provides additional views on the Managers'       Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying S. 3021: America's       Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA), that was submitted       as part of the Congressional Record during consideration in       the House of Representatives on September 13, 2018.                                 section 1144         Section 1144 on Levee Safety Initiative Reauthorization       extends by five years the authorization of appropriations for       the National Levee Safety Program, which includes the       committee on levee safety, inventory and inspection of       levees, and levee safety initiative. The Senate Managers urge       the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to improve the       current levels of levee safety program transparency and local       levee sponsor involvement.        By law and policy, local levee sponsors assure the day-to-      day performance of levee systems. As such, local sponsors       typically maintain abundant familiarity with localized flood       and levee system conditions as well as local risk management       and communication needs. For the levee safety program to be       successful in achieving cost-beneficial flood damage       reduction, the Corps must to the maximum extent practicable       involve local sponsor expertise and rely on scientifically       sound and technically rigorous analysis. The Senate Managers       are aware of internal guidance drafted by the Corps to direct       its district offices to engage public sponsors as       participants in all levee safety program activities. The       Corps is encouraged to execute this directive fully so that       local sponsors and affected citizens derive maximum benefit       from the levee safety program.        The Senate Managers arc additionally concerned about the       agency's decision to formulate and publicize Levee Safety       Action Classification (LSAC) assignments for levee systems in       the absence of site-specific solutions and corresponding cost       estimates. It is difficult to perform effective risk       characterization and communication about levee systems in the       absence of identified corrective actions and their associated       costs and benefits. The levee safety program must improve       flood protection by driving requisite cooperation with local       sponsors, transparency, objectivity, rigorous technical       justification, and development of actual solutions that focus       on the imperative of identifying cost-beneficial, engineered       solutions. The Corps noted in a March 2018 Levee Portfolio       Report that, ``there may be reluctance to share risk       information with the public when an immediate and viable risk       management solution has not been identified.'' The Senate       Managers urge the Corps to immediately rectify this shortfall       by cooperating with local levee sponsors to produce viable       levee system corrective actions and corresponding cost       estimates along with LSAC assignments. Given the scope and       potential impact of these levee system risk assessments,       which could involve levee accreditation status by FEMA under       the National Flood Insurance Program, the Corps should also       seek out external peer review of the reliability and       usefulness of the overall LSAC process.                                 section 1170         Section 1170 contains a drafting error that was identified       following the passage of S. 3021 as amended by the House of       Representatives. The Senate Managers intend to initiate       legislation to make a technical correction in the language of       this section to replace the words ``Arizona River Basin''       with ``Arkansas River Basin'' to ensure the work is conducted       in the Arkansas River Basin, located in Colorado and three       other States. Further, the Senate Managers ask that the Corps       prepare to implement this section as so modified pending the       correction.                                 section 1229         Section 1229 directs the Secretary to do a report on the       status of a water supply contract for Wright Patman Lake,       Texas. In addition to that provision, the Senate Managers       believe that the Secretary should implement the Department of       the Army, Civil Works Contract No. 29-68-A-0130, at Wright       Patman Lake, Texas, in an expeditious manner and in       accordance with all applicable Federal and State water laws.       This includes the acceptance and expenditure of funds       contributed by a non-Federal interest for any study required       by law to implement the contract.                                 section 1318         Section 1318 directs the Secretary of the Army to align the       schedules of and ensure coordination between the Argentine,       East Bottoms, Fairfax-Jersey Creek, and North Kansas Levees       Units, Missouri River and Tributaries at Kansas Cities,       Missouri and Kansas, project and the project for flood risk       management in Armourdale and Central Industrial District       Levee Units, Missouri River and Tributaries at Kansas Cities,       Missouri arid Kansas. It is the Senate Managers' intent that       these two flood control projects be considered to be a single       project for budgeting purposes despite separate       authorizations, and for the purposes of the Supplemental       Appropriations in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, P.L.       115-123, it is an ongoing construction project.                                 section 2010         Section 2010 provides new authority to permit a State to       require the owner or operator of certain public water systems       to assess its options for consolidation, transfer of       ownership, or other activities in order to get that system       into compliance. The Senate Managers believe there is no       requirement for systems to adhere to the results of these       assessments.                                 section 4103         Section 4103 provides technical assistance for treatment       works in the Clean Water Act (CWA). It is the Senate       Managers' view that, when determining which qualified and       experienced nonprofit organizations will provide on-site       training and technical assistance, the EPA should consult       with the relevant State and the publicly owned treatment       works to determine the forms of training and technical       assistance they believe will be most effective and       beneficial.   Additional Views of the Senate Managers on Water Resource Issues and                         the Development of S. 3021         EPA's ``Water Transfer Rule,'' 40 CFR Sec. 122.3(i),       excludes discharges from ``an activity that conveys or       connects waters of the United States without subjecting the       transferred water to intervening industrial, municipal, or       commercial use'' from the National Pollutant Discharge       Elimination System (NPDES) wastewater permitting requirements       of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC Sec. 1342. The Second Circuit       Court of Appeals held that EPA's interpretation of CWA is       reasonable and EPA is entitled to Chevron deference in       Catskill Mountain Chapter of Trout Unlimited v. EPA, 846 F.3d       492 (2nd Cir., 2017); cert denied, 138 S. CT. 1164-1165 (Feb.       26, 2018). The Supreme Court's denial of certiorari resolves       the question of whether EPA's Rule complies with the CWA.  [[Page S6747]]         The Senate Managers encourage the Secretary to conduct a       study on impediments to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'       Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (33 U.S.C.       3901 et seq.) (WIFIA) program implementation. In the study,       the Secretary should examine obstacles to the implementation       of the Corps WIFIA program and to identify all projects that       the Secretary determines are potentially viable to receive       assistance. Additionally, the study should describe any       amendments to the Act or other legislative or regulatory       changes that would improve the Secretary's ability to       implement the Corps' WIFIA program. The report should be       submitted to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of       the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives no later than       one year after enactment of AWIA 2018.        Water resources projects have historically not been able to       be completed after construction commences due to the use of       benefit-cost analyses in the budgeting of water resources       development projects. During construction, costs accrue while       benefits are not yet realized, which lowers the benefit-cost       ratio stalling projects. The Senate Managers continue to be       concerned with this matter, and ask that the Corps provide       recommendations to Congress on how to address this concern       within 180 days of enactment of this Act.        Several Chief's Reports were neither completed nor received       by Congress before negotiations closed on AWIA, and the bill       was passed by the United States House of Representatives. The       final bill did not include these projects for that reason.       The Senate Managers believe that the Corps should expedite       the completion of these reports in an expedient manner so       these projects can be included in the next Water Resources       Development Act.        The Senate Managers believe that the Secretary should       expedite the expected Chief's Report for the Souris River       Basin, Minot, North Dakota, flood risk management project       that was authorized by section 209 of the Flood Control Act       of 1966 (80 Stat. 1423).        The Senate Managers believe that the Secretary should       expedite the expected Chief's Report for the Delta Islands       and Levees, California, ecosystem restoration project. It was       authorized by a June 1, 1948, Committee on Public Works of       the Senate resolution; the resolution adopted by the       Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives on       May 8, 1948; and House Report 108-357 accompanying the Energy       and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2004 (Public Law       108-137; 117 Stat. 1827).        The Senate Managers believe that the Secretary should       expedite the expected Chief's Report for the Anacostia       Watershed, Prince George's County, Maryland, for flood       control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration. The project       was authorized by a resolution adopted by the Committee on       Public Works and Transportation of the House of       Representatives on. September 8, 1988.        The Senate Managers believe that the Secretary should       expedite the expected Chiefs Report for the Hashamomuck Cove,       New York, project for coastal storm risk management, which       was authorized in title X of division A of the Disaster       Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-2; 127 Stat.       23).        The Senate Managers encourage the Secretary to expedite the       completion of the post authorization change report (PACR) for       the Howard A. Hanson Dam, Washington project for water supply       and ecosystem restoration. This project was authorized by       section 204 of the Flood Control Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 180)       and modified by section 101(b)(15) of WRDA 1999.        The Senate Managers encourage the Secretary to expedite the       completion of the PACR for the Port Pierce, Florida, shore       protection and harbor mitigation project. The project was       authorized by section 301 of the River and Harbor Act of 1965       (79 Stat. 1092), section 102 of the River and Harbor Act of       1968 (82 Stat. 732), and section 506(a)(2) of the Water       Resources Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3757), and       modified by section 313 of the Water Resources Development       Act of 1999 (113 Stat. 301).        The Senate Managers encourage the Secretary to expedite the       completion of the PACR for the Port of Iberia navigation       project, authorized by section 1001(25) of WRDA 2007 (121       Stat. 1053; 128 Stat. 1351).        The Senate Managers encourage the Secretary to expedite the       completion of PACR for the Wrightsville Beach, North       Carolina, hurricane and storm damage risk reduction project.       It was authorized by section 203 of the Flood Control Act of       1962 (76 Stat. 1182) and section 501 of WRDA 1986 (100 Stat.       4135).        The Senate Managers also encourage the Secretary to       expedite the completion of the PACR for the Carolina Beach,       North Carolina, hurricane and storm damage risk reduction       that was authorized by section 203 of the Flood Control Act       of 1962 (76 Stat. 1182).        The Senate Managers note that a number of environmental       infrastructure projects were unable to be included in the       final text of AWIA due to the statutory requirements of the       project vetting process established in WRDA 2014. As noted in       the Joint Managers Statement on September 13, 2018, AWIA       amends the WRDA 2014 project vetting process to allow for the       consideration of environmental infrastructure projects       prospectively. Although the requirements of WRDA 2014 limited       the consideration of environmental infrastructure projects       during the development of S. 3021, the Senate Managers       encourage the Corps to vet such projects using the updated       review process and resubmit them for inclusion in the next       water resources authorization.        Though not authorized in S. 3021, the Senate Managers have       also agreed to request and support a National Academies study       on the Rio Grande River Basin. Such study should examine the       Rio Grande River Basin as a holistic system to better       understand how the Corps should manage this river system in       the face of extreme weather events to better meet water needs       of the region. The National Academies should conduct an       evaluation of the capacity, operation and state of existing       basin reservoirs; look for opportunities to promote water       conservation through operation, regulation or physical       improvements of the reservoirs; and examine the impacts of       reservoir operation and management on species and habitats to       the region. The study is expected to provide recommendations       for future management scenarios and recommendations in       accordance with the Rio Grande Compact to assist in       establishing more flexible operation procedures to meet the       water needs of the Rio Grande River Basin. The Corps is       encouraged to initiate this study with the National Academies       as soon as practicable.     I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
