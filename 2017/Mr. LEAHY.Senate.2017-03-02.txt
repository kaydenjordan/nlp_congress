 Mr. President, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development plays a vital role ensuring that all Americans have access  to safe affordable housing. Affordable housing should not be a  political issue; it is a moral issue. Programs like Section 8 and the  Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, Program keep families in their  homes and support and maintain affordable housing. That is not up for  debate.   I am disappointed that President Trump did not look to our  knowledgeable housing advocates across the country to identify a  qualified, experienced nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department  of Housing and Urban Development and instead nominated Dr. Ben Carson  to this important position. In testimony before the Senate Banking  Committee, Dr, Carson, like many nominees, said the right things. He  made the right promises. I want to believe that he will fulfill those  commitments.   Programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban  Development keep shelter over the heads of our Nation's struggling and  low-income families. They combat homelessness among adults and children  alike by building and maintaining affordable housing and helping  families buy their first homes. I am proud of the progress we have made  in Vermont and across the Nation through programs implemented by the  Department of Housing and Urban Deveropment. During his confirmation  hearing, Dr. Carson testified to the crucial role of rental assistance  programs. He pledged to be an advocate for funding for housing  assistance programs. He turned away from his previous call for a 10- percent across-the-board cut to housing programs. I hope that Dr.  Carson will fulfill these commitments.   I continue to have concerns regarding Dr. Carson's seeming animosity  toward the affirmatively furthering fair housing, AFFH rule, which he  called a ``failed socialist experiment'' in an op-ed in the Washington  Times. While Dr. Carson tried to minimize those comments in his  hearing, I remain concerned that Dr. Carson doesn't understand the AFFH  rule. This rule asks cities and towns receiving Federal dollars to look  at their housing patterns to identify racial bias and to take action to  rectify any bias they find. Dr. Carson has called it social  engineering. I call it social justice and support the examination of  policies to promote equality and eliminate discrimination. During his  confirmation hearing, he pledged to enforce our fair housing laws. I  believe this includes upholding the AFFH.   I am concerned that Dr. Carson lacks the necessary experience to  successfully serve as our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  He will be confirmed, of that there is no doubt. I hope that Dr. Carson  will work with both sides of the aisle to further the mission of the  Department, strengthen the successful programs that keep families in  their homes, build and support and maintain affordable housing in  Vermont and across the Nation, and help first-time home buyers realize  their homeownership goals.    Mr. President, I will speak briefly, as I know the  distinguished senior Senator from Alaska is waiting to speak.   I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.    Every day we learn more about the troubling connections  between the Russian Government and both President Trump's  administration and his campaign, but last night kind of topped  everything--a revelation that Attorney General Sessions met with  Russian officials during the height of the Presidential campaign, which  raises a new level of alarm.   One of the reasons is, we now know the Attorney General, under oath,  misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to my direct question  about his contacts with Russian officials. I asked then-Senator  Sessions if he had  [[Page S1549]]  been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian  Government about the 2016 election. His answer was unequivocal. He said  no. He provided a similarly misleading response to Senator Franken,  saying that he was ``not aware'' of any connections between the Trump  campaign and the Russian Government.   Especially those of us who are lawyers, and who have had a chance to  serve as attorney general or as prosecutors in our States, know it is  an egregious breach of public trust that Attorney General Sessions has  not recused himself from this investigation. I think everybody would  agree he has to recuse himself. Of course, as this goes on, the  question now arises: Has he perjured himself?   In response to these reports, the Attorney General claims that he  ``never met Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.'' That  is a wholly inadequate response. The Attorney General was a top adviser  to the Trump campaign. He took a private, undisclosed meeting with the  Russian Ambassador during the height of concerns about Russian  involvement in our election. Think about it. There are reports  everywhere about concerns about Russian involvement in the election of  the United States, and he has an undisclosed meeting with the Russian  Ambassador.   He also met with the Russian Ambassador during an event at the  Republican National Convention. One would think, at the Republican  National Convention, it is possible that politics might be discussed.  Now, if the Attorney General thinks his explanation is sufficient after  he misled Congress about these contacts, of course, he is mistaken. I  don't say that as a Democrat. I think everybody would agree to that.  What I worry about is that the Attorney General is only the latest  Trump administration official who has attempted to mask his contacts  with the Kremlin.   The President's first National Security Advisor lied to the Vice  President about his communications with the Russian Ambassador. He only  resigned after the media reported how he had lied to Vice President  Pence, and even that was weeks after the President had been informed.  He had to leave only when it became public. The President's Chief of  Staff attempted to use the FBI--which, of course, would be in violation  of Justice Department policies--to suppress news reports about Russian  contacts. I have been here through seven previous Presidents-- Republicans and Democrats. You would assume they would play by the  rules. This administration seems to want to make up the rules.   My concern is not just what the administration might be doing; my  concern is about Russia. We are, I believe strongly, the greatest  democracy history has known. We are the longest existing democracy in  history, and now we have Russia meddling and trying to undermine our  democracy. Every American should worry about that. Every American  should be frightened, not just concerned but frightened. It is an  attack on our democracy. This is one of the most disturbing national  security challenges facing our country. Russian President Putin ordered  a multifaceted campaign that was aimed at helping Donald Trump win and  undermining public faith in our election. That should alarm and outrage  everybody no matter what party one belongs to.   We didn't hear a word about it in the President's speech on Tuesday  during the joint session of Congress. In fact, the President's only  reaction has been to disparage American investigators, to disparage the  intelligence community, to cast journalists who report on this as  ``enemies of the American people.'' Journalists are not enemies of the  American people. Russia is the enemy of the American people. Putin is  the enemy of the American people. Do not cast our journalists, do not  cast our investigators, do not cast our intelligence people, do not  cast those who dare speak out as being enemies of America. Point to the  real enemies--Vladimir Putin and those he controls.   It is about time we take this seriously. I have been here 42 years. I  have never seen such a perfidious threat to our democracy than what we  are seeing in Vladimir Putin, and my concern is the administration does  not call it out for what it is. We Americans deserve to know the facts.  We deserve a full and fair investigation. We deserve one that is free  from any political influence.   I have repeatedly called on Attorney General Sessions, who was one of  President Trump's top advisers during the campaign, to recuse himself  and appoint a special counsel to conduct the investigation. Earlier  this week, he said: ``I would recuse myself on anything that I should  recuse myself on.'' This morning, he said he would recuse himself  ``whenever it's appropriate.'' This would be a ludicrous response from  a law clerk at the Department of Justice. From the Attorney General, it  is dissembling.   Recusal is not optional here. It is required by very clear Justice  Department regulations. It is required to maintain at least a semblance  of integrity in this investigation. The Attorney General has to recuse  himself because, as stated clearly in Department rules, he is obviously  ``closely identified'' with the President due to his ``service as a  principal adviser.'' That is the rule, and that is the rule whether it  is a Republican or a Democratic administration. It describes his  relationship with the President.   The investigation has to be led by someone who, in reality and in  appearance, is impartial and removed from politics. That does not  describe someone who was in the trenches of a political campaign with  the subjects of the investigation while they were allegedly engaged in  the very activity under investigation. It does not describe somebody  who misled Congress--who misled the Republican-led Senate Judiciary  Committee--about his own activities that have been implicated in the  investigation.   This is not a close call. We know Russia is doing everything to  undermine our democracy. Let's stand up for America. Let's do what is  best for our country. The Attorney General should start by stepping  aside. Then what we need is an independent investigation, and we need  answers.   I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska for her  indulgence.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to explain my opposition to the  nominations of Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the Interior and Rick  Perry to be the Secretary of Energy. I have closely reviewed their  records, testimony, and responses to questions for the record.                          confirmation of ryan zinke    Madam President, the Secretary of the Interior is one of the most  important jobs in the Federal Government and has a far reach when it  comes to coordinating our Federal policy in the 50 States and U.S.  Territories for our public lands, parks, and cherished natural  resources. The Secretary and the Department of Interior are tasked with  using sound science to manage and sustain America's lands, water,  wildlife, and energy resources, while honoring our Nation's vital  obligations and responsibilities to tribal nations. The Secretary of  Interior also coordinates Federal assistance to the Freely Associated  States of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the  Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau under the Compacts of Free  Association. There are few Cabinet positions with such a wide range of  management and organization.   Any nominee for this position should be selected for their commitment  to protecting our precious resources, as well as their dedication to  uphold and enforce our environmental laws.   After reviewing Mr. Zinke's record, there is little doubt that he is  dedicated to public service and that he has a strong connection to the  outdoors. However, the Secretary of the Interior has a great  responsibility as the leading steward of our majestic public lands, the  champion of our great tribal nations, and the manager and defender of  our diverse wildlife. I fear that Mr. Zinke may not be fully prepared  to set aside some of his personal views on the management of our  resources and consider the views of all Americans as we debate critical  natural resources issues.   I enjoyed learning that Mr. Zinke is an admirer of President Teddy  Roosevelt, a point that has been repeated countless times, and I was  pleased that he agrees that, yes, President Roosevelt did get it right  when he placed millions of acres of lands under Federal protection.  However, I hope that Mr. Zinke will not only study the work that  President Roosevelt did to instill a conservation ethic in this  country, but will look more broadly at other individuals whose  steadfast commitment and dedication to conservation and historic  preservation have left their mark in Vermont and across the country.   For instance, Laurance Rockefeller made significant contributions to  the American conservation movement that had a lasting impact on the  American landscape. The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical  Park in Woodstock, VT, honors not only Rockefeller's dedication to  conservation, but is also the first national park to tell the story of  conservation history and the evolving nature of land stewardship in  America. Conservation of the environment and recreational development  was a passion to which he dedicated his life. In addition to his work  in Vermont, he was instrumental in the creation and development of the  Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and the Virgin Islands National  Park on the island of St. John. These three national parks could not be  more different, but they are each spectacular pieces of our natural  heritage. This heritage that would not exist today and be available for  the public to enjoy, had it not been for the vital work of Laurance  Rockefeller and the Federal investments that have been made in these  important public lands.   I hope Mr. Zinke will also study and hopefully visit the Appalachian  National Scenic Trail, which carves its way not only through Vermont,  but 13 other States as well. This trail is an amazing footpath for the  people that traverses over 2,100 miles through wild forests, towns,  valleys, and mountaintops, and connects a myriad of through-hikers and  day hikers to our scenic landscape. All of them are able to enjoy the  important Federal investments in this trail, which is maintained by the  countless hours of work done every year by devoted volunteers like the  Green Mountain Club in Vermont.   Work to build and maintain the Appalachian Trail is not static, nor  is it complete. There continue to be important investments needed  through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF, to acquire land and  conservation easements to safeguard the trail. There is much needed  trail maintenance that should be included as part of any infrastructure  bill the Senate considers. This work is shovel-ready and will have a  considerable impact in supporting our outdoor economy on which Vermont  is so dependent.   Mr. Zinke should also seek out expertise and guidance from the past  Secretaries of the Interior who have dedicated their lives to this  work. I hope he will study the exit memo that Secretary Jewell prepared  on the Department's Record of Progress and the moral imperative the  Department has to positively impact our American economy, our rural  communities and cities, and ultimately, the well-being of our planet.   As Secretary of Interior, Mr. Zinke will oversee a number of ongoing  debates concerning our fragile public lands, the protection of  endangered species, and how we respond to climate change. I know that  there is no single solution that can answer the different land  management issues facing each region of our country. Many stakeholders  are constantly engaging the Interior Department and the Senate with a  wide variety of views on how we should protect, access, and use our  natural resources. In Vermont, we are deeply concerned about the  pressure being placed on our natural resources from rapid growth and  climate change.   I heard from hundreds of Vermonters concerned about Mr. Zinke's  nomination and worried that our environmental standards and laws will  not be enforced for our lands, air, water, and threatened species under  his leadership. His record has shown an opposition to policies that  protect valuable rivers and streams from polluting coal runoff and a  willingness to weaken historic laws such as President Teddy Roosevelt's  Antiquities Act. He even authored a bill that sought to obstruct  efforts by the Department of the Interior to review and modernize  management of our Federal energy resources and ensure that taxpayers  are fairly compensated for their sale. Taxpayers deserve a Secretary of  the Interior who will work to support the protection of our shared  Federal resources 100 percent of the time, not one who will actively  work to weaken or dismantle the powers of protection invested in this  Department.   Based on that record, I voted against his nomination. Nonetheless,  now that Mr. Zinke is the Secretary, I want him to know that I am  committed to working closely with him on a variety of issues that are  important to Vermonters and all Americans. I will work with him to  foster consensus not only in New England, but throughout the country.  As the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and a member of  the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to working  with him to ensure that we protect our Federal lands and continue the  important conservation ethic of Teddy Roosevelt to permanently protect  our beautiful and fragile natural resources, while also addressing new  challenges posed by climate change.   Madam President, with respect to the nomination of Rick Perry to be  the Secretary of the Department of Energy, hundreds of Vermonters have  written to me in opposition. They were concerned that under his  leadership we will halt the forward progress we have made towards a  responsible energy strategy for the future of our country. Not only did  Governor Perry make headlines for famously proposing to abolish the  Department of Energy, he lacks a background or any true experience on  the complex scientific and technical issues in the Department of  Energy's portfolio. This agency must be focused on addressing our  energy and environmental challenges through transformative science and  technology solutions; yet Mr. Perry expedited the permitting of coal- fired electric generating plants and filed suit challenging  [[Page S1558]]  the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases  significantly endanger public health. How can we trust him to lead the  Energy Department?   I was pleased that, during his confirmation hearing, Governor Perry  apologized for suggesting that the entire Department of Energy should  be abolished. However, he has yet to say that he will fight to maintain  important offices within the Department, such as the Office of  Electricity and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. I  find it hard to see how we can pursue an ``all-of-the-above'' energy  strategy called for by the administration if so much of the  Department's capabilities are targeted for elimination. By supporting  research around wind, solar, and efficiency, offering loan guarantees  for innovative demonstration projects, and providing expertise and  support to the private sector in commercializing new research we can  create American jobs and grow the national economy. Conversely, if we  turn our back on the future, we are ceding these important and fast  growing fields of research and production of renewable energy  technologies to China, the European Union, and other countries at a  critical time. That would be a monumental mistake to haunt our economy  for many years.   Earlier today, I had the chance to talk to a Vermont company that is  closely watching the work of the Energy Dpartment to advance America's  clean energy revolution. Northern Power Systems in Barre, VT, has been  designing and developing wind turbines for almost 40 years and offers  support services for energy generation needs around the world. Last  year, they received an award for their increase in exports, but rather  than selling to an international market they would rather see their  sales here in the U.S. take off so that they can create more American  jobs to manufacture American-made wind turbines. Turbines that should  be installed here to utilize this reliable, abundant, and free resource  to lower energy costs for Americans.   It is troubling that Mr. Perry has taken such an aggressive stance  against the Department of Energy and dismissed large parts of its  mission. I hope that he will devote himself to learning everything he  can about the diverse work of the Department and surround himself with  some of the best public servants and technical experts he can find.   The last Secretary of Energy, Dr. Ernest Moniz, prepared two  documents that I am hopeful Mr. Perry will study closely. First, the  Quadrennial Energy Review provides a broad review of federal energy  policy in the context of economic, environmental, occupational,  security, and health and safety priorities. The Department also  prepared an extensive suite of analyses to accompany the Quadrennial  Energy Review that I know would serve Mr. Perry well as he tries to  understand the wide array of issues that will come before him at the  Department.   I would also recommend that he review the exit memo Secretary Moniz  prepared, which highlights the responsibilities and opportunities for  the Department's enduring service to the Nation as our leading science,  technology, and innovation agency. The Department has an extraordinary  span of responsibilities from energy and the environment, to cyber  security, science and national security, and it must collaborate with  other agencies like the Defense Department and our intelligence  community.   I remain committed to supporting and protecting the essential mission  of the Department of Energy in order to move us forward with 2lst  century jobs and make needed investments in our electricity grid, clean  energy, and energy efficiency that will save American consumers and  businesses money.    Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to  the fact that it has now been 1 year since the assassination of Berta  Caceres, a renowned indigenous Honduran environmental activist who  devoted her life--and ultimately lost her life--defending the land,  water, and other natural resources of the Lenca people.   After an initial attempt by the Honduran police and even some high- ranking officials to falsely portray the murder as a crime of passion,  which is a not uncommon ploy to cover up official complicity in such  cases, eight men have been arrested, including one active-duty and two  retired military officers.   Although Honduran officials have denied any government involvement in  Ms. Caceres's murder and downplayed the arrest of Major Mariano Diaz  who was promptly discharged from the army, there are reasons to be  skeptical.   Diaz, a decorated special forces veteran, was appointed chief of army  intelligence in 2015, and at the time of the murder he was reportedly  on track  [[Page S1573]]  for promotion to lieutenant colonel. Another suspect, Lieutenant  Douglas Giovanny Bustillo, reportedly joined the military on the same  day as Diaz. They served together and apparently remained in contact  after Bustillo retired in 2008.   It is particularly noteworthy and troubling that, according to press  reports, both Diaz and Bustillo may have received military training  from the United States.   A third suspect, Sergeant Henry Javier Hernandez, was a former  special forces sniper who had worked under the command of Diaz. He may  also have worked as an informant for military intelligence after  leaving the army in 2013.   According to press reports, First Sergeant Rodrigo Cruz, a former  army officer who deserted after Caceres's death and remains in hiding,  said the Honduran military high command gave a hit list with the names  and photographs of activists to eliminate to the commander of the  Xatruch multiagency taskforce, to which Cruz's unit belonged, and that  Caceres's name was on the list. It sounds a lot like the death squads  in El Salvador in the 1980s.   Five civilians with no known military record have also been arrested.  They include Sergio Rodriguez, a manager for the Agua Zarca  hydroelectric dam that Berta Caceres had long opposed.   That project is being led by Desarrollos Energeticos SA, Desa, with  international financing and the strong backing of the Honduran  Government. According to press reports, the company's president,  Roberto David Castillo Mejia, is a former military intelligence  officer, and its secretary, Roberto Pacheco Reyes, is a former justice  minister. Desa employed former Lieutenant Bustillo as head of security  between 2013 and 2015.   Ms. Caceres had reported multiple death threats linked to her  campaign against the dam, including several from Desa employees. The  Honduran Government largely ignored her requests for protection, and  Desa continues to deny any involvement in the murder.   It is inconceivable to anyone who knows Honduras that this outrageous  crime was carried out by these individuals without orders from above.  The question is whether the investigation will identify the  intellectual authors, which almost never happens in Honduras. In fact,  as Global Witness, the U.S. Department of State, and others have  documented, there have been scores of killings of environmental  activists in Honduras that have never been credibly investigated and  for which no one has been punished.   I have no doubt that one of the reasons this case has progressed at  all is because U.S. law enforcement experts, supported by the U.S.  Embassy, have assisted in the investigation, and because of the efforts  of Honduran Attorney General Oscar Fernando Chincilla.   However, as I have said before, in Honduras where impunity is the  norm, a case of such domestic and international importance should also  be the subject of a parallel independent investigation. The obvious  entities to convene such an inquiry are the Inter-American Commission  on Human Rights and the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption  and Impunity in Honduras, MACCIH; yet the Honduran Government continues  to reject such an inquiry.   The United States and Honduras have a troubled history; yet we and  the Honduran people share many interests. We want to continue to help  Honduras address the deeply rooted poverty, inequality, violence, and  impunity that have caused so much suffering and hardship and  contributed to the migration of tens of thousands of Hondurans,  including children, to the United States.   But for this Senator, that requires solving the Berta Caceres case  and undertaking credible investigations and prosecutions of the  shocking number of assassinations of other social activists,  journalists, and human rights defenders in recent years. It means  Honduran officials publicly affirming and defending the legitimate role  of such activists, who in the past have been ignored, threatened, and  treated as legitimate targets. Only then will it be clear that the  Honduran Government is committed to justice and that our assistance  will achieve lasting results.   The Department of State needs to thoroughly and transparently  investigate whether Major Diaz and Lieutenant Bustillo were in fact  trained by the United States. If so, the Congress and the Honduran  people deserve to know how they were selected, what training they  received, and any steps taken to improve the process of screening  potential trainees and to monitor the conduct of those who have  received U.S. training.   Finally, as I have said before, as long as the Agua Zarca project and  others like it continue over the objections of indigenous people whose  livelihoods and cultures are intrinsically linked to the rivers that  are impacted, the confrontations and violence will continue. The  Honduran Government, like other governments in that region, needs to  change its way of doing business in areas where the rights and  interests of indigenous people have long been violated and ignored.   Given the shameful history of the Agua Zarca project it should be  cancelled. Other hydroelectric and extractive projects in indigenous  territories should be reconsidered by the Honduran Government and  allowed to proceed only after a transparent process based on the free,  prior, informed consent of affected communities.                            ____________________
