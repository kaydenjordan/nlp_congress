 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous materials on H.R. 729.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, today I am truly honored to bring to the floor a  bipartisan bill championed by many colleagues from throughout the  country and many individuals and organizations passionately committed  to our oceans, lakes, and coastlines and to the ecosystems,  communities, and economies that depend on them.   I especially want to recognize my colleagues who introduced and  advocated the measures that are incorporated in this bill:  Representatives Kilmer, Huffman, Wittman, Quigley, Pallone, Pingree,  Norton, Carbajal, Ruppersberger, and Young.   This bill consolidates 10 bipartisan bills, cosponsored by a total of  24 of my minority colleagues, that tackle the crisis and challenge of  our time: climate change.   Climate change, of course, knows no partisan, country, or other  manmade boundaries. It indiscriminately threatens us all, but it is  especially insidious as it applies to our world's oceans, lakes, and  coastlines.   Earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  issued a special report on ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate,  making crystal clear that our oceans and coasts are under mortal  threat.   Over 40 percent of Americans live in coastal counties right on our  oceans and lakes. These communities not only account for nearly half of  our U.S. gross domestic product, but they are on the front lines of  climate change and need resources today to help prepare for and respond  to the effects of climate change, including flooding, sea level rise,  severe weather, coastal erosion, and changing water conditions that  affect ecosystems and fish populations.   They need help, and as we help them, we help all of us. We know from  a generation of data now that every dollar invested in predisaster  mitigation saves at least $6 in recovery costs. H.R. 729 includes  bipartisan measures that will do this in four ways.   First, it will improve coastal resilience and economic enhancement by  making several important updates to the Coastal Zone Management Act, a  then-revolutionary law from 1972 to establish a partnership between the  Federal Government and coastal and Great Lakes States. It will also  help communities implement climate-resilient living shoreline projects  that use natural materials to protect communities and ecosystems  instead of hard or armored walls and infrastructure that we know are  less effective.   Second, it will reinforce fish habitat conservation and fisheries  research. It will also authorize steady funding for the U.S. Geological  Survey to conduct science and research activities to support fishery  management in the Great Lakes and to restore the loss of basic fishery  science capabilities and accelerate implementation of new technology.   Third, recognizing that responsible management of the oceans, coasts,  and Great Lakes relies on robust data, this bill will reauthorize the  integrated coastal and ocean observation system and, for the first  time, formally authorize the digital coast partnership, both of which  are led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   Finally, H.R. 729 will update the National Sea Grant College Program  to ensure the United States has a strong marine and coastal science and  policy workforce so that we can continue to develop smart policy  solutions in the future.   This bipartisan bill is supported by a plethora of diverse  organizations across our country, including the Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation, the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Project, the  American Sportfishing Association, and Ocean Conservancy.   It won't, in and of itself, solve climate change. That takes a much  larger, more focused, and deliberate international effort. But it will  move our Federal policy into the present and the future as to what  risks arise for our oceans, lakes, and coasts and their communities,  and this bill is an imperative step in the difficult process we face.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues' support, and I reserve the balance  of my time.          House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                  Washington, DC, December 6, 2019.      Chairman Raul M. Grijalva,      Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2405, the ``National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act       of 2019,'' which was referred to the Committee on Natural       Resources on April 30, 2019.        In the interest of expedience in the consideration of H.R.       2405 the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will       waive formal consideration of the bill. This is, however, not       a waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Science       Committee over the subject matter contained in H.R. 2405 or       similar legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. Thank you for your cooperation       on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                   Washington, DC, December 9, 2019.      Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of H.R. 2405, the ``National Sea       Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2019,'' which was       referred solely to the Committee on Natural Resources, the       Committee on Natural Resources appreciates the decision by       the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology (``Science       Committee'') not to pursue its request for a sequential       referral of the bill as to any provisions that fall within       the Rule X jurisdiction of the Science Committee.        The Committee on Natural Resources acknowledges this action       with the mutual understanding that, in doing so, the Science       Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claims       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee on Natural Resources agrees to       include our exchange of letters in the Congressional Record.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                             Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.     Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer), who is the introducer of the bill in chief.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman), the chair of the Natural Resources Committee  Subcommittee on Water, Oceans and Wildlife.  [[Page H9973]]         Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), a valued member of our Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger).  [[Page H9974]]         Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the chair of the full Natural  Resources Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Madam Chair, I yield 90 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, first of all, I thank the members of my majority who  rose in favor of this bill as well as the few members of the minority  who did as well.   And I again thank the 24 Republicans who supported a portion of this  bill that is at least a start on the challenge of our time: climate  change and the impacts on our oceans, on our coastlines, and on our  lakes.   The ranking member complains on several fronts. The first front he  complains on is that this is just an illusion, that this is just moving  the ball nowhere at all.   I completely reject that. I completely reject the notion that  strengthening our Federal programs that are directly related to  resiliency of our coastlines, that are directly related to good science  applied to our oceans and lakes, that are directly related to finding  good, solid public-private partnerships to address the incredible  negative impacts of climate change and other causes on our oceans and  coastlines is not moving the ball forward.   In fact, I would suggest that the illusion we are talking about is  the illusion that the ranking member cares at all about these issues  because, if you look at the record of addressing these issues under the  Republican majority, that record is zero. They have not moved any balls  forward whatsoever.   And further, pardon me for distrusting the current administration,  because the ranking member complains that NOAA and other Federal  agencies are already exercising flexibility on many of these programs-- fine. Administrative flexibility is one thing, and all power to good  people and NOAA who are trying to do the right thing, but that is  different from a congressional mandate to do something.   The reason for the concern is staring us in the face. Every year of  this administration, there have been proposed disastrous budget cuts to  NOAA and other ocean-related programs. For the current fiscal year,  2020, a cut of 18 percent was restored by the House majority: cuts to  eliminate or severely decrease funding to our critical ocean  [[Page H9978]]  and coastal programs, Sea Grant, coastal zone management, National  Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, hydrographic surveys and ocean  observing, climate change research, programs that manage coral reefs  and marine mammals and sea turtles, and many more.   So pardon me if we are distrustful of this administration or of  future administrations on severely restricting the flexibility that  these programs have to administer critical needs for not only our  country, but our world.   Pardon me, but it is a congressional mandate in these areas that is  really necessary.   The ranking member and his colleagues complain that we are not  advancing climate change by a step. If they want to advance climate  change with us, then join us in a major climate change initiative; join  us in returning to the Paris climate accord; join us across the board.   The ranking member complains that no due consideration was given to  these many bills. In fact, these bills were heard; they were discussed;  and, with the exception of the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves),  there were no Republican amendments offered to any of these bills.   The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern) complains that we should  not spend more on our oceans, lakes, and coastal cities; we should not  anticipate disaster mitigation. The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves) argues that, in fact, there is not a positive cost benefit in  these programs and their funding going forward.   The citation for that information is the National Institute of  Building Sciences, based on 23 years' worth of data from FEMA, the  Economic Development Administration, and HUD.   Investments upfront for the impacts of climate change and other man- made causation to our oceans and lakes and coastlines is, in fact, a  major return to not only our communities, but to all parts of our  country.   The gentleman complains, and the minority would have you believe,  that this is a mandatory increase of over $1 billion in Federal  funding. It is not. It is discretionary, in large part, to the  Appropriations Committee.   So, as we go into the amendment process, I appreciate my colleagues'  support, and I truly hope that this can be a bipartisan bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 748,  I offer amendments en bloc under the rule.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, again, in the interests of an incredibly good bipartisan  bill and moving this bill forward, I offer this en bloc amendment,  which is a package of a number of amendments offered by colleagues that  all seek to further improve the resilience of our coastlines and of our  Great Lakes.   I applaud the sponsors of these amendments for their thoughtful  engagement on this issue and for acting to ensure that families in  their districts are safe and healthy, with productive jobs and clean  environments.   We are working to create a more sustainable, healthy planet, and this  package of bills and these amendments will move us in the right  direction.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), my colleague.    Madam Chair, again, these en bloc amendments are critical  additions and positive additions to a critical bill. These amendments  address major issues related to the harmful impacts of climate change  and  [[Page H9992]]  other man-made effects on our oceans, our coastlines, and our lakes.   For example, they single out the destruction that is being wrought,  as we speak, on our coral reefs throughout our entire country, our  coral reefs throughout the Gulf Coast, throughout Florida, and  throughout the West Coast, in Hawaii and beyond: the acidification that  has led to bleaching of these coral reefs. And as we all know, or at  least I hope we all know, as go the coral reefs, so go our oceans.   These amendments would strengthen Federal programs that address the  health of our coral reefs. These amendments go to harmful algal blooms,  which are a problem throughout our country, as well.   What can we and should we do about it as a Federal coordinated  effort? Of course, we should do something about that.   These amendments would strengthen this bill. These amendments would  forward a Federal-State partnership, a community partnership, to  address another harmful consequence which is killing our oceans.    These amendments would address coastal resiliency. How do we prevent  our coastlines from eroding? In my own home State of Hawaii, we have  seen significant erosion. And that is true of all of the other coasts:  significant increases in sea level over a very, very recent period of  time that has caused major erosion.   How can we adopt better overall programs that adapt to a changing  ocean and do not worsen the problem of coastal erosion? How do we do  that?   These amendments get at these issues. These are good, solid, and  positive additions that our colleagues have come up with to strengthen  a good, solid, and positive bipartisan bill.   Madam Chair, I support these amendments, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, for our majority colleagues, I deeply appreciate  my colleague's comments in support of his amendment and his  appreciation and understanding of the communities that he represents,  in terms of the impacts of climate change and other man-made causes not  only on our oceans, because we tend to focus on our oceans, but on our  lakes, to include our Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes are currently experiencing nearly record high water  levels, causing widespread erosion of beaches and property and costing  people their lives. In fact, there have been over 50 percent more  deaths in the Great Lakes in 2019 because of these dangerous conditions  compared to 2018.   These high lake levels are forecast to continue for 2020 and, in all  likelihood, beyond. Just this month, 12 Michigan State lawmakers asked  Governor Whitmer to declare a state of emergency for the Lake Michigan  shoreline because of water levels.   Resilient, living shorelines are one of the best options for the  Great Lakes communities dealing with the impacts of high lake levels,  as they are for other communities in the body of this bill.   Our majority does support my colleague's amendment to be sure that  this money does find its way to where it is most needed. I support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate my colleague's efforts  on this particular amendment, which, as he points out, is a truly  bipartisan amendment joined in by Members from the New York delegation  on a bipartisan basis. I think this illustrates a couple of different  things.   First of all, this bill and these amendments need not be partisan. In  fact, they offer one of the best avenues forward for true  bipartisanship as we confront the crisis of climate change.   Second, they illustrate that when we talk about our marine resources  and climate change, and in this bill, we focus on our oceans and tend  to think that our coastal States are those that are affected. Clearly,  it is not only our coastal States that are affected.   Many States throughout our country are directly affected by the  impacts of climate change, including New York State, in conjunction  with the Great Lakes. So this is an amendment that we can support.  Every year, we seem to hear about another toxic algal bloom in the  Great Lakes closing beaches or fisheries.   It is important that the fishery research reauthorization in this  bill include researching the impacts of harmful algal blooms because  there is a lot that is unknown about the causes of these toxic blooms  and the long-term effects in fish populations.   When we speak of fish populations in the Great Lakes, we speak not  only of the benefits of the fish populations through our natural  ecosystems in the Great Lakes and not only of recreational fisheries,  but we speak in the range of some 75,000 jobs that can be directly  attributed to the health of our fisheries in our Great Lakes. So I am  pleased to urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, again, this is a very positive, bipartisan  amendment by the Members from New York and indicates that we can, in  fact, proceed in a bipartisan way on these critical issues.   As already noted earlier in my remarks, the Great Lakes have  experienced record or near-record high levels of water this year and  are projected to continue to have high levels next year and well  beyond.   Many coastal communities and property owners in the Great Lakes are  suffering from accelerated land loss and erosion. This amendment  rightfully ensures that water level regulating practices can be a part  of coastal resilience planning.   I only regret that when it comes to our world's oceans, we don't have  the luxury of regulating sea levels in accordance with water level  regulating practices.   We support this amendment and the intent of this amendment, but I  must indicate a caution for the Record, and that is that if this  amendment leads to the uncontrolled, indiscriminate construction of  dams throughout our country, we need to be careful because dams are  double-edged swords. They can be a tremendous boon to water regulating  practices and electricity, energy, sports and fishing, and many other  concerns, but they can have unintended environmental consequences.   I would simply caution that as we go forward with the implementation  of this amendment, I hope that we pay very close attention to the sound  science behind water level regulating practices.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I applaud the sponsor of this amendment, my  colleague from the beautiful and critical Virginia coast.   Everything she said in her remarks could easily have applied to many,  many of our military installations across the country.   Of course, Hampton Roads is critical to our Nation's defense, and so  is Joint Base Pearl Harbor, the home of our Air Force and our Navy in  the Indo-Pacific, as is Marine Corps Base Kaneohe, the home of our  marines in the Indo-Pacific.   My colleague, as a member of the Committee on Armed Services, knows  full well that our military has actually taken the lead in assessing  the realistic consequences of climate change on our military  installations across the country. They deserve credit for that. They  also need help with that. My colleagues' amendment would provide them  that help and will create the partnership that we need to guarantee the  continued security and operation of our Nation's key military  installations and the family communities that depend on them.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is not a coastal resilience  amendment. This amendment has nothing to do with the underlying bill;  in fact, it was a miracle that it was ruled germane. This amendment  instead is simply an unneeded handout to oil and gas companies that  takes us in exactly the wrong direction, not only on climate change,  but on the very survival of our oceans.   We all know, and I remind everybody, that this language is the exact  language that in past Congresses was included in the other side's ocean  drilling package that would have paved the way for faster permitting of  seismic testing and ocean drilling.   Why? Because our oceans marine mammals get in the way of that.   Congress first enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act over 40 years  [[Page H9999]]  ago to protect all marine mammals in response to declines caused by  human activities, and it has worked successfully for almost all of  those years. The Marine Mammal Protection Act ensures that activities  that may result in incidental harm or take of marine mammals are  thoroughly reviewed, rather than permitted through the expedited and  inadequate process proposed by this bill.   Activities such as seismic air gun testing used for oil and gas  exploration, offshore drilling, sonar, and geophysical surveys can all  affect marine mammals. And while I sometimes hear the other side  falsely claim that these activities have not killed any marine mammals,  the best available science for decades has demonstrated that, in fact,  there are significant long-term negative impacts on several marine  mammal species that do, in fact, cause their death.   This amendment would undermine critical protections under the Marine  Mammal Protection Act by striking the conditions required for permitted  activities. It would allow for unmitigated incidental harm, that is  without the current safeguards that would allow for the, ``least  practicable impact on such species or stocks,'' among other things. Is  it too much to ask that we require the least practicable impact on such  species or stock?   It would further limit mitigation for any incidental losses and  requirements for monitoring. These legislative changes would allow  industry to continue their activities with oversight of their impacts  only if it was, ``efficient and practical.'' Efficient and practical?  Let's just give them carte blanche to gut this bill, literally and  figuratively.   Lastly, this amendment would waive requirements for take and  consultation under the Endangered Species Act, another decades-long  cornerstone of our protection of our natural species for any threatened  or endangered marine mammals. The ESA has been critical to the recovery  of several populations of marine mammals and is needed to protect other  species from extinction.   Let's keep the focus where we can focus on a bipartisan solution to  climate change as it affects our oceans, our coastlines and our lakes.  Let's keep the focus on coastal resilience, on assisting communities,  on fostering Federal-State organization partnerships, on living in the  present and the future and not in the past on the effects of climate  change.    Let's keep that focus there, rather than use this bill, this  amendment, to provide a desired handout to an industry that does not or  has not demonstrated a true understanding of its impacts on our oceans,  an industry that does need to continue to be regulated through strong  positive time-tested legislation, such as the Marine Mammal Protection  Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close after the gentleman  closes, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we understand that for some industries  interested in the exploitation of our oceans that the Marine Mammal  Protection Act is inconvenient. We understand that we ask for  limitations on the activities of those industries, which would  otherwise not demonstrate any discernible concern for our oceans. And  we reject the basic premise that that regulation is not necessary for  our oceans.   Our marine mammals deserve our protection, and we have protected  them, and we have worked through the give-and-take of legitimate  activities in the oceans where they can and should be balanced with  impacts on our marine mammals.   So, again, I respectfully submit that this particular proposal, which  has been--as the ranking member points out--thoroughly vetted in prior  Congresses, although not brought to the floor, can in fact yield a  good, solid debate. But we simply reject the position taken.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645
