 Madam Speaker, the original NAFTA has been one of the  most destructive economic forces to jobs in America. There hasn't been  a single year of trade balance since its passage.   I fought NAFTA tooth and nail when it was considered back in the  1990s. And as the Representative for working class communities from  Toledo to Cleveland, I have since joined every  [[Page H7550]]  one of my constituents in bearing witness to the devastating effects of  what some call ``free trade.''   On the campaign trail, President Trump repeatedly boasted he would  scrap NAFTA and renegotiate a better deal. But his proposal lacks  commonsense labor enforcement provisions, falls short of pressuring  companies to reshore American jobs, and it provides massive carveouts  for Big Pharma that will cause the price of prescription drugs to  skyrocket even more.   I have always been an advocate for fair trade among free people, but  NAFTA crashed the largest economy in the world--the United States--into  that of a developing nation--Mexico--without any plan to deal with the  human and economic consequences.   Madam Speaker, as currently written, the USMCA, NAFTA 2.0, continues  this failed legacy of NAFTA 1.0, and remains a failure for the American  worker. The USMCA is just NAFTA 2.0. It should be defeated.                            ____________________
