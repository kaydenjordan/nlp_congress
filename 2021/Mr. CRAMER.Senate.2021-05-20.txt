 Mr. President, I want to honor a Grand Forks  firefighter for receiving a national honor by the VFW. Saving lives is  what firefighters are called on to do as part of their job every day.  But in the case of Logan Schonart, his lifesaving act went much beyond  that.   When members of the Grand Forks Fire Department heard Rick Aamot,  their former batallion chief, was suffering from kidney disease and  needed a new kidney, they were concerned enough to look into how they  could help. Because it can take years to find a donor, they joined in  the search to find one. Schonart was among those who took a test for  compatibility, and his test showed he was a match. Having worked  together for nearly a decade before Aamot retired, Schonert thought  enough of him to step forward and offer to be his donor.   Schonert was not looking for publicity about his successful kidney  donation to Aamot, but he spoke out about it to encourage others to  consider doing the same if the opportunity presented itself. In  recognition of his generous lifesaving act, Schonart was named the 2020  North Dakota VFW Firefighter of the Year and earlier this month was  named the 2021 National VFW Firefighter of the Year. The award was  presented May 7 at the Grand Forks Fire Station.   Mr. President, I congratulate Logan Schonart on this national honor  recognizing a firefighter who exceeds professional expectations and  demonstrates community service and professional achievement. As the  2021 National VFW Firefighter of the Year, he sets an extraordinary  example for all of us demonstrating what selfless sacrifice looks  like.                            ____________________
