 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1423,  the  [[Page H7778]]  FAIR Act, which would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in  employment, consumer, and civil rights cases, restoring the rights of  consumers, workers, and small businesses to go to court.   This is about respecting the Seventh Amendment, the constitutional  right to a trial by jury, the right of every single American to get  their day in court.   This is also about public accountability. This is about ending the  ability of bad corporate actors to shield their wrongdoing and patterns  of violation from public scrutiny.   Let me be perfectly clear: Forced arbitration clauses, which are  often buried in the fine print in confusing legal jargon, put the  interests of powerful corporations over American workers and consumers.   This impacts every single one of us. Every person in this room at  some point has unknowingly ceded their rights away when entering into a  contract to buy a new car, to start a new job, or sign up for a new  credit card. This is hurting real Americans, from the elderly people  who are mistreated in nursing homes, or employees working overtime but  not getting paid, to servicemembers who are fired or not rehired after  returning from Active Duty. Very few of them are actually getting  justice.   In the last 5 years, the number of consumers who have won a monetary  award from forced arbitration averages to 382 people a year. Let me put  this into perspective: On average, more Americans get struck by  lightning every year than win a monetary award from an arbitration.   When corporations know that they can get away with such bad behavior  and shield that bad behavior from coming to light, there is absolutely  nothing incentivizing them to follow the law and treat consumers well.   It should go without saying, but this legislation is overwhelmingly  popular. Research shows that 84 percent of Americans oppose forced  arbitration.   I urge every single one of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the FAIR  Act and restore vital rights to American consumers, workers, and small  businesses.                            ____________________
