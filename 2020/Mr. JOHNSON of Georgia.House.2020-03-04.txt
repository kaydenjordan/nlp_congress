 Mr. Speaker, today indigenous environmental  activist, Berta Caceres, would have been 49 years old, but on March 2,  2016, she was viciously murdered in her own home by a coordinated  effort between greedy corporate and government thugs.   She died defending the land of the Lenca indigenous people. Berta,  along with countless other Honduran activists, was the victim of a  government wracked with corruption and impunity. Drug traffickers have  littered the highest ranks of Honduras' Government, and its military  remains weaponized against its own people, all of whom are targets of  victimization by this government, which is aided by U.S. security  assistance. We turn away our brothers and sisters at the border, but we  abet the very crimes they are fleeing.   Berta Caceras' legacy should serve to remind us of this, and enough  is enough.                            ____________________
