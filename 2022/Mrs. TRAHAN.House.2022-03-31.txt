 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of something every single  Member of this body should be able to get behind, capping the price of  insulin at $35 a month.   In my home State of Massachusetts, over half a million people rely on  their lifesaving insulin prescription. But being forced to pay anywhere  from $100 to $1,600 a month for it simply isn't doable for so many  families.   Far too many diabetics are being forced to ration their doses, and  some are even skipping them altogether because they can't afford the  medicine they need.   Let's be clear about what that means. Hardworking folks are risking  their lives each day because big pharmaceutical companies are putting  profits first.   We have the ability to change that with the legislation before us  today, Mr. Speaker. And shame on us if we stand by and do nothing while  people we have the honor to represent die waiting for Congress to act.   I plead with my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation. Our constituents are depending on us.                            ____________________
