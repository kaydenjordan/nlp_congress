 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that a special prosecutor has  been named to conduct an independent investigation into Russia's  meddling in our 2016 election and any connections between the Trump  campaign and Russia.   Appointing Robert Mueller is a step in the right direction, but he  must be able to operate independently, without interference from the  White House, without interference, even, from the Justice Department or  any other administration officials.   We must also keep in mind that this particular investigation will be  limited in its scope in the sense that it will be looking only at  counterintelligence issues and only at potential criminality arising  out of the investigation. What it won't do is give us that bigger  picture, give the American people the sense of the connection that may  have occurred between the campaign of Donald Trump and the Russians.   In order to get to that, in order to restore faith and confidence in  our democracy and our national security, we need an independent  commission to look at that bigger picture and let Congress deal with  the big questions that the American people sent us here to address.  That is the direction we must take.                            ____________________
