 Mr. President, I rise today on Pearl Harbor Day to  remind my colleagues that on December 7, 1941, Imperial Japan attacked  not only Pearl Harbor but also the Philippine Islands, Guam, Wake  Island, Howland Island, Midway, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai,  and Bangkok.   In the Philippines that day, 89 men from Maywood, IL, who made up  Company ``B'' of the 192nd Tank Battalion--federated National Guard  units from Illinois, Wisconsin, Kentucky, and Ohio--defended Clark  Field from invading Japanese forces. They had arrived in the  Philippines less than 3 weeks earlier.   These Illinois tankers watched helplessly as Japan's modern planes  flew beyond the reach of their guns and destroyed the airfield. They  then fought valiantly on the Bataan Peninsula with antiquated weapons  and dwindling supplies. Relief from the United States never came.  Though they held out for months, the men, overcome with fatigue,  starvation, and disease, were surrendered by their commanders on April  9, 1942.   What followed was the infamous Bataan Death March 100 miles up the  peninsula to a makeshift prison camp. Thousands died. Maywood, a hamlet  outside of Chicago, had the greatest number of men from any single  American town on the Death March. They would not all make it home.   Those who survived the initial march endured 3 and a half years of  death camps, brutal forced labor, and unimaginable abuse. More than  half the Americans taken prisoner on Bataan died before they could see  the war's end. Of the 89 Maywood men of Company ``B'' who left the U.S.  in 1941, only 43 returned home in 1945.   For 79 years, Maywood has celebrated and remembered its heroes of  Bataan with an annual September Memorial. Like many important  celebrations in COVID, this was the second year that the memorial had  to be postponed. But we do not forget the men of Maywood. From the  Bataan-Corregidor Memorial Bridge in Chicago to Maywood's Bataan  Memorial Park, my home State of Illinois recalls daily their sacrifice  for liberty.   As a retired member of the Illinois National Guard myself, today is a  solemn day--a day that will forever live in infamy--when we are  reminded of the sacrifices made and the brave lives lost in service to  our Nation. I am proud to have served with my Illinois National Guard  family and work to continue to bring respect, remembrance, and honor to  such a strong legacy.   Therefore, I ask my fellow Senators to join me on this 80th  anniversary of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and to remember  the other Americans who fought and died throughout the Pacific that  day. Although the aim of the December 7 surprise attack on Hawaii's  Pearl Harbor was to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet in its home port and  to discourage U.S. action in Asia, the other strikes served as preludes  to full-scale invasion and brutal military occupation.   I further ask my colleagues to join me in commending the hard work  and dedication of Maywood Bataan Day Organization President Col.  Richard A. McMahon, Jr., and his board of directors, as well as Ms. Jan  Thompson, president of the Illinois-based American Defenders of Bataan  and Corregidor Memorial Society, who are committed to honoring and  preserving the history of the men and women of Bataan who gave so much  in the fight against tyranny and fascism. They, too, are the part of  the story of Pearl Harbor Day and in keeping the memory of the men of  Maywood alive to this day.                            ____________________
