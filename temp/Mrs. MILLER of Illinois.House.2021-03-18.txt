 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague,  Congressman Cloud, for this very important Special Order. The House of  hypocrites may be a more fitting name than this House of  Representatives.   The Democrats have facilitated the building of a 10-foot-tall wall or  fence with razor wire around the people's House, our national Capitol  Building, and surround themselves with police and National Guard. Yet,  the same people refuse to protect our Nation's border and the continued  construction of our border wall.   Last week, the Democrats passed two bills that diminish our Second  Amendment rights. The Democrats are the people who have told you we  don't need guns and walls, yet they have surrounded themselves with  guns and walls for months.   There are real dangers posed by allowing this massive illegal  immigration invasion. We don't know who the people are that are coming  or what their intentions are. We do know that a lot of them are  bringing in drugs, women and children to be trafficked, COVID and other  diseases, and weapons.   I call on President Biden and the Democrats to stop obstructing the  enforcement of our immigration laws and facilitating this invasion on  our southern border.
