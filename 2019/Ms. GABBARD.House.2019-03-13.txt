 Mr. Speaker, today in Yemen, there are millions of  Yemeni people who are on the brink of death from famine and disease,  lack of access to food and water, basic medicine and healthcare.   Thousands of Yemeni civilians have died in this genocidal war being  waged by Saudi Arabia with support from the United States. They have  been living under the looming threat of death at a moment's notice.   This must end. Not another day can go by with U.S. support for this  genocidal war.   Saudi Arabia is not our ally. They spend billions of dollars  spreading the Wahhabi-Salafist ideology that fuels terrorist  organizations like ISIS and al-Qaida. They take the weapons that they  get from the United States and provide them to al-Qaida.   Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, today, the Senate is taking an important vote, and I  urge my colleagues in the Senate to hear the pleas of the Yemeni people  who are begging for their lives. Vote today to end the unconstitutional  U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen.                            ____________________
