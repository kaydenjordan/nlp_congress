 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees on payrolls of America's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise in celebration of Hispanic  Heritage Month.   In my home district of central Washington, the history and the  culture of Hispanic Americans is woven into the fabric of our  communities. From small businesses in manufacturing to agriculture and  artistry, the success of our communities is dependent on the success of  our diverse and vibrant Hispanic populations.   Earlier this year, the House passed legislation to finally establish  the National Museum of the American Latino in our Nation's Capital. It  is my hope that this museum will empower all of us to learn about and  engage with the history of Hispanic Americans and their contributions  to our history and our culture.   In central Washington and across the country, we are proud of our  Hispanic friends and neighbors who prove that the American Dream is  alive and well. Because of them, we are a stronger, more diverse, more  prosperous society, and I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating  Hispanic Heritage Month.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman), my good friend, for yielding.   As we all know, the West has been on fire.   In my home State of Washington, over 700,000 acres have burned,  causing thousands of families to evacuate, leaving their homes, their  businesses, and their farms behind. Whole towns have essentially been  wiped off the map.   Smoke blanketed central Washington, with fires raging up and down the  West Coast. The air quality of our cities and our rural areas ranked  the worst in the world.   As the people of central Washington and many of my colleagues in  Congress understand, healthy, resilient forests are the key to wildfire  prevention. We have made significant progress, but there is still much  work to be done.   Without our leadership in Congress, families will continue to lose  their homes and their businesses, and jobs will continue to be lost,  and our public health will continue to be threatened.   While a loss of homes and livelihoods is heartbreaking, there is  nothing more tragic than the loss of life.   Today, I join the people of central Washington in mourning the loss  of 1-year-old Baby Hyland, whose life was tragically cut short as his  parents fled to escape the Cold Springs fire that was raging across  Okanogan County. The Hyland family has suffered immeasurable loss with  the deaths of both their toddler as well as the death of their unborn  child. My heart aches and my prayers go out for the Hylands as they  recover from their own wounds in this unimaginable heartbreak.   These tragic circumstances fall on us, Mr. Speaker. We are  responsible, as the Federal Government, for failing to deliver a  management strategy that enables us to prevent these catastrophic  events.   We cannot continue to sit idly by.   We have to responsibly log our forests and graze our lands, or we  will watch them burn.   These wildfires and this year have truly tested our resilience, but  of this I am certain: in the face of catastrophe, central Washington  will recover.   Now it is the Federal Government's responsibility to do everything in  its power to prevent another disaster like this again.   For years, extreme environmentalist groups have insisted that we  leave our forests and natural lands alone, leaving them in their quote  ``natural state.'' But as we witness, year-after-year, that strategy  simply does not work.   Many point to climate change as a contributing factor; I am not here  to refute that. At the end of the day though, the facts remain: our  land management--or lack thereof--is a serious problem.   Decades of mismanagement, misguided environmental policies, and  lackluster forestry and grazing practices have led to forests and  grasslands that act as tinder for wildfires, just waiting to be set  ablaze each summer.   We cannot continue to sit idly by. We have to responsibly log our  forests and graze our lands, or we will watch them burn.   As I have stated all along throughout the many challenges this year  has presented: Central Washington's communities are resilient.   Wildfire recovery is no easy feat, but I have seen firsthand how  citizens, volunteers, local organizations, and government entities work  together to revive our communities, rebuild our fallen structures, and  actively work to prevent future devastation.   I have heard stories of students and volunteers jumping into action,  working to clear burnt areas, making way for new structures.  Fairgrounds and community groups opened to help house and treat  evacuated or injured livestock and animals. Donations continue to pour  in from across the state, region, and country to families and  firefighters in need.   I am working closely with FEMA and USDA to ensure our communities  receive the federal assistance they need, and I stand ready to help the  people of our district in any way I can.   These wildfires--and this year--have tested our resilience, but of  this I am certain: In the face of catastrophe, Central Washington will  recover. Now it is the federal government's responsibility to do  everything in its power to prevent another disaster like this again.
