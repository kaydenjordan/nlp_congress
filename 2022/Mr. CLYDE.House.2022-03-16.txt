 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2022  Georgia High School Association 3A State champions, the Lumpkin County  Lady Indians girls' basketball team.   After trailing behind in the third quarter, the Lady Indians defeated  the Greater Atlanta Spartans girls' basketball team 51-47, winning  their 28th consecutive game and securing their first championship title  in school history.   These talented young women, led by head coach David Dowse, fought  till the very end, showing incredible athleticism, strength, and  determination.   Congratulations to the Lumpkin County Lady Indians girls' basketball  team on a spectacular win and an exciting new title. Georgia's Ninth  District is proud of them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, while the devastating war in Ukraine is  heartbreaking, we cannot turn a blind eye to the crises that President  Biden has created here at home, especially when the American people are  paying for his failed policies.   Last week, inflation hit another new, 40-year high of 7.9 percent in  February, continuing to impose a hidden tax on every solitary American.   Prices at the pump, utility bills, and costs in the grocery store  checkout line just keep getting worse.   Yet, instead of reversing his disastrous policies and reducing  government spending in order to alleviate the pain inflicted on  Americans' wallets, President Biden pivots to offer deceptive excuses.   First, we were told inflation was just transitory, that is it, but  when price hikes continued, the new spin comically became that  inflation is a good thing.   A good thing, really? Struggling Americans would beg to differ, Mr.  President.   When that messaging failed, the talking points quickly evolved to  blame higher prices on corporate greed. It appears the Biden  administration enjoys pointing fingers at others instead of admitting  the truth.   Now, in light of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Biden  administration's convenient scapegoat is Russian President Vladimir  Putin, disingenuously labeling the ongoing inflation as Putin's price  hike.   Make no mistake, inflation was skyrocketing long before Putin's  troops set one foot into Ukraine. These are most certainly President  Biden's price hikes. He is responsible, and no amount of dishonesty can  hide the truth from the American people.   In fact, Americans simply can't afford to buy any more of Biden's  deceptive excuses. Instead of playing the blame game while workers,  families, and small businesses suffer, the Biden administration and  congressional Democrats must reverse course on their wasteful spending  and failed economic policies. We must return to the America-first  principles that truly helped the American people thrive.
