 Mr. Speaker, my commitment to life is  rooted in the unequivocal truth that every person is created in the  image and likeness of God. As a father and a grandfather, I can tell  you that there is no greater gift than new life.   As a doctor, I can tell you that science confirms what we have known  for centuries. Every unborn child is a person deserving of fundamental  rights. During the span of my own medical career, I have witnessed  remarkable innovation. With today's technology, there can be no doubt  that a child in the womb is a living person.   Despite this evidence, Democrats are mounting unprecedented attacks  on pro-life protections. First, President Biden repealed the Mexico  City policy. Then House Democrats blocked the Born Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. Now they are attempting to repeal the Hyde  amendment, which bans Federal funds from being used to pay for abortion  services.                                time  1845    Since 1976, this key protection has been attached to all legislation  passed in Congress, preventing American taxpayers from funding abortion  against their will.   It is wholly reprehensible to require pro-life Americans to pay for  abortion against their conscience. As Congress considers appropriations  legislation, I urge my colleagues to dispense with their attack on the  longstanding Hyde amendment.   To uphold the dignity of human life, we must preserve this  protection. It is simple: The Hyde amendment saves lives.   Despite the challenges ahead, we must persevere in this fight. As we  read in Romans 12: ``Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with  good.''   Our enduring commitment to protect image-bearers and defend the  sanctity of human life will prevail.
