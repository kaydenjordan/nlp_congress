 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concerns  over the proposed budget cuts made in the President's budget and the  skyrocketing deficits that will leave our children and grandchildren  with trillions more in debt.   While it is imperative that we rein in wasteful government spending  and get our national debt under control, we cannot do so at the expense  of the men and women living in rural and Tribal communities and our  seniors.   This budget proposal slashes trillions from healthcare programs that  millions of seniors, working families, and veterans rely on every day.  Additionally, it would cut infrastructure programs and funding for  critical projects in rural America and hurt farming families.   This is not how we are going to curb spending and get our fiscal  house in order. We need to act now to pass a bipartisan budget that  addresses the debt crisis and invests in the future of our Nation.                            ____________________
