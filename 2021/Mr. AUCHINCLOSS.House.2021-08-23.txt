 Madam Speaker, the bipartisan infrastructure package  makes important investments in our country's roads, bridges, high-speed  internet, and clean water. But to fully deliver on our Democratic  agenda, we must also pass a budget reconciliation bill that invests in  a top priority for my district: climate resiliency.  [[Page H4349]]    Climate change is an ever-present danger to our constituents and  communities. Just yesterday, a tropical storm made landfall in my  district with intense winds of at least 47 miles per hour in southern  New England. With communities at risk of flooding, property damage, and  loss of life with increasingly harsh and dangerous storms, Congress  must act.   Massachusetts is a leader in mitigating and combating climate change,  but the Commonwealth cannot do it alone. I urge my colleagues to vote  to pass both the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan  infrastructure bill to take the necessary steps to end climate change.                            ____________________
