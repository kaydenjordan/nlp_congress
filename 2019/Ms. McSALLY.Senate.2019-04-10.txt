 Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate passed my bill, and  yesterday, we passed identical House legislation to ensure this went to  the President as quickly as possible. I would like to take a few  minutes to thank those involved with these agreements and again  highlight the importance of this historic achievement.   The Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan, also known as the DCP,  was negotiated between the seven Colorado River Basin States to respond  to this prolonged drought. It is designed to protect Lakes Mead and  Powell from reaching certain critical water elevations that would  trigger severe water supply and hydropower impacts, including the risk  of reaching crisis levels where operational control of the Colorado  River System is lost.   The set of five agreements that makes up the DCP builds off of the  tools and water saving commitments made by the basin States in the 2007  Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations  for Lakes Powell and Mead to further address water security and respond  to actual water conditions as demanded by responsible water resource  management. These added savings bring the risk of the Mead hitting  1,000 feet over the next 7 years to near zero.   I am especially proud of the work done on these agreements in  Arizona, which takes the biggest and most immediate reduction in water  supply under the DCP. Through inclusive,  [[Page S2380]]  good-faith negotiations, cities, farmers, tribes, and conservations  groups came together to make the tough decisions required to improve  long-term water security and avert the looming water supply crisis.   I would like to thank and congratulate Governor Doug Ducey and his  staff, the Arizona State legislature, Tom Buschatzke and his team at  the Department of Water Resources, the CAWCD board, Ted Cooke and the  CAP staff, Gila River Indian Community Governor Stephen Lewis and the  Gila River Indian Community Tribal Council, Colorado River Indian  Tribes Chairman Dennis Patch and the CRIT Tribal Council, and the  dozens and dozens of ag, water, municipal, NGO, and other stakeholders,  including the entire Arizona DCP Steering Committee, involved on this  outstanding achievement that will improve Arizona's water security for  years to come.   Work on the DCP has been underway for nearly 6 years. It has spanned  the terms of two Presidents, three Interior Secretaries, and 13  Governors. The effort has seamlessly transitioned between Republican  and Democrat administrations, both here in DC and out in the States,  and I am proud of the swift action taken by Congress to authorize this  agreement.   The Colorado River DCP Authorization Act was developed in a  bipartisan and bicameral manner, and involved the Governors'  representatives for each of the seven basin States. Responding to  concerns of some in the House and Senate about potential unintended  consequences of the legislative language proposed as part of the DCP  agreements, several changes were made to provide assurances that the  Nationals Environmental Policy Act applies to future Federal actions  outside the scope of existing environmental analysis and compliance  done in the Upper and Lower Basins.   I would like to thank Senators Cortez Masto, Gardner, and Barrasso,  along with House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva and Ranking  Member Rob Bishop for working with me to reach this compromise  legislation.   This exact statutory language is crafted to ensure water conservation  activities in the Colorado River Basin can begin in 2019 and be built  in to the Annual Operations Plans for 2020. Once the Colorado River  Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act is enacted, execution and  implementation of the DCP can and should begin immediately, as all of  the actions in the agreements authorized by this bill are well within  the scope of existing NEPA and Endangered Species Act compliance in the  Upper and Lower Basins. Specifically, the actions to be undertaken are  within the analyses and range of effects reviewed in the 2007 final  environmental impact statement on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for  Lower Basin Shortages and Coordinated Operations for Lakes Powell and  Mead, and the EISs and ESA documents prepared for operation of the  Colorado River Storage Project Act initial storage unit reservoirs.  Additional environmental compliance is only applicable should future  Federal actions be undertaken that are outside the range of effects  analyzed in those documents or the applicable Records of Decision.   In closing, I am proud to have led my colleagues from the seven basin  States to get this DCP Authorization Act passed through Congress as  quickly as possible, and I thank them for their hard work and support.  The Colorado River DCP Act chooses the path of water conservation,  compromise, and proactive water management over and litigation,  conflict, and creation of a zero sum game on the River. I understand  that there will be more work to be done after we have authorized the  DCP, but we have made important progress in passing this critical  legislation.                            ____________________
