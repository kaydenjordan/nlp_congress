 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for the Improving  Access to Behavioral Health Information Technology Act, H.R. 3331. Our  Nation finds itself in a mental health and opioid crisis, and Congress  must do all it can to ensure providers have the tools they need to  effectively treat their patients.   Toward that end, together with Representatives Matsui and Mullin, I  introduced this bipartisan legislation, which would authorize the  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to incentivize health IT  demonstrations for behavioral health providers. By utilizing electronic  health records, they can better coordinate care, support delivery of  treatment, and help to fully integrate recovery and prevention services  for all Americans.   This legislation takes the critical step of bringing mental health  and addiction treatment into the 21st century while reducing health  spending and expanding access for these treatments to underserved  communities, including rural areas in my home State of Kansas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3331. It  is my hope we will get this bill to the President's desk as quickly as  possible.
