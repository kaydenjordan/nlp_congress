 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Republican majority leader was on  the floor a little earlier, and he talked about the business of the  Senate and how busy we are in the Senate. I would like to state for the  record, so far in the calendar year 2019, on the floor of this U.S.  Senate, where the greatest deliberative body meets and considers the  lofty issues of our time, in the year 2019--currently this year--we  have considered 22 amendments in the entire year--22 amendments.   Madam President, six of them were offered by the junior Senator from  Kentucky. One Senator had six amendments: Senator Rand Paul. They were  all defeated. Then some 16 other amendments were offered.   To put that into perspective, on a good day in the Senate, when the  Senate was the Senate, there would be 10 amendments; bills would come  to the floor; we would debate; amendments would be adopted. Some would  lose. People would give speeches. We would pass legislation, send it  over to the House, go to a conference. We don't do that anymore.   Under Senator McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, we do  not do that anymore. There were 22 amendments in the course of the  entire year. If we were paid for the actual piecework that we do, we  would not get a paycheck this year because we haven't done anything.   I will take that back. What we have done is to fill as many Federal  court vacancies as possible with some of the most unqualified people  ever offered by a President of the United States. This week, a man  named VanDyke is being named to the court in Nevada. He has such a  limited connection with Nevada that both Nevada Senators refuse to  approve him for this court appointment. He has no connection to their  State, but he was chosen by the White House.   He went through a background check by the American Bar Association,  and they concluded unanimously that he was unqualified to be a Federal  judge--unqualified. He is not the first. Under this President, we have  had nine different court nominees found unqualified by the American Bar  Association. You say, Well, that is going to happen, lawyers disagree.   Do you know how many were found unqualified under the Obama  administration in 8 years? None, not one. There are nine unqualified  men and women now with lifetime appointments on the Federal bench  because, for Senator McConnell, that is his priority: Fill the bench  with people of his political stripe at any cost.   Take up legislation? No. The Democratically-controlled House of  Representatives has sent us over 200 different measures to consider on  the floor of the Senate. Senator McConnell has refused. He will not  take up any legislation. He is very proud of it. To his credit, he is  not ashamed or embarrassed. He says to call himself the Grim Reaper  when it comes to measures coming over from the House. He is here to  kill them, and he has done a pretty good job of that, if that is his  goal in what he wants to achieve. When I hear him come to the floor and  say we are not doing enough in the Senate--22 amendments in 1 year. I  say to Senator McConnell, you have been in the Senate for a long time.  You know that that number tells the whole story.    Among the organizations supporting the resolution are the  American Federation of Teachers, the Center for Responsible Lending,  the Consumer Federation of America, the Education Trust, the National  Association of College Admission Counseling, the NAACP, the National  Education Association, the Student Veterans of America, and the  American Legion on behalf of American veterans who have been victims of  this fraud as well.   When our resolution comes to the floor, I hope a handful of my  Republican colleagues will take a look at it and realize that we have  to give these students a second chance at their lives. We misled them  into attending for-profit schools that were worthless. The schools  defrauded them. They ended up with a debt to our government, and under  the provisions of the Higher Education Act, that debt can be forgiven.  Let's give these defrauded student borrowers a second chance.  Ultimately, they deserve an opportunity from our government to have a  better holiday coming before them and a better life ahead.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
