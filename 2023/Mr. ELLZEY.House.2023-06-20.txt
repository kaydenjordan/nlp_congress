Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to address the American  people. I rise in support of H.R. 1606, the Veteran Entrepreneurship  Training Act of 2023.   As a veteran, I know that going from military life to civilian life  can be  [[Page H2974]]  complicated. The military is great at training our servicemembers to do  their jobs, Mr. Speaker. You and I both know that.   They train them to be the most lethal force on the planet--of which  you were one--to defend and protect the people of the United States.  What they do not do is effectively help servicemembers or train them to  become civilians.   The Boots to Business Program will help fill that gap. This program  will help our veterans translate the skills that they acquired during  their years of military service to the tools that would be needed to be  successful in civilian life. Administered through the Office of  Veterans Business Development in the Small Business Administration, the  Boots to Business Program offers servicemembers and military spouses  moving from military to civilian life a foundational two-day, in-person  course for an introduction to business ownership.   The foundational course can be followed by optional online courses on  topics including market research, business fundamentals, and revenue  readiness. The Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2023 authorizes  this program for 5 years. We must help the men and women who so bravely  served our country. Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2023 is  one way to help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again thank Chair Williams, Ranking  Member Velazquez, and Mr. Schneider for this very important bill that  starts us down the right path, but it is only a beginning.   After our Nation's veterans have given so much for their country, we  have an obligation to give them the tools and resources to help them  transition back to civilian life. The Boots to Business Program,  incorporated in this bill, is an example of a program offered by the  Federal Government that actually accomplishes a mission. It helps  veterans transfer the skills they already have gained from their  military service to the private sector with the goal of starting their  own small business.   Oftentimes, some of the biggest obstacles facing veteran  entrepreneurship is not knowing where to obtain a loan. Through H.R.  1606 and the Boots to Business Program, our veterans can be taught how  to navigate that difficult process.   Veterans already have the intangible leadership skills to succeed in  any arena; and, above all else, this program  [[Page H2975]]  teaches them how to best transfer these skills into the private sector.   I again urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which  provides counseling and resources our veterans need to begin their  journey in starting their own small business.   Mr. Speaker, you and I both know that we have lost friends in combat.  We lost them 16, 20 years ago. We are losing them today, too. We are  losing them at a rate that is unsustainable, 22 a day.   Until the DOD and the VA transition to where they hand off one well- trained soldier, sailor, airman, or marine into a well-trained  civilian, we must always do more. This is a good start.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
