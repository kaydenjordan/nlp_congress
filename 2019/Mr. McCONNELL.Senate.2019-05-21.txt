 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of S.  1370 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    I further ask that the papers be held at the desk;  that if the House passes a bill identical to the text of S. 1370 just  passed by the Senate, the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; finally, that upon  passage of the House bill, S. 1370 be indefinitely postponed.    Madam President, this week presents us with more  opportunities to make progress on the backlog of qualified nominees who  are still awaiting Senate confirmation.   We began yesterday by voting to advance an exceptionally well- qualified nominee to the Federal judiciary. Daniel P. Collins of  California was chosen by President Trump to be U.S. circuit court judge  for the Ninth Circuit, and the reasons why are abundantly clear.  [[Page S2986]]    Mr. Collins is a graduate of Harvard and of Stanford Law School. He  has held clerkships on both the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the  U.S. Supreme Court for Justice Scalia. He served at the Department of  Justice as Associate Deputy Attorney General and as Attorney-Advisor in  the Office of Legal Counsel. He spent 4 years as an assistant U.S.  attorney. He has complemented that experience with more than 20 years  of well-regarded work in private practice.   Mr. Collins has developed a reputation for legal excellence. The  American Bar Association rates him well qualified for this new post.  Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee reported him favorably here  to the floor.   I hope my colleagues will join me as we vote later today to confirm  this fine nominee.   Following the Collins nomination, we will consider four more  nominations to district courts around our Nation: Howard Nielson of  Utah, Stephen Clark of Missouri, Carl Nichols of the District of  Columbia, and Kenneth Bell of North Carolina. Each has been tapped by  the President to fill important vacancies. Collectively, they represent  decades of experience in private practice and decades more in public  service, and they come before us with the high esteem of their legal  peers.   Take the case of Mr. Nielson, whose nomination we will consider  first. Former circuit judge Mike Luttig, for whom he served as law  clerk, said: ``Howard Nielson may well be the single most qualified  person to serve on the federal bench that I have ever had the privilege  to know.''   It would be hard to come up with a more unequivocal endorsement, so I  hope each of my colleagues will join me in support of Mr. Nielson,  along with each of the nominees who will follow him this week.   I have noticed that a few of my colleagues across the aisle have  expressed some displeasure that the Senate has recently been spending  some time on nominations. I would remind our friends on the other side  that not so long ago, thoroughly qualified district judge nominees were  the kinds of nominations that would sail through the Senate floor by  voice vote and in big groups.   Since this particular President was inaugurated in 2017, this  Democratic minority has largely taken a different view. They have  chosen to deploy an unprecedented level of systematic, across-the-board  delaying tactics. The effect has been the need for cloture votes and  individual consideration for all kinds of uncontroversial nominations,  where it hadn't been a tradition in the Senate in the past. So more  than 2 years into this consideration, we are left with too many  vacancies still unfulfilled and a backlog of qualified nominees who  need considering.   Confirming unobjectionable individuals continues to take more of the  Senate's time than it should, but this obstruction is not going to  deter us. We will be here as long as it takes. We will keep confirming  highly qualified nominees to the Federal bench. We will keep putting  the President's team in place and giving Americans the government they  actually voted for.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, as I have  discussed many times on the floor, powerful natural disasters have  devastated communities across America. Many are still in need of aid as  they struggle to rebuild.   My colleagues know all too well the destruction that was brought to  States across the Southeast, the gulf coast, and Puerto Rico by a bad  hurricane season: tens of billions of dollars in damage to buildings  and infrastructure and thousands of people left without shelter or  access to clean water and electricity.   We remember the record wildfires that swept across our western  regions, the tornadoes that tore through the Deep South, and the  rampant flooding that sunk entire communities across the Midwest and  affected many of my fellow Kentuckians as well.   We have seen the pain caused by nature's worst. Now it is time for  Congress to finally--finally--demonstrate our commitment to America's  best. It is time to deliver supplemental resources for the rebuilding  efforts that, in many cases, have been inching--just inching--along for  months. It is well past time to show the relief workers, the  volunteers, and the families still picking up the pieces that we have  their backs.   In recent days, important progress has been made to deliver on this  overdue commitment. Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and their counterparts over  in the House are continuing their hard work to reach a bipartisan  solution that meets the most pressing needs of all of these affected  communities. That includes promising steps toward bipartisan agreement  to deliver critical resources to address the ongoing humanitarian  crisis at our southern border. The status quo is completely-- completely--dysfunctional, so I am glad the agreement seems to be  converging on more resources.   I expect to discuss our progress in greater detail as the week  unfolds, but it is my sincere hope that in both parties and in both  Chambers we will finally--finally--be able to reach a meaningful  consensus that can become law and deliver on the priorities of  communities that are in need all across our country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  following this vote, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate recess until  3:45 p.m. and that at 3:45 p.m., the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the Clark, Nichols, and Bell nominations; finally,  that if cloture is invoked on the nominations, the confirmation votes  on the Nielson, Clark, Nichols, and Bell nominations occur at a time to  be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, on Wednesday, May 22.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.
