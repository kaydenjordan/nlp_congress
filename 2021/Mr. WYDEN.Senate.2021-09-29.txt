 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on executive Calendar  Nos. 264 and 159 be considered expired at 4:45 p.m. today; that the  vote on confirmation of the Anderson nomination occur at 4:45 p.m.  today; and that the vote on confirmation of the Meyer nomination occur  at a time to be determined by the majority leader, following  consultation with the Republican leader on Thursday, September 30.    Madam President, in a few minutes, I will put forward the  unanimous consent request that the Senate take up and approve a highly  qualified and unquestionably noncontroversial nominee. I am going to  take just a few minutes to talk about Jonathan Davidson, nominated to  be the next Deputy Under Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the  Treasury Department.   To do this briefly, there are a few key points to make about this  important nomination. To start, Jon isn't just a person off the street  being nominated for a new job in the Biden administration. In fact, my  guess is, virtually every Member of this body, Democrats and  Republicans alike, have worked with Jon at one point or another.   From 2011 until he was nominated this past spring, Jon served as  chief of staff to another Finance Committee colleague, Senator Bennet.  He is known as somebody who is honest, who is hardworking, and who is  committed, most importantly, to bringing people together to tackle big  challenges, and he has been doing it a long time.   Before his work with Senator Bennet, Jon served as chief of staff to  Senator Paul Sarbanes. He spent time in the office of Representative  John Sarbanes, and he was later chief counsel to our friend and  colleague, Senator Mark Warner. You don't have to take it from me that  Jon knows his way around the Congress. All of those Members trusted Jon  as a right-hand man.    The second issue: I can't find any controversy with respect to his  nomination. He cleared the Senate's Finance Committee on a 28-to-0  vote.   Let me repeat that: 28-to-0 vote.   In fact, the Finance Committee reported out several nominees this  Congress without any Republican opposition, none at all. Normally, that  would be enough to pave the way for prompt and full Senate  consideration, but I think we all understand these are not normal times  here in the U.S. Senate.   It used to be the case, at the end of July, the two sides would come  together and look to pass a package of noncontroversial nominees by  unanimous consent. My Finance Committee team thought this would be the  case this year. Unfortunately, that did not take place. Senate  Republicans were just in no mood to clear even the most uncontroversial  nominees.   This is an extraordinary level of obstruction beyond what you saw  when the previous administration was staffing up. For example, let's  take the previous two nominees for the same position Jon is up for.   Drew Maloney was the first Trump nominee for Legislative Affairs at  Treasury. The Finance Committee held a hearing on this nomination on  June 7, 2017. The committee voted on his nomination a week later,  favorably reported by a vote of 25 to 1. A few weeks after that, the  full Senate passed his nomination by unanimous consent, along with  several other nominations for roles in the Trump Treasury Department.  That is how the process generally unfolds.   Two years later, Brian McGuire was nominated to replace Mr. Maloney.  His hearing was held July 24, 2019. The Finance Committee approved his  nomination a week later. He was confirmed to serve in the Trump  administration on September 24.   In both cases, these two nominees, colleagues, were confirmed 2  months after their hearings.   Jon Davidson has been waiting 4 months since his hearing on May 25-- nearly twice as long as Trump nominees waited for the same job.   I think we all understand that it is essential to have qualified  individuals heading up offices of Legislative Affairs. They help to  make sure administrations follow the laws, just as the Senate passes as  intended. They help Members write legislation. They make sure that all  Members get responses to their questions with respect to oversight.   Setting everything else aside, you would think Senate Republicans  would be especially interested now in making sure the Senate can  perform that essential oversight. I myself am looking for some straight  answers to a number of oversight requests I had posed to the Treasury  Department, and having Jon installed in his new role as Treasury would  sure help to move that process along. Federal Agencies and the Congress  need these legislative point guards in order for Agencies to run as  smoothly as possible.   This isn't a policy position, nor is Jon Davidson a nominee who  raises any major concern from anybody. I have yet to hear even anything  resembling a substantive reason from Senate Republicans for opposing a  nominee like Jon Davidson, who got a 28-to-nothing vote out of  committee to lead this office. There is no reason for delaying any  longer.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  following nomination: Calendar No. 168, Jonathan Davidson, to be Deputy  Under Secretary of the Treasury; that the nomination be confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.    Mr. President, let's understand exactly what is at issue  here. Jonathan Davidson has been nominated to be the Deputy Under  Secretary for Legislative Affairs. In that particular role, he would  not be directly involved in decisions over sanctions, No. 1.   No. 2, when it comes to Nord Stream 2, the Biden administration, to  their credit, has recognized the threat from Russia, but also that the  pipeline is nearly complete and the Trump administration failed to stop  the construction.   Everything my colleague from Texas is raising in his concerns about  Nord Stream 2 is already happening with another pipeline--Turk Stream  2--and my colleague is aware of this. He has been briefed repeatedly.   Now, for those who don't have access to the same kind of information  that my colleague has, gas is already being diverted from Ukraine into  Europe through Turk Stream 2 because the past administration did  nothing about that pipeline either.   The Biden administration has actually put a plan forward to mitigate  the effects of Nord Stream 2 and has received concrete agreements from  the Germans to move Ukraine toward energy independence and address  Russian threats.   I am just going to close with just another dose of good government.  The 9/11 Commission specifically warned about the need to have senior,  confirmed individuals in place to avoid a threat to the homeland. And,  by the way, we did that during the Trump administration. We have far  less people confirmed today than we did in 2001, before 9/11.   In my view, this has got to end. For these reasons, I object to the  UC.    Mr. President, I am going to be very brief and then make a  unanimous consent request.   Again, we have a difference of opinion with respect to the facts.  That is what the Senate is all about--real debate. In a moment, I am  going to ask unanimous consent to put into the Record at this point an  article from just a few days ago from the Wall Street Journal that  makes the truth about Nord Stream 2 AG very clear.   In effect, in the Wall Street Journal article that we are going to  put into the Record, the pipeline owner said last week that  construction on the pipeline has been completed.   There is no reason to object to this very talented individual, John  Davidson, to head this important post after he got a 28-to-0 vote in  the Senate Finance Committee.   I think this article in the Wall Street Journal that I have just  asked to be printed in the Record at this point in the debate, so we  can make sure the facts are correct, supports our basic proposition on  this side of the aisle.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 13]  Senate Republicans Vow To Block Treasury Nominations Until Nord Stream                           II Firm Is Sanctioned                     (By Ian Talley and Brett Forrest)         Washington.--Senior Senate Republicans on Monday threatened       to indefinitely hold up the nominations of five top Treasury       Department officials if the Biden administration doesn't       blacklist the firm managing Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline       project.        Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) and Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said       they are prepared to approve the nominations, including two       national security posts that oversee sanctions and       counterterror finance, if the Treasury Department blacklists       Russia-owned Nord Stream 2 AG.        The Biden administration has implemented sanctions against       several firms that have provided support to the project but       not against Nord Stream 2 AG, saying that it would irritate       relations with critical ally Germany and do little to stop       the project, given that it was near completion. Gazprom,       Russia's state-controlled gas-export monopoly and the       pipeline owner, said last week that construction on the       pipeline had been completed. But there are still bureaucratic       hurdles that have to be overcome to get it running.        Nord Stream 2 is designed to accommodate the transmission       of 55 billion cubic meters of gas annually, the company said.        Republicans say they are concerned the pipeline project       bolsters Europe's reliance on Russian energy and gives Moscow       leverage over Washington's trans-Atlantic allies. By holding       up the five top Treasury nominations, they hope to pressure       the administration into sanctioning the managing firm and       stymie the pipeline's startup.        ``The administration's so-called `deal' with Germany hands       Vladimir Putin a geostrategic victory, entrenches corrupt       Russian influence in Europe, and drastically weakens the       security of Ukraine, Poland, and other states on the       frontline of Kremlin aggression,'' Mr. Toomey, the ranking       member of the Banking Committee, and Mr. Cruz said in a       letter to the chairmen of the Senate Banking and Foreign       Relations Committees.        A Treasury spokeswoman said that while the department has       experienced career staff who are experts in their fields,       ``The Senate should move quickly to confirm these nominees       who are integral to disrupting illicit finance, combating       terrorism, and administering sanctions.''        Nord Stream 2 AG officials didn't respond to a request for       comment.        The Banking Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the       nominations of Brian Nelson as the Treasury's undersecretary       for terrorism and financial intelligence and Elizabeth       Rosenberg for the role of assistant secretary for terrorism       financing.        Without Republican support in the committee, Democratic       lawmakers face long odds getting the nominations approved.        That could leave empty the post responsible for overseeing       U.S. sanctions policy, extending a vacancy that has already       lasted nearly two years. The nominations of Jonathan Davidson       as deputy undersecretary, Lily Lawrence Batchelder as       assistant secretary for tax policy and Benjamin Harris as       assistant secretary for economic policy all have been       committee-approved, but full Senate ratification has been       held up by Mr. Cruz.        The Texas Republican said he's prepared to lift his holds--      as well as those he has on nearly two dozen State Department       appointments--if the administration commits to sanctioning       the Russian project management firm.        Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), the chairman of the Senate       Foreign Relations Committee, didn't immediately respond to a       request for comment. The chairman of the Banking Committee,       Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), directed questions to the       State Department and White House. ``Decisions on sanctions       regarding the NS II pipeline are made by the       administration,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown said.        The Republican senators say a federal law called the       Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,       signed into law in 2017, mandates blacklisting companies or       individuals involved in evasion of the act's sanctions. They       say the provisions allow for the administration to delist the       company, but that opens the door for Congress to vote on the       issue.  [[Page S6768]]         Republican aides said the law mandating sanctions had       bipartisan support, fueled by concern the Trump       administration would treat Moscow too favorably. Given that       some Democratic lawmakers opposed the Biden administration's       Nord Stream 2 decision, those aides said Congress could vote       to keep the firm on Treasury's blacklists.        The risk of sanctions, the aides said, could dissuade       companies from providing certification.        In November, Norwegian certification company DNV suspended       its work on Nord Stream 2 after assessing that its activities       could expose the company to sanctions under Protecting       Europe's Energy Security Act, a 2019 U.S. law specific to the       pipeline, a company spokesman said.        Last week, Germany's energy regulator Bundesnetzagentur       received Nord Stream 2 AG's application for an operating       license. The company has four months to engage an independent       certification company to complete an assessment of the       pipeline's operational integrity.        Once a certification is complete, the German regulator       would send its decision to the European Commission, but this       isn't the final hurdle to gas flows. Initial deliveries could       face additional, unrelated delays. Last month, a German court       rejected Nord Stream 2 AG's bid to bypass a European Union       pro-competition regulation mandating that a gas producer and       the company that transports the gas be separate entities.        One of the congressional aides said the Biden       administration, besides worrying about creating diplomatic       friction with allies, may also be concerned about setting       precedent regarding sanctions, because Treasury officials       also could have to sanction other companies.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
