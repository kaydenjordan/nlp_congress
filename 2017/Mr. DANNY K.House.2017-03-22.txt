 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, let me thank you for  giving me the opportunity to once again express my opposition to the  repeal-and-replace healthcare bill before us.   You know, it is my position that health care ought to be a right and  not a privilege, especially in a country where we have the skill, the  knowledge, and the technology to provide it.   Medicare and Medicaid opened up new opportunities for health care for  seniors and large numbers of low-income, poor people in this country in  the mid-1960s. As a matter of fact, before Medicaid and Medicare, some  of them had never ever been able to acquire any professional medical  help. As a matter of fact, they lived off remedies and concoctions and  things that they had learned how to put together.   Now we come along with some help--Medicare, Medicaid--and the next  big move was the Affordable Care Act, which was a long time coming, but  it helped us move to the point where more than 20 million people were  able to get health insurance who had never had it before, whose only  outlet was to go to the emergency room of public hospitals and  oftentimes sit sometimes for 2 or 3 days before they got service,  before they got attention.   Now, here we come with something talking about repealing it, taking  it away. How could we possibly want to go backwards, back to where  millions of people are wondering every day whether or not they are  going to be able to go to the doctor and get serviced if they are sick?   And so I say to my colleagues, especially those who have never had  the experience of knowing hundreds of people with no care like I have,  let's say: No, no, no. Forward ever, backwards never.                            ____________________
