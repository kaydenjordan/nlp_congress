 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  heroism of Chad Robichaux and Staff Sergeant Dennis Price during the  Afghanistan evacuation last year. Their selfless actions evacuating  tens of thousands of Afghan interpreters and their families, vulnerable  women and children, persecuted Christians, and American citizens,  represents the highest levels of patriotism.   I met Chad through his work supporting our Nation's veterans as the  founder of the Mighty Oaks Foundation, a leading nonprofit serving the  military, veteran, and first responder communities around the world.  Through faith-based combat trauma and resiliency programs, Chad has  been instrumental in ensuring our brave warriors are supported when  they return home from the battlefield.   Chad's work doesn't stop there. He is also the co-founder of Save Our  Allies, a nonprofit focused on the evacuation and recovery of  Americans, our allies, and the most vulnerable people trapped in  Afghanistan. Save Our Allies began as a personal quest for Chad, as he  set out to rescue his longtime friend and Afghan interpreter. However,  the mission quickly evolved because of Chad's compassion for all people  and his servant's heart.   While the U.S. military held the Kabul airport in Afghanistan, the  Save Our Allies Task Force successfully extracted approximately 17,000  evacuees in a period of 10 days. Despite these courageous efforts, a  report from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated over 142,000  vulnerable Afghans remained in the country following the exit from  Kabul.   With the complete takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, the report  projected 20 million women would be vulnerable to sexual abuse and  slavery; Christians would be persecuted and executed; Afghan  interpreters and their families would be hunted down and killed;  children would be abused through religious manipulation; and the 1,000- plus Americans left behind would be killed or held hostage for ransom.   Understanding the ruthlessness of the Taliban as a former Force Recon  Marine, Chad Robichaux knew the rescue mission had to continue. In  response, Save Our Allies launched several operations to explore new  ways for extractions. Robichaux and his team first identified possible  ground evacuations that could be feasible by cross-border movements  into Tajikistan and quickly planned a reconnaissance operation.  Robichaux hand-selected Staff Sergeant Dennis Price, a Force Recon  Marine and Scout Sniper, to take part in the mission.   I want to share two stories from that mission to highlight their  incredible acts of sacrifice, service, and bravery. Early in the  mission, Staff Sergeant Price sought a higher vantage point to evaluate  a potential river crossing area. Upon his ascent up a mountain, he came  under sniper fire two separate times, pushing him back to return to the  safe house to reconvene with Robichaux and discuss moving forward with  the operation.   These two brave men humbly discussed their families, loved ones, and  all that would be left behind should they not make it out of this  mission ahead. Still, both men agreed to continue their mission of  building safe passage for American and Afghan evacuees.   During day 3 of the mission, and upon confirmation of possible river  crossing,  [[Page H8126]]  Staff Sergeant Price found himself 10 feet away from an armed Chinese  militant hiding in the bushes, utilizing the vegetation as concealment.                                time  1245    Robichaux, using his uncanny observation and combat skills, noticed  the looming threat and physically ushered Staff Sergeant Price into a  nearby vehicle before he could be captured or killed, ultimately saving  his life. Because of this heroic act, the two men were able to continue  providing real-time information to American intelligence agencies.   During their 10-day operation, Robichaux and Price were able to cover  90 miles of border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, remaining  undetected by countless Tajik, Russian, and Chinese military patrols,  all while avoiding Taliban-infested areas and checkpoints.   These examples, and countless others that cannot be shared due to  their sensitive nature, underscore the exemplary efforts undertaken by  both Americans behind enemy lines to collect the critical information  needed to bring so many to safety.   Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to stand before the House to honor their  courageous bravery and willingness to sacrifice their lives for their  fellow man. The mission that these men completed has saved and will  continue to save hundreds and possibly thousands of lives.   On behalf of a grateful Nation, I express my sincere gratitude. God  bless Chad Robichaux and Staff Sergeant Price for their service to our  country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the  passage of my bill, H.R. 4821, the Combating the Persecution of  Religious Groups in China Act. This urgently needed legislation will  hold senior officials of the Chinese Communist Party accountable for  the human rights violations and persecution of Christians and other  religious groups in China.   The Chinese Communist Party believes any religion threatens its  control over society. As a result, the CCP is carrying out a systemic  crackdown on all religions to control and manipulate every aspect of  faith. This includes the closing and destruction of churches,  installing surveillance equipment on church property, forcing the  modification of religious teachings to conform with the objectives of  the government, and the wrongful imprisonment of thousands of  individuals.                                time  2200    Through the Defending Freedoms Project, I am a congressional advocate  for three of these religious prisoners: Pastor John Cao, Pastor Zhang  Shaojie, and Pastor Wang Yi. Each were sentenced to several years in  Chinese prisons on illegitimate charges for practicing their faith.  This is unacceptable, and it must end.   As a Nation built on the fundamental principle of the freedom of  religion, we have a responsibility to shed light on this persecution  and speak for those in China who have no voice.   By passing this legislation, the House of Representatives will be  sending a clear message to China that we will not stand by as they  brutally abuse their own citizens. No one should live in fear for  practicing their faith, and China must be held accountable for their  criminal human rights violations.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Foreign Affairs Committee members and  their staff for their hard work in bringing this important legislation  to the floor, and I call on my colleagues to support its passage.
