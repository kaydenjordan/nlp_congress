 Madam Speaker, last week, a draft  majority opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v.  Wade was leaked. This is troubling and unprecedented. All Americans  should be concerned about this betrayal of trust in our Nation's  highest court.   My position on life has always been clear. You can't be a champion  for the future of this great country if you are going to limit its  potential.   For the majority of the last 50 years, Democrats have controlled the  House, the Senate, and the White House. In that time, they failed to  codify Roe v. Wade. Today, we are witnessing calls from the extreme  left to end the filibuster in the Senate and pack the courts.   This radical stance neglects the unborn and continues to ignore the  struggles of hardworking American families who are trying to cope with  soaring inflation, out-of-control food and energy prices, and the  failed policies of the Biden administration.   Madam Speaker, I will always use my voice here in Congress to defend  our most vulnerable and protect the unborn.  [[Page H4902]]                                ____________________
