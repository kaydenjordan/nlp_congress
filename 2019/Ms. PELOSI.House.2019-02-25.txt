 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished leader for  recognition and calling us together to salute two great women in this  Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I rise for the great honor of swearing in Cheryl Lynn  Johnson as the 36th Clerk of the House of Representatives. This is a  very distinguished and prestigious role.   Mr. McCarthy, I was pleased to appoint the first African American  woman Clerk of the House, Lorraine Miller, when I was Speaker before,  and now I am happy to be appointing the second.   We are privileged to be joined by Cheryl's parents, the Reverend  Charlie Davis and Cynthia Davis of New Orleans, who are with us in the  Chamber. Thank you for being with us.   We are also pleased to welcome Cheryl's husband, Clarence Ellison,  and her son, Bradford, to this Chamber today as well. Welcome to you,  and thank you.   I join our colleagues, the distinguished Democratic leader, the  Republican leader, and distinguished Republican whip in saluting House  Clerk Karen Haas for her many years of distinguished service to this  institution.   Anyone who knows her is proud of her service. On behalf of the U.S.  House of Representatives, I thank you, Karen, for the great integrity  and dedication for which you have served the people's House. Thank you  so much.   She has been magnificent.   Cheryl Johnson embodies public service and has dedicated her career  to strengthening many of the most important institutions of our  democracy, including our own.   Indeed, today is a homecoming, as Leader Hoyer has mentioned, as  Cheryl returns to the House of Representatives where she worked with  distinction and honor for Chairman Lacy Clay, Sr.--I emphasize senior-- of the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries  and Memorials; and the House Committee on Post Offices and Civil  Service Subcommittee on Investigations.   Our country is stronger for her work on the then-Committee on  Education and the Workforce to secure justice and progress for our  children and advance fairness and respect for our workers.   In the Congress, she earned the respect of all--Members and staff,  Democrats and Republicans--for being a leader of compassion, courage,  and commitment.   Cheryl returns to the House after more than a decade at the  Smithsonian Institution. Her great dedication to that American  treasure--which is the largest museum in the world--has ensured that it  will remain a source of creativity, innovation, and research for  generations to come.   Our Nation is particularly grateful for her extraordinary vision and  persistence in helping transform the dream of the National Museum of  African American History and Culture into a reality.   Cheryl has made a difference empowering millions of Americans and  visitors from abroad to explore and be inspired by the beauty and  richness of American culture and history.   Cheryl's strong leadership and deep love and respect for the  institutions of our democracy will be vital in her role as House Clerk,  strengthening and safeguarding the Congress in the tradition of Karen  and the Congress, the first branch of government, Article I.   I thank Cheryl for her commitment to our institution and to our  democracy; and with great, again, recognition and appreciation to Karen  Haas for her service.   It is now my privilege to administer the oath of office to Cheryl  Johnson.                            ____________________
