 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership on this issue before us today.   I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying bill.  Unfortunately, this is another example of the Democratic majority  putting politics over people. It is a missed opportunity to reach an  agreement on many solutions that have bipartisan support.   The Energy and Commerce Committee on which I serve is historically  the most bipartisan committee in Congress. Our record of results with  both Chairman Walden and Chairman Upton proves it. No other committee  sent more bills to the President's desk than Energy and Commerce during  their tenure.   This record of bipartisan results for the people has unfortunately  faltered under this current majority. And the process and the politics  of H.R. 2 are a perfect example of why.   It is hard, it is actually impossible, for this historic results- oriented committee to reach an agreement when there is no regular order  and we, the minority, are left out of the process.   It is easy to pass a partisan wish list for my friends across the  aisle to campaign on when you don't expect that they are going to  become law.   Instead of using the committee process to advance solutions like  rural broadband deployment, vehicle safety improvements, and American  leadership in clean energy, the majority is continuing to take the easy  way out and is more interested in scoring political points.                                time  1100    We see the continued consolidation of power and decisionmaking within  the Speaker's office.   Last Congress, this House unanimously passed the SELF DRIVE Act-- unanimous--which would have ensured the most important vehicle safety  technology of our lifetime is deployed here in America.   Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of  lives, restore independence to our seniors and people with  disabilities, and create a cleaner environment with less road  congestion.   Autonomous vehicles are our future. America could lead, America  should lead in this new era, but sadly, the majority is content to let  other countries lead. In fact, the U.S. has fallen behind since our  work on the SELF DRIVE Act. We will continue to fall behind because we  lack a national strategy and a viable path to deployment.   Other countries, like China, are not waiting for us. They are moving  full speed ahead with testing, and it is happening in our own backyard.   Last Congress, every single Democrat on the Energy and Commerce  Committee agreed that we needed to modernize the SAFETEA Act, to lead  on this transformative technology. What has changed?   If the majority was serious about addressing the nearly 40,000 deaths  on our roads each year, they would tell the well-funded trial bar  enough is enough and pursue meaningful legislation to unleash American  innovation in our auto sector, a part of a new era of American  innovation. But, no. They are more concerned with the trial bar and  their special interest groups.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  abandon this partisan messaging exercise and work with us for a new era  of innovation that will help save lives.
