 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment made in order under the  rule.    Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank my subcommittee  chairman, Mr. Lamborn, for his leadership on this, and Mr. McClintock  for bringing the bill in chief forward here that I am asking to amend  today.   This amendment ensures that State-led projects can also enjoy the  coordination that the bill itself will do, State-led surface storage  projects such as Sites Reservoir. These will be defined in the WIIN Act  and they will be eligible under H.R. 1654's permitting.   Doing so enables States to direct their own resources towards  infrastructure needs at lower cost and improves States' ability to  partner with the Federal Government on projects that provide both State  and Federal benefits.   Adopting this amendment to include State-led projects will allow the  development of more water infrastructure more rapidly and at no  additional cost to the Federal Government. For example, in my home  State of California, the voters have approved billions of dollars  toward infrastructure projects such as Sites Reservoir--not too far  from my neighborhood--which will include enough water storage for  millions more people in our State.   Now, if you know the saga of Sites Reservoir, the locals there will  tell you they have been talking about it, studying it, poking it,  prodding it for about 40 years. Bureaucracy plays a major role in that.   So the bill in chief is not looking to change environmental laws or  get rid of environmental laws. Indeed, my colleague on the other side  of the aisle talked about having an honest discussion in this area.  Well, an honest discussion would show that the bill in chief is one  that is merely coordinating. It is not changing the Water Quality Act.  It is not changing NEPA, CEQA, or anything else, other than getting  these people all in one room to coordinate at one time.   Yes, we, indeed, have costs involved, because people give up, whether  it is  [[Page H5089]]  private sector money or the people that pass bonds as State voters give  up after a while because they don't think their dollars are actually  getting to the projects, when they hear needless, endless delays, when  we have this game of bureaucratic badminton being played by various  agencies knocking one idea to another, taking years of time and  additional costs, especially those surprise ones at the last minute.   Lake Oroville is in my own backyard. Now, what we have seen there  since the crisis happened with the breakage of the spillway is that  coordination under an emergency, where, even though there are some  trying to throw roadblocks in there, people recognized coordination was  needed, because when 188,000 people have to evacuate an area due to  some unknown factors with how the infrastructure is holding up, then  they saw the need to fix it.                                time  1530    And the spillway at Lake Oroville is going to be fixed pretty rapidly  over a 2-year period and made usable in this short amount of time. So  that is how coordination can work to get a needed project done when it  can be an emergency.   What we need to quit doing is waiting for emergencies like this and  on levee projects when we know for years and years that levee  projects--highways, bridges, other infrastructure that have this  bureaucratic badminton played when people are trying to get these  projects done--need to be coordinated. That is what this bill does.   My amendment adds to it, again, an important ability for State  dollars under State-led infrastructure projects to be included in that.  So I think it makes a heck of a lot of sense and will help our voters  like in California and others around the country to be able to enjoy  that coordination.    I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague, Mr. Costa, for  his bipartisan support and effort in ensuring we have a proactive way  of doing things in California on water infrastructure. I appreciate  that a lot.   So for anybody to say that the amount of effort it takes to get past  the bureaucratic process, to simply get the existing permits under  existing laws, is not burdensome is naive. Indeed, whether we are  talking highway projects, levee projects, bridge projects, and, more  particularly, this bill, water storage projects, we need this  coordination.   So the coordination will mean more for the American people, more for  the people of my own State, with less dollars, less delay, and they can  start enjoying the fruits of this project, the fruit of their tax  dollars.   So my amendment simply adds to that, State-led efforts, whether it  has been a bond passed by a State or other State funding in California  and other States, that they, too, can enjoy that coordination that this  bill would provide.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passing and  celebrate the life of a good friend to many, Mr. Stan McEtchin. Hailing  from Vancouver, British Columbia, Stan passed away on June 9, after 92  years of enriching the lives of those around him.   For the past few decades, the small town of Paradise, California, has  known Stan as a pillar of the community, whose sculpted metal artwork  decorated shops and houses all across Butte County. But before his  creative artwork made him a local celebrity, Stan served his country in  World War II.   In 1943, he volunteered for the First Special Service Force in the  Canadian Army, an elite American and Canadian commando unit that  preceded the modern Special Operations Forces we have today. In 2014,  the man beloved for his artwork and for his charity was awarded a  Congressional Gold Medal right here in Washington, D.C., for his unit's  heroism in battle.   I consider myself fortunate to have known him just a little bit, and  our country fortunate to have gained such a good man from our northern  neighbors.   God bless his family and his memory.                            ____________________
