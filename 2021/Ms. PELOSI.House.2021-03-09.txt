 Mr. Speaker, as we gather here today to pass the PRO Act,  we are engaged in a great act of patriotism for our country.   The middle class is the backbone of our democracy. The middle class  in America has a union label on it. So as we move to strengthen  collective bargaining and the rest, we are strengthening our middle  class and our democracy. For that reason, I rise with great pride as  the House takes this historic patriotic step forward for our workers  and for justice and fairness in America.   I thank Chairman  Bobby Scott, the chair of the Education and Labor  Committee, for his leadership in the PRO Act, among other things, and  his lifelong dedication to fighting for working families.   That is what unifies us as Democrats. With all of our differences,  our unity springs from our commitment to making progress for America's  working families.   This progress is possible, because just over 4 months ago, Americans  went to the polls and elected President Biden, a champion of workers,  whose commitment to families' health and financial security is in his  DNA.   The elected Democratic majorities in Congress know that unions are  the backbone of our Nation. And as I have said for many years, the  middle class has a union label on it. It bears repeating.   Now, House Democrats are honoring that truth by, tomorrow, passing  the American Rescue Plan, which honors our heroes, healthcare workers,  first responders, transportation, sanitation, food workers, and our  teachers, many of them members of unions.   Today, we are passing the crown jewel of our pro-worker agenda, the  PRO Act.   Again, under the American Rescue Plan, we have a very significant  provision for pensions.   The PRO Act restores and strengthens the powers of unions to fight  for better wages and working conditions, which is both a moral and  economic imperative for building back better--building back our economy  better.   Unions pave the way for bigger paychecks for all, over the last 80  years, consistently providing workers with 10 to 20 percent higher  wages, benefits so strong that even nonunion workers receive better  wages.   Unions deliver greater access to affordable healthcare and a secure  retirement. Workers represented by a union are significantly more  likely to have access to health insurance through work and five times  as likely to have a defined benefit pension--and that, with Mr. Scott's  leadership, is a significant part of the American Rescue Plan, which we  will pass either later today, depending on how long it takes in the  Rules Committee, or tomorrow at the latest.   Vitally, unions are a force for justice. Union members of color have  almost five times the median wealth of their nonunion counterparts, and  unions are one of the most effective tools for closing the gender pay  gap. That is something I am so proud of and so grateful to organized  labor for, because they have done more to close the gender pay gap than  any organization you can name, except possibly, pretty soon, this  Congress may vote to have equal pay for equal work. That is something  we have passed in the House; hopefully, we can pass it in the Senate.   Yet today, unions face a brutal and existential assault waged from  courthouses, State houses, and even this House: from the disastrous  Supreme Court ruling in Janus, which trampled over the freedoms of more  than 17 million public workers; to so-called right-to-work laws, which  give employers the right to gut unions; to the GOP tax scam, giving 83  percent of the benefits to corporations and the wealthy and raising  taxes on 86 million middle-class families.   Let me just say that that GOP tax scam, which cost about $1.9  trillion--I will talk about this later, but I want to mention it here  every chance I get. Their tax scam cost about $1.9 trillion, exactly  what this bill invests in, and this bill takes half the kids in America  who are poor, out of poverty, a third of the people in poverty out of  poverty, invests in working-class families, puts vaccines in people's  arms, children back in school safely, money in people's pockets, and,  again, people back to work. It is something that will grow the economy,  as opposed to their tax scam, which just heaped mountains of debt onto  future generations.    They didn't complain when it cost $1.9 trillion to give a tax break  to the rich. They are just complaining when we are trying to lift the  American people up in the time of a pandemic, as well as the economic  crisis that accompanies it.   At the same time of all this, workers seeking to organize a union  face a surge of intimidation and retaliation from the employers and  special interests. In fact, employers are charged with violating  Federal law in the majority of all union election campaigns involving  more than 60 employees. In  [[Page H1147]]  one out of five union election campaigns, employers are charged with  illegally firing a worker participating in a union activity. Year in  and year out, big corporate employers get away with their crimes. No  accountability, no consequence; just full impunity.   We must strengthen the power of unions to negotiate for what they  need and deserve, which is why, today, we are passing the PRO Act,  because what they need and deserve is what America's workers need and  deserve.   The most comprehensive, consequential pro-worker legislation in over  80 years, the PRO Act empowers workers to exercise their basic right to  organize, including by giving workers the power to override right-to- work laws and streamlining access to justice for workers who are  retaliated against.   It holds employers accountable, reversing an unacceptable status quo  in which there are no monetary penalties for companies that violate  workers' rights, no matter how repeated or egregious the violation.                                time  1330    And it strengthens workers' access to fair and free union elections,  fixing a process that is fundamentally rigged against workers so that  they, not employers, can decide for themselves whether to join a union.   This legislation will make a tremendous difference in workers' lives,  helping combat the acceleration of economic inequality that undermines  the middle class, which has only grown worse over the past year.   In this past year, the rich have gotten so much richer. Let me tell  you how much. During the first 4 months of the pandemic, while workers  suffered record high unemployment, Mr. Speaker, American billionaires'  wealth grew by $931 billion. Extraction of money to the top.   The PRO Act is part of the Democrats' mission not only to recover  from this time of crisis, but to Build Back Better, advancing an  economy that works for every American in every ZIP Code.   As the AFL-CIO, representing over 12 million workers, writes, ``In  the midst of a global pandemic, which has killed tens of thousands of  frontline workers, it is more important than ever that working people  have the right to rely on the protection of a union contract. The PRO  Act will level the playing field to give workers a fair shot when  fighting for improvements on the job . . . The PRO Act is the first  step to restoring our middle class.''   As we pass the PRO Act, Democrats will continue our work to pass a  $15 minimum wage, secure paycheck fairness for women--that is coming up  in a couple of weeks--protect pensions--tomorrow--and lower healthcare  costs and increase paychecks for all.   I have a sweater that one of my friends gave me, and it says ``We  don't agonize, we organize.'' So I want to also embroider on there,  ``We don't agonize, we organize, we unionize,'' because that is the way  that we are going to level the playing field for America's workers.   For America's workers and middle class and for the financial security  of all Americans, I urge a strong bipartisan vote on the PRO Act.   I thank the gentleman again, our distinguished chair, Mr. Scott, for  his leadership.
