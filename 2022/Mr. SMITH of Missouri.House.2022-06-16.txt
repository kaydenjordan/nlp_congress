 Mr. Speaker, the biggest challenge facing  Missouri families right now is sky-high inflation. They know that  President Biden and Washington Democrats have only themselves to blame  for driving inflation to the highest level in 40 years.   Last month alone, inflation cost Missouri families an extra $663.  That is about the same as a monthly payment on a brand-new pickup  truck.   Gas prices are the highest they have been, at over $5 a gallon. The  cost to fill up an F-150 is over $150.   Families are paying more to put food on their tables, clothes on  their backs, and gasoline in their cars. Milk is up 15 percent. Bread  is up 14 percent. Bacon is up 18 percent.   Just yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the  third time since March. This is yet another price increase for  families, farmers, and small businesses.   The American people cannot afford to keep paying for President  Biden's mistakes.                            ____________________
