 Madam Speaker, the high cost of insulin is a crisis  gripping my district and our Nation. Time and again, my constituents  have told me they can no longer afford their insulin. The prices are so  high that many are resorting to desperate measures, like using expired  insulin, rationing their doses, or not taking it at all.   Communities of color disproportionately suffer complications of  diabetes when they can't afford insulin. I know, because my district,  which is nearly 90 percent Latino and African American, has a high rate  of diabetes. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in L.A.  County.   Tomorrow, we will have an opportunity to act. The Affordable Insulin  Now Act will ensure lifesaving insulin is affordable for millions of  Americans on private health insurance and Medicare. It will put money  back in the hands of American families.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting for its passage tomorrow.                            ____________________
