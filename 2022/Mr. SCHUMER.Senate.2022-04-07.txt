 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Now, Mr. President, the Senate gavels in this morning  for a joyous, momentous, groundbreaking day. This morning, we will vote  to end debate on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a  Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, and, later this afternoon, the  Senate will fulfill its constitutional duty to finally confirm this  remarkable and groundbreaking jurist.   The cloture vote is scheduled to take place at approximately 11 a.m.,  and we will aim to vote on final confirmation in the afternoon, the  time depending on how many Members wish to speak.   Today is a culmination--a culmination for more than 6 weeks where  this Chamber has examined and debated and questioned Judge Jackson on  her record and her qualifications. Every step of the way the judge has  proved herself exceptionally qualified, thoughtful, and prepared to  serve on the Court. As I said, she encapsulates the three b's:  brilliant, beloved, and belongs. She belongs on the Supreme Court. It  is now up to us to finish the work that the President entrusted us to  do.   So today is also a joyous celebration in another way. In the 233-year  history of the Supreme Court, never, never has a Black woman held the  title of Justice. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first, and I  believe the first of more to come.   This milestone should have happened generations ago--generations  ago--but we are always trodding on a path toward a more perfect Union.  Nevertheless, America today is taking a giant step toward making our  Union more perfect.   People sometimes talk about standing on the shoulder of giants. Well,  Judge Jackson will go down in history as an American giant upon whose  shoulders others will stand tall, and our democracy will be better off  for it.  [[Page S2058]]    I will have more to say later this afternoon, prior to the final vote  on the confirmation, but for now I want to thank Chairman Durbin of the  Senate Judiciary Committee for beautifully executing the nomination,  all the members of the Judiciary Committee for their thoughtful and  respectful--all my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for  their thoughtful and insightful examination of the judge's record, and  I want to thank those Republican Senators who chose to take this  process seriously.   So it is truly a joyous day; joyous for the Senate, joyous for the  Court, joyous for America.   Let us finish the work today of confirming Judge Jackson, finally, to  the Supreme Court of the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on the final day of the work period,  the Senate is going to pass a much sought after piece of legislation:  revoking Russia of permanent normal trade relations with the United  States.   The legislation will go a long way to landing a painful, severe blow  on Putin's economy. It will hinder his ability to keep funding his war  machine, and adds Russia, as well as Belarus, to a list of nations,  including North Korea, that are ineligible for free trade with the  United States.   I want to thank my colleague from Idaho Senator Crapo for working so  closely with me on into the night last night to make sure that this got  done.   We will also vote separately on legislation regarding an oil ban, and  I thank my colleagues who worked together to reach a compromise on this  measure. We are moving forward today.   Putin must absolutely be held accountable for the detestable and  despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine.   The images we have seen coming out of that country, most recently out  of the town of Bucha, are pure, pure evil--hundreds of civilians  murdered in cold blood; dozens of bodies of men, women, children, the  elderly, the defenseless; people with hands tied behind their backs and  left dead in the streets. Some of the bodies showed signs of torture.   According to a new report by Der Spiegel, German intelligence now  believes that some of these murders were discussed by Russian troops  over radio intercepts. And why were these people killed? Simply because  they were Ukrainians. So many were children, civilians, young people,  women. No nation whose military is committing war crimes deserves free- trade status with the United States.   Let me say that again. No nation whose military is committing war  crimes deserves free-trade status with the United States.   No vile thug like Putin deserves to stand as an equal with the  leaders of the free world. He is a menace and a pariah who has ensured  that his place in history will be one of everlasting shame.   So today's votes approving PNTR revocation are significant. It is  very important that the Senate pass this bill, and I want to thank  Senator Crapo as well as Senators Manchin and Cardin and Wyden and  Murkowski and Menendez and all others who worked in good faith with us  together on these measures. We wouldn't have reached this outcome  without their diligence and good faith.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, I want to close with a few  thoughts on what the Senate has accomplished over the past 6 weeks.   There are two words that I believe perfectly summarize the work  period we are about to conclude: productive and bipartisan.   In this work period alone, we passed a major postal reform bill over  a decade in the making; we passed a bold and robust government funding  package, which will help millions of Americans in thousands of  different ways; we passed critical emergency aid for the people of  Ukraine; we passed the Emmett Till anti-lynching bill after a century  of waiting; and topping it all off, we will confirm the 116th Justice  of the U.S. Supreme Court.   Meanwhile, before I yield, I also want to applaud the  administration's action in extending the pause on payments and interest  of Federal student loans. The pandemic continues to impact families  economically, and that is why extension is critical for so many  borrowers.   And while the extension provides relief, I continue to urge the  President to use his existing authority and cancel up to $50,000 in  debt in order to provide immediate relief to millions of borrowers,  boost our economic recovery, and help narrow the racial wealth gap in  our country.   So it has been a very busy April; it has been a very busy March work  period, and when we come back in May, it is going to be very busy  again. We have a whole lot to do.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Jackson nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. today.   For the information of the Senate, there will be a rollcall vote at  1:45 p.m. today on confirmation of the nomination of Ketanji Brown  Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  States. Senators are encouraged to be seated prior to the start of the  vote and are encouraged to cast their vote from their desks.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this is a wonderful day, a joyous day, an  inspiring day for the Senate, for the Supreme Court, and for the United  States of America.   Today, we are here to vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the  116th Justice of the United States Supreme Court.   Now, a few days ago, I spoke with a group of eighth graders from  Cheektowaga, NY. Many of them were students of color. It was amazing.  When I mentioned that this week we were confirming the judge, you could  see them light up, the unmistakable look in their eyes. ``One day,''  each young lady thought to herself, ``I can do it too.''   You know, it has been a dark 2 years with COVID--people getting sick  and dying, many of whom we knew, stores closing, and schools shutting  their doors. But even in the darkest times, there are bright lights.  Today is one of the brightest lights, and let us hope it is a metaphor,  an indication of many more bright lights to come.   As I have said over and over again, there are three words that I  think best fit Judge Jackson: brilliant, beloved, belongs.   Judge Jackson is, in every sense and by all measures, a brilliant  jurist. She is, indeed, a brilliant person. By the judge's own telling,  she first discovered her calling to the law not in a classroom or by  reading a book or by talking to lawyers but by sitting at the kitchen  table, next to her dad, filling out her coloring book while her dad  pored through case law.   Years from now, other parents and other daughters will do the same,  and it will be Justice Jackson's opinions that will lay open on the  table. The judge's parents and her entire family should beam with pride  that this day has come. At every step of her upbringing and career,  Ketanji Brown Jackson ranked among the highest of achievers.   And, look, we should take a moment to note that Judge Jackson will be  the first and only Justice with experience as a public defender. We are  proud of that, and America is proud of that. It will enhance the  Court's ability to preserve a basic truth in our country--that all  deserve equal justice under the law, from the privileged to the  impoverished. In an imperfect world, the judge conquered so many  hurdles and today stands as one of the most experienced individuals  ever nominated to the Supreme Court.   For this reason, the judge is also beloved by individuals and  organizations across the political spectrum. I went through her record  carefully, and never did I find one instance of a peer or a colleague  or an associate saying one negative word about her. It was incredible.  When we go through these records, you often find someone here or there  who will bad-mouth the individual who knew them but not with Judge  Jackson.   And, lest we forget, the judge is popular in the minds of the  American people. A Gallup poll released after her hearings showed  nearly 60 percent of the public supports her confirmation--10 points  above the historical norm. There is no question here the country, by  and large, wants the Senate to confirm Judge Jackson. Police chiefs  want to confirm Judge Jackson. Conservative and moderate and liberal  judges all want us to confirm Judge Jackson.   And I thank my colleagues in this Chamber who worked in good faith to  make sure the Senate can finish its work today.   Finally, as I have said many times, the judge belongs on the Supreme  Court. By that, I mean something very specific. In our Nation's  history, 115 individuals have been confirmed by this body to serve on  the Supreme Court of the United States. Of those, 108 have been White  men; only 5 have been women; only 2 have been African American. But  Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first African-American woman ever to  hold the title of ``Justice.''   Think about the impact that will have on our democracy. Untold  millions of kids will open textbooks and see pictures of Justice  Jackson among the highest ranks of our public figures. How many  millions of kids in generations past could have benefited from such a  role model? How many would-be Justices, lawyers, doctors, generals,  businesspeople have been lost to history precisely because their  history books had few, if any, role models that they could relate to?   We certainly have a long way to go on the road to true justice, but  by confirming Judge Jackson today, we are taking a bold step forward  toward reaching the full realization of our country's promise. We will  make it far more likely that girls across America will feel precisely  what Judge Jackson  [[Page S2069]]  felt herself when she was a kid: Nobody can stop me. I can do this too.  I am brilliant too. I belong too.   For all of these reasons, increasing the diversity of the Court has  been one of my highest priorities and one of the highest priorities of  our Senate Democratic majority of whom I am so proud.   Justice Jackson is the most important example, but we have been  working on this for over a year. Of the 58 Senate-confirmed Federal  judges since we took the majority, three-quarters have been women, and  two-thirds have been people of color. It is not just racial and gender  diversity that matters. We have strived to lift up judges who bring  diversity through their experience: more public defenders in our  courts, more civil rights lawyers, more election lawyers.   When Americans of all walks of life come before the court, they  should have confidence that those who don the robes have the ability to  walk in their own shoes, to see and understand their side of the story,  and then apply the law properly according to the facts.   One judge at a time--one judge at a time--this majority is expanding  the possibility of who merits consideration to the Bench; and I would  be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my Republican colleagues who joined  us on this occasion and over the year to achieve this goal.   In closing, I want to thank Chairman Durbin for beautifully executing  this nomination process. It was equal parts fair, thorough, and  expeditious--no easy feat in this modern Senate.   I want to thank all of my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee. You were just fabulous--every one of you--in your respectful  and insightful examination of the judge's record.   And I want to thank my Republican colleagues who chose to take this  process seriously no matter which side you voted on.   The President sent us an impressive nominee. She merited robust and  thoughtful and lively examination. I thank the Members who did  precisely that.   In short, this is one of the great moments of American history. At  the time of our Constitution's ratification, in most States, you had to  be a White male, Protestant landowner to be considered part of American  society. So, from the get-go, generations of Americans have sought to  establish the United States as a full democracy. We fought a bloody  civil war to end slavery. Women organized and reached for the ballot.  The civil rights movement brought an end to the vicious segregation of  the mid-20th century. And, today, we are taking a giant, bold, and  important step on the well-trodden path to fulfilling our country's  founding promise.   This is a great moment for Judge Jackson, but it is an even greater  moment for America as we rise to a more perfect Union.   I thank my colleagues for their work.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
