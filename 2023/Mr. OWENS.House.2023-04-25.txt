 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.  [[Page H1936]]     Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and privilege to stand in  the House today to highlight the courage of a young man, Enes Kanter  Freedom, who has dealt with the tyranny of a country that he came from.   Since becoming an American citizen, he decided to stand for those who  do not have the voices that we have here.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for being here to share these  moments with us, and to educate the American people to the fact that  freedom is something we have to fight for. Not only here, but  everywhere, there is a voice that is speaking for the things we  sometimes take for granted.   Mr. Speaker, I am very, very proud to highlight Enes Kanter Freedom's  journey. The fight exposes tyranny in Turkiye and China. I encourage  those who are watching to tune in so we can support and help those that  are truly voiceless in these other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. De La Cruz).   Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today before you as a south Texan  and an American to speak out against the human rights violations being  committed in Turkiye.                                time  1945    The Turkish Government, under the leadership of President Erdogan,  has been suppressing the basic human rights of its citizens for far too  long.   As we gather here today, thousands of innocent individuals in Turkiye  are being unjustly detained, tortured, and subjected to inhumane  treatment. Turkish authorities have shown no regard for the basic  rights and freedoms that we take for granted here in our country.   We have heard reports of journalists being arrested and imprisoned  simply for speaking out against the government. Teachers, academics,  and activists have all faced similar fates. There are countless cases  of people being detained and held without trial or evidence. This is  not acceptable in any society, let alone one that claims to be a  democracy.   However, we are not here just to talk. We are here to demand action  from President Biden and insist that he put the interests of the  American people first and take time to listen to Turkish Americans,  such as professional basketball player Enes Freedom, who has been a  vocal advocate for human rights in Turkiye.   Enes has been tirelessly fighting for the rights of the Turkish  people, and he has even faced persecution for doing so. He was forced  to give up his passport and feared for his life after being accused of  being a terrorist for simply speaking out against the government.   We cannot stand by and watch as innocent people are being subjected  to such brutality. Our top priority as Members of Congress is to care  for the American people.   The Biden administration has an entire State Department that is  supposed to advance our interests around the world. It is time for the  Biden administration to do its job.   We respect the sovereignty of other nations, but the human rights  violations in Turkiye can no longer be ignored. We are all God's  children. Let us continue to fight for a world where the human rights  of all men, women, and children are respected, regardless of where they  come from.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for her remarks. The  gentlewoman is a great addition to our Conference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis),  who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cammack), who is my favorite Gator of all time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to switch slides here in a minute.   First of all, I thank my colleagues. It has been a full day, a flying  day, yet they found the time. Many would have loved to have been here-- but they had other things going on--to speak up for a young man who had  the courage when many in the NBA league would not. He had the courage  to stand out. He had the courage to stand up because freedom is  something that many of us take for granted. He happened to be a young  man at the age of 20 who stood up against the regime that he saw  changing.   Two years ago, he started exposing the atrocities in Communist China,  a country that is very near and dear to the NBA because that is where  they get a lot of funding now and where they get a lot of profits now.  We can see that there are many who are playing the game and becoming  very, very wealthy and becoming very, very popular and getting a lot of  fame but not willing to do what Enes Kanter was able and willing to  do--to give it all--because he believes so much in the idea of freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my grave concerns regarding the  human rights abuses discussed tonight. Once a thriving democracy, the  two-decades-long ruthless regime of Erdogan has made Turkiye notorious  for human rights abuses.   For over a decade, former NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom has used his  platform to speak for the voiceless who are suffering under the tyranny  of Turkiye and Communist China.   Turkiye's oppressive behavior does not end with Enes. Journalists,  human rights activists, and protesters are jailed. His father was  jailed because he spoke up here in the United States--unjustly, to say  the least. Protesters are jailed without trial and labeled  ``terrorists'' without evidence.   Turkiye is ranked fourth globally for arresting journalists critical  of the government. Turkiye's President has also weaponized the  judiciary system to target opposition parties.   This is not democracy. This is not what a NATO ally should be  standing for or acting like.                                time  2000    Two years ago, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Turkiye  shut down the second largest political party.   Women's rights are also under threat in Turkiye, as well. The Turkish  Government withdrew from the Istanbul Convention, an international  treaty to tackle gender-based violence.   In anticipation of a formidable challenge in the upcoming general  elections in Turkiye, the regime is intimidating rival parties, voters,  and the press to sway the election results in the government's favor.   The Biden administration and other NATO allies must condemn these  heinous actions of the Turkish regime. Unfortunately, once again,  President Biden is a laggard when it comes to protection of basic human  rights and freedoms.   Though an American citizen, Turkiye put a $500,000 bounty on Enes for  calling out the abuse of power in Turkiye. President Biden, as has been  noted before, has repeatedly refused to meet with our fellow citizens.  He has also ignored the official requests from many of my fellow  Republican colleagues to do so.   The Biden administration has failed to protect one of the most  fundamental rights of every American--freedom of speech.   When Enes criticized the Chinese Communist Party for its brutality  against its own people, the NBA abruptly ended his career.   As the corporatist sports complex--NBA, NFL, and Nike--promoted the  anti-flag, anti-American, BLM, Marxist movement, it was Enes Freedom  who was speaking about the real human rights abuses being perpetrated  by the CCP.   Note here the shoe, ``end slavery.'' No slavery. That is something  that you did not see on TV, I can promise you that.   It was his voice that exposed the corporatist sports complex  hypocrisy as they chose to turn a blind eye to the misery their  business model had created for the Chinese people. Enes' criticism  culminated in the CCP's demand that he be canceled. The CCP's  cancellation of China's NBA TV coverage drove home the consequences of  not bowing to their demands. Once the NBA acted to terminate the 11- year all-star's career, the CCP allowed NBA games to once again be  aired in the Chinese market.   The NBA, NFL, and Nike's decades-old partnership with the CCP has  created a culture within the corporatist sports complex that can best  be summarized as profit over American patriotism and profit over the  Chinese people.   It is a culture that has granted credibility to the Communist Chinese  regime, a regime that has interned over 1 million Muslim Uyghurs.   It is a culture that promoted BLM rhetoric of America's systemic  racism as the global corporatists in real time profited in the billions  from slavery in China. This sports complex has discovered the financial  benefits of the 1800's slave trade, that when given scale, human  slavery is the cheapest and most profitable labor on planet Earth.   The NBA, NFL, and Nike culture of greed profit over patriotism and  profits over the Chinese people has justified them closing their eyes  to the genocide of the Muslim Uyghurs. It confirms that child labor,  human trafficking, and organ harvesting from healthy Muslim Uyghurs is  okay as long as it is out of sight and out of mind.   What the voice and action of Enes Freedom did was show the hypocrisy  of their virtue signaling. As the NBA handed out slogans to players on  their jerseys to support Black Lives Matter, he was wearing shoes that  highlighted the real issue of atrocities of slavery in China. Again,  this is what was not seen on prime time TV.   On a side note, and a personal note: Where are the activist voices of  this corporatist sports complex as throughout our country hopeless  Black youth callously kill each other by the thousands?   Where are their BLM slogans and messages on the sidelines as in every  urban city our education system betrays at-risk kids by the millions?   Where is the presence and voice of the sports complex whose very  survival  [[Page H1938]]  depends on 70 to 80 percent of Black talent?   Mr. Speaker, the corporatist sports complex of the NFL, NBA, Nike  could care less about Black lives, Muslim lives, Asian lives, White  lives, or American lives. For them, it is indeed profit that matters.  If turning their backs on their loyal fans here in America and  betraying the values that have made us the greatest country in the  history of mankind, so be it. Profit over patriotism.   One of the values that the Republican Conference holds dear and will  make clear is loyalty to our fellow countrymen and women. Turkiye,  remove the bounty off Enes Kanter Freedom and any other American  citizen. If not, there will be legislative action from this body, I can  promise you.   We call on the Turkish Government to release all political prisoners  and cease its persecution of the Hizmet movement and its members. We  expect a NATO ally to respect free speech and assembly and to uphold  its international obligations to protect human rights.   Let us not be the generation that history looks back on as one of  moral indifference.   Let us not be the generation that is compared to the 1800s pre-Civil  War era when industries flourished from the demands of cotton as they  betrayed their commitment to our human rights of life, liberty, and  pursuit of happiness.   Enes Kanter Freedom has shown the bold courage, tenacity, and empathy  that defines our American way. For the millions who depend on American  resolve to remain the shining city on the hill, we are committed to  freedom and liberty in every corner of the world. We must stand, rise,  support those Americans who speak and stand for freedom and the freedom  of speech. Let's make sure as Americans we are not looked at as the one  who dropped the ball in this case.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
