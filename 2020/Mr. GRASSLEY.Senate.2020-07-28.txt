 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, I want to talk about the World Trade  Organization. I have said what I am going to say now before. So I want  to say it again: The United States must reaffirm its commitment to  significant reform of the World Trade Organization. The United States  must move to revitalize that organization because the World Trade  Organization advances the cause of free and fair global trade, and they  necessarily do it because of the modern economy we are in.   It is imperative that we continue to double down on the efforts that  demonstrate the United States' leadership at Geneva, the headquarters  of the World Trade Organization. That includes our efforts to reform  the World Trade Organization appellate body, to work on subsidies that  too many countries are using, and to continue ongoing negotiations to  accomplish these goals.   The World Trade Organization can and should play an important role in  the global economic recovery from our virus pandemic. I urge the  administration and my colleagues here in the Senate to advocate for our  interests. I urge the Trump administration to confront trade  distortions, and most importantly, this administration must encourage  all World Trade Organization members to unite in an effort to lift us  out of the nearly unprecedented global downturn we have had in trade  because of the virus pandemic.   I yield the floor                            ____________________
