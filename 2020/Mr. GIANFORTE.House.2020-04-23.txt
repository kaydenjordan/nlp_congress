 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of reopening  the Paycheck Protection Program after an unnecessary lapse in funding.   In just 2 weeks after the launch, the program provided over 13,000  loans in Montana, totaling $1.4 billion. It has helped small businesses  stay open and keep workers on the payroll.   But as the well quickly ran dry on this critical lifeline for small  businesses and workers, the Speaker and the Senate Democratic Leader,  Chuck Schumer, stood on the sidelines and failed to work with  Republicans to keep this program running.   When Senate Majority Leader McConnell moved to increase funding,  Democrats objected, refusing to allow immediate action. That is  outrageous.   At last, we are doing the right thing by small businesses and  workers, but it is overdue, and it has been needlessly held up with  partisan games.   I urge my colleagues to stand with small businesses and workers today  and pass the Paycheck Protection Program.
