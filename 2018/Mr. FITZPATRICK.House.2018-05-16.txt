 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform the House about  our team's work on behalf of women in my district and across the  Nation.   Last month, data from Yale University gynecologists demonstrated that  between 2 percent and 10 percent of American women undergoing  gynecological operations end up having missed cancers. It is shocking  to think that these cancers are found only after women undergo these  surgeries. These missed cancers are at high risk of being spread by the  very surgeries these women are undergoing to help them.   My physician constituents, like the Reed family, tell me that this  represents an unacceptable and seismic epidemic of undiagnosed  gynecological cancers that are prone to spread and upstaging with  catastrophic results.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I have asked the CDC to immediately consider  guiding gynecologists towards the use of more precise preoperative  tissue biopsy methods in order to identify the women at risk. I am now  awaiting a response from CDC leadership with a plan of action aimed at  containing what is likely to be a shocking epidemic of undiagnosed  gynecological cancers in American women.   Mr. Speaker, we must stay focused on this situation in order to  protect all women from this grave health risk.                             National Police Week     Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, and  I am proud to recognize a member of the law enforcement community in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose quick thinking delivered justice to a  survivor of abuse.   Officer Michael Marks of the Middletown Township Police Department  promptly and professionally investigated an allegation of abuse of a  nonverbal patient who had suffered blunt force trauma. His diligence  led to a grand jury inquiry, which ultimately brought charges against a  caretaker, who was later found guilty. Because of the work of Officer  Marks, this individual will no longer be able to prey on the  defenseless members of our community.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally thank Officer Marks for his  work in defending our community and send a message to all of my  neighbors in Middletown Township that they are undoubtedly safer for  having him on our police force.                  Recognizing Makefield Women's Association     Mr. Speaker, over the past year, women all over our  country collectively raised their voices and are continuing to change  our culture for the better.   Today, I would like to recognize a group of women in our district  actively working to make Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a better place.  The Makefield Women's Association in Yardley last month donated over  $27,000 to local charities, including: A Woman's Place, the Family  Service Association Emergency Homeless Shelter, the Penndel Community  Food Pantry, Wrapping Presence, and the Yardley-Makefield Volunteer  Fire Company.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the Makefield Women's  Association, which greatly improves the quality of life for our  community. I would especially like to thank the organization's  president, Jennifer Ketler, for her leadership and for her service.                            ____________________
