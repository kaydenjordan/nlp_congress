 Madam Speaker, across our country, parents  are facing a new and scary reality this summer. As soccer camps and  Little League games get back underway, there is a new and growing crime  crisis that is threatening our communities.   Just last week, President Biden made the extraordinarily false  comment that crime is down. President Biden is wrong. We are seeing a  rise in crime throughout American cities.   In Philadelphia, there have been 315 homicides this year, an increase  of over 35 percent from last year. This is unacceptable.   The people living in our communities deserve to feel safe. While  families worry about the growing crime crisis, liberal leaders have  turned their backs and failed to protect our neighborhoods.   Across the country, mayors and community leaders have condemned the  police officers and joined protests calling to defund law enforcement.  They have failed to support our police officers as the police officers  are battling, firsthand, this crime wave. This dangerous rhetoric makes  our communities less safe. Now is definitely not the time to defund the  police.   Tragically, ambush-style attacks on law enforcement have increased 91  percent since last year. These attacks have been deadly, and  unfortunately, 155 police officers have given their lives in the line  of duty.   This is not the time to play games, and this is not the time to cut  funding for body armor and safety equipment that protect our officers  who are on the front lines.   Now more than ever, we must stand with our law enforcement officers.  We must stand with our heroes to keep us safe each and every day. We  must ensure that they have the tools and the training to protect  themselves from harm while they protect us and protect our communities.   Now is the time to back the blue.   Now is the time to support our law enforcement.   Now is the time to speak out against the dangerous rhetoric that puts  the lives of the men and women in blue in danger.                            ____________________
