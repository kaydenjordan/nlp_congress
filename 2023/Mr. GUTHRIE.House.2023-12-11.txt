 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  5378, the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act.   Over the past several years, I have heard from countless Kentuckians  about the challenges they face and the pain they are feeling due to  rising healthcare costs. This bipartisan, landmark legislation marks  the first step in driving transformational change across our healthcare  system.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act incorporates transparency  requirements in nearly every aspect of the healthcare system. We are  building on the Trump-era price transparency rules for hospitals and  insurance plans. We are requiring pharmacy benefit managers to disclose  prices and fees to lower costs for patients and employers. We are even  requiring transparency for clinical labs.   We have countless testimonials and data to show that transparency  lowers costs. Recently, a multinational equipment manufacturer fired  their PBM and started managing their own prescription drug benefits for  its employees because they finally understood what they were being  charged.   The most important part about this bill is that, for once, it is not  a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach to the cost of healthcare.   The American people have given Congress this mandate, with over 95  percent of surveyed voters supporting healthcare price transparency to  reduce healthcare costs, according to a 2022 KFF poll.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act directly lowers costs that  seniors are paying out of pocket for certain drugs like cancer drugs  and other medicines administered in doctors' offices that are owned by  hospitals.   Seniors receiving Medicare should not be paying more for a drug based  solely off the location of where they receive the drug. We are fixing  this.   I should note that we are able to get major policy changes in this  legislation while making sure the bill saves the American people money,  an estimated $700 million. This is an objective that Congress very  rarely prioritizes.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Rodgers for her vision and steadfast  leadership on this bill. I will proudly be casting a ``yes'' vote on  H.R. 5378, and I urge my House colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H6790]]  (H.R. 4531) to reauthorize certain programs that provide for opioid use  disorder prevention, recovery, and treatment, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Section 1903(m)(9)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1396b(m)(9)(A)) is amended by striking ``(and before fiscal       year 2024)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of my bill, H.R.  4531, the Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act.   Over the past 2 years, we have lost over 200,000 Americans to drug  overdoses and poisonings. This is a step in the wrong direction, as the  United States saw decreases in year-over-year drug overdoses between  2018 and 2019.   Tragically, our best efforts to drive down these overdose rates were  disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which left millions of Americans  isolated and shuttered from support systems that helped those  struggling with substance use disorder stay on track.   These statistics show the policies and programs we enacted in 2018  were working prior to the pandemic. However, since 2018 we have seen  the horrors that illicit fentanyl and other illicit substances, like  xylazine, have caused our local communities.   In the past 3 years, over 70 percent of all drug overdoses in the  Commonwealth of Kentucky have been the direct result of poisonings from  fentanyl or fentanyl-related substances.   Earlier this year, I convened an Energy and Commerce Health  Subcommittee field hearing in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where we heard  firsthand accounts from law enforcement and treatment providers about  the harsh realities of the crisis.   We heard the heart-wrenching testimony from Michael Straley, who lost  daughter, Leah, a few years ago to fentanyl poisoning, underscoring the  daily stresses of families with loved ones battling substance use  disorder. That work has helped inform the bill before us today.   We are reauthorizing important programs such as State-level  prescription drug monitoring programs, residential treatment for  pregnant and postpartum women, and other prevention, treatment, and  recovery services.   We are also placing xylazine into schedule III of the Controlled  Substances Act, while maintaining access for veterinarians and ranchers  to use in animals.   Xylazine is an emerging lethal street drug that is a unique threat as  it is not an opioid, and so it does not respond to FDA-approved opioid  reversal medications.   That said, H.R. 4531 provides even greater access for treatment  providers to use Federal funds to purchase over-the-counter opioid  overdose reversal medications, which we know have helped reduce opioid  overdose rates in communities across the country.   We are also building on important steps we took in 2018 to help those  who rely on the Medicaid program access care.   We are permanently requiring Medicaid programs to provide lifesaving  medication-assisted treatment. We are permanently codifying the  flexibility for States to waive outdated policies that prevent  vulnerable individuals from seeking comprehensive wraparound and  substance use disorder care. We are also assisting foster care youth by  ensuring they do not lose their Medicaid services if they are receiving  the behavioral care they need at qualified residential treatment  programs.   Finally, the legislation before us today promotes access to long-term  recovery and support services like workforce training for individuals  in recovery.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democratic colleague,  Representative  [[Page H6795]]  Ann Kuster, for her help on this important legislation and historical  leadership on addressing the opioid crisis.   I also thank all of my colleagues for working with us to ensure the  policies of H.R. 4531 are fully offset, which was essential to ensuring  this legislation could get to this point.   Again, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for working with me on  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4531, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), who is the chair of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Nunn), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chair of the committee, the ranking  member, and the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) all working  together to solve this problem which every American family is facing or  knows of someone or has some relation to someone who is. This touches  everybody far and wide, urban and rural, suburbs and small towns.  Particularly in my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we have  really had families just devastated by this.   We have to close the border. We have to get a handle on what is  coming across the border. We have to make sure that we have things in  place to prevent people from bringing these to our young people and  adults. We are here today, though, to make sure those who have this  substance use disorder have access to proper care, the opportunity to  not just recover, but to have full and productive lives.   We believe that on both sides of the aisle, and we have worked  together for this. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3226) to reauthorize the Prematurity Research Expansion and  Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3226         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``PREEMIE Reauthorization Act       of 2023''.       SEC. 2.

(2) The factors that impact pre-term birth rates.        (3) Opportunities for earlier detection of premature birth       risk factors, including--        (A) opportunities to improve maternal and infant health;       and        (B) opportunities for public health programs to provide       support and resources for parents in-hospital, in non-      hospital settings, and post-discharge.        (c) Analysis.--The analysis required by this subsection is       an analysis of--        (1) targeted research strategies to develop effective       drugs, treatments, or interventions to bring at-risk       pregnancies to term;        (2) State and other programs' best practices with respect       to reducing premature birth rates; and        (3) precision medicine and preventative care approaches       starting early in the life course (including during       pregnancy) with a focus on behavioral and biological       influences on premature birth, child health, and the       trajectory of such approaches into adulthood.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today firmly committed to the principle  that every life is worth living. That starts with giving babies born  prematurely a fighting chance at growing up and living their lives to  the fullest.   In 2021, the preterm birth rate increased to 10.5 percent, which was  the highest recorded rate since 2007. Last year, 1 in 10 babies were  born prematurely.   Premature babies have a higher risk of infant mortality,  developmental delays, and chronic health conditions.   This is why I rise today in support of H.R. 3226, the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act of 2023, led by Energy and Commerce Committee  members Dr. Burgess and Dr. Miller-Meeks, Health Subcommittee Ranking  Member Eshoo, and Representative Robin Kelly.   The legislation would reauthorize programs that are critical to  Federal research, education, and intervention activities to reduce  preterm birth and infant mortality.   The bill would also authorize a study to identify best practices to  help detect and prevent preterm births as well as better understand the  factors that lead to such births.   This critical legislation will help to reduce preterm births and  ensure that babies have effective treatments to give them the best  start in life.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I think Ms. Eshoo just stepped off the floor, Mr. Speaker, but my  good friend from California announced she is not running for  reelection. She is the primary sponsor of this bill in the House, and  it is an important bill.   All life is important. It is important that we move forward and give  everybody an equal chance to live a full, productive, and happy life.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill.   I appreciate my friend from California, Mr. Speaker, for all of her  hard work. We will miss her, but we have another year to continue to  work on good things like this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
