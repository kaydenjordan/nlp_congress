Ashley works closely with each of her students as she is committed to  supporting their academic growth. She knows building a relationship  with each child is imperative in nurturing them to be successful.   Ashley also works with her fellow educators in connecting with  students and their parents.

Lindsay records her classroom lessons so her students can listen to  them at home while doing their homework. She does this in the event one  may be struggling with a topic. During the COVID pandemic, Lindsay  would go to a student's home to help with a lesson and gives one-on-one  tutoring during her free time. She wants her students to know she is  always there for them and does her best for their success.   Lindsay currently teaches grades sixth and eighth grade mathematics  at Blountstown High School. She graduated from Chipola College in 2008,  earning her associate of arts degree in general education.

Teaching was different from Tara's original career plan. She  initially wanted to be a biologist, but coaching volleyball at Franklin  County High School made her want to be involved with students. She felt  she was making more of an impact on the lives of others and decided to  change careers. Tara finds teaching to be a fulfilling job and allows  her to serve her community. She has worked with students in sixth,  seventh, and eighth grade science. At the high school level, she taught  marine science, biology, environmental science, and math for college  readiness. She is currently in her 9th year of teaching and teaches  forensic science.   Tara graduated as valedictorian at Apalachicola High School in 2006.  She earned her bachelor's degree in environmental science from the  University of West Florida in 2011. She worked 5 years for the Florida  Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Fish and  Wildlife Conservation Commission. Since becoming a teacher, she has sat  on the homecoming and graduation committees and is president of the  Franklin County Teachers Association.   I offer my deepest gratitude and best wishes to Tara for her  commitment to her students. I look forward to hearing about her  continued success as she enters working in school administration and  completes her master's degree in educational leadership from the  University of West Florida.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I recognize Joselyn Leon, the Palm  Beach County Teacher of the Year, from Belle Glade Elementary School in  Belle Glade, FL.   Joselyn's students serve as her biggest inspiration. She believes she  is making a positive impact in the world through her work with them.  She is known for her in-depth planner that details each activity.  Joselyn knew she wanted to be a teacher because of her passion for  working with kids. She prayed for guidance in her career and found  teaching to be the answer. While teaching is her official job, Joselyn  does not consider it a job because she loves what she does.   Joselyn became a fifth-grade teacher at Belle Glade Elementary School  because she wanted to give back to her community. In 2017, she joined  the School District of Palm Beach County and, shortly after, was named  the school's Beginning Teacher of the Year.   I convey my sincere gratitude and best wishes to Jocelyn for her  devotion to her students.
