 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize  Audubon Greenwich as it celebrates 75 years of dedication to the  protection and preservation of local bird species and their habitats.   Founded in 1943, the organization began as the Greenwich Main  Sanctuary, thanks to the property gifted by Eleanor and Hall Clovis.  This sanctuary is recognized as the National Audubon Society's first  educational nature center. Two years later, Audubon Greenwich expanded  thanks to the donation of the Fairchild Wildflower Sanctuary by Mrs.  Elon Huntington Hooker and garden clubs in the area.   For three-quarters of a century, Audubon Greenwich has continued to  expand its impact on protecting local wildlife. Today, 686 acres of  protected habitat, including seven sanctuaries, provide protection for  many species of birds. Though the organization's underlying focus is to  support Important Bird Areas and protect bird species of concern,  Audubon Greenwich has an even wider ranging set of goals. As part of  the National Audubon Society, they advocate for far-reaching innovative  steps to reduce the impact of global climate change, prevent air and  water pollution, and reduce pesticide use, among other missions.   One of the most notable aspects of Audubon Greenwich is how  accessible it is to the public. For 75 years, the sanctuaries have  welcomed people to visit and explore, appreciating the preserved areas  and the wildlife that resides there. Audubon Greenwich now sees over  20,000 visitors every year. The sanctuaries, nature center, and trails  provide many opportunities for public learning and enjoyment, enhanced  by the organization's nature education programs for children and  adults.   Audubon Greenwich boasts an array of bodies of water, forests, an  apple orchard, and even original New England homestead buildings. Their  conservation efforts play a vital role in keeping Greenwich and the  surrounding area safe for wildlife and well preserved.   Dedicated to preserving the past and preparing natural ecosystems and  people for the future, Audubon Greenwich is a positive model for  environmental education and wildlife conservation. I applaud its  accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating  Audubon Greenwich on 75 years of excellence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Connecticut Commission on Human Rights  [[Page S6913]]  and Opportunities, CHRO, as they celebrate 75 years of dedication to  eliminating discrimination and seeking equal opportunity for everyone  throughout the State regardless of their gender, race, nationality,  sexual orientation, disability, or other personal characteristics.   Founded in 1943 as the Inter-racial Commission, the commission is the  oldest State-sponsored civil rights agency in the United States.  Originally, it researched ways to provide equal opportunities and  employment to everyone in Connecticut. Thanks to the Fair Employment  Practices Act, which the State implemented in 1947, the commission was  provided the legal authority to investigate employment discrimination  complaints, conduct hearings, and enforce the law.   Throughout the years, CHRO jurisdiction has expanded, including  research, public education, and working with other groups in order to  enact positive change. The commission's research division helped lay  the groundwork for greater civil rights laws in Connecticut. The agency  changed its name during the peak of the American civil rights movement  after Governor John Dempsey responded in 1967 to Martin Luther King,  Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech by calling a Governor's conference on  human rights and opportunities to put words into action.   Now able to help with individual complaints, CHRO works to ensure  compliance with Connecticut human rights laws, including those  requiring affirmative action in State agency personnel practices and  State contract compliance laws. The agency further assists the people  of Connecticut by bringing civil enforcement efforts against illegal  discrimination in public accommodations, housing, employment, and  credit transactions. Over the past three-quarters of a century, the  commission has unfailingly sought to achieve its goals for the benefit  of every person in the State.   Tirelessly devoted to eradicating discrimination and creating justice  and equal opportunity for all Connecticut residents, CHRO is a catalyst  for positive change. I applaud the commission's accomplishments and  hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Connecticut  Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities on their 75 years of  advocacy, education, research, and assistance.                            ____________________
