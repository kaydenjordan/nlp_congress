 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the  humanitarian and national security crisis happening as we speak in my  district.   The flood of migrants at the International Bridge in Del Rio has  highlighted the vulnerabilities we have in both our immigration system  and as a Nation. That is why I rise today to speak in opposition to the  previous question.    We need much-needed commonsense reforms to provide the Border Patrol  with more advanced technology, supplemental boots on the ground, and  additional support to secure our southern border through  infrastructure.   In order to prevent an event like this from happening again, there  needs to be substantial policy changes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question.
