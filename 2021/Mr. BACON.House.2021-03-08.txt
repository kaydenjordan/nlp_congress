 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of  Omaha's last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, Robert Holts, who passed away  on February 12 at his retirement home in Bellevue.   He joined the still-segregated U.S. Army in November 1942, and  quickly landed in an aviation training program that would lead to a  slot in the 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Not only  did he and other members make history as the first all-Black unit, but  they also made history through their exemplary service, and they  changed America for the better and forever.   The famed Tuskegee Airmen protected Allied bombers during the last 2  years of World War II. They were the first group of African-American  military pilots and airmen in the U.S. Army Air Corps, and Holts was  one of the 21 Tuskegee Airmen that had ties to Omaha.   Holts continually surmounted the challenges of racism, segregation  policies, and the Great Depression faced in his life.   Born in 1924, Holts attended Kellom Elementary School and Omaha  Central High School. Holts had a strong high school record, and he was  given the opportunity to join an aviation program that flew P-51  Mustangs. They became known as the Tuskegee Airmen, a nod to the name  of the base they trained at. More than 15,000 missions were flown by  the Tuskegee Airmen, and they destroyed 261 German aircraft.    After the war, Holts worked as a U.S. Postal Service employee for  nearly 40 years before settling in North Omaha near family. A little  more than 60 years later, Holts and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen were  awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their heroic actions in World  War II. Not only have they been lauded for their actions as fighters  for our country in a world war, but as fighters for civil rights for  all.   Our country is better and stronger because of the Tuskegee Airmen and  heroes like Robert Holts. We shall always remember the legacy of Robert  Holts.                      Honoring Gina Ponce and B.C. Clark     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor two women from our  district for Women's History Month because of their commitment to  advancing opportunities and experiences for women. Gina Ponce and B.C.  Clark are historymakers, as they work to empower women in our  community.   Born and raised in the Bronx, Gina has been in Nebraska for 25 years  and is the mother of two sons and grandmother to one granddaughter. She  credits her father as her inspiration in serving others, as he led by  example in his service to the community.   Gina has been in her current position as director of Latino community  outreach at Bellevue University since 2015, where she is responsible  for managing outreach and admissions including the Latino community.   She sees her two biggest accomplishments as founding the Women on a  Mission nonprofit 11 years ago and opening the El Camino Latino Center  at Bellevue University. Women on a Mission engages in outreach to build  up and empower women and girls spiritually, physically, and  emotionally.   Recent awards she received include the 2020 Heartland United for  Puerto Rico Award, the 2017 Women of Color Leadership Award, and the  2013 Latina of the Year. However, Gina says she sees her award every  day in the success of those she has helped, and she credits her own  success to the passion and gifts that come out of the South Omaha  community.   Also passionate about assisting women in their visions and dreams is  the founder and president of the Metro Omaha Women's Business Center,  B.C. Clark. She continues to inspire women and accelerate their success  by creating economic opportunities through programs offered by her  center. Those opportunities include a monthly business forum, quarterly  Success Series, and various workshops and trade shows to educate,  inspire, and encourage entrepreneurs and businessowners.   In 2014, B.C. also started the Business Connection Nebraska, a local  television show on public access TV, where she showcases businessowners  from across the State. She is also a well-respected speaker and mentor  for several community and minority business groups, where her knowledge  of how to increase profitability and operational efficiency, as well as  satisfy customer expectations, has helped many businessowners excel  professionally.   In addition, B.C. volunteers at Carole's House of Hope, where she  mentors inner-city young women. She is a former president of the  Midlands Latino Community Development Center, encouraging and promoting  Latino businesses.   B.C. credits her faith as a factor in her own achievement and is  quick to recognize others who have helped her in her quest to help  others find success. She also recognizes that a belief in yourself will  make you successful. As she told her own granddaughters: ``You don't  have to wait for a man to give you a diamond ring. If you want it, you  can work for it.''   Both Gina Ponce and B.C. Clark are role models not only for women,  but for our community, as they have demonstrated their service to help  others succeed. Because of leaders such as they, the numbers of  businesses owned by women in the United States has increased by 114  percent in the last 20 years, and 64 percent of new women-owned  businesses were started by women of color.                            ____________________
