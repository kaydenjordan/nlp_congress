 Mr. President, before I start my remarks, I want to  underscore how valuable the Department of Defense fellows program is to  our individual offices. I can tell you firsthand that Captain Ng's  presence in my office has given me capacity to deal with issues  concerning appointments that I have or issues that are pending in  Congress of a military nature.   For those of us who have never served in the military service, having  someone like Captain Ng in our office is incredibly important. I really  want to underscore that and thank all of our Defense fellows for the  services they are performing for our country.   Mr. President, on May 22 of this year, I stood before this body and  expressed my deep concerns about the media reports that President Trump  was considering granting pardons to certain U.S. military personnel who  had been convicted of committing war crimes in both Iraq and  Afghanistan.   Now 6 months later, President Trump has followed through with setting  a very dangerous precedent, pardoning three military personnel of war  crimes, two who were found guilty under the U.S. military's Uniform  Code of Military Justice and one whose trial never concluded.   President Trump's pardons significantly disrupt the foundations of  our own institutions, particularly the U.S. military.   First, President Trump's pardons cause confusion for our military  servicemembers on what actions are acceptable on the battlefield--an  already difficult task given the complexity of war. Second, he  undermines the military justice system. Finally, these pardons degrade  America's global standing and influence.   Stephen Preston, a former General Counsel at the Department of  Defense, wrote the following in the Department of Defense Law of War  Manual in June of 2015:         The law of war is part of who we are. . . . [T]he laws of       war have shaped the U.S. Armed Forces as much as they have       shaped any other armed force in the world. The law of war is       part of our military heritage, and obeying it is the right       thing to do. . . . [T]he self-control needed to refrain from       violations of the law of war under stresses of combat is the       same good order and discipline necessary to operate       cohesively and victoriously in battle.    The Law of War Manual goes on to outline the five interdependent  principles that serve as the foundation of the law of war: One,  military necessity; two, humanity; three, proportionality; four,  distinction; and five, honor.   These principles are pillars of American values and the guideposts we  expect America's sons and daughters to operate within so they remain  trusted and respected by all citizens of the world. President Trump's  ill-advised pardons have placed those pillars on shaky ground. He has  blurred the lines of morality for our troops and has disregarded the  constitutional values the Founding Fathers set forth.   By virtue of their oath and training, members of the U.S. military  are accountable for their individual and collective actions through the  Uniform Code of Military Justice.   Department of Defense policy states:         Each member of the armed services has a duty to: (1) comply       with the laws of war in good faith; and (2) refuse to comply       with clearly illegal orders to commit violations of the law       of war.    Two of these military personnel President Trump pardoned were found  guilty of violating the law of war through the prescribed Department of  Defense investigative and judicial processes. They violated  international and domestic law, and they failed to uphold their  constitutional oath. President Trump's pardons of war crimes erode the  trust, confidence, and the legal and moral authority of the military  justice system. He never gave the military justice system a chance to  work and determine all the facts surrounding the third individual whom  he pardoned.   Our own Commander in Chief has now compromised and degraded the  integrity of the U.S. military judicial system--a system America relies  on to maintain good order and discipline within the ranks of our  millions of uniformed servicemembers.  [[Page S6742]]    Perhaps most important and most damaging, President Trump's actions  have eroded America's moral standing and global influence.   That erosion emboldens our adversaries to cite our actions in  committing and justifying their own war crimes. Have we become a  country that now justifies and embraces the type of acts that occurred  at My Lai during Vietnam or Abu Ghraib in Iraq? Will we continue to  allow horrific acts committed by rogue actors who strategically  diminish America's global standing?   Moving forward, how will other nations trust the United States to  implement and enforce the law of war, as required by our own domestic  laws, policy, regulations, and orders, and by the multiple treaty  obligations with other countries?   Our Nation cannot tolerate crimes committed by rogue actors who  violate their oaths and who turn their backs on American laws and  values. If our government does not hold those individuals accountable  for their actions, the United States will never recover from the  strategic losses they incur. Under no circumstance is adopting the  behavior of our worst adversaries ever justified, ever.   Just as we seek to hold foreign actors accountable for war crimes, we  also have an obligation to hold ourselves accountable. We cannot  willfully allow our institutions or the individuals who serve them to  deviate from the laws and standards of conduct that underpin our great  Nation, but that is precisely what President Trump has done. Our former  colleague, Senator John McCain, suffered many years of torture at the  hands of the North Vietnamese captors. Nonetheless, he stood in this  Chamber to decry our use of the same tactics. He said: ``This question  isn't about our enemies. It is about us. It is about who we were, who  we are, and who we aspire to be. It is about how we represent ourselves  to the world. Our enemies act without conscience. We must not.''   Senator McCain was correct. Great power competition with our  adversaries is not just about who wins on a battlefield; ultimately, it  is about preserving international recognized norms and values that  uphold the rule of law, individual freedoms, and human dignity. If the  U.S. fails to be the global champion of current international norms and  democratic values, then our adversaries will replace those values with  their own ideology predicated on intimidation, fear, and violent  oppression.   The United States must not willfully commit or condone war crimes. We  must bring those who commit them to justice, regardless of citizenship,  affiliation, or background. Even in the fog of war--especially in the  fog of war--we must so act. We must always endeavor to act with moral  clarity and preserve the international norms and values that took so  long and have cost so many American lives to establish.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an inspiring  young man, Ellis McKennie. I had the good fortune of getting to know  Ellis when he was an intern in my office, first in the summer of 2018  in my State office and then again this past summer in Washington. He  was a diligent worker, always searching for ways to help. He was keen  to take advantage of every opportunity to learn. One thing that became  obvious right away is that Ellis is an empathetic young man; in one  instance, as a youngster, he asked his mother to make lunches for less  fortunate fellow students. I am very grateful to Ellis for his service  to the people of Maryland during his internships and for his service to  the University of Maryland as the epitome of a student athlete. Ellis  has been an offensive lineman on the Terrapins' football team for the  last 4 years. Perhaps more important than his leadership on the field,  though, has been his leadership off the field, where he has advocated  fiercely for meaningful athletic reform in the wake of his boyhood  friend and teammate Jordan McNair's tragic death from heatstroke last  year. Ellis has worked hard to mobilize his teammates and the entire  campus to become more engaged politically. In recognition of his  ability to bring people together for positive change, the student body  elected Ellis to the university senate this year.   Somehow, among Ellis's football career, activism, and student  governance, he has also found time to set an exemplary academic record,  twice earning All-Big Ten academic honors and completing his  undergraduate degree in just 3 years. Now, while he plays his final  season for the Terrapins, he is busy earning a graduate degree in  public policy. Next, Ellis plans to attend law school and hopes to  serve as an elected official 1 day, perhaps here in the Senate.   I have been so impressed by everything that Ellis has been able to  accomplish at such a young age and by everything that he aspires to  achieve in the future. Most of all, I am proud of his enduring  commitment to building community, helping those in need, and fighting  for what's right. Young people like Ellis should reassure all of us  that the future of our country is in capable hands.   On November 20, the Baltimore Sun ran an article by Don Markus  entitled ``Maryland's Ellis McKennie found his voice when Jordan McNair  died. Now he looks to finish his career strong.'' The article captures  the qualities that make Ellis such a special young man. I ask unanimous  consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Maryland's Ellis McKennie Found His Voice When Jordan McNair Died. Now                   He Looks To Finish His Career Strong.                              (By Don Markus)         Ellis McKennie spent his first three years at Maryland as a       nondescript reserve offensive lineman, redshirting his first       season after graduating from McDonogh and serving as a       little-used backup the next two.        It took the death of Jordan McNair--a fellow offensive       lineman who had been more like a little brother since they       grew up on the same street in Randallstown--for McKennie to       find his voice.        It then took McKennie getting a role this season, briefly       as a versatile reserve and then as a starter in seven games       at four positions, to have the platform to use it.        ``As someone who's a leader on this team. I feel confident       to express the feelings and attitude of the team,'' McKennie       said last week, sitting in the auditorium of the Gossett Team       House. ``I'm that way to Coach [Mike Locksley], too.        ``I'm on the leadership council and I'm one of the guys       coach is asking, `Where do you think the team's at?' I'm that       voice for him and when the media comes asking the same       questions. I'm confident that I can represent the team in a       good way in the public light.''        Going into Saturday's senior day matchup with Nebraska (4-      6, 2-5 Big Ten), McKennie is hoping that he can help Maryland       (3-7, 1-5) end a five-game losing streak.        ``I can't stress how important it is for us to beat       Nebraska.'' McKennie said. ``I can still remember singing the       alma mater after the Syracuse game [a 63-20 win on Sept 7]       thinking. `I can't wait to do this some more this season.' If       that's the last time I get to sing the alma mater at Maryland       Stadium, that'll be tough for me to handle. I'm going to do       whatever I can to get this win.''        McKennie's role as a leader for the Terps began to evolve       in the weeks and months after the 19-year-old McNair's death       from heatstroke in June 2018.        It was McKennie and then-sophomore center Johnny Jordan who       were designated to speak when the still-grieving team met       with the media for the first time in late August.        It was McKennie who carried the flag with McNair's jersey       number--79--out for the 2018 season opener at FedEx Field and       waved it after the Terps upset than-No. 23 Texas, 34-29.        It was also McKennie who walked out with a couple of his       teammates from a team meeting after former coach DJ Durkin,       who had been put on administrative leave in the aftermath of       McNair's death, had briefly been reinstated in late October.       Durkin was fired by university President Wallace D. Loh the       following day.        ``They say in the face of tragedy that people get closer       together, and that's what happened on this team,'' McKennie       said. ``We lost a brother, but at the same time, when you go       through something like that with a group of people and you       come out the other side, you have a different kind of       relationship with them. That role during that whole time       period just kind of fluidly turned into a leadership role on       the field this season.''        Jodi McKennie wasn't surprised that her middle child became       the de facto team spokesman among the Maryland players.        ``From the time he was a little boy, he was the most       empathetic child you could meet,'' she said last week. ``He       could not stand to see anyone he thought was suffering in any       way.''        It meant asking his mother to make extra lunches for other       kids who didn't have food  [[Page S6752]]       at home to bring to school or to have her put money on the       accounts of less fortunate students. At Maryland, it took       shape McNair's death.        The leadership piece took over because he is definitely led       by his moral compass, and that comes from understanding right       from wrong and what happened to Jordan was so hard on him       that he could no longer be quiet,'' Jodi McKennie said.        His father's five-year stint as the boys basketball coach       at Archbishop Curley also had an impact on the younger       McKennie.        ``I had a couple of kids who had problems with their family       and he would see Dad get up and go and do things [for the       players],'' the elder McKennie said Monday. ``It was the same       for me. When I got to college, I didn't realize my Dad, who       was a Marine Corps dude, was in my brain. You don't realize       until it has to be shown.''        Recalling when his son walked out on Durkin, the elder       McKennie said his son called him beforehand to tell him of       his intentions.        ``I said, `Ellis, before you do anything, do you want to       talk about it?' and he said, `Dad, I got this,' '' the elder       McKennie said.        McKennie doesn't think he would have been any less a leader       this season had he not worked his way up the depth chart and       into a starting role.        ``I have a type of rapport with teammates, they know what       I'm about, and that I actually care about this team and this       university,'' McKennie said. ``Whether I'm playing. whether       I'm having a good game or a bad game, whether I'm on scout       team, it wouldn't make a difference, just the type of guy       that I am.''        Said senior defensive tackle Brett Kulka: ``Ellis is great.       He's definitely a leader. You can see that in the locker room       as a whole. He's an encouraging player. He likes to help       younger guys. He understands what it takes to win in terms of       you need everyone on the team. He really embraces that       role.''        It has been more than 17 months since McNair died and       McKennie said it is unlikely that he will ever get over it       completely. He had known McNair since they were kids and       McNair played Little League baseball on a team coached by       McKennie's father.        ``You're never going to feel normal. It almost turns into a       new type of normal, it's a new reality you've got to live       it,'' McKennie said. ``I can't lie and say I don't think       about it every day. I get texts from his parents before every       game. . . . You're never going to move on from it.        ``I think it was important that when Coach Locks got here,       he had a meeting with a bunch of us and he said, `We can move       on without forgetting Jordan. We can take steps forward, but       we'll not forget where we came from and not forget Jordan in       any sort of way.' ''        Even though the patch of grass at Maryland Stadium with       McNair's number has grown over, McKennie said, ``Internally       we honor him every day. His locker is still in our locker       room. We pray in front of it before every game.''        Four years later, McKennie is only one of three players       remaining from the 19 members of the 2015 recruiting class,       along with linebacker Isaiah Davis and defensive end Keiron       Howard.        ``There are less than 10 guys from my class that made it       through their eligibility,'' McKennie said. ``Our class is       extremely interesting because it's been filled with so much       turmoil. A lot of guys didn't finish, but we also had two       first-round draft picks, DJ Moore and Darnell Savage. So it's       like a pretty big spectrum. I've been the only offensive       lineman left for two years.''        Locksley said Tuesday that the person and player he helped       recruit to Maryland while serving as the team's offensive       coordinator has grown tremendously in the past five years.        ``He's a guy that's been directly affected with the three       full-time coaches, two interims, the loss of a former high       school teammate [and] dear friend, and this kid continues to       stand strong.'' Locksley said at his Tuesday news conference,       where he announced that McKennie and three other seniors       would serve as captains for Saturday's game.        ``He's one of the guys you can sell the University of       Maryland with. He's the epitome of a student-athlete. He's a       guy that has the right kind of habits and behaviors, where       he's going to be really successful on the field and off the       field. Really I can't say enough great things about the       leadership that he's provided, not just for the players, but       even to me as the head coach. He's the epitome of what a       Maryland player should look like.''        For much of his career, McKennie focused ``pretty heavily''       on the front half of his hyphenated position as a student-      athlete, graduating in three years with a degree in       government and politics and then working on his master's       degree in public policy, which he will finish in the coming       weeks as he gets ready to start studying for his LSATs and a       career as a lawyer or politician.        ``We used to joke that he would be the first black       president and then we had [Barack] Obama so now we're banking       on him being the second black president,'' his mother said.        Even with what he has accomplished off the field--twice       earning All-Big Ten academic honors, being elected to the       university senate during the 2019-20 academic year, interning       for U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) last summer--McKennie       thinks of himself mostly as a Maryland football player.        ``That's what I do every day,'' he said. ``There hasn't       been a day in the past five years when I haven't come to this       building aside from a few holidays. It's going to be a weird       change. I'm looking forward to what's next for me, but I'm       definitely going to miss everything that has come about. I'm       starting to appreciate things differently now. I'm going to       practice not dreading practice anymore. I'm happy to be there       with my teammates.''        Unlike many of his former teammates who left long before       their eligibility expired or moved on the moment they played       their final game, McKennie said there will always be an       attachment.        ``I love this university and I love what it means to be a       Terrapin.'' McKennie said. ``It means so much more to me than       just playing on Saturday. If it was about playing time, I       still wouldn't be here. I should have gone somewhere else and       played a little bit sooner. It means so much to me to       represent this university and represent this state that I've       called home for most of my life, that's the most important       part to me.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to retired Army CPT Jonathan Ng, a Department of  Defense fellow serving in my office, for the remainder of this session  of Congress.
