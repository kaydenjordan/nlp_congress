 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lindsey Wilson  College football team of Columbia, Kentucky, for winning the 2020 NAIA  National Football Championship.   The Lindsey Wilson football team finished their undefeated season as  national champs Monday night, beating Northwestern College from Iowa  45-13, adding another championship to their season after already  winning the Mid-South Conference. Even more impressively, the Blue  Raiders dominated opponents every game during the regular season,  outscoring them by an average of 32 points a game.   Lindsey Wilson College did not have a football team from 1935 to  2009. Football was reintroduced to campus in 2010, after an 86-year  absence, and it has not taken long for the Blue Raiders to reach the  pinnacle of NAIA football.   I commend Athletic Director Willis Pooler and Head Coach Chris Oliver  for building a championship-caliber program in just over a decade. This  accomplishment is also a testament to every player's hard work and  dedication during an unprecedented year.   Once again, congratulations to the national champion Lindsey Wilson  College football team on this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
