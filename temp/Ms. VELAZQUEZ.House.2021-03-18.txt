 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill,  the Dream and Promise Act. Let me thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman  Nadler, Chairwoman Lofgren, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, and Rep. Yvette  Clarke for all their work to make humane immigration reform a priority.   I am a proud co-author of the Dream and Promise Act, which will  finally give peace of mind to millions who are American in every way  but on paper by providing a pathway to citizenship. These are Dreamers,  TPS, and DED recipients, yes. But they are also our co-workers,  friends, family members and hardworking, law-abiding members of our  communities.   And under this bill, we can shield qualifying recipients of TPS, DED  and DACA from deportation and create a more comprehensive pathway to  citizenship.   So, let's do the right thing, the American thing, and pass this bill.
