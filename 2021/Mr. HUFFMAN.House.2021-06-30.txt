 Mr. Speaker, it is important that this 5-year surface  transportation reauthorization invests in a cleaner, greener  transportation future while helping create great-paying jobs for  American workers, but the INVEST in America Act does more than that. It  finally restores Congress' Article I prerogative in controlling the  power of the purse.   Through an open, transparent process, Member-designated projects will  ensure that elected Representatives of the people have at least some  say on which surface transportation projects get funding. And in my  district that means expanding the SMART rail service into Healdsburg  and further north, closing the gaps in a pedestrian and bike pathway  along San Francisco Bay Trail, providing ADA accessibility and  educational signage at the mouth of the Smith River Overlook, and  planning for a safe pedestrian crossing at the San Rafael Channel.   The INVEST Act will also start planning for improvements along Route  37 to benefit both commuters and the environment in the face of rising  sea levels.   I thank Chairman DeFazio for his leadership on this bill, and I look  forward to sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature.
