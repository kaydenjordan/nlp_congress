 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Emmer for yielding.   The lady, for whom I have enormous respect, has failed to mention the  fact that this or any other project anywhere in the country, let alone  the State of Minnesota, would be, nevertheless, subject to endless  reviews by the Environmental Protection Agency, some of which take up  to 10 and 12 years. So it is not as though we are approving a mining  project here. It is going to have to undergo rigorous review.   As my colleagues from Minnesota know, I was an original sponsor of  the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness legislation. I am very proud of  that fact.   I want everybody to know here that, at the time, we made a solid  commitment to preserve and to protect some 1.1 million acres out of the  Superior National Forest for the BWCA, to protect it from all manmade  harm and damage to the environment. But we also made a commitment to  reserve the remainder of the Superior National Forest for mixed-use  purposes and specifically cited recreation an forestry.    The U.S. Forest Service described mining as a desirable-use purpose.  In fact, that was the forestry service at that time.   Our word is our bond in this business. This amendment will uphold  that hard-fought compromise. The simple truth is that we have been  mining on the Iron Range for 130 years, yet we have the cleanest water  in the State of Minnesota and perhaps the country. We are going to do  everything we can to make sure that we keep it that way.
