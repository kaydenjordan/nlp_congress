Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Murphy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters: one from AFSCME and  one from AARP.           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                    Washington, DC, April 10, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to vote no on       H.J. Res. 2 and to reject this and any other effort to amend       the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget.        The proposed constitutional amendment is a draconian and       unwise proposal that would damage the economy, result in huge       job losses and weaken vital public services that all       Americans depend upon. It unwisely requires outlays to match       receipts each year regardless of economic conditions, a       supermajority vote of three-fifths to increase the debt       ceiling with limited exceptions for outlays to exceed       receipts only in times of war, but not during recessions or       disasters.        H.J. Res. 2 is a false attempt to claim fiscal       responsibility on the heels of a reckless tax cut that is       projected to cause the deficit to skyrocket to $1.9 trillion       over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget       Office (CBO), and to exceed $2.5 trillion if its tax policies       are extended. The tax cut for the wealthy and big       corporations irresponsibly forced revenues to their lowest       levels since 1956, an unsustainable level far below what is       needed to support programs that provide basic needs for       struggling families, to promote economic growth and meet       other critical needs like investing in infrastructure and       education.        H.J. Res. 2 would irresponsibly require a supermajority       vote to lift the debt ceiling, an already difficult vote that       subjects the U.S. and worldwide economies to instability and       potential economic destruction. Further, requiring a balanced       budget annually would take away the ability to respond to       changing economic conditions and raise serious risks of       tipping weak economies into recession and making recessions       longer and deeper. Most egregious, H.J. Res. 2 is a thinly       veiled attempt to force drastic changes to Social Security,       Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' benefits that Americans earn       and depend on.        H.J. Res. 2 is a dangerous and fiscally irresponsible       political maneuver. AFSCME urges you to reject this       politically motivated and dangerous proposal.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                             AARP,                                                      April 9, 2018.        Dear Member: AARP s writing to express our opposition to a       balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United       States. AARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan       organization dedicated to empowering Americans 50 and older       to choose how they live as they age. With nearly 38 million       members and offices in every state, the District of Columbia,       Puerto Rico, and the U S. Virgin Islands, AARP works to       strengthen communities and advocate for what matters most to       families with a focus on health security, financial stability       and personal fulfillment.        A balanced budget amendment would likely harm Social       Security and Medicare, subjecting both programs to       potentially deep cuts without regard to the impact on the       health and financial security of individuals. It would also       likely diminish the resources available for programs       assisting Americans who are least able to provide for       themselves--services such as meals or heating for those who       are too poor or physically unable to take care of their basic       needs without some support.        A balanced budget amendment would prohibit outlays for a       fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal       year. It would impose a constitutional cap on all spending       that is equivalent to the revenues raised in any given year.       Because revenues fluctuate based on many factors, spending       would, out of necessity fluctuate as well under a balanced       budget amendment. Consequently, Social Security and Medicare       benefits would also fluctuate, potentially subjecting each to       sudden or deep cuts. Social Security and Medicare would       therefore cease to provide a predictable source of financial       and health security in retirement under a balanced budget       amendment.        The lack of a dependable Social Security and Medicare       benefit would be devastating for millions of Americans.       Social Security is currently the principal source of income       for half of older American households receiving benefits, and       roughly one in five households depend on Social Security       benefits for nearly all (90 percent or more) of their income.       Over 50 million Americans depend on Medicare, half of whom       have incomes of less than $24,150. Even small fluctuations in       premiums and cost sharing would have a significant impact on       the personal finances of older and disabled Americans.        Individuals who have contributed their entire working lives       to earn a predictable benefit during their retirement would       find that their retirement income and health care out of       pocket costs would vary significantly year-to-year, making       planning difficult and peace of mind impossible.        It is particularly inappropriate to subject Social Security       to a balanced budget amendment given that Social Security is       an off-budget program that is separately funded through its       own revenue stream, including significant trust fund reserves       to finance benefits. Imposing a cap on Social Security       outlays is unjustifiable, especially when the Social Security       trust funds ran a surplus for decades--reducing the past need       for additional government borrowing from the public--and       resulted in a public debt that is less today than what it       otherwise would have been.        Older Americans truly understand that budgets matter and       that we all need to live within our means. However, they also       understand that budgets affect real people; and they       certainly understand the difference between programs to which       they have contributed and earned over the course of a       lifetime of work, and those they have not. AARP opposes the       adoption of a balanced budget amendment that puts Social       Security and Medicare at risk. If you have any questions,       please have your staff contact Joyce A. Rogers, SVP,       Government Affairs office            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Mr. Speaker, let me read a couple of paragraphs from  this letter from AFSCME.   ``The proposed constitutional amendment is a draconian and unwise  proposal that would damage the economy, result in huge job losses, and  weaken vital public services that all Americans depend on. It unwisely  requires outlays to match receipts each year regardless of economic  conditions, a supermajority vote of three-fifths to increase the debt  ceiling, with limited exceptions for outlays to exceed receipts only in  times of war, but not during recessions or disasters.''   This is a false attempt to claim fiscal responsibility on the heels  of a reckless tax cut projected to cause the deficit to skyrocket to  $1.9 trillion over the next decade.   Mr. Speaker, let me read from the AARP letter. This is, as we know,  AARP, the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to  empowering Americans over 50 on how they choose to live as they age.  And  [[Page H3191]]  here is what they had to say: ``A balanced budget amendment would  likely harm Social Security and Medicare, subjecting both programs to  potentially deep cuts without regard to the impact on the health and  financial security of individuals. It would also likely diminish the  resources available for programs assisting Americans who are least able  to provide for themselves--services such as meals or heating for those  who are too poor or physically unable to take care of their basic needs  without some support.''                                time  1630    Mr. Speaker, the letter goes on to say:   ``The lack of a dependable Social Security and Medicare benefit would  be devastating for millions of Americans. Social Security is currently  the principal source of income for half of older American households  receiving benefits, and roughly one in five households depend on Social  Security benefits for nearly all . . . of their income. Over 50 million  Americans depend on Medicare, half of whom have incomes of less than  $24,150. Even small fluctuations in premiums and cost sharing would  have a significant impact on the personal finances of older and  disabled Americans.''   Mr. Speaker, I am here to say that we are in strong opposition to the  so-called balanced budget amendment today. There is a word that has  been thrown around in this discussion. Because I care about words, I  wanted to make sure that I was using the right word for what is  happening. So I looked in the dictionary, and I looked up the word  ``hypocrisy.'' Here is the definition of hypocrisy: hypocrisy is the  practice of claiming to have standards or beliefs to which one's own  behavior does not conform. The dictionary definition goes on to say: a  pretense.   That, Mr. Speaker, is what is happening, a pretense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned the word ``hypocrisy.'' I mentioned the word  ``pretense.'' If this was such an important issue, why did it not get  proposed before the GOP tax scam? Because if the majority is really  worried about the deficit, then they would not have passed a tax scam  that cost this country $1.9 trillion simply to give tax cuts to the  wealthiest individuals and corporations in our country.   This morning in the Budget Committee where I serve as vice ranking  member, the Congressional Budget Office Director, Keith Hall,  reaffirmed what we always knew, that these tax cuts do not pay for  themselves. He also told us that there is no such thing as sustained  growth of the rates that our Republican colleagues have thrown out  there and said are going to happen.   So if the majority were worried about a balanced budget, they should  have voted ``no'' on the GOP tax scam. But that is not what my  Republican colleagues did. If they were worried about a balanced  budget, then Republican colleagues should not have insisted on a $670  billion military spending budget. But we didn't hear a peep about this  then. You can't just oppose spending, Mr. Speaker, when you don't like  the things that we are spending on.   By the way, I have some breaking news: Republicans control the House,  the Senate, and the Presidency. Republicans have control. But as we are  seeing, that does not mean that Republicans know how to govern.   This amendment is a new low to showcase a contempt of the American  people's memory and intelligence. But I believe that the American  people are watching. They didn't buy the tax scam where they are now  seeing that only 5 percent of those tax cuts are actually going to  workers, and they are not going to believe in this maneuver either, Mr.  Speaker.   Why? Because, as I said during the tax scam debate on the floor last  year, the American people are going to rise up against any concerted  and naked effort to cut earned benefit programs like Medicare and  Social Security. I want to emphasize the words ``earned benefit''  because people call them entitlement programs, but Social Security is a  program that people have contributed to with a promise that they would  be taken care of when they retire.   But let's talk about the real purpose of this balanced budget  amendment. It is similar to what I said on the floor last year in the  middle of this debate, a three-step dance. Step one, pass a GOP tax  scam to transfer $1.3 trillion in debt from working Americans to the  wealthiest 1 percent and largest corporations.    Step two, explode the deficit--exactly what we heard from the CBO  Director today--$2 trillion to the budget deficit over the next 10  years.   Step three, use those exploding deficits to justify deep cuts to the  very programs that matter the most to Americans, Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid.   We have already seen this strategy in the President's fiscal year  2019 budget which slashes $500 billion from Medicare, $1.4 trillion  from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security disability.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just the American people and Democrats in  Congress who have noticed the hypocrisy of what is being proposed  today. Even some Republicans in Congress have talked about it. Our  colleague, Congressman Mark Meadows, said--and these are his words that  I am quoting--``There is no one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one  on Main Street, that will take this vote seriously.''   He is right. This isn't going to fool anyone, least of all the  American people.   Americans deserve so much better. My friend from Georgia talked  earlier about how we both sit on the Budget Committee, and we have  actually had conversations about how we wish we could actually talk  about real solutions. That doesn't happen as often as it should, and  certainly if you want to have a conversation about the deficit and the  debt, we should have that. But to propose a balanced budget amendment  after you have already voted for a tax cut that increased the deficit  by $2 trillion over the next 10 years, that, I think, is something that  people will see through. Americans will see through that just as they  saw through whom the benefits of the tax cut are actually going to.  [[Page H3192]]    So, Mr. Speaker, today I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this amendment, and let's get back to the real work of serving the  American people with real discussions and real questions that come up  at the time when they are relevant.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
