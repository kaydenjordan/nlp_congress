 Mr. President, I rise this morning to address the events  of General Flynn's resignation as National Security Advisor on Monday  night and the need for a full, independent, impartial, and transparent  investigation into the facts of the case. It is now readily apparent  that General Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story. It is  merely the beginning of a much longer story.   The circumstances of General Flynn's contacts with the Russian  Ambassador during the transition, the recent reports of potential high- level contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence,  including General Flynn, should raise hairs on the necks of everyone in  this body and every American of goodwill--Democrat, Republican,  conservative, liberal, Independent. This is not a partisan issue. This  is an issue about our country and how it is governed. It is also an  issue about our security. We are now left with more questions than  answers, and it is imperative to find the truth. With every hour that  goes by, more and more questions are raised. Every White House press  briefing and early morning tweet seemingly introduces new  inconsistencies and contradictions that demand a full accounting. Every  report that suggests deeper ties between the Trump campaign and the  Russian Government needs to be followed up on and verified.    We need to get all the facts.   So in the days and weeks ahead, the Trump administration needs to  answer some serious questions. These questions must be asked by an  independent and unbiased law enforcement authority. They must be  answered truthfully by administration officials. Any attempt to lie or  to mislead must be countered with the full force of law.   There needs to be an independent and transparent investigation on two  fronts: one in the legislative branch, where we have an obligation to  conduct oversight, and one in the executive branch, which has the  responsibility of finding and prosecuting potential criminal liability.   Today I wish to address the investigation that must occur in the  executive branch.   The new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, cannot be the person to lead  that investigation. In fact, Justice Department regulations  specifically prohibit individuals who have political ties to the  subjects of an investigation from leading that investigation. It is a  clear conflict of interest. I want to read the regulations of the  Department of Justice. They are right here, and every American should  see them because they are clear as can be.         No Department of Justice employee may participate in a       criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or       political relationship with any person or organization       substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of       the investigation or prosecution or who would be directly       affected by the outcome.   [[Page S1167]]     No employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or  prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any  person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is  the subject of the investigation or the prosecution.   The regulations continue. They define political relationship, again,  clear as a bell:         Political relationship means a close identification with an       elected official, candidate, political party or campaign       organization arising from service as a principal advisor or       official. Personal relationship means a close and substantial       connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce       partiality.    Jeff Sessions was chairman of the National Security Advisory  Committee alongside LTG Michael Flynn. He was a senior adviser in the  Trump campaign, the first Senator to endorse the President's campaign,  and nominated him at the Republican Convention in Cleveland. Those  facts and the Department of Justice's own rules disqualify Attorney  General Sessions from running this investigation.   The words are crystal clear; there is no wiggle room. If Attorney  General Sessions were to conduct or in any way be involved with this  investigation, he would be violating Justice Department guidelines.   As bad a start as the Trump administration is off to, it would make  things dramatically worse to ignore these guidelines, which were set up  for the purpose of getting to the truth in a fair and impartial way.   Attorney General Sessions must recuse himself immediately. Any  investigation headed by, directed by, or influenced by the Attorney  General will be jaundiced from the very start.   Because the rules are so clear, I expect the Attorney General will  recuse himself and allow an independent and thorough investigation to  go forward.   We have an additional reason to seek an independent and transparent  investigation because of how the White House has treated this matter  over the past few weeks.   The White House knew for weeks that General Flynn misled the Vice  President and let General Flynn stay on the job. They knew for weeks  that his discussion about sanctions with the Russian Government could  potentially compromise our national security because he would be  subject to blackmail, and they let him stay on.   The President knew for weeks about this and let General Flynn stay on  in his full capacity, present at and participating in the highest level  of national security discussions, until those reports were made public.   If the reports of General Flynn's incorrect statements to the Vice  President were never made public by the Washington Post, would the  President's trust ever have eroded? Would General Flynn ever have been  fired? Would he still be in his job today? We will never know now. The  answer is very troubling.   If an investigation is not independent, nonpartisan, and, most of  all, transparent, there is no guarantee this administration will take  the decisive and immediate actions necessary to keep our country safe.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak on the potential repeal  of the Social Security Administration's rule that helps keep guns out  of the hands of those with a severe mental illness. I voted no.   First, I want to point out that this rule only addresses a  shortcoming in the existing background check law that Congress passed  legislation to address. We use the National Instant Criminal Background  Check system to prevent criminals and the adjudicated mentally ill from  purchasing firearms.   In order for the FBI to have access to all the data they need to run  those background checks, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act in  2007--in bipartisan fashion, signed into law by President George W.  Bush, hardly a gun safety activist--to instruct Federal agencies to  send information to the NICS system about criminal records and mental  illness.   This rule at the Social Security Administration is simply  implementing that bipartisan law.   Second, let me underscore the point, this rule only applies to those  who have severe mental health disorders, like schizophrenia. These are  folks who, because of their disorder need assistance managing their own  affairs and are so severely impaired that they cannot hold down a full- time job. It simply requires the Social Security Administration to pass  that data on to the NICS background check system so the FBI can stop  gun sales to the seriously mentally ill.   It doesn't get much more common sense than that.   Frankly, I find it absurd that the Republicans have chosen to repeal  this rule as one of their first priorities in this Congress.   Does the Republican majority really think it is wise, as my colleague  from Connecticut asked, that folks who are so severely mentally ill  that they cannot work and require assistance managing their finances  should be assumed to be able to responsibly own and protect a gun?   Mental illness is a serious topic. We have debated it many times in  this body--how to better provide for treatment, how to decrease the  stigma surrounding it--but I don't remember the part where we debated  whether it was wise or not to allow folks with a severe, almost  incapacitating, mental illness to easily purchase a gun.   Gun violence takes far too many lives each year. At the very, very  least, we should be doing all that we can to prevent criminals,  potential terrorists, and the adjudicated mentally ill from purchasing  firearms; yet Republicans consistently line up behind the NRA to block  or repeal policies that would do those things--even though 8 or 9 out  of every 10 Americans supports them, though a vast majority of  gunowners support them.   Whenever Republicans talk about gun violence, they say, ``Let's  enforce the laws on the books!'' Well, as I mentioned, this regulation  does just that; it implements the bipartisan 2007 NICS Improvement Act  that Republican President George W. Bush signed into law.   Today, Republicans are calling their own bluff; they are not  interested in enforcing the laws on the books--they just want to repeal  them, even when that puts innocent American lives at risk.   If Republicans have a problem with this rule, they should have pushed  the Social Security Administration to modify it, rather than repealing  it outright and blocking any similar rulemaking on the subject, which  is what this CRA would do.   Thank you.                            ____________________
