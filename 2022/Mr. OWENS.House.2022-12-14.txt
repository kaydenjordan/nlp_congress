 Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the  Central Utah Project Completion Act--an absolute game changer for  Utah's water optimization and conservatory efforts.   Our State is the fastest growing economy per capita, and our  population will double by 2065. Historic drought is crippling States  like Utah, which reminds us that water truly is the lifeblood of the  West.   The Central Utah Project plays an integral role in efficient and  innovative water use and conservation measures to meet the demands of  our booming population and economy.   Since this act became law 30 years ago, the Central Utah Project has  ramped up water delivery to 1.5 million Utahns daily. This remarkable  accomplishment would not be possible without the tireless work of  Utahns.   I am committed to working hand in hand with local, State, and Federal  partners to ensure Utah remains on the right track. Congratulations on  this remarkable milestone.                            ____________________
