 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lieutenant Eric Schrage of the Collinsville Fire Department and  congratulate him on being awarded the Medal of Honor Award from the  Firefighting Medal of Honor Awards Ceremony this past May.   Lieutenant Schrage was recognized for his actions in responding to a  fire  [[Page H5163]]  in an apartment building while driving his own personal vehicle last  September. After Lieutenant Schrage assessed the situation and  determined that the residents were trapped, he took matters into his  own hands.   Without regard for his own safety, he was able to enter the building  and rescue a semiconscious woman trapped in her apartment, remove her  from the complex, and remain with her until medical attention arrived.   After rescuing the woman, he took actions to prevent the fire from  spreading to other parts of the apartment. His quick actions helped  prevent further damage and loss of life in the surrounding apartments.   I am proud to recognize Lieutenant Schrage for his courage and  selfless actions that saved a woman's life.   Thank you, Lieutenant Schrage and all the first responders for all  that you do to protect us and keep us safe every day.                            ____________________
