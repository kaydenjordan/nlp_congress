 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor William ``Bill''  Graves Wofford, Jr., of Rockwall, Texas, who passed away on October 29,  2019, at the age of 95.   Bill was born on May 1, 1924, in Fort Worth, Texas to William Graves  Wofford, Sr., and Margaret Melinda Wofford.   As a very young man, Bill left his family to fight in World War II  and to defend our country. He proudly served in both the U.S. Army and  the U.S. Navy. At the close of the war, at the age of 21, Bill returned  to the States to pursue an education from the Georgia Institute of  Technology.   Following graduation, Bill returned home to Texas where he embarked  on his 27-year career alongside business partner, Bob Timberlake, to  form Timberlake & Wofford, a manufacturing representative firm that  served the north Texas area and experienced great success.   Bill is remembered for his great sense of humor and his gentle  personality. His love of sailing and the outdoors led him to help found  the Rush Creek Yacht Club.   Bill was not only a leader in his community, but a friend to all: a  loving husband, father, and grandfather.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Wofford family. We also lift up the family and friends of Bill  Wofford in our prayers.   I have requested that the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor his life, legacy, and his service to our  country.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for the brave men and women who  serve in our military who protect us, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.            Honoring the Life of Deputy Sheriff Matthew Ryan Jones     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Matthew Ryan Jones of  Waco, Texas.   Deputy Sheriff Jones was killed on October 11, 2019 in the line of  duty as he assisted a motorist on the side of an area highway.   Matt was born on February 7, 1989, in Waco, Texas, to Ronnie and  Debbie Coleman Jones. He graduated from Connally High School and the  Texas State Technical College in Waco before joining the Falls County  Sheriff's Office in August of 2015.   Matt bravely served his community for 4 years, most recently being  named the department's canine deputy. Fellow first responders have sung  the praises of their fallen brother stating that: Matt ``never backed  down from a challenge and understood the nature of policing in a small  community.''   Matt was not only a proud public servant, he was a friend to all, a  loving husband, and an avid outdoorsman. Matt enjoyed spending time in  nature, hunting, fishing, and riding his ATV.   Mr. Speaker, Matt's life was defined by his service to his community.  He will be forever remembered by his community as a husband, a son, a  brother, and a selfless public servant.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Jones family. We also lift up the family and friends of Matthew in  our prayers.   I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor his life, legacy, and his service to our central Texas  community.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to pray for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us overseas, and  for our first responders who keep us safe here at home.
