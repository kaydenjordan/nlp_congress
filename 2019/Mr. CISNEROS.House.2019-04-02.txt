 Mr. Speaker, healthcare is a right, not a privilege.  Unfortunately, I know all too well what it is like to have family  members without healthcare coverage.   My mother went 15 years without health insurance, 15 years without  seeing a doctor. My father used to drive to Mexico to get his diabetes  medication because he had no insurance to cover the high cost.   The Affordable Care Act has provided over 20 million people with  insurance and allowed them to have access to healthcare; 9,000 of them  are in my district. It has also provided protections for those with  preexisting conditions, protections that this administration and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have tried to take away.   I have spoken with so many parents who may have a child with a heart  condition, childhood diabetes, or asthma. If these protections are  taken away, so many families won't be able to afford the necessary  surgeries or medications for these kids.   Let's do what is right for kids. Let's do what is right for families  and protect the Affordable Care Act. Let's protect healthcare.                            ____________________
