 Mr. President, before we vote on the resolution of  disapproval, I want to reiterate several very important facts.   This resolution of disapproval is bipartisan. The resolution is also  supported by 23 groups, mostly disability rights groups.   The disability groups believe that this agency--the Social Security  Administration--and its regulation will unfairly stigmatize those with  disabilities. Of course, they are right.   The American Civil Liberties Union has said this:         We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the       harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a       vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should       not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection       between the need for a representative payee to manage one's       Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward       gun violence.    The ACLU goes on to say:         Here, the rule automatically conflates one's disability-      related characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money,       with the inability to safely possess a firearm.    The agency regulation is defective in many ways. Namely, the  regulation does not require the agency to prove a person is dangerous  or mentally ill. The regulation also provides no formal hearing or due  process before a person is reported to the gun ban list.   Supporters of the gun ban have said that repeal of this regulation  will interfere with the enforcement of the gun prohibition laws. I want  to say plainly and simply: This is hogwash. We should not let baseless  scare tactics confuse this important issue.   Important Federal gun laws are still on the books, even if the agency  rule is repealed. We aren't repealing any laws.   The new regulation is inconsistent with these existing Federal gun  laws.   The agency still has a duty to report anyone who has actually been  adjudicated as dangerously mentally ill to the gun ban list. That is  also true of anyone convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of  domestic violence or involuntarily committed to a mental institution.   The Federal law requires this:         If a Federal department or agency . . . has any record of       any person demonstrating that the person falls within one of       the categories . . . shall . . . provide the pertinent       information contained in such record to the Attorney General.    This law remains in effect.   Repealing this regulation will merely ensure that disabled citizens'  Second Amendment rights are, in fact, protected.   Those rights will no longer be able to be revoked without a hearing  and without due process. It will take more than a personal opinion-- just a personal opinion of a bureaucrat--to abridge one's Second  Amendment rights.   An existing statute requires agencies to report the individuals to  the gun ban list who are ineligible to possess firearms. That  requirement remains intact even if this regulation is repealed.   So it is plainly wrong to claim, as has been said, that if the  regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report  prohibited persons.   If the supporters of this regulation want to take away people's gun  rights, then they need to acknowledge the government must carry the  burden to actually prove a person--prove a person--is dangerously  mentally ill. And the government must provide due process in that  process.   They need to go back to the drawing board, in other words, because  this rule is inconsistent with the very important Second Amendment  rights to bear arms, own, and possess guns--buy and possess guns.  Therefore, it must be repealed, and this resolution must be approved.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on this side I yield back our unused  time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
