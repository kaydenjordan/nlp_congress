 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night President Trump selected  Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee for the upcoming vacancy on the Supreme  Court. In selecting Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump did exactly what  he said he would do on the campaign trail--nominate someone who will  overturn women's reproductive rights and strike down healthcare  protections for millions of Americans, including those with preexisting  conditions. He has put at risk civil rights, labor rights,  environmental rights, and LGBTQ rights. How do we know? Because  President Trump repeatedly promised to nominate Justices who will  overturn Roe v. Wade and who will undermine our healthcare laws.   This didn't come out of the clear blue; President Trump promised it.  He said he would only pick ``pro-life judges'' who would  ``automatically'' reverse Roe v. Wade. President Trump actually went so  far as to say that women should be ``punished'' for their healthcare  choices. President Trump also said that his judicial appointments would  ``do the right thing,'' unlike Justice Roberts on healthcare. That is  President Trump's litmus test, and it couldn't be clearer.   During the campaign, President Trump commissioned a list of 25 people  who would meet the litmus test, who were vetted and approved by two  organizations that represent the hard right--the Federalist Society,  led by a man named Leonard Leo whose goal in life has been to overturn  Roe v. Wade, and the Heritage Foundation, whose goal is to strike down  healthcare law because they don't want the government to help people  out when they have preexisting conditions or other healthcare needs.   Edward Whelan, a prominent conservative activist, said this about  Leonard Leo, the man who put together the list that Trump promised to  choose from: ``No one has been more dedicated to the enterprise of  building a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade than the  Federalist Society's Leonard Leo.''   If anyone believes that Judge Kavanaugh or anyone else on the list  would uphold Roe v. Wade, then I have a bridge to sell them.   Leonard Leo's goal in life is to repeal Roe. He came up with the  list. Do you think he put any slackers, in his opinion, on that list?  No.   Judge Kavanaugh got the nomination not because he will be an  impartial judge on behalf of all Americans but because he passed  President Trump's litmus test--repeal women's freedom for their  reproductive rights and repeal America's healthcare, including  protection for preexisting conditions. If Judge Kavanaugh were to be  confirmed, women's reproductive rights would be in the hands of five  men on the Supreme Court. That is not what the women or the men of  America want.   Judge Kavanaugh in his own writings made clear he would rule against  reproductive rights and freedoms and that he welcomes challenges to the  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, of our healthcare act.  Judge Kavanaugh has argued that the Supreme Court should question the  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. He openly criticized the  Supreme  [[Page S4849]]  Court when they upheld the law. He is no neutral arbiter. He has  already made up his mind. He wouldn't have been approved by the  Heritage Foundation if they weren't certain that he would repeal the  ACA. He wouldn't have been approved by the Federalist Society if  Leonard Leo wasn't certain that he would repeal Roe v. Wade.   Judge Kavanaugh has argued that the Trump administration could keep a  young girl in Federal custody to prevent her from obtaining  constitutionally protected healthcare. He has argued that employers  should be able to deny their employees access to affordable  contraceptive coverage. If Judge Kavanaugh feels that way about  contraceptive rights, imagine what he feels about a woman's right to  choose.   I will make one other point about Judge Kavanaugh. He is a deeply,  deeply conservative justice, way out of the mainstream. He has written  troubling decisions rejecting something 90 percent of Americans want-- commonsense gun laws. He has undone environmental protections. He has  challenged them. Our Clean Air and Clean Water Acts would be at risk.  He would make it far more difficult for regulations to exist to enforce  those laws.   Here is what is most amazing: He has gone so far as to say that a  President doesn't need to follow the law if he ``deems'' it  unconstitutional.   Folks, here we have a President, President Trump, who cares less  about the rule of law, less about the restraints that every other  President has felt were put in place by the Constitution and the norms  that have blessed this great country for 200 years, and we are going to  put on the Bench someone who says: If this President, President Trump,  deems some law is unconstitutional, he doesn't have to follow it. How  many Americans think the President would be judicious and limited in  doing that? That is not the President I have seen over the last year  and a half--oh, no.   An analysis by Professor Epstein of Washington University of St.  Louis found that Judge Kavanaugh would be the second most conservative  Justice on the Court, to the right of Judge Gorsuch, second only to  Justice Thomas. This is the most conservative Court we have had in 80,  90 years--since the 1930s, at the very minimum. To those who say that  President Trump has made a moderate selection from the judicial  mainstream in the form of Judge Kavanaugh, think again and look at his  record. He is a deeply conservative justice.   His judicial philosophy appears to spring from his history. Judge  Kavanaugh was embedded in the partisan fights of the past few decades  involving the notorious Starr report, the Florida recount, President  Bush's secrecy and privilege claims once in office, and ideological  judicial nomination fights throughout the Bush era.   The hard right has had a goal. They can't achieve their hard-right  philosophy through the two elected branches of government, try as they  might--the Congress and President--but if they get control of the one  nonelected branch, the judiciary, they can turn the clock back in  America for decades, maybe centuries. That has been their goal. When  Judge Kavanaugh worked in the White House, he helped them achieve that  goal. Judge Kavanaugh's background as a partisan political operative  seems exactly like the kind of man President Trump would want on the  Supreme Court if legal issues from the Mueller probe arise--deferential  to a fault to Executive authority.   Judge Kavanaugh's long track record of partisan politics comes with a  long paper trail. The Senate must now be able to access and have the  time to adequately review all documents, emails, and other paperwork  associated with Judge Kavanaugh before the process moves forward. Judge  Kavanaugh's papers may be critical to helping the American people  understand the kind of jurist that Judge Kavanaugh would be on the  Supreme Court, and if that makes us take a little more time, so be it.   As the President himself has said, this is one of the most  consequential nominations we have had in a generation. To get the full  record before any of us vote is absolutely necessary, important,  essential, and fair. Judge Kavanaugh's papers may give the Senate the  best and only chance of understanding Judge Kavanaugh's personal views.   No doubt, Judge Kavanaugh will be schooled, as were his most recent  predecessors, to reveal as little as possible about his philosophy and  personal views in his confirmation hearing. No doubt he will employ  practiced evasions that have become a farcical tradition of the  nomination process: I will respect precedent. I will follow settled law  and strive to uphold stare decisis. Gee, Senator, I can't comment lest  I bias myself on a future case.   We have seen what happened when Justice Roberts, Justice Gorsuch, and  Justice Alito said that. Once they got on the Bench, they overturned  precedent with alacrity to achieve their political goals. Probably the  worst was Citizens United, where Chief Justice Roberts undid close to a  century of tradition and allowed wealthy people to send millions of  dollars undisclosed into our politics, making the swamp so much worse.  Most recently, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Roberts, and the rest  dramatically overturned precedent in the Janus case on a whim, as the  dissent noted. They just pulled a theory out of a hat--a First  Amendment ruling that the First Amendment prohibited unions from  organizing. My, oh my, how can anyone believe that Judge Kavanaugh will  stick to precedent when Justice Roberts, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice  Alito ignore precedent and make their own political rulings regularly?   We need to review the record--Judge Kavanaugh's written history,  where the best clues of his jurisprudence may lie. It is no less than  the standard my Republican colleagues demanded of then-Judge Kagan  during her confirmation process. They asked for her entire record;  170,000 documents were sent here.   We need those documents now more than ever because this new Justice  will be so pivotal in determining the future of our Nation for so long.  The nomination could alter the balance of the Court in favor of  powerful special interests against working families for a generation.  The pro-hard-right business Heritage Foundation wants only nominees who  will side with the big boys against the average person, and in Judge  Kavanaugh, they have someone who would do just that.   We cannot let it happen. If the Senate blocks this nomination, it  will lead to a more independent, moderate selection that both parties  could support.   I yield the floor.    First, Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, my  neighbor from New Jersey, for the excellent job he does in just about  anything he does but particularly today as ranking member of the  Foreign Relations Committee. His leadership is invaluable to this  country so I thank him for it.   Mr. President, President Trump is on his way to attend the annual  summit of NATO leaders in Brussels. The President should use the  occasion to reinforce and build up the transatlantic alliance rather  than tear it down.   Since its founding nearly 70 years ago, NATO has become the most  powerful and successful security partnership ever created. The first  half of the 20th century was marked by unprecedented human suffering-- depression, war, and genocide. After World War II, in the face of  Soviet aggression and expansion, NATO showed the world a different way.   Working together with other international institutions, NATO  established the political and economic rules of the road that have  promoted our national security and our mutual prosperity.   This institution now finds itself under incredible and completely  unnecessary strain from Russia's interference in democracies across  Europe and including the United States, from China's rapacious economic  aggression and geopolitical provocations, from the evolving threat of  terrorism, and, shockingly, from within.   Our President, President Trump, has routinely berated the leaders of  our NATO allies in far harsher terms than the President has ever  criticized President Putin of Russia, a dictator who has invaded a  sovereign country, murdered journalists and political dissenters,  directed a nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom, and continues to  prop up the brutal Assad regime in Syria. He has shown an eagerness to  impose tariffs against Europe but a reluctance to sanction President  Putin and his cronies. He has accepted the word of President Putin over  the consensus of 17 agencies of the American intelligence community.   For reasons that continue to baffle so many, President Trump will  follow up his summit with a one-on-one meeting with President Putin in  Helsinki, a mere 100 miles from the Russian border.   Before leaving for Europe this morning, the President summed up his  agenda. He said: ``I have NATO, I have the UK . . . and I have Putin.  Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all. Who would think?''   Who would think? President Trump, considering all you have said and  done in the past 2 years, considering your kid glove approach to  President Putin that has everyone here scratching their head, any one  of us could have predicted that Putin would be your easiest meeting,  but every one of us is in fear of what Putin might get out of it.   Every time the President has negotiated one-on-one with President Xi,  with Kim Jong Un, our rival has gotten the better of him and of our  country. And many of us fear what President Trump will do alone with  Putin, what he will concede and what Putin will get out of him.   The President of the United States should be a clarion voice for our  values, bolstering our allies and isolating our adversaries. President  Trump has, unfortunately and alarmingly, been the opposite.   The values at the foundation of our NATO alliance are worth fighting  for--free markets, free and fair elections, representative government,  rule of law. These are the values that protect our citizens from the  encroachment of tyranny. President Trump should recognize that power  resides in the values shared by our NATO allies as well as the  strategic sense of using NATO as a powerful bulwark against the abuses  of a resurgent Russia.   Later this afternoon, the Senate will vote on a motion to instruct  conferees on the Defense bill to reaffirm Congress's enduring and  unequivocal support for NATO. I hope it receives the overwhelming  bipartisan, if not unanimous, approval it so deserves.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3187         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
