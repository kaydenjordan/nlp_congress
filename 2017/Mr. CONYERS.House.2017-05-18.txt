 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, though troubled and saddened by the  recent attacks on law enforcement officials, I believe that H.R. 115,  the Thin Blue Line Act, is counterproductive to ensuring public safety  and only serves to exacerbate concerns with the unfair and unjust death  penalty.   H.R. 115 expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in Federal  death penalty cases to also include killing or targeting a law  enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder.   Aggravating factors are specific factors that judges and juries  consider in determining whether a sentence of death is justified for  the underlying offense. Passage of this bill would add a 17th statutory  aggravating factor for Federal death penalty eligible offenses.   H.R. 115 has been rushed to the House floor, without a single hearing  and without the opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to  whether our system of imposing the death penalty is fair, just, and  reliable. Like most of my colleagues, I support measures that would  actually protect our first responders, brave men and women who risk  their lives every day to protect us.   Unfortunately, H.R. 115 not only fails to do this but would also  exacerbate problems with the Federal death penalty.   First, H.R. 115 duplicates Federal and State laws that enhance  sentences of persons convicted of crimes of violence against law  enforcement. The very law the bill seeks to amend, 18 U.S.C. section  3592, already states that a crime against a high public official,  including a judge, a law enforcement officer, or an employee of a  United States penal or correctional institution, is an aggravating  factor that may be considered in determining whether a death sentence  should be imposed.   Other Federal laws also impose a life sentence or death on persons  convicted of killing State and local law enforcement officers, or other  employees assisting with Federal investigations, as well as officers of  the United States courts.   Secondly, H.R. 115 does not address documented and systemic  unfairness and racial unfairness in the disposition of the death  penalty. Any legislation dealing with the Federal death penalty must  also address numerous concerns related to racial disparity in  application of capital punishment, the lack of qualified counsel and  sufficient resources to represent those facing the death penalty, and  faulty forensic ``science'' testimony ordered in support of convictions  in death penalty cases.   The Federal death penalty, in particular, is rife with troubling  evidence of racial disparity. For example, 36 of the 61 people  currently on Federal death row are African American, Latino, Asian, or  Native American.   If you break this down by Federal circuit, the results are even more  disturbing. For example, 15 of 18 men who have received a Federal death  sentence in the Fifth Circuit--Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi--in  the modern era have been people of color.   Third, civil rights and civil liberties organizations oppose H.R.  115. Organizations committed to the protection of civil rights and  civil liberties, including the NAACP, ACLU, and the LCCR, have noted  that the Thin Blue Line Act ``is an unnecessary and misguided attempt  to politicize the unfortunate deaths of law enforcement officers and  could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement  and the communities they served.''                                time  1500    And finally, H.R. 115 will not deter violence against police  officers. By adding a 17th aggravating factor to the Federal death  penalty statute, this legislation ignores scientific research regarding  the ineffectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime.   It is important to note that the National Research Council of the  National Academies has concluded that the studies claiming that the  death penalty has a deterrent effect on murder rates are  ``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be the basis of sound public  policy.   Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his yielding and for his leadership and for the pleasure  that I have in working on the Judiciary Committee. Let me thank the  chairman and Members as well, particularly working on the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, of which  this underlying bill comes to the floor on.  [[Page H4337]]    This is a very important week, Mr. Speaker. It is National Police  Week. A number of our constituents have been here, and we have had the  opportunity to hear from a number of outstanding leaders: a sheriff  from Los Angeles County; the sheriff from South Carolina; the police  department leader from Houston, Texas; and the head of the FOP.   So I think that we have had a good week in terms of hearings in the  Judiciary Committee, and certainly this past Monday we honored those  who tragically ascended to the memorial wall where we honor police from  across the Nation.   So I think it is important to put on the record that none of us, I  would hope--I certainly don't--take a back seat to the respect,  admiration, and the work that we do to keep our law enforcement and  first responders safe. We commend them for their service as we continue  to work on police and community working together.   We also are grateful for those who are engaged in enhanced community  relations as well as working with diverse communities.   So let me acknowledge individuals from Houston that we have lost:  Assistant Deputy Chief Clint Greenwood; Officer Richard K. Martin;  Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth.   We lost Jerry Ronald Walker of Little Elm Police Department.   Then officers who died in Dallas: Officer Brent Thompson, Sergeant  Michael Smith, Senior Corporal Lorne Ahrens, Officer Patricio  Zamarripa, and Officer Michael Krol.   I have had the chance to work with a number of chiefs of police,  including Chief Lee P. Brown, one of the first police chiefs in Houston  that I was able to work with as I began to engage publicly; Chief  McClelland; now Chief Acevedo; and chiefs in-between.   I particularly thank them for working with the community during  stressful times, during times when violence was evidenced out in the  community; not against police, but against communities--keeping the  peace, if you will, as we tried to work together.    So I support policies that are necessary, and I certainly support the  idea of protecting our law enforcement. Of course, the underlying bill  has that provision and indicates a protection of law enforcement  officers. In actuality, it provides the opportunity for the protection  as well as the utilization of the death penalty.   This particular legislation continues to want to add aggravating  factors, making it 17. If we had a hearing and if we were able to  determine that this would actually have an impact, there would be  reason to at least have a vigorous debate over whether there is an  impact or not.   But H.R. 115 is a duplicative bill and unnecessary because under 18  U.S.C. 3592(c), there already exists mechanisms that achieve the goal  of punishing by death a defendant who kills a law enforcement officer  or first responder.   First of all, it should be stated that the bill is based upon  underlying offenses, drug offenses. There is a whole myriad of actual  laws that are Federal criminal offenses, and if a death occurs under  that Federal criminal offense, then you are eligible for the death  penalty.   Let me cite as an example the Boston Marathon terrorists act and the  killing of the MIT officer who was killed. The Federal prosecutor was  able to take that case to the Federal court and to pursue a death  penalty because it was pursuant to a terrorist act.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The time of the gentlewoman has  expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. The most heinous tragedy of those who were lost in  9/11, the mourning of firefighters, first responders, and law  enforcement who lost their lives, certainly there is no doubt that that  was a heinous terrorist act. If those terrorists had lived--there would  have been firefighters and first responders included, and their deaths  would have been, in essence, tried under the Federal death penalty; and  those heinous perpetrators would have been tried, given capital  punishment, if the jury had convicted them--there probably was no  doubt--and ultimately might have seen their end through the exercise of  the death penalty.   That is, I think, clearing up that we are standing here adding any  measure of difference to this particular legislation. If the act falls  under Federal criminal laws, you can be, or the murderer of you can be,  in fact, charged with a Federal death penalty.   On the other hand, if you go into a burning building and,  unfortunately, the owner of the building--or there is some unfortunate  incident and you are shot as a firefighter, you do not fall under this  statute. That is not a Federal offense, but you can fall under your  State death penalty cases.   Why would we be concerned about this idea of additional death  penalties?   Let me cite for you the case of Buck v. Davis, where the death  penalty verdict was based merely on whether the defendant is likely to  commit acts of violence in the future, and a psychologist opined that  being Black did increase the probability. The trial court reasoned  that: ``introduction of any mention of race was de minimis.'' In other  words, insignificant, completely ignoring that the largest number of  individuals that go to their death are African Americans. Thank  goodness for the Supreme Court and the reasoning of Chief Justice  Roberts.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Justice Roberts stated for the court in reversing  the lower court: ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Likewise, in the Gregg v. Georgia case, decided after Furman, the  court held that if death penalty is mandatory, such that no permission  for mercy is granted, and where capital punishment is based on  characteristics of the offender, then it is unconstitutional and  ``arbitrary and capricious.''   The underlying bill has mandatory death penalties. It will cover  first responders if they are killed pursuant to Federal crimes. We are  standing here, not adding anything to the underlying bill. First  responders are protected. Law enforcement are protected.   I would hate to see any of them lose their life, but under a Federal  crime, their case will be tried as a death penalty case. In other  instances, it will be tried by State law. We respect these heroes and  sheroes. It is shameful if we use that to add another aggravating  element to the death penalty, and continue to discriminate based on  race.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first acknowledge and commend the law  enforcement community throughout our country that work tirelessly to  help protect and serve our communities.   I especially want to thank Chief Acevedo for his leadership,  commitment to Houston, and for his vision on unifying communities  through police relations with the people they take an oath to serve and  protect.   As we celebrate police week, I would like to take a moment to thank  and honor all the officers that served selflessly and died in the line  of duty.   Especially, Assistant Deputy Chief Clinton Greenwood of Harris County  Constable's Office-Precinct 3, TX, died on 4/3/17;   Officer Richard K. Martin of Houston Police Dept., died on 5/18/15;   Deputy Sheriff of Harris County Sheriff office, Darren Goforth, 8/28/ 15;   And Detective Jerry Ronald Walker of Little Elm Police Dept., TX,  died 1/17/17 and the five officers killed in Dallas, TX on 7/7/16-- Brent Thompson, Sgt. Michael Smith, Sr. Corporal Lorne Ahrens, Officer  Patrick Zamarripa, and Officer Michael Krol.   Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Houston's former Chief, Lee  P. Brown who laid the strong foundation for HPD's strong community  liaison practices with all communities; Harris County Sheriff Ed  Gonzalez; Alan Rosen, Harris County Constable, Precinct 1 and all of  our other men and women in uniform.   I know personally the level of stress and challenges posed, because I  have many friends that have and are currently serving my Congressional  district in Houston and our country very well and with great  distinction.   I support our policies that are necessary, so long as we are doing so  with fairness, in accordance with our Constitution, and in a manner  that is not duplicative of statutory measures already in place.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 imposes the death penalty for the killing or  targeting of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders as a 17th aggravated factor for homicide.   Although this bill is presented as a proposal to protect police  officers and first responders, it does much more.  [[Page H4338]]    H.R. 115 is duplicative and unnecessary because under 18 U.S.C.  3592(c), there already exists mechanisms that achieve the goal of  punishing by death, a defendant who kills a law enforcement officer or  first responders.   Prosecutors are already armed with prosecutorial discretion to seek  capital punishment in death penalty cases as demonstrated in the cases  below:   U.S. v. Ronell Wilson--2 NY City detectives were killed during a gun  sting operation. Defendant was sentenced to death.   U.S. v. Donzell McCauley--a Washington, DC police officer was killed  and defendant received a sentence of life without parole.   U.S. v. Kenneth Wilk--a deputy sheriff was killed while attempting to  serve a search warrant; defendant was sentenced to life without parole.   U.S. v. Kenneth Barrett--a state law enforcement officer was killed  during a drug raid, defendant was sentenced to death.   LaShawn Casey, an undercover police officer was killed in a  carjacking related to a drug transaction; a capital jury sentenced the  defendant to life without the possibility of parole.   These cases illustrate that prosecutors have the discretion under the  current law to seek the death penalty. By adding a 17th aggravated  factor under the vague, arbitrary and capricious language of H.R. 115,  we are heading down a dangerous path.   Please take note that the death toll of firefighters/first responders  reported by the National Fire Protection Association illustrates a  drastic decline in deaths overall, most of which were fire and accident  related.   The statistics available do not support the need for this duplicative  measure in H.R. 115.   This bill does nothing to protect our law enforcement or to ensure  public safety; instead, it raises constitutional questions as to its  validity because ``targeting law enforcement'' is substantially vague  language that will subject many innocent lives to death, based purely  on their desire to exercise their First Amendment rights about the  well-documented racial disparity in treatment throughout our  communities.   We must ensure that we do not create legislation of broad scope and  vagueness that will have a chilling effect on an insular group.   H.R. 115 is laced with a discriminatory effect that will trigger  strict scrutiny under the 14th Amendment, and open the gateway for  draconian habeas laws.   This bill will create a slippery slope, further adding to recent  turbulence caused by Attorney General Jeff Session's memo and  destroying whatever trust remains between law enforcement and  communities.   This bill sends troubling messages around the world about how we view  and measure life in America in this 21st century.   It is time to get serious about this epidemic and not hide behind  vague language because `all' lives matter, blue, black, brown, white.   Mr. Speaker, while some may say that any adverse effects of the bill  before us are de minimis, and thus, will not severely impact the racial  disparity found in the use of the death penalty, it is neither the  amount of words in this bill nor the amount of time used to utter them  that is significant; rather, it is the discriminatory effect that will  result in communities disproportionately impacted by the death penalty.   Let us take for example, the case of Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. __  (2017) where the death penalty verdict was based merely on `whether  defendant is likely to commit acts of violence in the future' and a  psychologist opined that being black did increase the probability. The  trial court reasoned that ``introduction of any mention of race was de  minimis,'' in other words, insignificant.   As Chief Justice John Roberts stated for the Court in reversing the  lower court; ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Likewise, in Gregg v. GA, which was decided after Furman (invalidated  death penalty across the country), the court held if death penalty is  mandatory, such that no permission for mercy is granted, and where  capital punishment is based on characteristics of the offender, then it  is unconstitutional and ``arbitrary and capricious.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 is extremely deadly because it is arbitrary and  capricious, imposing the death penalty based solely on the status of  the victim.   The death penalty is already available both at the state and federal  level and is reserved for matters of extraordinary circumstances.   While we want to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters  and first responders received protection as they protect our  communities, we cannot and should not attempt to do so by weighing the  worth of lives and arbitrarily impose the death penalty based on our  measuring sticks of who should live and who should die.   H.R. 115 will undoubtedly contribute to the continuation of well- documented and pervasive racial disparities in the imposition of the  death penalty.   Since 1976 only 20 white prisoners have been executed for the murder  of an African American victim, while an alarming 286 African American  prisoners have been executed for the death of white victims, and 42% of  African Americans currently remain on death row.   Death penalty generally, has been criticized over the years by legal  scholars and by Supreme Court Justices who have opined in several  instances, that `the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which  prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.'   Even in 1958, when the Court first explicitly spoke about the death  penalty as having constitutional challenges, it said in Trop v. Dulles,  ``the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause must draw  its meaning from the `evolving standards of decency that mark the  progress of a maturing society' rather than from its original  meaning.''   Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that we have evolved and matured  significantly since we first implemented the death penalty in the 1600s  and thus, we must evaluate cautiously, laws that seek to further  advance this flawed, astronomically costly and unjust practice.   Tax payers currently spend $740,000 for cases without the death  penalty, while cases where the death penalty is sought cost $1.26  million. Maintaining each death row prisoner costs taxpayers $90,000  more per year than a prisoner in general population.   Capital punishment does not work; it is discriminatory and is used  disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial,  ethnic and religious communities.   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976,  82% of all executions have occurred in the South (37% in Texas alone),  which contributed to the United States status as one of five countries  in the world to account for the most executions in 2012.   FBI data has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent and in  fact, 14 states without capital punishment in 2008, had homicide rates  at or below the national rate.   Taking another life does not stop violence.   Like mandatory minimums, public opinion for the death penalty is  currently at its lowest with a 42% opposition, evidenced in a 2016 Pew  Research report, which found that the U.S. now dropped to number seven  worldwide in countries accountable for the most executions.   Mr. Speaker, over two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished  the death penalty either in law or practice, and the U.S. is the only  Western country that still uses the death penalty.   Even family members of murder victims and other individuals who have  witnessed live executions of death row inmates, particularly, in the  recent botched and questionable executions, have called for a repeal of  this practice and ask instead for alternative sentencing.   In fact the death penalty solves nothing, and may even perpetuate the  suffering of the parents, children, or siblings left behind.   We do not need to expand the use of the death penalty where public  opinion is at its lowest, but instead, implement sound and practical  legislation that will save lives of our officers and the people they  serve.   This measure is what public opinion suggests.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 10 minutes  remaining, and the gentleman from Louisiana has 15\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that we are all in  support of the protection of our officers. I think that there is no  competition on sympathy or wanting to appropriately assure that those  who go up against our officers in a vile and violent manner would be  brought to justice.   I think the point on race disparity as relates to the death penalty  is relevant. It is about life. But I want to make it very clear: Under  this underlying bill, our officers who are State police officers are  protected already, including the example that I used about the MIT  officer in the Boston Marathon terrorist act. It is if you are in the  furtherance of a Federal crime. The bill itself is all Federal. You  have to be engaged in an act that is a Federal crime.   Clearly, if the terrorists on 9/11 had lived, the cases of the  firefighters who lost their lives certainly would have been tried-- those cases of the tragic, heinous deaths of firefighters who are our  friends, and certainly are my friends--under the Federal death penalty  law.   In the case of U.S. v. Kenneth Barrett, a State law enforcement  officer was killed during a drug raid. That is one of the underlying  offenses. The defendant was sentenced to death.   In the case of Lashaun Casey, an undercover police officer was killed  in a carjacking related to a drug transaction. A capital jury decided  to sentence the defendant to life without the possibility of parole,  but it was a capital jury.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. And so I want to honor them, too, but I also want to  show the disparities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the very valuable point that Chief  Justice Roberts made in the particular case of Buck v. Davis and the  statistical documentation of the disparities in the death penalty  cases. We cannot ignore it.   Chief Justice Roberts stated before the Court, in reversing the lower  court, ``some toxins can be deadly in small doses,'' when the district  court wanted to ignore or diminish the fact that race was involved in  this case.   A psychologist had the audacity to say that being Black did increase  the probability that you would commit an act of violence prospectively.  How sad is that?   We are saddened by the death of our officers, but we are already  protecting them and the first responders. Pursuant to a Federal  criminal act, the prosecutor, at their discretion, can charge the  defendant with a death penalty case.   I just hope my colleagues will recognize that we are not divided in  our love, affection, and respect for the men and women that serve as  first responders and law enforcement throughout this Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter addressed to Mr.  Goodlatte and myself, and I want to read the first paragraph of it.   ``Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers:   ``We are current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from  jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R. 115, the  Thin Blue Line Act. We do so because we believe this bill will do  little to protect the lives of police and first responders and will  drive away resources proven to be effective at protecting law  enforcement and preventing and solving crime.''                                                     April 26, 2017.      Re Law Enforcement Opposition to H.R. 115.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: We are       current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from       jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R.       115, the Thin Blue Line Act. We  [[Page H4340]]       do so because we believe this bill will do little to protect       the lives of police and first responders and will drive away       resources proven to be effective at protecting law       enforcement and preventing and solving crime.        We are all too familiar with the risks that local, state,       and federal law enforcement and first responders take each       day to prevent, investigate, and prosecute crime. In fact;       some of us have served alongside colleagues who were killed       in the line of duty. We understand the impulse to threaten       those who have murdered our fellow officers with the death       penalty, and some of us have experienced that desire       directly.        But we also know that the death penalty, as it currently       operates, is poor public policy. It is ineffective,       expensive, and can make irrevocable mistakes. It is also used       disparately and often on vulnerable populations, which       undermines our ability to create effective and trusted       relationships with those in the community on whose support       our success depends. That is why, while some of us may       philosophically support the death penalty, we all oppose its       expansion in practice--even under the auspices of supporting       law enforcement.        Each of us understands that it takes many and varied       resources to keep our communities safe. We need strong       partnerships with local government and the communities we       serve. We need well-functioning and modern systems to       collect, store and process police activities, crime data, and       evidence. We need equipment to protect and assist officers as       they perform their duties. One tool virtually never seen on       our list of needs is the death penalty.        In short, we believe H.R. 115 is an unnecessary expansion       of an already flawed and ineffective policy. We encourage you       to oppose this bill and instead support measures that promote       the overall health, safety, and welfare of law enforcement       and the communities we have been sworn to protect.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,        James Abbott, Chief, West Orange (NJ) Police Department       (1997-Present).

Concord, NH       (1975-1997), President, International Association of Chiefs       of Police (1995-1996).     Mr. Speaker, I would like all of my colleagues to  recognize that, during our observation of National Police Week, we are  reminded again of the importance of ensuring that law enforcement  officers are safe so they can carry out their duties effectively.   These kinds of ``enhancement'' bills like H.R. 115 do nothing to  invest in officer wellness or to address the everyday challenges faced  by police officers or first responders. Moreover, they are redundant,  especially because there are laws that protect police officers and  first responders from violence in all 50 States.   Rather than advancing a bill that amounts to an empty gesture, that  is damaging, at best, this Congress should focus on real reform  measures that will protect law enforcement, first responders, and their  communities. Providing duplicative protections to law enforcement  simply cannot counterbalance the impact of fundamentally flawed death  penalty legislation.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
