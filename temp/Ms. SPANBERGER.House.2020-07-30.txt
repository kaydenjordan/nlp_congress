 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to  address current IRS backlogs.   Over the past few months, I have heard from constituents across  central Virginia who have not yet received their recovery rebate checks  or their 2019 Federal tax refunds.   Congress created the recovery rebate program to address the economic  crisis caused by COVID-19, and as families struggle waiting for IRS  checks to arrive, we know that the taxpayer correspondence which is  necessary to process these checks and tax returns is currently sitting  in trailers and office space leased specifically to store the backlog  of mail.   This backlog is unacceptable, and Congress must take action to make  clear that this backlog must be addressed, and we must give IRS the  tools they need to address it and make clear our expectations that they  will.
