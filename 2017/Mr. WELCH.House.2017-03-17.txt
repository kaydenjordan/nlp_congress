 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 16, after line 6, insert the following:        (6) An analysis of succession planning and hiring as it       relates to rural areas.        Page 16, line 7, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.        Page 17, line 21, strike ``and''.        Page 17, line 24, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 17, after line 24, insert the following:        (J) the ability to recruit and hire in rural areas.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Chair, my amendment has one goal: to ensure that rural  America is very much a part of the conversation on improving the  Veterans Administration.   This very good, bipartisan bill that is before us will help the VA  improve its ability to recruit, hire, train, promote, and retain  physicians and other employees at the VA, but it could be slightly  changed to help veterans in rural America. And, by the way, a  significant number of veterans are in rural America, including Vermont.   My amendment would add two provisions. First, the underlying bill  requires the GAO to conduct a study on succession planning at the VA.  That is intended to try to better understand the problem the agency has  to have a pipeline of qualified candidates to assume critical roles  that are open.   My amendment would require the GAO to study and analyze succession  planning and hiring in rural areas. The vast majority of our country is  rural, so we have got to put an emphasis on that. The challenges in  rural America are different than in the urban areas.   Second, the underlying bill also requires the VA to collect  information on  [[Page H2163]]  hiring effectiveness: the time it takes to fill a vacant position, the  attrition rate, the reason staff leaves, investment in training and  development, and other barriers to recruitment and training. My  amendment would require that study to focus on the rural challenges  that are different, significantly, than in the urban areas.   The lack of qualified candidates that the VA can recruit and,  ultimately, fill open positions with is a real problem. But we have to  recognize that that is even more difficult in rural America.   In Vermont, we have 50,000 veterans living in the State and only nine  VA facilities to help them. These are some of the satellite facilities  that are quite small. Our largest facility is White River Junction, the  VA Medical Center there that we are very proud of. It provided medical  care for over 26,000 of those veterans in 2016. The director there has  indicated to me that it is a real struggle to find qualified candidates  to fill mission-critical positions.   We had, at that facility, a wonderful neuropsychologist--desperately  needed--but that person was married, had children, and due to the  inability of her husband to find a job within his field of work, they  have left the VA there to go to an urban area. This is one variation of  the problem we face--to recruit, to hire, and to retain critical  personnel--that needs to be addressed in rural areas.   My amendment will help us better understand the unique challenges  rural America faces dealing with the critical staff shortages at our  veterans facilities and sets the stage for us to fix the problem.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to support my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
