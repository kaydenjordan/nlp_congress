 Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the  time that I have been allotted here this evening, joining with my  colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to answer the question  that was posed to us by this President. I rise to answer President  Trump's question to the Black community.   Now, all throughout his campaign, President Trump declared that Black  people all across this country just live in hell and fear each day, and  we may be shot on the street. He basically said that we have nothing,  our education is no good, on and on and on. Then he went on to say that  only he can solve the challenges African Americans face.   Unfortunately, this kind of talk is typical of this President:  boasting, bragging, and making promises. This President will say  anything and promise anything, of course, with no intention of living  up to his promises. One should not believe anything he has to say.   As a matter of fact, the African-American community understands very  well when these kinds of empty promises are made. As a matter of fact,  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the presidents of  the Historically Black Colleges and Universities organized, put  together, a proposal, and they went to meet with the President at the  White House.  [[Page H2461]]                                     time  2015    They didn't even have an opportunity to present the proposal. They  were just ushered around in a photo op, and that was all that happened,  without any real conversation, without any proposals being produced.  They were treated in a disrespectful way.   This, basically, is what I have decided we can expect from the  President. His budget and policy priorities reveal his true intentions  and what so many of us already know about this President. He really  doesn't care about the issues facing the African-American community,  and he doesn't care to learn about those issues or advance any  meaningful legislation to provide jobs and economic opportunities for  our Nation's most vulnerable communities.   If you take a look at Trump's HUD budget, you find a $6 billion  reduction. He wants to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  program, which supports our cities and various urban renewal projects.  He wants to eliminate the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. This  President wants to eliminate the Choice Neighborhoods program. He wants  to eliminate the homeownership program and on and on and on.   Just last week, this President tried and failed to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. If that unconscionable bill had passed, 14 million  people would have lost insurance coverage next year, and the American  people would have seen billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts.   Trump's empty promises do not end with the budget. He has also filled  his Cabinet with millionaires and billionaires who don't have a clue  about the challenges facing the African-American community.   Trump's Treasury Secretary was known as the ``Foreclosure King,'' who  profited off the backs of vulnerable homeowners during the 2008  recession.   Trump's Education Secretary knows nothing about public education, did  not attend public schools. Her children didn't attend public schools.  She was not chosen to repair public education; she was chosen to break  it.   Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who lied under oath before the  Senate, opposed the Violence Against Women Act. He has taken hardline  positions against our efforts to reform the criminal justice system,  which disproportionately incarcerates African Americans. Of course, we  knew about his background and his history and what he is known for, and  that is discrimination, disrespect for African Americans.   Mr. Speaker, my position against this President and his  administration is clear: I oppose this President. I do not honor this  President. I do not respect this President. He has disrespected the  office and offended so many people across this country and around the  world with his disgusting and indecent rhetoric against women, the  Black community, Muslims, immigrants, and disabled Americans.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just the African-American community who will  lose under this President. It is everyone who isn't a millionaire or  billionaire that stand to lose under this administration. I will  continue to oppose him and fight him every step of the way.   While I am talking about where he has put his priorities--and, of  course, I think the budget really does reflect your priorities--he has  reduced the education budget by 13 percent, or $9 billion less than  last year; a $168 billion increase for charter schools, 50 percent  above current levels.   Let's take a look at labor. It reduces the budget by 21 percent, a  $2.5 billion decrease from last year. Health and Human Services,  decreased funding by $15 billion, the lowest in 20 years.   It reduces funding for the National Institutes of Health by 19  percent. For the Environmental Protection Agency, it reduces the budget  from $8.1 billion to $5.7 billion. Housing and Urban Development,  again, reducing the budget by just about $6 billion, or 13.2 percent.   He claims he cares about small businesses. He reduces the SBA budget  by 5 percent, or $43.2 billion less than last year. It goes on and on  and on.   Homeland Security, increases the budget by only 6.8 percent, to $44  billion, even though he claims he cares a lot about the security of  this country.   What am I saying? I am simply saying that African Americans have  struggled and fought, historically. Many African Americans have paid a  huge price fighting for justice and equality in this country and have  died for it. I don't have to call the names of Martin Luther King and  all the others. We have paid a price. We have fought.   But guess what? Despite the fact that America has not always been  there for us, we have always been there for America. We have fought in  America's wars. We have suffered discrimination. We have suffered  isolation and undermining. But we stand up for America, oftentimes when  others who think they are more patriotic--who say they are more  patriotic--do not.   When we fight against this President and we point out how dangerous  he is for this society and for this country, we are fighting for  democracy. We are fighting for America. We are saying to those who say  they are patriotic but they turn a blind eye to the destruction that he  is about to cause this country: You are not nearly as patriotic as we  are.   We not only have fought in America's wars, have stood up for America,  have been there whenever this country was threatened in any way, we say  now that this country is threatened with a President who does not  belong there, a President who does not understand how this government  works, a President who goes down to Mar-a-Lago every weekend and plays  golf. He is not huddling with Members of Congress and trying to figure  out how to form a consensus. Rather, he thought he could come in here  and run roughshod over everybody. But that is how he works, that is how  he acts.   He is not good for America. African Americans know this. The Black  Caucus understands this. And for those members of the Black Caucus  representing our leadership who went to meet with him, they have laid  out to him all of this, what our care and concerns are all about. But  in the final analysis, we really don't expect anything from him. My  mission and my goal is to make sure that he does not remain President  of the United States of America.
