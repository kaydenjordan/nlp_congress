 Madam President, I rise today to support Senator  Tuberville's Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.   For more than half a century, title IX has expanded opportunities for  women and girls from the classroom to the playing field. According to  the Women's Sports Foundation, our country went from a ratio of 1 in 27  girls playing sports in 1972 to 1 in 5 today. We went from fewer than  30,000 female collegiate athletes in 1972 to nearly 230,000 female  athletes today. That is progress that should be celebrated.   However, women's sports are fundamentally undermined when biological  males are allowed to compete against them. There are biological  differences between men and women. If we ignore those differences, we  threaten future opportunities for female athletes and the entire notion  of women's sports. It is unfair, it is unsafe, and it is unacceptable.  That is why Senator Tuberville's bill is so important. It simply  ensures that title IX protections are clearly defined by a person's  reproductive biology and genetics at birth.   The bottom line: Female athletes should compete against other female  athletes. It is that simple.   I yield the floor.
