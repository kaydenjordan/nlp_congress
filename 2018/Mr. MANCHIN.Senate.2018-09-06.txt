 Mr. President, Today I wish to honor a White Sulphur  Springs native who not only completed groundbreaking work at NASA  during the space race, but who also broke the barriers of race and  gender during a critical time in our Nation.   Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson was blessed with a natural talent for  mathematics which far exceeded that of her peers. By the age of 13,  Katherine was already attending high school on West Virginia State  College's campus where, in 1937, she received a B.S. in both  mathematics and French.   In 1939, when West Virginia began to integrate its graduate schools,  West Virginia State's president, Dr. John Davis, personally selected  Katherine and two male students as the first African-American students  to attend West Virginia University.   After starting a family, Katherine found work at the West Area  Computing section of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics'  Langley laboratory, headed by fellow West Virginian Dorothy Vaughan.  The 1957 launch of the Soviet satellite, Sputnik, changed history--and  Katherine's life. Her work on the equations to describe an orbital  spaceflight in which the landing position of the a spacecraft is  specified led to Katherine being the first woman recognized as an  author of a report from the flight research division.   As NASA prepared for the orbital mission with John Glenn in 1962,  Katherine was famously asked to run the orbital equations controlling  the Friendship 7 trajectory by hand in case of a mechanical computing  error. Katherine has recalled John Glenn saying that, if she said the  numbers were good, then he was good to go. The mission was a success  and marked a tremendous turning point in the competition between the  United States and the Soviet Union in space.   Katherine's story inspired the book, ``Hidden Figures,'' by Margot  Lee Shetterly and also the Oscar-nominated film of the same name.   Recently, 46 of my colleagues and I introduced the Hidden Figures  Congressional Gold Medal Act, which would award Congressional Gold  Medals to Katherine, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine  Darden in recognition for their contributions to NASA's success during  the space race. In 2015, President Obama awarded her the Presidential  Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.   A bronze statue in Katherine's honor now stands on the campus of West  Virginia State University. It is my hope that the students who pass it  every day will be reminded of Katherine's legacy and will be inspired  to keep their passion for knowledge alive.   Every one of our female leaders in West Virginia are the epitome of  strength, leadership, and advancement in their fields. They serve as  inspiring role models for the next generation, and that is due in great  part to the women who broke ground in generations past. Because of the  accomplishments of intellectual leaders such as Katherine, more young  women have and will blaze their own trails in the fields of science,  math, engineering, and technology and will continue to make our State  and entire Nation proud.   It is an honor to recognize Katherine's legacy and to wish her the  very best as we celebrate her 100th birthday.                            ____________________
