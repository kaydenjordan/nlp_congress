 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 47,  this lands package.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member  for their bipartisan work on this important bill.   Our public lands define our Montana way of life. Three principles  guide my approach: conserve our public lands, increase public access,  and trust our local communities.   These principles guided me to protect the gateway to Yellowstone  National Park. I met with the residents and community leaders, and the  consensus is clear: They don't want mining in Paradise Valley. That is  why I introduced the legislation to permanently ban mining on 30,000  acres of public land just outside Yellowstone Park. That measure is  included in this package today.   This package also permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Susan and I raised our kids hunting, fishing, and backpacking on our  public lands in Montana, and I know how critical LWCF is to Montana.   Permanently protecting the gateway to Yellowstone and permanently  reauthorizing LWCF will help preserve and expand public access to our  public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this bill. It is so important  to Montana.
