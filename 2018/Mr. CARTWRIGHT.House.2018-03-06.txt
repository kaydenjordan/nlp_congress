 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 188, the  Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act, an acronym for the EGO  Act.   S. 188 is the Senate companion to H.R. 1401, legislation that I  introduced along with Representatives Jim Bridenstine, Cheri Bustos,  Walter Jones, Leonard Lance, David McKinley, Pete Olson, and Tom Rice.   My friend and former House colleague, Senator Bill Cassidy, is the  lead sponsor of S. 188 which passed the Senate unanimously on September  18, 2017.   The EGO Act would prohibit Federal funds from being used to pay for  the costs of painting portraits of officers and employees of the  Federal Government. Federal agencies have spent hundreds of thousands  of dollars on portraits that are displayed within agency buildings,  often in secure locations that are not open to the public. Although  this money is only a fraction of a percentage of the federal budget, it  represents a failure to exercise fiscal restraint. Every dollar the  government spends on vanity projects for federal officials is a dollar  that is not spent improving the lives of everyday Americans.   Congress has the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are  being used efficiently and effectively. For these reasons, I am proud  to sponsor the EGO Act, and urge the House to pass S. 188, sending it  to the President's desk.
