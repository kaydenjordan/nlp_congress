 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 620, the ADA  Education and Reform Act of 2017. This is overdue legislation that will  increase protections for individuals with disabilities while providing  business and property owners the opportunity to remedy ADA infractions  before unnecessary lawsuits and the costs that accompany litigation.  Under the current ADA law, lawyers may collect fees when suing  businesses or property owners, but plaintiffs cannot collect damages.  The current system has created ``drive-by'' demand letters sent by  lawyers, like a bulk mailer, to every location on Main St. or at a  small mall. In some cases it was not clear that the plaintiff had even  attempted to access the property or had even gone inside. The emphasis  was on filing the lawsuit and collecting fees without regard for  increasing accessibility for the disabled. Sometimes the infractions  are easily corrected: signage, soap dispenser heights.   In my district in east San Diego County we have quaint, older towns  that are notable for their historical structures dating back to the  1800s. These communities are proud of their heritage and these  buildings are a source of local pride and tourism. In Julian, an old  gold mining and apple growing town, the Julian Town Hall was threatened  by a lawsuit. A public relations stunt was held there where someone  crawled up the steps of the town hall, cameras rolling, despite the  fact that a handicap accessible ramp was located on the side of the  building. In Ramona, a predatory lawyer targeted every business on Main  St. with various and frivolous claims. It is for these and other  reasons I introduced similar legislation, H.R. 777, the ADA  Notification Act of 2013.   With the ``notice and cure'' provision in H.R. 620, drive-by lawsuits  will be eliminated, business will have an opportunity to remedy any  deficiency, and there will be increased compliance and correction  because property and business owners cannot defer the corrections.
