 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution lists many Communist dictators, but it  doesn't list any of the capitalist dictators--from Hitler to Mussolini  to Franco to Salazar to Peron, and so many more, because the issue is  not socialism, the issue is tyranny.   The second issue is the progress of the American people. Because  every single issue of progress from Medicare to Medicaid to the  Affordable Care Act to public housing to Social Security has been  called by Republican leaders at the time ``socialist.''   This is not an attack on tyranny. This is an attack on all of these  programs. This is an attack on Medicare, on Social Security, on public  housing, on Federal aid to education, on everything the Republicans  have quoted ``socialist'' when they were first enacted, and they still  want to get rid of.
