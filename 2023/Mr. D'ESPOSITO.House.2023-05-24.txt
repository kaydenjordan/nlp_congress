 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 467, the  HALT Fentanyl Act of which I am proud to cosponsor. I also find it  baffling, Madam Chair, that speakers from the other side say that this  does nothing when, in fact, we are working to correct the wrongs of the  procriminal, open-border agenda that Democrats have passed throughout  this country.   There is not one community across this Nation that has been immune to  the devastating effects of fentanyl. As an NYPD detective, I have  witnessed far too many Americans destroyed due to opioid addictions  stemming from this horrific narcotic, and Congress must act swiftly to  combat the fentanyl epidemic.   Madam Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support the HALT Act in  order to make permanent classwide scheduling order for fentanyl-related  substances, which is the key to preventing unneeded deaths related to  fentanyl.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to  Michael R. Masone, an ex-chief of the Island Park Fire Department, the  same department that I proudly served for the last 23 years.   This weekend back home in Island Park, we are going to rededicate our  beloved local beach in his honor. The ex-Chief Michael R. Masone Beach  was named for a man who back in 1942, when he served as chief of our  great department, resigned. He resigned as chief to do something far  greater, and that was to serve this Nation in World War II. He returned  home and married the love of his life, Sue, and they lived in Island  Park for decades.   He was the senior member of our department when he passed away,  serving over 70 years.   His nickname in Island Park was ``The Hawk,'' and we called him ``The  Hawk'' because he always kept a watchful eye on our beloved community.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward this weekend to joining neighbors, loved  ones, family, friends, and fellow Island Parkers in, once again, paying  tribute to a true American hero, someone whom we all aspire to be back  in Island Park, ex-Chief Michael R. Masone.                            ____________________
