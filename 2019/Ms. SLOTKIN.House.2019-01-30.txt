 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about the bill that  I introduced called the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns, or SEAS, Act,  along with 21 of my fellow freshmen.   This bill will stop the use of government shutdowns as a tool in  political debate and ensure that our Federal workers are never again  held hostage when Congress and the President's office cannot agree.   Under this act, if a deal cannot be reached, Members of the House,  the Senate, the Executive Office of the President, and his political  appointees will have their pay suspended and their travel from D.C.  curtailed.   To my fellow Michiganders: This bill was because of you. You asked me  why the average TSA workers, Customs and Border Patrol employees, FAA  employees, and FDA employees were punished  [[Page H1321]]  because of something they had nothing to do with. And I heard you.   To my fellow Members of Congress who may be reticent to support a  bill that penalizes ourselves: This is a moment of leadership. This is  a moment to acknowledge that we may not have started this shutdown, but  it is our responsibility to prevent them from happening in the future.   Madam Speaker, I implore my colleagues to do the right thing and  support this bill.                            ____________________
