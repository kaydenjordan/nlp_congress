 Mr. Speaker, as we break here for a recess, it is  important to remember that COVID is still a very serious threat, and a  little under 2,000 people a day are dying of it.   I have been contacted by medical professionals in my district who  feel there is too much pressure to use  [[Page H1092]]  remdesivir and not enough opportunity to use ivermectin or  hydroxychloroquine to treat this horrific disease. This is  unprecedented that people would step in.   As I understand it, hospitals are billing out over $3,000 a day for  remdesivir, but they may be getting under $50 or $60 a day for  ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine.   The combination of doctors being prevented from doing what they want  and the fact that some people are making a lot more money on one drug  than the other is something the press should be looking into, and it is  something I think our Oversight and Reform Committee should be looking  into.   I hope if anybody is paying attention, you pick up on this story and  see what the real background is. I am not an expert on the topic, but  experts on the topic do believe that people are dying unnecessarily.                            ____________________
