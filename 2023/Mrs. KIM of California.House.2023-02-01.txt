 Mr. Speaker, as we all know, deceptive drugs  made of fentanyl are killing young people and destroying lives in  southern California and across our Nation at an alarming rate.   In California, fentanyl is responsible for one out of every five  youth deaths.   The top source of fentanyl is the U.S.-Mexico border, and last year,  60 percent of fentanyl found in 2022 was at southern California ports  of entry in San Diego and Imperial counties near my district.   The Orange County Sheriff's Department seized more than 400 pounds of  suspected fentanyl, and nearly 400,000 pills suspected to contain  fentanyl during the first 10 months in 2022.   I will keep fighting for solutions to secure our border and prevent  these drugs from entering our schools, streets, neighborhoods, and  homes.                            ____________________
