 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 619, a bill  to require the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to  declassify all information related to potential leaks between the Wuhan  Institute of Virology and the origins of COVID-19.   We had red flags about COVID's origins from day one. If it looks like  a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a  duck. Folks, this screams like a duck.   In January 2020, Dr. Fauci received emails that promulgated that  COVID-19 looked engineered and not from the wild. Yet, 3 weeks later,  to save his own skin, he commissioned a scientific paper that  ``debunked'' the lab theory. He was academically and intellectually  dishonest. Why? He did not want the American people to know the truth.   The truth is that Dr. Fauci and his institution funneled hundreds of  thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to promote dangerous gain-of- function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology without proper  guardrails.   That is the key. The Wuhan lab was no more set up to deal with this  deadly virus than my mother's kitchen.   We had people--thousands, millions of people--lose their lives, their  livelihoods, and their loved ones.   If this contagion leaked from the lab, if that is the case, the world  deserves to know. It is time to call out the duck in the room. Release  the intelligence that we need to find out the truth.   We have been lied to by China. We have even been lied to by our own  government leaders. We need the truth. We ask our colleagues to please  pass this bill.
