 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as co-chair of the Bipartisan  Ski and Snow Board Caucus to recognize the incredible achievements of  New Hampshire's own Mikaela Shiffrin, the most-decorated skier of all  time.   On March 11, 2023, during Women's History Month, Mikaela broke the  record for the most World Cup alpine wins by any skier, male or female,  earning 87 championship wins and securing her place in history.   Shortly after, she won another title, breaking her own record and  making history again. I love having a woman be the most decorated skier  in the world.   From her earliest days, when I met her at the Dartmouth Ski Way and  first watched her race with her late father, my friend, Jeff, Mikaela  has taken the world by storm. Her record-breaking win and dedication to  the sport will inspire women and girls across the country and around  the world.   Thank you, Mikaela, for inspiring us to be nice, think first, and  have fun.                            ____________________
