 Mr. Speaker, yes, it is one of those last names. I  have family members that have trouble pronouncing it.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, may I make a quick parliamentary  inquiry?    Mr. Speaker, my question is, just because the  Democrat leadership here changed the rules sometime last night, do I  have to wear this thing while standing here alone during my 1-hour  Special Order? May I take it off when I am at the mike?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the clarification. I know  we are all trying to get our heads around it because things keep  changing around here.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Oklahoma had a couple of things she  wanted to share tonight. This is the first time she and I have had a  chance to talk. She is really smart and incredibly charming.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma, I only  got this in an alert just about 2 hours ago, and I will send her a copy  of it.   Apparently, we now have a whistleblower, a formal whistleblower  complaint. They were there to help take care of these children, and  they were instructed not to disclose how many of these people in the  housing unit had COVID.   If that is true, once again, we are back to the duplicity of what has  been going on at the border.   As we talk about just what this is doing, the impact to the country-- and I am going to talk a little bit about what it does to the working  poor--that might be a really interesting thing, because you touched on  it, this whistleblower complaint that may expose that they are being  told not to disclose the level of COVID that is in this population  crossing the border illegally.    It is a great irony, isn't it?    What do you think the likelihood is that the Democrat  majority here, in their constitutional oversight responsibility, will  take that whistleblower complaint seriously and look into the fact  that, if it is true, we have been lied to?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and wish her a  great evening.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to do a couple of things this evening, and  I am going to try to tie it together. Hopefully, some of this makes  sense. I am going to start off with just a one-off.   Last week, I had a gentleman knock on my front door of my home. For  all of us who are elected in this sort of time where things are a  little anxious, you always stand up a bit when someone you don't know  is at your front door.   Turns out, it is a really smart gentleman. He has a Ph.D. in  amphibians and lives down the street from me. He had something he  wanted to share, and this was something I didn't expect. It was a  complete one-off.   He told me the story of what had happened just a couple of weeks  earlier. He had this beloved dog. I am going to screw up the breed. I  think it was some type of malamute, just this big, beautiful, fuzzy  white dog. Apparently, the canine had gotten his wife's purse and  chewed up some gum.   I know this seems like a weird thing to do on the floor of the House,  but it killed the dog. I think the more technical term is a sugar  alcohol that is used. It is pronounced xylitol, which we see in certain  gum products and candy products. It is an artificial sweetener.  Apparently, it kills our canines.   We have drafted a letter to the FDA and the appropriate agencies,  asking if there is knowledge of this. If there is also knowledge of  this, should there at least be some warning put on these packages?  Because I had never heard of this.   Then, when I went to the internet and looked, there was story after  story after story after story of just heartbreak about people with  their puppies getting some gum, getting one of these artificially  sweetened candies, and dying. I guess it shuts down the liver  incredibly aggressively.   As almost a public service announcement, but also I am hoping that my  colleagues on the left and right--if the FDA, if the bureaucracy  doesn't really respond to us--would be willing to do a piece of  legislation creating a directive that there needs to be some sort of  warning on these products that if your puppy gets loose with this, it  may lose its life.   That is a little different than talking about economics, but the  gentleman was just heartbroken because this dog was truly one of his  best friends, a really important family member. To go from being out  there playing to, several hours later, having him pass away, I think  all of us would understand the impact of that.   I had not heard about this. I think if we have gum with that  sweetener sitting around our house--and I have a puppy coonhound that  will munch on anything. We quickly got that in the shelves, away from  the dog.   For all of us, it is something that we are thinking. Hopefully, the  FDA and others will do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk about what is going on in our Nation. We are  going to touch a little bit--and it is going to be a little sarcastic  and a little cranky. I am sorry about that, but I don't know another  way to try to tell the story of just the absurdity of what is going on  in some of our tax policy and economic policy.   Mr. Speaker, the theme I really want to try to weave through today is  not  [[Page H4242]]  being understood, I don't think, by either Republicans or Democrats,  liberals or conservatives.   So much of the public policy that is being pushed right now is just  crushing to the working poor. We are going to do some really crappy  things to the working poor, and it is not necessary.   There is rational economic policy. You don't cater to certain of your  activist constituencies as much, but it is much more effective to  helping those we say we care about here in our society.                                time  2045    I do this slide as often as I can. What is the greatest threat in  this country right now to my 5-year-old daughter, to your retirement?   The fact of the matter is our demographics. This slide is before all  the crazy spending proposals that have been produced so far this year.  This is where we are structurally.   And the fact of the matter is, as a society, we are getting old  really fast. So think of this in 30 years in today's dollars. So I will  adjust for inflation. In today's dollars, we will be $101 trillion in  publicly borrowed money. Only about $3 trillion of that is what you  would think of as general spending. All the rest of it is purely Social  Security and Medicare.   Medicare is about $71 trillion of borrowed money. The spend is much,  much, much, much larger than that, but that is how much we are going to  have to borrow to finance the shortfall.   Because, once again, for those who don't pay attention to this,  Medicare is a promise. We have made that promise to American workers  and American retirees. But only part A, which is the hospital portion,  is actually the trust fund. And the trust fund is gone in 3 to 5 years,  we wiped out that money.   The rest of Medicare spending, when you see the doctor, when you get  a pharmaceutical, those things come right out of the general fund.  There is no trust fund for that spend.   If we don't get serious about sort of the holistic theory of how you  save this country, and it turns out really aggressive economic growth,  you have got to embrace technologies and new methods to crash the price  of healthcare, these sorts of things. If we don't have that type of  vision, these numbers become what drives all policy.   If you care about the environment, if you care about education, if  you care about this, there will be no money because we will spend every  dime we have just financing the retirement promise that we have made as  a government, as a society to each other. But yet this isn't  particularly sexy. It is really scary. It is really hard. It requires a  calculator. And God knows, we all work in a place that doesn't own  calculators.   So let's walk through a little bit of the reality that part of the  solution to what we are doing to the working poor, part of the solution  to what we are doing to these massive, massive unfunded promises is  economic growth.   And one of my intense frustrations is the amount this place is  willing to, what do you call it, oh, yeah, lie, about basic revenues.  We call them receipts in Ways and Means, tax revenues, and these  things. Remember, post tax reform a number of my brothers and sisters  on the left got up behind these microphones and told stories: We are  going to go into massive recession, the revenues are going to collapse,  this is going to happen.   Well, what ended up happening?   Remember 2018--because remember we passed tax reform at the end of  2017--2018 and 2019 were the second and third highest, adjusted for  inflation, so we are talking real math, receipts, tax collections in  U.S. history. But what was more phenomenal about it is it created such  an economic lift. So many of our brothers and sisters were working,  particularly from the working poor. We saw things--and we are going to  look at a couple of those boards--where the working poor became  dramatically less poor. And because they are working, the trust funds  we were just touching on, what we showed for Social Security and  Medicare, their longevity revenues, because people were working, their  lives got longer. This was actually, I thought, the Holy Grail for both  those on the left and the right, we were going to try to find a way to  mathematically make the numbers work so we can keep our promises.   Well, it turns out, post tax reform, the receipts were incredibly  robust, and they were the second and third highest in U.S. history. And  the only reason they weren't number one, by a sliver, was in 2015 we  had some really unusual, what they call, timing effects, when certain  things happened just before the end of the fiscal year that were posted  in a certain fiscal year. So I won't geek out too much on that.   But often you will hear Members of the majority party here get behind  the microphone, and say, well, the tax scam. It is really actually a  pretty dark thing to say, because those couple of years before the  pandemic were some of the most robust--actually, the most robust years  in modern economic times for the poor in this country. The working poor  became dramatically less poor.   But there are those that will stand behind the microphone and call it  a tax scam. And the willingness to keep lying--and I am sorry, I know  that is a crappy word to use, but I am so frustrated because they can't  seem to stop. A couple of Members, just this last week, once again, got  behind these microphones, and said: Well, 83 percent goes to the top 1  percent. That is a lie.   As a matter of fact, even the Washington Post--which is not really  particularly friendly to those of us on the free market economic side-- has gotten so frustrated with Democrats getting behind microphones and  lying. They are even now saying, the zombie claim that 2017 tax cuts  gave 83 percent to the top 1 percent. Even the leftist newspapers are  just bewildered with the left not telling the truth. I don't mind  having policy arguments, but don't make crap up, over and over and  over.   We see now even the left-wing media is having to correct the  Democrats, saying, no, it turns out post tax reform that 2018 and 2019  were sort of miracle years; incredible wage growth, incredible  productivity growth, savings growth, and particularly for the  populations that we claim we care about.   Remember, they were the first 2 years in modern economic history  where income inequality really shrank, and I thought that was the Holy  Grail, that the wealthy got wealthier, but the poor got much less poor  much faster, actually closing the income differential gaps and the  wealth gaps. I always thought that that was the Holy Grail around here.    And when it happened--but it didn't happen with social engineering,  it didn't happen with big spending programs that you get to basically  extort votes with. It happened by opening up the economy and creating  investment in productivity that made it so you could pay people more.  It gets vilified with misinformation. It is just real hard to make  honest government public policy when one side won't actually own a  calculator.   So to beat this a little bit more, you take a look at what happened  to, particularly, working, unmarried women. The wage growth was  remarkable. Just remarkable. I think it was in 2019, we had African- American females, I think, who were having like a 7-8 percent growth in  wages in a single year in a time with almost no inflation. Some of  these numbers were remarkable.   And if the goal here is to make the poor less poor, I actually  believe those who were on the free market side have demonstrated there  is a path where it works, and it is sustainable. And we are going to  come back to that theme, because this year we will probably see income  and equality shrink, but it is going to shrink in a way--because we  have pumped so much cash out the door--it is not sustainable. As soon  as that money goes away, we go back to the bad old days and the really  crappy policies of the previous decade.   So let's actually walk through something that we started to touch on  when we opened this up. The violence--and I am going to use the term,  economic violence--that we are committing to the working poor in this  country seems to get no press. I mean, if you read some of the really  geeky economic journals, they are shaking their heads trying to get  their heads around why the left is doing what they are doing.   But if I came to you tomorrow and said, tell me the number one policy  sin that is going on right now that crushes the working poor. The  classic definition of the working poor is they may not have finished  high school. That is  [[Page H4243]]  their labor is their value, it is what they sell.   It turns out, when you open up the borders--we have some amazingly  detailed studies, and these are studies from years ago, back when  Democrats actually believed in locking down the borders to protect  working men and women. Remember these days, it was only like a decade  and a half ago, where Republicans were accused of being owned by the  Chamber of Commerce and wanting cheap labor, and Democrats were going  to protect working men and women? Until all of a sudden it seems to  reverse.   And I just desperately wish this place actually used basic economic  theory to create policies instead of sort of having a meeting and  saying, okay, this year you guys take that side, we will take this  side. It is just absurd what is going on.   We have a number of studies that talk about when you flood the market  with folks with similar skill sets. So you basically--if you are part  of the working poor, what do you sell? You sell your labor. And this is  the right board, sorry.   When you open up the border, we are actually looking at a reduction  in wages by 6.2 percent. But why this is so harsh is some of the papers  say it is going to last for a decade. What is going on at the U.S.  border right now is, you are kicking the heads in of the working poor  in this country for the next decade.   I know that doesn't fit the talking heads' language that you see on  cable television or the rhetoric around here, but you can't sort of  give speeches and say you care and then engage in policies that crush  the value of their labor because you make them compete against  potentially millions of those with similar skill sets.   And you start to take a look at what we did this last year, where  there was peak unemployment for those skill sets. Now, if you happen to  be a computer programmer this last crappy year, actually you did just  fine. If you are someone who your skill set was you could work from  home, you survived.   If you happened to be part of the population that you had not  finished high school, you were in the 21-plus-percent unemployment  area. It turns out the very populations that were most crushed by the  pandemic are the very ones we are turning around and kicking their  heads in again by opening up the border.   Is it compassionate? Is it truly loving?   When I hear speeches from my friends on the left saying, well, we are  opening up the borders to be compassionate. How about the millions and  millions and millions of our brothers and sisters here who may not have  had the opportunities that those in this body have had? And we are  going to make them compete with similar skill sets and millions of new  arrivals.   And it turns out, if you actually look at the math, it is African  Americans, particularly in urban areas, that you have just--that this  body has just--by this President's policies, have crushed their future  earning power, have made the value of their labor much less and it is  not short term.   If you read the studies, we have a whole decade now of loss from  where we were in 2018 and 2019, we have just wiped out that progress  and the previous several years of progress. You would think this place  would actually care about things like that.   No. Because what is going to happen is the left's economic policies  aren't, hey, we need revenues for this spending, and being extra  creative with where those revenues come from.   Remember, I have come to this floor multiple times and said, if we  need a trillion dollars for infrastructure, I can show you where you  can cut a trillion dollars in spending, stop subsidizing the rich.                                time  2100    Stop subsidizing the very top 1 percent. Stop subsidizing their flood  insurance on their third home on the beach. Stop buying them subsidies  for their Teslas, for their electric car, and for their solar panels.   If you take a look, Mr. Speaker, this is one of the great  perversities we have here in policy, is the left wants to raise taxes  on the rich and then on the other hand, hand it back to them in  subsidies for other things they buy. I assume this is purely political.   This is, hey, I am giving you something, vote for me. Then you are  able to tell your base, hey, look here, I went out and taxed the rich.   But from an economic standpoint, this is an absurd thing to do. This  is economically distorting, and this is almost a type of political  exploitation.   Why don't you just go straight, Mr. Speaker?   Don't do the economic extortions. Stop subsidizing, and stop sending  the money out the door.   What is fascinating is I have done that speech now three times on the  floor. I have sat down with a couple of my Ways and Means Democrat  friends, walked them through the binder on all the things we do to  subsidize the wealthy, and they just look at me, shrug, and say, Well,  I don't know how we would sell that.   It is crazy. But it shows you, Mr. Speaker, the perversity of policy  here.   So this becomes the policy being offered by the left: Let's raise  corporate taxes.   Okay. Well, besides the international tax that we seem to be signing  onto that is going to make the United States one of the most  uncompetitive nations in the world, we are also about to do something  where raising the corporate tax in the first 24 months we lose 1  million jobs.   So, Mr. Speaker, do you remember how we were talking about we need  that robust economy and we need the robust labor market, but Democrats  get their tax policies, just the corporate tax will unemploy in the  first 24 months 1 million Americans.   So we start to take a look at--and this is a little complex to try to  show on a board, we are going to have to spend more time on it to try  to explain. But this is a whole bunch of the revenue side that the  Democrats are proposing, and this is the spending.   The problem is much of the revenue here is a fraud. It is not real.  So, Mr. Speaker, you start looking at the tax compliance. We can give  you some proposals, and we have been trying for years, saying use data.  You can cover much that of that tax gap by using data, not hiring  80,000--think of that, 80,000, that is twice as many as the entire  Coast Guard--80,000 new unionized IRS employees to go out and chase  people for the taxes when it turns out we have these supercomputers in  your pocket, and there is data out there that would let you match  instantly saying: Is this person telling us the truth?   It would be dramatically less intrusive, because for this to work,  the Democrats actually have a proposal where you are going to turn  every bank account into an IRS employee. Mr. Speaker, you do  understand, if you look at the Democrats' revenue proposal, my  transactions, my bank balances, my ins and outs, go to the IRS.   This march towards totalitarianism is on every one of these aspects.  So it is not enough to just make up fake numbers of what the revenues  are going to be. It is inherently intrusive, and it won't work. You  will get lots of data, Mr. Speaker, that you can functionally use  against the American people, but it is not the data that is actually  going to get you the revenues, because for these who are really rich,  tomorrow they will just move their money or their currency, they will  do a crypto, they will do that type of token type of transaction, and  it will be the rest of the American public that just gets crushed by  this intrusion.   So let's actually sort of dig a little bit more into this so it is  understood. Lots and lots of the experts out there, many are just the  columnists. If you take a look, Mr. Speaker, some of them who are  actually on the left are making it very clear that the Democrats'  revenue proposals are a fraud. They are making things up.   These are just some snippets of many of the articles that are out  there, and they are calling it bipartisan. But there was a promise.   Do you remember? The big promise from the President and Speaker  Pelosi is: We are going to pay for these things.   No, they are not. Let me show you, Mr. Speaker, how devious this  stuff is. So President Trump a couple years ago--and many of us weren't  thrilled with the model--proposed a rebate back to the consumers.  [[Page H4244]]    So you buy a pharmaceutical, the purchasing managers in the  background who buy it from the manufacturer and get it to your pharmacy  get a rebate. They take that rebate and use part of it to buy down the  price of the drug. Then it is sold at the retail counter, and you get a  lower price.   President Trump's proposal was to take that and not buy down the  price of the drug; therefore, it would actually raise the drug cost a  little bit to Government, but the consumer would get that rebate at the  retail counter. This is the simplest way to describe it. It is a little  complex.   This is the way it works over here. The Democrats said: Oh, no. We  hate this.   I have a whole list of quotes from Speaker Pelosi and the Biden team  saying that this will never become policy and this will never become  law.   Well, if it was never going to become law, how can the Democrats turn  around and tell us that they are going to use the money from that  program as one of their pay-fors?   It was like $180 billion. This is not law, and it is not policy. It  was a proposal. But somehow if you look at the list of the pay-fors  from the left, Mr. Speaker, they put $180 billion and say: Hey, we will  just take this fake, magical money and use that to buy our friends.   Is this the new and improved way?   Mr. Speaker, you wonder why the American people when they start to  understand the scam that are so many of these spending tax proposals  why they are becoming so cynical.    I put up this board, because I want to call it the cliff that it is.  Here is one of the other great scams that is in the Democrats spending  proposals, how they get the scores to work.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask for my time.    I am sorry if I sound a little cranky, but I have had  a lot of coffee. As you know, Mr. Speaker, at a certain point when you  start to stack this stuff up it just breaks your heart, because we are  better than the games we are playing right now. Please trust me, if  Republicans were doing this, I would be, and I have been, when we have  tried doing these sorts of things I have been every bit as aggressive.   So here is the scam so the public understands this: There are things  like PAYGO where, hey, if a program goes more than 5 years, it has to  be paid for.   So, Mr. Speaker, what if you create a multi-multi-multibillion dollar  program, and then on the fifth year you just pretend it comes to an  end?   Hey, we are just going to drop it. It doesn't really exist. Wink,  wink, nod, nod.   We know a future Congress will have to extend it, because it have  will have a constituency, but that way when it is scored, it scores  within--and we don't have to pretend that we just created another  program that has no funding and, therefore, continues to explode that  debt.   This is actually what the Democrats are doing, and much of the  spending is the creating games.   So earlier this year we created things like the childcare tax credit  extension. Republicans really want to work on this, because  particularly if we can target it to help the working poor there is a  much more uncomfortable conversation, but we need to have it because,  as you know, Mr. Speaker, the United States has a collapsing fertility  rate. We actually now functionally don't have enough children to cover  our debts. Oddly enough, that has a huge impact on future economic  robustness.   How do we make it so you can afford to have a family?   So the left has actually created a thing here where it costs  functionally $100 billion this year. In the proposal, it would cost  $1.3 trillion to do this the way the Democrats are spending money over  the 10 years.   So how do they make that score work?   How do they not have to say: Well, just the childcare credit is $1.3  trillion of spending over 10 years. They just pretend it stops. They  get a few years out, and then they just drop it.   You are really going to take the populace of the United States, start  sending them a check every month, and then pretend it is going to stop?   That is the example. There are bunches of these examples. As a matter  of fact, they did it with SCHIP years ago where on the sixth year the  program was just supposed to disappear, and that is how they were so  giddy they could get it to work with PAYGO.                                time  2110    You wonder why the public realizes this place is almost operating  like scam artists. If we allowed someone outside this building to do  things like that, we would put them in jail.   Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of other things here. There are ways  to find revenues to cover the infrastructure spending. I believe those  of us on the more conservative side, we can show you places to cut  spending and, therefore, not create the distortions.   You all saw the report, though I am sure my brothers and sisters on  the left will avoid ever saying it out loud, that the actual capital  gains tax hike on its own loses $33 billion in the 10 years, that it is  not until you start to play games with something called bases.   Well, Mr. Speaker, have you ever thought about what a capital gains  tax actually is? Okay. We are going to tax you for the gain you have in  your value, the profit you made. What happens when the house you have,  the piece of real estate, the other things you own--it is not  appreciation. It is called inflation.   You do realize that is one of the great scams going on at this  moment. As your house goes up in value, as other things go up in value,  and we are going to get this much larger capital gains tax, then we are  going to remove a bunch of what they call the bases. We are going to  cap what you can subject to the lower tax rate.   You do realize that we are going to tax Americans on the higher price  from inflation, not the actual purchasing power of it getting more  valuable.   Let's do an example of your home. Now, you are a single person. You  own a home, and it goes up by half a million dollars. You have just  done incredibly well. That first $250,000 of gain--it is called once in  a lifetime though you get to use it, I think, every 5 years--is exempt.  But that other $250,000, you will have to pay capital gains tax on.   How much of that gain is appreciation? You bought a house in the  right neighborhood. You exploded in value. But the next house you are  going to buy, didn't it also go up similar in value, similar in cost?  Was it inflation?   You will pay tax and now extraordinarily high tax rates, if the  Democrats get their proposal, on that gain. It is a certain level of  cruelty.   The last thing I want to touch on is, if our body here really wants  to have an honest discussion about infrastructure and its true needs in  our society--I have not seen the details of the so-called bipartisan  agreement in the Senate, but the devil is always in the details.   I have a couple of examples here. If we are really going to do this,  we need to sort of figure out if the Democrats really want  infrastructure, particularly even green infrastructure. Do we really  want it, or do we just want to put up a whole lot of cash that,  ultimately, basically goes to environmental groups and that,  ultimately, just goes to lawyers?   Let me give you an example. For us out in the Southwest, there is  this area of New Mexico--I guess the way it is phrased is that they  have this tremendous wind asset. It is one of the greatest wind  production areas in all of North America.   Fifteen years ago, California said, hey, we really want some of that  clean energy from that wind area in New Mexico. We will help invest in  it. We will buy a forward on it. We will contract to buy this. We are  at 15 years now, and the power line still isn't permitted because of  all the environmental reviews, all the different jurisdictions.   If you are really trying to decarbonize the power grid, are the  Democrats willing to stop funding the lawyers and the environmental  groups that make their living off the litigation and NEPA study after  NEPA study? Those are environmental studies.   We have a case here. It is referred to as SunZia power line. You can  go online and look it up. It started in 2006, and some of the documents  out there say they will finally get their permits in 2023 or 2025.  [[Page H4245]]    This isn't unique. There are lots of occasions like this where an  area where you want to build wind, solar, even some geothermal, you  can't get it permitted.   Don't you see the absurdity? We are going to put up all this money  for infrastructure, particularly even from the Democrats, the green  infrastructure, but we are not going to change the laws because the  left is the beneficiaries of so much money from the environmental left  and the trial lawyers and the lawyers that sue on this stuff.   We need to put a clock on this. Look, I know this hits a little close  to home for some of our East Coast folks. But when it becomes an  upheaval over doing ocean-based windmills off part of the East Coast  here--and a lot of the very, very wealthy leftists are the very ones  who cry and complain, saying you can't put this in part of our view,  which really isn't part the view if you actually looked at the data.   We have to decide. Things like this Vineyard Wind project, which, I  guess, is--actually, I am embarrassed to say that I have the map on my  wall. I guess it is off the coast of Rhode Island. They have been  fussing over that for a decade now.   Do the Democrats truly want this clean energy? For us in the desert  Southwest, in the afternoons, because of our photovoltaic inventory, we  produce too much power. We are now having to have really creative  discussions of, in the afternoon, when power rates crash to almost  nothing, should we convert it into hydrogen and make that storage?   You all saw the incredible article last week in The Wall Street  Journal about the new iron to rust batteries. They are very, very  heavy, so they don't work in vehicles but could be incredibly  inexpensive, efficient storage. This is wonderful. But that is for  those of us who live in the desert, where we have lots of sunshine and  photovoltaic is pretty efficient.   But if you want to transmit that power someplace, are the Democrats  going to step up and help someone like myself, who is just trying to do  a piece of legislation that would put this permitting on a clock for it  to get capital, for you to raise money, for investors to participate,  for you to plan the power grid?    You can't have it where the power line for that wind farm you wanted  takes 15 to 20 years to get the power.   I guess my little passion here is I am incredibly skeptical on the  pay-fors. Even if it passes, unless we are willing to change the  bureaucratic bottlenecks that have been created, you are not seeing  much of this change in the power grid for a couple of decades.   Do we continue to tell the public the fantasy? Or do you step up and  say: Hey, I am going to do the hard things. I am going to change these  timelines. I am going to have to say no to some of my trial lawyer  contributors. I am going to have to put this on a clock so everyone  gets a chance to share their concerns for it to be properly  environmentally reviewed.   It doesn't take 20 years to do a line siting. If the left is willing  to do that, then they will get some credibility that they really are  serious. If they are not willing to do that, then you understand much  of the talk about the green revolution and the energy base is a fraud.  It is theater. It is pandering because we will say: Hey, look at all  this money, but you can't move the generation.   It is real, and we have example after example after example.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you tolerating a bit of my tirade tonight.  As we often joke to whoever is in the chair, I used to get put in that  chair when I made John Boehner mad, so I got to be in the chair a lot  at night.   But the things I shared tonight, they don't need to necessarily be  partisan. They are math. They are process. They are the bottlenecks  that keep many of the things we actually can agree upon from happening.   But this place is so weaponized right now that if I say it is black,  the other side has to say it is white. It has just become a  dysfunctional body.   If our goal is to make the working poor less poor, if it is to make  our society much more prosperous, if it is to provide optionality in  our energy, we know it has to be done, but we have to be willing, not  to necessarily engage in the theater side but maybe actually engage in  the proof we have of what has worked and what hasn't.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
