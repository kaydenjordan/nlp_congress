 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 600) to promote Internet access in developing  countries and update foreign policy toward the Internet, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 600         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Global Access Policy       Act of 2017'' or the ``Digital GAP Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this Act is to--        (1) encourage the efforts of developing countries to       improve mobile and fixed access to the Internet in order to       catalyze innovation, spur economic growth and job creation,       improve health, education, and financial services, reduce       poverty and gender inequality, mitigate disasters, promote       democracy and good governance, and strengthen cybersecurity;        (2) promote build once policies and approaches and the       multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance; and        (3) ensure the effective use of United States foreign       assistance resources toward this end.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The number of Internet users worldwide has more than       tripled from 1 billion to 3.2 billion since 2005, yet the       growth rate of Internet access is slowing: An estimated 4.2       billion people, or 60 percent of the world's population,       remain offline, an estimated 75 percent of the offline       population lives in just 20 countries, and rural, female,       elderly, illiterate, and low-income populations are being       left behind.        (2) Studies suggest that women across the developing world       are disproportionately affected by a digital gap, and that       bringing an additional 600 million women online would       contribute $13 billion to $18 billion to annual GDP across       144 developing countries.        (3) Internet access in developing countries is most often       hampered by a lack of infrastructure and a poor regulatory       environment for investment.        (4) Build once policies and approaches, which seek to       coordinate public and private sector investments in roads and       other critical infrastructure, can minimize the number and       scale of excavation and construction activities when       installing telecommunications infrastructure in rights-of-      way, thereby reducing installation costs for high-speed       Internet networks and serving as a development best practice.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         Congress declares that it is the policy of the United       States to consult, partner, and coordinate with the       governments of foreign countries, international       organizations, regional economic communities, businesses,       civil society, and other stakeholders in a concerted effort       to close the digital gap by promoting--        (1) first-time Internet access to mobile or broadband       Internet for at least 1.5 billion people in developing       countries by 2020 in both urban and rural areas;        (2) Internet deployment and related coordination, capacity       building, and build once policies and approaches in       developing countries, including actions to encourage--        (A) standardization of build once policies and approaches       for the inclusion of broadband conduit in rights-of-way       projects that are funded, co-funded, or partially financed by       the United States or any international organization that       includes the United States as a member, in consultation with       telecommunications providers, unless a cost-benefit analysis       determines that the cost of such approach outweighs the       benefits;        (B) adoption and integration of build once policies and       approaches into the development and investment strategies of       national and local government agencies of developing       countries and donor governments and organizations that will       enhance coordination with the private sector for road       building, pipe laying, and other major infrastructure       projects; and        (C) provision of increased financial support by       international organizations, including through grants, loans,       and technical assistance, to expand information and       communications access and Internet connectivity;        (3) policy changes that encourage first-time affordable       access to the Internet in developing countries, including       actions to encourage--        (A) integration of universal and gender-equitable Internet       access goals, to be informed by the collection of related       gender disaggregated data, and Internet tools into national       development plans and United States Government country-level       development strategies;        (B) reforms of competition laws and spectrum allocation       processes that may impede the ability of companies to provide       Internet services; and        (C) efforts to improve procurement processes to help       attract and incentivize investment in Internet       infrastructure;        (4) the removal of tax and regulatory barriers to Internet       access;        (5) the use of the Internet to increase economic growth and       trade, including--        (A) policies and strategies to remove restrictions to e-      commerce, cross-border information flows, and competitive       marketplaces; and        (B) entrepreneurship and distance learning enabled by       access to technology;        (6) use of the Internet to bolster democracy, government       accountability, transparency, and human rights, including       through the establishments of policies, initiatives, and       investments that--        (A) support the development of national Internet plans that       are consistent with United States human rights goals,       including freedom of expression, religion, assembly, and       association;        (B) expand online access to government information and       services to enhance government accountability and service       delivery, including for areas in which government may have       limited presence;        (C) advance the principles of responsible Internet       governance, including commitments to maintain open and       equitable access; and        (D) support programs, research, and technologies that       safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms online, and       enable political organizing and activism, free speech, and       religious expression that are in compliance with       international human rights standards;        (7) Internet access and inclusion into Internet       policymaking for women, people with disabilities, minorities,       low-income and marginalized groups, and underserved       populations;        (8) cybersecurity and data protection, including       international use of the National Institute of Standards and       Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical       Infrastructure Cybersecurity, that are industry-led and       globally recognized cybersecurity standards and best       practices; and        (9) inter-agency coordination and cooperation across all       executive branch agencies regarding the construction and       promotion of Internet initiatives as a greater part of United       States foreign policy.       SEC. 5. LEVERAGING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.         In pursuing the policy described in section 4, the       President should direct United States representatives to       appropriate international bodies to use the influence of the       United States, consistent with the broad development goals of       the United States, to advocate that each such body--        (1) commit to increase efforts and coordination to promote       affordable and gender-equitable Internet access, in       partnership with stakeholders and consistent with host       countries' absorptive capacity;        (2) integrate affordable and gender-equitable Internet       access data into existing economic and business assessments,       evaluations, and indexes such as the Millennium Challenge       Corporation constraints analysis, the Doing Business Report,       International Monetary Fund Article IV assessments and       country reports, the Open Data Barometer, and the       Affordability Drivers Index;        (3) standardize inclusion of broadband conduit as part of       highway or comparable construction projects in developing       countries, in consultation with telecommunications providers,       unless such inclusion would create an undue burden, is not       necessary based on the availability of existing broadband       infrastructure, or a cost-benefit analysis determines that       the cost outweighs the benefits;        (4) provide technical assistance to the regulatory       authorities in developing countries to remove unnecessary       barriers to investment in otherwise commercially viable       projects and strengthen weak regulations or develop new       regulations to support market growth and development;        (5) utilize clear, accountable, and metric-based targets,       including targets with gender-disaggregated data, to measure       the effectiveness of efforts to promote Internet access; and        (6) promote and protect human rights online, such as the       freedoms of expression, religion, assembly, and association,       through resolutions, public statements, projects, and       initiatives, and advocate that other member states of such       bodies are held accountable when major violations are       uncovered.       SEC. 6. DEPARTMENT OF STATE ORGANIZATION.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Secretary of State should seek to enhance the efficiency       and effectiveness of United States foreign assistance efforts       to carry out the policies and objectives established by this       Act, including by redesignating an existing Assistant       Secretary position in the Department of State to be the       Assistant Secretary for Cyberspace to lead the Department's       diplomatic cyberspace policy generally, including for       cybersecurity, Internet access, Internet freedom, and to       promote an open, secure, and reliable information and       communications technology infrastructure.        (b) Activities.--In recognition of the added value of       technical knowledge and expertise in the policymaking and       diplomatic channels, the Secretary of State shall--        (1) update existing training programs relevant to policy       discussions;        (2) promote the recruitment of candidates with technical       expertise into the Civil Service and the Foreign Service; and        (3) work to improve inter-agency coordination and       cooperation on cybersecurity and Internet initiatives.        (c) Offset.--To offset any costs incurred by the Department       of State to carry out the designation of an Assistant       Secretary for Cyberspace in accordance with subsection (a),       the Secretary of State shall eliminate  [[Page H658]]       such positions within the Department of State, unless       otherwise authorized or required by law, as the Secretary       determines to be necessary to fully offset such costs.        (d) Rule of Construction.--The redesignation of the       Assistant Secretary position in the Department of State       described in subsection (a) may not be construed as       increasing the number of Assistant Secretary positions at the       Department above the current level of 24 as authorized in       section 1(c)(1) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act       of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a(c)(1)).       SEC. 7. USAID.         It is the sense of Congress that the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development should--        (1) integrate efforts to expand Internet access, develop       appropriate technologies, and enhance digital literacy into       the education, development, and economic growth programs of       the agency, where appropriate;        (2) expand the utilization of information and       communications technologies in humanitarian aid and disaster       relief responses and United States operations involving       stabilization and security to improve donor coordination,       reduce duplication and waste, capture and share lessons       learned, and augment disaster preparedness and risk       mitigation strategies; and        (3) establish and promote guidelines for the protection of       personal information of individuals served by humanitarian,       disaster, and development programs implemented directly       through the United States Government, through contracts       funded by the United States Government, and by international       organizations.       SEC. 8. PEACE CORPS.         Section 3 of the Peace Corps Act (22 U.S.C. 2502) is       amended by--        (1) redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (e); and        (2) adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(f) It is the sense of Congress that access to technology       can transform agriculture, community economic development,       education, environment, health, and youth development which       are the sectors in which Peace Corps currently develops       positions for Volunteers.        ``(g) In giving attention to the programs, projects,       training, and other activities referred to in subsection (f),       the Peace Corps should develop positions for Volunteers that       are focused on leveraging technology for development,       education, and social and economic mobility.''.       SEC. 9. PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the President shall transmit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate plans to promote       partnerships by United States development agencies, including       the United States Agency for International Development and       the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and international       agencies funded by the United States Government with the       private sector and other stakeholders to expand affordable       and gender equitable access to the Internet in developing       countries, including the following elements:        (1) Methods for stakeholders to partner with such agencies       in order to provide Internet access or Internet       infrastructure in developing countries.        (2) Methods of outreach to stakeholders to explore       partnership opportunities for expanding Internet access or       Internet infrastructure, including coordination with the       private sector, when financing roads and telecommunications       infrastructure.        (3) Methods for early consultation with stakeholders       concerning projects in telecommunications and road       construction to provide Internet access or Internet       infrastructure.       SEC. 10. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the President shall transmit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on       efforts to implement the policies specified in this Act and a       discussion of the plans and existing efforts by the United       States Government in developing countries to accomplish the       following:        (1) Developing a technical and regulatory road map for       promoting Internet access in developing countries and a path       to implementing such road map.

SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Broadband.--The term ``broadband'' means an Internet       Protocol-based transmission service that enables users to       send and receive voice, video, data, graphics, or a       combination thereof.        (2) Broadband conduit.--The term ``broadband conduit''       means a conduit for fiber optic cables that support broadband       or wireless facilities for broadband service.        (3) Build once policies and approaches.--The term ``build       once policies and approaches'' means policies or practices       that minimize the number and scale of excavation and       construction activities when installing telecommunications       infrastructure in rights-of-way.        (4) Cyberspace.--The term ``cyberspace'' means the       interdependent network of information technology       infrastructures, and includes the Internet,       telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded       processors and controllers in critical industries, and       includes the virtual environment of information and       interactions between people.        (5) Stakeholders.--The term ``stakeholders'' means the       private sector, the public sector, cooperatives, civil       society, the technical community that develops Internet       technologies, standards, implementation, operations, and       applications, and other groups that are working to increase       Internet access or are impacted by the lack of Internet       access in their communities.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous materials in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous materials in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today, more than 60 percent of the world's population lacks access to  broadband, lacks access to the Internet. That means 3 billion people  have been left out of the biggest technological revolution of our time.  Three billion people are being denied the benefits of the free flow of  information and game-changing innovations in health, education, and  commerce; and 3 billion consumers remain out of the reach of American  goods and services.   Women and girls are disproportionately affected by this digital gap,  despite serving as the principal consumers, caregivers, educators,  peacemakers, and income earners across the developing world. Bringing  women online is going to deepen the benefit of existing investments in  governance and global health, and it is going to accelerate economic  growth.   So this bill closes that digital gap. It promotes efforts by  developing countries to accelerate Internet deployment through the  standardization of cost-effective, build-once policies. It partners  with the private sector, and it creates a favorable investment climate.   At the same time, it reduces duplication of effort among U.S.  Government agencies by demanding improved interagency coordination and  collaboration with the private sector. And it calls on the State  Department to consolidate the responsibilities held by three separate  coordinators for cyber policy, technology, and information under a  single Assistant Secretary for Cyberspace.   So let me explain something here, Mr. Speaker, if the U.S. Agency for  International Development is helping  [[Page H659]]  to finance the construction of a rural road in Ghana, the private  sector should be invited to lay down broadband conduit before the  concrete is poured, obviously. Why dig the same road twice? The bottom  line is that, as this infrastructure expansion is going on right now,  we have the ability to get the private sector in to lay that broadband,  and that is what this bill does. It is smart economics, smart  development. It advances key U.S. values. And, frankly, it is good for  American industry as well.   So I thank my cosponsors--Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers,  Eliot Engel, and Grace Meng--for their efforts on this bill, which, by  the way, the predecessor bill passed unanimously last September here.   I strongly urge Members to support the Digital GAP Act here again  this year so we can get it to the President's desk without delay.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  reclaim the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 17 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say, as the author of this bill, it does take  a lot of work, a lot of research, to put together legislation like  this. And I did want to thank Joan Condon of the staff, and I wanted to  thank Jessica Kelch, certainly Margot Sullivan, and Taylor Clausen for  their efforts here.  [[Page H660]]    I think that as you get involved in this legislation and you see some  of the lost opportunities in the past--I would just give one example.  NetHope, an NGO, made a compelling case for this build-once policy that  this puts in place.   It was several years ago, as they explained, and Eliot Engel and I  have been out to Liberia. There was a $100 million project for a road  where there is no Internet use, and there is very little across  Liberia. Had the donors had the foresight to just invite the private  sector to lay the fiber-optic cable under that road while it was being  constructed--and, as you know, you do that at a fraction of the cost.  That is when they want to lay the cable--the cost would have been 1  percent of the total investment. It would have been $1 million.   But what is the consequence of that lack of foresight?   You fast forward to 2014. I will tell you the consequences. Ebola  ravaged Liberia, 10,000 people over the course of a single year; it  crossed international borders, finally included the United States.  There was a reason why the information did not get out, and that reason  was because there was not Internet access in this region across  Liberia, which was the same region where they would have put the  Internet access. That is what physicians tell us.   It is not a surprise that experts agree that the lack of Internet  infrastructure hampered Ebola response efforts, according to the  physicians, as donors and community health centers struggled to track  the disease. They could not even coordinate their efforts, for those of  you who remember that struggle.   Now, all of a sudden there is renewed interest in improving the  Internet architecture in Liberia, and now we find that the cost is so  many, many, many multiples of what it had been had this bill been law,  and that we had simply let those know in industry that that opportunity  was there to lay that cable back when the road was originally being  built.   So we need this build-once strategy. We have got to have smart  development. We can do better. We will. And I urge the Members to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Friday,  January 27, 2017; and further, when the House adjourns on that day, it  adjourn to meet on Monday, January 30, 2017, when it shall convene at  noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 601) to enhance the transparency and accelerate the  impact of assistance provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961  to promote quality basic education in developing countries, to better  enable such countries to achieve universal access to quality basic  education and improved learning outcomes, to eliminate duplication and  waste, and for other purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). Pursuant to the rule, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 601, the Reinforcing  Education Accountability and Development Act, or the READ Act. This  bill passed the House at the end of the last Congress in essentially  the same form as H.R. 4481. I am pleased the House has moved to take it  up again today.   We all recognize the importance of education as a driver of economic  growth, social mobility, and overall stability. Education is what  increases the productivity of the workforce. This is what empowers men  and women to better care for themselves and their families. It  increases civic participation.   Even 1 extra year of schooling significantly increases a worker's  earnings over her or his lifespan. For women in particular, a primary  school education is directly correlated very strongly with improved  maternal-child health and improved survival rates.   Yet, around the world, as we know here, there are 120 million  children that are not in school. More than one-third of these children,  as Nita Lowey can testify, come from countries that are embroiled in  war, embroiled in conflict, and many of these recent conflicts have  lasted for over a decade.   We are now seeing entire generations of these young children who are  failing to receive even the most basic education.   You want to talk about a humanitarian crisis?   This is it. There are clear implications for global stability and for  our security.   When children remain out of school, what do they face?   Well, certainly great increased risk of abuse at the hands of  traffickers, forced marriage or marriage as a child bride, and  recruitment by criminal or terrorist organizations.   Nowhere is this harsh reality more clear than in Syria, where 4  million Syrian children are currently out of school. We have had the  opportunity to talk to many of these children on the border and see  what their circumstances are like.   Inside Syria, these children are being shaped by violence and by a  lack of alternatives that place them at high risk of exploitation and  radicalization. As refugees--if you talk to our friends and allies in  the region--they are placing tremendous strain on the education system  in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.   Despite these growing challenges, it has been decades since Congress  reviewed and updated the authorities on which U.S. international basic  education efforts are based.   This bill, the READ Act, introduces the new guidelines and the  increased accountability for existing U.S. efforts to improve access to  basic education in developing and conflict-torn countries. It requires  strategic planning. It requires the prioritization of resources  relative to needs on the ground in these countries and relative to the  potential for impact. It requires alignment with U.S. diplomatic  development and security interests.   Particular emphasis is given to those areas in crisis and those  countries that are partners of the United States that face this  critical challenge, whose populations are most in need, who have  committed their own resources to ensure the success and sustainability  of these efforts, but need our assistance.   It also requires increased attention to what is most important here,  and that is to the specific barriers to education that are faced by  women and girls.   The bill formalizes a senior coordinator position within USAID to  oversee the development and implementation of a strategic plan across  Federal agencies to ensure coordination and eliminate duplication and  waste.   I thank Representative Lowey for her continued bipartisan leadership  on this issue, as well as my committee's ranking member, Mr. Engel, and  the chair of our Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations, Mr. Smith, for their work on  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I concur with those arguments that Mr. Engel just made. Congresswoman  Nita Lowey and I have talked about this, and if my colleagues will  think on this for a minute, the reality today is that we face a  situation where there are 65 million men, women, and children around  the globe who have been displaced by conflict. I would just like the  Members to think about the fact that this is more people than were  displaced during World War II. This is the highest level, highest on  record of human beings who have been displaced by conflict. Think about  what that means to the children who are those most victimized.   The United States is doing important work around the world, trying to  help our allies, trying to help organizations--and there are many good  NGOs working on this--to address this massive education deficit that so  many of these children face. But Congress, I think, has to demand a  greater degree, yes, of transparency and accountability for these  activities to ensure our investments are as effective as possible in  line with our strategic interests.   There is one more thing that we have to ask of our partners in this,  and that is equal access to every young girl for education. That has  got to be up there at the top of that priority list.   This Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development Act outlines  clear priorities for this work with that emphasis that I talked about  and asking those partners to carry out their end of this bargain. This  bill also requires aggressive monitoring and evaluation and an annual  report that justifies the investment on a country-by-country basis, but  holds with it the accountability for the education of girls and for the  rest of this work.   I urge Members to support this measure. Again, I thank Representative  Lowey. I thank the rest of the Members who worked on this for working  on such a bipartisan basis on its provisions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
