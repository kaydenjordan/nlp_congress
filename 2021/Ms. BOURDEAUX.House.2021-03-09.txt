 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment, which clarifies that the PRO Act does not expand the  National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction over the smallest of  small businesses, who help drive the economy in my district and across  the country.   The NLRB uses metrics to determine whether a company affects  interstate commerce, and, thus, is subject to its enforcement and  standards with different thresholds for different types of businesses.  My amendment ensures that these thresholds do not change.   In other words, my amendment provides certainty to the small family- run businesses found throughout my district because the labor standards  they are subject to will not change under this bill. My amendment  protects our employees while maintaining stability for small businesses  that are already under so much strain.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this amendment.
