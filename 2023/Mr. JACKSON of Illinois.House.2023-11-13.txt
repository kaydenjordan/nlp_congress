 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. I thank my  distinguished colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of  Florida.   For the next 60 minutes we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all  Americans.   Our Special Order hour today will focus on a very urgent and pressing  issue for our community, and that is the recognition of November as  National Diabetes Month.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Brown), my  colleague from the city of Cleveland.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished  colleague, Congresswoman Shontel Brown from Ohio's 11th Congressional  District, for her leadership within the Congressional Black Caucus and  for highlighting and focusing our attention and, indeed, the Nation's  attention on this critical issue of diabetes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable  Congressman Payne from the great State of New Jersey for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), who  is the honorable chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Chairman   Steven Horsford, for those  powerful words. Again, I thank our esteemed colleague, Congresswoman  Shontel Brown of Ohio, for having led this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my colleague from the great State of  Louisiana, the distinguished Congressman, Mr. Troy Carter.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Louisiana, Congressman Troy Carter,  for his participation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the Honorable Sheila Cherfilus- McCormick from the great State of Florida.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Diabetes Month. This month is important for all of us in the  United States. More than 37 million Americans have diabetes and we need  to double down on our efforts to find a cure for this disease.   During this month, we cannot lose sight of the stark disparities when  it comes to diabetes in the Black community. Black adults in the U.S.  are 60 percent more likely than White adults to be diagnosed with this  debilitating disease.   This is a national health crisis that deserves our immediate  attention. Black Americans with diabetes are 2.5 times more likely to  be hospitalized and are twice as likely to die from this disease.   As a healthcare executive, I saw this disparity firsthand and the  impact it had on the communities that I serve in Congress.   A study conducted at Emory University confirmed what many of us have  long known to be true.   Structural racism and geographic inequalities are exacerbating  diabetic health disparities. Estimates indicate that rates of diabetes  are 1.5 times higher among people of color, including Black Americans,  American Indians, Alaska Natives, Hispanics and Asians.   Statistics emphasize just how serious this epidemic is in my home  State. According to the Florida Diabetes Alliance, an estimated 579,000  Floridians have diabetes but don't know it, greatly increasing their  health risk and dying.   Yet despite inequalities, African Americans are 19 percent less  likely to access newer diabetes treatment. That means that they are 19  percent less likely to access medication which could mean a healthier  and longer life.   Every American, no matter the color of their skin or their ZIP Code  should be able to receive the best treatment options available with no  questions asked.   This month, let us recommit and address the social determinants of  healthcare and recognize the impact they have in driving diabetes  disparities. This encompasses everything from accessing green space and  how long it takes to get to the grocery store. It comes down to whether  patients live near a healthcare facility where they can speak to a  provider and receive leading-edge diabetes care. It is a matter of  whether our kids are eating nutritious lunches in the cafeteria.    If we want to get serious about tackling the disproportionate rates  of diabetes among Black Americans, this is where we need to start.   By focusing on the social determinants of healthcare, we would lay  the groundwork for a better and healthier future.  [[Page H5723]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick for her statement.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring vaunted and valuable attention to  one of the greatest health challenges plaguing the American people and  to declare that this body needs to do more to alleviate the pain.   The month of November has been designated as being National Diabetes  Month and the goal of this designation is to highlight the  disproportionate impact diabetes continues to have on the communities I  represent.   Never before has one chronic disease so diabolically focused its fury  on Black and Brown people, which, of course, begs the question as to  whether or not the proliferation of this silent killer is connected to  the quality of food and economic choices of those very same  communities.   The physiology of Black and Brown people is not in any way  predisposed to be more vulnerable to this disease than any other group  of people, and yet diabetes continues to destroy Black and Brown lives  at a rate that is more than disproportional but diabolic as well.   Since 2001, the proliferation of Type 2 diabetes among Black and  Brown youth has increased at a rate of 95 percent, Mr. Speaker.   According to the National Health Institute, young people between the  ages of 10 and 19 years of age have seen instances of Type 2 diabetes  double among them. Two out of every 100 Black and indigenous American  youth now suffer from this disease, and it is accelerating at an  alarming pace.   As I stand before you here, I shudder to think about the implications  associated with the level of increase, what that will mean for the  quality of life of families of young people currently sinking into this  chronic abyss.                                time  2110    Whether we are willing to acknowledge it or not, the way we currently  treat, talk about, and address this disease will leave this country  vulnerable to a medical tsunami the likes of which no one on this  planet has ever seen.   We cannot be silent about this because if we do nothing, African  Americans are twice as likely as any other group to die from this  disease.   If we do nothing, African-American adults are twice as likely to be  hospitalized because of diabetes and suffer long-term complications  more than any other group.   If we do nothing, Black people in this country are three times more  likely to be diagnosed with renal disease which, of course, is a portal  that leads to a whole host of other debilitating morbidities.   If we just sit around and dither, Black people will be 60 percent  more likely to be diagnosed with a disease that has the power to kill  them. Let us not forget that African Americans currently make up 13  percent of the American population. When 95 percent of the young people  that make up 13 percent of your entire population are currently  slipping down the slippery slope of diabetes, someone has to sound the  alarm.   This is why every American should be glad that President Biden has  declared November to be National Diabetes Month, and all of us should  be glad because this is a conversation we need to have. The time for us  to act as if this is not a national emergency is over.   Diabetes in the American population has crossed the Rubicon. We are  well beyond the point of no return, and if we do not decide that the  health and healthcare of every American, particularly African  Americans, is a priority equal in its importance to national security,  then we will rue the day we buried our heads in the sand and  preoccupied ourselves with the seasonal foolishness of partisan  politics.   This is not a red State or blue State issue. The American people are  dying. The American people are suffering. The American people are  looking to the government they elected to do something in its power to  help, help them fight and ward off the devastating effects of this  debilitating disease.   Last year, millions of Americans reported hoarding insulin because of  shortages. The overwhelming need is manifesting itself nationwide. Who  would have thought that people who live in the world's greatest country  in the history of the world would have to hoard medication? Could any  of us have ever imagined that the need for insulin would be so  expansive that hoarding the medication would be a necessity or even an  option, but this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality  millions of Americans have to live with every day.   This is the minute-to-minute struggle for countless American families  trying not to lose hope amid a sea of chronic and cataclysmic medical  consequences. To those of you, I say hold on and don't give up. If we  are determined to do something about it here in this Congress, we can  say that elections have consequences because, indeed, they do.   One of the positive outcomes of the last Presidential election is the  fact that President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is the duly elected President  of the United States, and he helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act to  help us deal with the runaway cost of insulin. Now insulin is $35 a  month. That is very much a welcome relief in my neighborhood.   As an American, not only as a Democrat, I am glad that we have  someone in the Oval Office who cares about what this disease is doing  to our country. It says a lot about the character and integrity of the  President that he would go out of his way to address this issue when so  many other problems have been vying for his attention over the last 3  years.   However, I also say to you, we can do more. We simply cannot avoid  the connection between the systemic inequities of America and the  incredible racial disparities by which diabetes continues to  proliferate in the Black community.   In fact, in a recent study conducted at Emory University, it was  suggested, if not directly implied, that structural racism is  accelerating the diabetes crisis in the United States of America.  Therefore, potentially what we have here is not just a medical crisis,  what we have happening in America is also a social and a cultural  crisis.   When it comes to diabetes and the Black community, it would appear  that our current crisis is the result of a strange confluence of  issues. Nutritional opportunities, access to fruit and vegetables, and  the inability to afford healthy nutritional options have all come  together to make an already terrible situation worse.   More and more researchers are discovering that the race, geography,  and economy of a community can be an overwhelming determining factor  for understanding the impact of this debilitating and chronic disease.  This is why I have been a major proponent of the Gus Schumacher  Nutrition Incentive Program, the GusNIP. I am a major supporter of this  program because it allows the Secretary of Agriculture to provide  funding opportunities to conduct and evaluate projects providing  incentives to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables for low- income consumers.   For many years, the other party has wanted us to believe that  government is the problem, but what they forget to tell you is that  sometimes national problems require national solutions; and there is a  role, indeed, for government.   In this program, it is critical for us to also understand that we  cannot retreat on SNAP. There are too many Americans who need the  supplemental nutritional assistance. Let us be clear, the same way we  incentivize big corporations and wealthy individuals with tax breaks,  we should have the moral courage to incentivize healthy choices for  low-income Americans.   What is good for the goose is also good for the gander. If incentives  work for rich people, then let them also work to save the lives of  working-class and low-income Americans.   As I stand here tonight, I am actively working to see this program is  fully funded this year. This is something we must do. We owe it to the  American people to do everything we can to help them save lives.   Let me simply say that it is about time we start incentivizing things  that keep people alive and not just behaviors that make people more  money. It is my great hope and expectation that the expansion of GusNIP  will allow the program to run more efficiently and increase cooperation  between recipients and the Federal Government.   I also believe that a greater emphasis needs to be placed on the  Healthy Food  [[Page H5724]]  Financing Initiative, created back in the Obama administration to  provide grants and technical assistance to empower families to have  access to fresh, healthy, and affordable foods in rural and urban  communities that are underserved.   Most people fail to realize that the overwhelming instances of hunger  in America are not happening in American cities. It is, rather, taking  place in rural communities. This is why I am pleased that the  Department of Agriculture partnered with the Reinvestment Fund to  invest $22.6 million to improve access to healthy foods in underserved  communities.   We have an obligation to do all that we can do to empower ordinary,  everyday American citizens to make choices that will sustain their  lives. As a government, we cannot make the choice for them, but we can  create a better set of options for them to make lifesaving decisions  for themselves.   What good is balancing the budget if the American people are sick and  dying from chronic disease?   What good is having a strong military or defense if the American  people are withering away from diabetes and other morbidities that  slowly eat away the health of the Nation?   A coherent and stringent immigration policy will mean absolutely  nothing if the people who are already citizens of this country are  dying from diseases that we can avoid.   Everything that America is and everything we hope it to be depends on  the health and safety of our citizens. In the absence of being healthy,  there is no American Dream.   I say to my colleagues, let us do everything that we can to empower  people to have greater health, longer life, and what every American  deserves; namely, three meals a day for their bodies, education and  culture for their minds, and, yes, freedom and dignity for their souls.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Honorable Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick.                                time  2120    Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jackson of  Illinois for co-anchoring, and I give a very special thank-you to our  CBC chair, Representative Horsford, for his work, and also to  Congresswoman Shontel Brown for hosting a press conference we held  earlier.   Mr. Speaker, in recognition of National Diabetes Month, I rise today  to commend the Biden-Harris administration for their work to deliver  lower insulin costs for the American people.   Because of the administration's transformative Inflation Reduction  Act, nearly 4 million seniors on Medicare with diabetes are seeing  their insulin costs capped at $35. Because of this, pharmaceutical  companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have followed suit and also  capped their insulin prices at $35 a month.   This is a massive win for our seniors nationwide, including those in  Florida's 20th Congressional District. The life-changing cap that has  helped over 29,000 of my constituents pay $440 less each year in  insulin is worth it. These savings are making a tremendous difference  when it comes to health outcomes.   Medication is not something that those living with diabetes can go  without. Over 80 percent of adults with diabetes depend on medication  to manage their conditions.   While this cap is putting money back into our seniors' pockets, we  still have more work to do. As President Biden has made clear,  affordable insulin should be accessible to all Americans, not just  Medicare beneficiaries.   It is devastating that nearly a fifth of insulin users have to ration  their insulin use. In a country like ours, how can this be the case?   Stark healthcare disparities also underscore the need for us to do  more and to act. Diabetes rates are skyrocketing within communities of  color. Since 2001, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes for Black and  Hispanic children has increased by a staggering 95 percent. Let me  repeat that one more time: increased by 95 percent for our Black and  Hispanic children.   Nobody should be forced to choose between paying their rent and  buying insulin. No one should die because they had to ration their  insulin. No one should go blind or lose limbs because they could not  afford medication. Your life shouldn't be put on hold because you were  diagnosed with diabetes.   As Americans, we can and must do better. Last Congress, I was proud  to vote for the Affordable Insulin Now Act to clamp down on runaway  insulin prices threatening Floridians' health and financial security.  We need to get this bill across the finish line and make diabetes  treatment more affordable.   Americans all over, no matter their political affiliations, stand to  benefit from low insulin costs. Every American, no matter the color of  their skin or their ZIP Code, deserves a healthy and fulfilling life  and a dignified existence. Every American deserves to grow old with  dignity.   Diabetes is both preventable and manageable. Let's act now. Those  living with diabetes cannot wait.    Mr. Speaker, these are the issues of the  Congressional Black Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
