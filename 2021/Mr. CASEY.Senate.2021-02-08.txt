 Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to the late  Richard L. Thornburgh, a former Pennsylvania Governor and former U.S.  Attorney General. Dick Thornburgh was also a hero to the disability  community for his longstanding advocacy for the rights and self- determination of people with disabilities.   Born in Pittsburgh on July 16, 1932, Dick received an undergraduate  degree from Yale University and a law degree from the University of  Pittsburgh Law School before going into private practice.   In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed Dick as the U.S. attorney  for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and in 1975, President Gerald  Ford appointed him to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the  Justice Department's Criminal Division. Two years later, he returned to  Pennsylvania.   In 1978, Dick was elected Governor of Pennsylvania and was reelected  in 1982, becoming the first Republican to serve two successive terms as  Governor of the Commonwealth.   During his time in office, Governor Thornburgh provided a steady hand  and a calm demeanor. Most notably, he led Pennsylvania through the  Three Mile Island crisis, America's worst nuclear meltdown. He took  charge of the crisis and in so doing won praise from President Jimmy  Carter and from Pennsylvanians for how he handled the potential  disaster. At the time of the Three Mile Island Crisis, Governor  Thornburgh said:         You have to reassure people. You have to go before the       cameras and microphones and tell them what you know and what       you don't. You have to stop the rumors and, of course, you       have to make decisions. There isn't any Republican or       Democratic way to deal with a nuclear crisis. Nobody has ever       had to deal with this kind of accident before.    In 1988, President Ronald Reagan nominated Governor Thornburgh to be  the U.S. Attorney General, a position in which he served until 1991. He  resigned in 1991 to run for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania following  the tragic death of Senator John Heinz in a plane crash. Governor  Thornburgh lost the Senate election to Harris Wofford, who had been  appointed to the vacancy 6 months before the 1991 election.   Following his Senate run, Governor Thornburgh served a 1-year  appointment as Under-Secretary General at the United Nations at the  request of President George H.W. Bush. In that role, he sought to bring  reform, transparency, and accountability to the United Nations.   After his service at the United Nations, Governor Thornburgh returned  to private practice but would continue to serve in advisory roles at  the State and Federal level, imparting his wisdom and experience in a  number of different arenas.   Of his many contributions to public life, Governor Thornburgh was  especially respected in the disability rights community for his  tireless advocacy for the rights and self-determination of people with  disabilities.   Governor Thornburgh's son, Peter, was injured in a car accident in  1960, a tragic accident that also killed Thornburgh's wife, Ginny  Hooton. The accident left Peter Thornburgh, then just 4 months of age,  with a significant brain injury that caused physical and intellectual  disabilities. Governor Thornburgh is quoted as saying that the accident  ``made him think about what he could do with his life to contribute to  the world.''   As Attorney General in Bush Administration, Dick Thornburgh helped to  shepherd the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, through Congress  during a most critical period in 1989. On  [[Page S570]]  June 21, 1989, then Attorney General Thornburgh affirmed to the  disability community and the Nation the Bush administration's intent to  support the passage of the ADA and to sign the legislation when  Congress passed the bill.   When the ADA passed Congress, Attorney General Thornburgh said that  the day was ``one of emancipation, not just for the millions of  Americans with disabilities who will directly benefit from this Act,  but even more so for the rest of us now free to benefit from the  contributions which those with a disability can make to our economy,  our communities and our own well-being.''   Walter Cohen, who served as both Pennsylvania's secretary of public  welfare and attorney general, stated that Governor Thornburgh was  responsible for Pennsylvania creating home and community based services  for people with disabilities and for ordering the closure of the  Pennhurst State School and Hospital, which had been found to be housing  hundreds of people with developmental and intellectual disabilities in  squalor.   Mr. President, for many Governor Thornburgh is known for his decades  of public service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to the  Federal Government. He is deserving of this recognition, and the people  of Pennsylvania owe him their deepest gratitude for his service. But  any discussion of Governor Thornburgh's service would be incomplete if  we did not pause to note that because of his efforts, in part, the  lives of people with disabilities have been dramatically improved. Our  built environment and transportation system have been made available to  all people. It is now understood that every child, no matter their  disability, has the right to a quality, public education. People with  disabilities, rather than living in institutions, are now free to grow  up and flourish in the community and setting of their choice.   These opportunities may be taken for granted now, but they were hard  fought gains achieved through the sweat and tears of the disability  community and those who fought alongside them every step of the way.  Dick Thornburgh was one of the greatest of these champions. His public  service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is worthy of commendation.  We extend condolences to Dick's wife, Ginny, his sons, John, David,  Peter and William, and to his grandchildren and great grandchildren.                            ____________________
