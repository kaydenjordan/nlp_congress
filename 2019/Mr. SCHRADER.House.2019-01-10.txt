 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with some very, very sad  news. On Tuesday night, the Mary B II, a crab boat out of Newport,  Oregon, capsized while crossing the Yaquina Bay bar.   Members of the U.S. Coast Guard responded heroically to assist the  boat, battling seas that were 12 to 14 feet in height. Unfortunately,  the crew of three died.   It was actually to be Josh Porter's last trip on that boat. He had a  different job.                                time  1100    Mr. Speaker, I want to convey my deepest condolences to the crews,  the family, the friends, and, frankly, the community for their immense  loss. The tragedy illustrates the courageous and perilous work that our  Coast Guard members perform daily and how vital their services are for  these communities.   I am proud to lend my support to legislative efforts that make sure  these men and women actually receive their pay for this dangerous work  that they perform on our behalf.   As we enter almost 3 weeks under a partial shutdown of the  government, I know, for many of our valuable public servants, their  resources are stretched thin. They will start missing paychecks because  of the failures of the Federal Government. They continue to admirably  serve throughout this shutdown, and we must ensure they don't suffer  because of our failures.   Mr. Speaker, I implore the President and Congress to take up the  bills the Senate and House have passed and reopen the United States  Government.                            ____________________
