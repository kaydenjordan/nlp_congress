 Madam Speaker, it has been 23 years since Columbine. It has  been 15 years since Virginia Tech, 10 years since Sandy Hook, 4 years  since Parkland. We have offered prayer and thoughts for years with no  real action.   It has been 15 days since the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where  19 children were massacred. One of the students, a 10-year-old girl,  survived because she covered herself in the blood of her dead  classmate.   We have trained kids to hide under their tables. We have trained  teachers to barricade their doors. We have trained schools to lock down  their campuses. Now, are we going to train kids to cover themselves  with their friend's blood in order to survive?   When are we going to understand the common denominator here is not  just criminals but making it easy for criminals to access deadly  weapons?   Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Canada all dealt with  mass shootings, but there was a national outcry, and they put in place  restrictions to stop mass carnage from happening again.   We don't have mental health issues more than any other country. What  we do have here are politicians who lack the moral courage to stand up  to the NRA. We have a society that is not willing to stand up to  protect its citizens, especially its most vulnerable,  [[Page H5341]]  which is our beautiful children. We have to be better than that.   We also must remember, Madam Speaker, it is not just mass shootings.  It is white supremacists in Buffalo who massacre elders. It is gangs  who carnage our neighborhoods, who allow for a 3-year-old in my  district to get mowed down by gunfire.   The problem is guns. The problem is our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle. We have to have the courage to stand up to them and to  stand up for our country.                        Protecting Individual Freedoms     Madam Speaker, Roe v. Wade is fundamentally about privacy.  Fifty, 60, 70 years ago, in order for women to access abortion care,  they had to go to back-alley clinics and use wire hangers.   In 1973, it was decided that women have a right to make their own  decisions about their bodies. We have to be a country that refuses to  go back. We have to be a country that refuses to have women in my  generation and the generation before enjoy more freedoms than my  daughter's generation and the next.   Republicans will say they are the party of freedom and liberty, but  they are the party that doesn't believe in liberty and freedom for  women. Democrats are the party that is protecting your freedom and  expanding liberty, which is why we introduced and passed the Women's  Health Protection Act because codifying Roe v. Wade into law is  essentially about protecting the freedoms for individuals to make their  own private decisions about their healthcare.   If you stand for freedom, if you stand for liberty, join us and  reject an extremist, fascist, misogynistic, backward party that wants  to take us back to the stone age where men dictated what women do with  their bodies. Help us exist in a country where our values of uplifting  and advancing the rights of individuals still stand.                           Rampant Food Insecurity     Madam Speaker, one in six children in the United States  doesn't have enough food to eat. It is unconscionable that we allow 16  percent of our children here in this country to go hungry.   Right now, Mitch McConnell and Republicans are blocking funding to  continue the school waivers that allow for children to continue to eat  in schools. Our inability to get these waivers and feed millions of  children who are food insecure is inexcusable.   Globally, there are 276 million people facing food insecurity around  the world, with countries in the Horn of Africa teetering on the edge  of famine. We have an opportunity to get people on board and rally  around those who are in need and starving.                            ____________________
