 Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Waters for yielding me  time and for her leadership on this.   Nine years ago, I was there, in 2008, when our financial system  collapsed, as a new Member of Congress, the sole scientist on the  Financial Services Committee. And as we surveyed the wreckage of our  economy, I wondered how we ever could have gotten into a place like  that with our financial system clogged with toxic assets based on  trillions of dollars of mortgages that never had any realistic chance  of being repaid by their homeowners.    We saw giant banks and trading firms leveraged beyond belief, huge  financial corporations so complex that they had thousands of business  units that even their CEOs were unaware of, and risk management  software that was being ignored, if it existed at all.   How could we have gotten there? But when I look at the CHOICE Act  that Republicans are about to ram through on a party-line vote, I  understand perfectly how we got there. I see all the same forces of  mindless deregulation and free market ideology, an overriding mania for  tax cuts for the rich, while stripping financial protection for  ordinary American families; the same refusal to learn the lessons of  financial history and to replace them with alternative facts that fit  their ideology.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand up for working families and  protect our economy by opposing this bill today.
