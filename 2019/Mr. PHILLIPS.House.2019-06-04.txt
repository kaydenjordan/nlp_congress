 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue in the U.S. and in my State of  Minnesota.   In Minnesota we are home to a thriving community of Liberian refugees  who fled two civil wars and an Ebola outbreak, refugees like my good  friend, Louise Stevens. She escaped civil war, left her life behind,  and slept on a friend's floor for over a year just for the chance at  the American Dream.   Now she is over 60. She has worked hard in Minnesota's healthcare  industry for 18 years. She is the mother of American children. She pays  taxes, and she is here legally under DED. But because of that DED  status, she still has no path to citizenship. The same is true for  thousands of Liberians in America.   I am so proud to help lead the Dream and Promise Act and finally, at  long last, change that. That is the American Dream and, at long last,  it should be our reality.
