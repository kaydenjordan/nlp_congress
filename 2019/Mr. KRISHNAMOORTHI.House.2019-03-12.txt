 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1617) to direct the Director of National  Intelligence to submit intelligence assessments of the intentions of  the political leadership of the Russian Federation, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1617         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping Russian Entrapments       Minimal and Limiting Intelligence Networks Act'' or the       ``KREMLIN Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Russia continues to engage in information warfare and       political interference in the West, including by undermining       democratic systems and exploiting economic and ethnic       tensions within member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization.        (2) Such activities constitute a threat to the United       States and to its allies.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions       Act (Public Law 115-44) authorized the United States       Government to impose sanctions in response to actions by       countries, including Russia, that undermine the security of       the United States;        (2) the United States should sustain its contribution to       the newly deployed enhanced forward presence of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Poland, Lithuania,       Latvia, and Estonia and encourage Canada, the United Kingdom,       and Germany to continue their important leadership roles in       the military presence of NATO in those countries;        (3) the United States has defensive intentions in pursuing       such sanctions and such enhanced military posture in Europe,       and does not seek to threaten Russian territory;        (4) the United States does not seek to be an enemy of the       Russian people;        (5) the United States desires a peaceful, economically       prosperous relationship with Russia based on democratic       principles where freedom and the rule of law are upheld for       all; and        (6) the United States is committed to defending these       fundamental beliefs against any Russian aggression.       SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director of National       Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of State and       the Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees each of the assessments described in       subsection (b).        (b) Assessments Described.--The assessments described in       this section are the following with respect to the current       intentions of the political leadership of the Russian       Federation and based on intelligence obtained from all       sources:        (1) Potential military action against members of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).        (2) Potential responses to an enlarged United States or       NATO military presence in eastern Europe or to increased       United States military support for allies and partners in the       region, such as the provision of additional lethal military       equipment to Ukraine or Georgia.        (3) Potential areas where the Government of the Russian       Federation could exploit weaknesses and divisions among the       governments of its Western adversaries.        (c) Form.--Each assessment required under subsection (a)       may be submitted in classified form but shall also include an       unclassified executive summary, consistent with the       protection of intelligence sources and methods.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the       Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Armed       Services of the House of Representatives; and  [[Page H2665]]         (2) the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on       Foreign Relations, and the Committee on Armed Services of the       Senate.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1617.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1617, the Keeping  Russian Entrapments Minimal and Limiting Intelligence Networks Act, or  the KREMLIN Act.   The intelligence community is united in its assessment that Russia  attempted to sabotage the 2016 U.S. election and that America is not  alone in facing these dangers and attacks. In fact, recent reports  indicate that Russia continues to engage in information warfare and  political interference in the West that threatens the health of  democratic institutions within member countries of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, otherwise known as NATO.   Among many examples, the Russian Federation is linked to cybercrimes  in Ukraine and Germany, disinformation campaigns here in the United  States, intelligence support for pro-Russian Bulgarian candidates, and  financing for pro-Russian parties in France.   The bipartisan KREMLIN Act which I introduced with my friend,  Congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, acknowledges the active threat of  foreign interference on the United States and our NATO allies.   Specifically, this legislation would require the Director of National  Intelligence to submit three intelligence assessments to Congress.  These assessments must analyze:   First, potential military action by Russia against members of NATO;   Second, potential responses by Russia to an enlarged U.S. or NATO  presence in Eastern Europe;   Third, potential areas where the Russian Government could exploit  weaknesses and divisions among the governments of NATO and her allies.   Most importantly, the KREMLIN Act recognizes that Russian meddling  with our allied NATO countries constitutes a direct threat to the  United States.   By providing the appropriate congressional committees with these  comprehensive assessments, we will be better prepared to thwart efforts  in the future that aim to weaken international democratic institutions.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2019.      Hon. Adam Schiff,      Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on Foreign Affairs has now had an opportunity to review H.R.       1617, the ``KREMLIN Act,'' which falls within our shared Rule       X jurisdiction. I appreciate that you have consulted with us       on this legislation. The Foreign Affairs Committee has no       objection to considering this bill on the House floor. To       expedite that consideration, the Foreign Affairs Committee is       willing to waive referral, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       legislation or its subject matter.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Foreign Affairs Committee       reserves the right to request an appropriate number of       conferees to address any concerns with this bill or related       provisions that may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperation spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                 Eliot L. Engel,                                        Chairman, House Committee on      Foreign Affairs.                                   ____           Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House of             Representatives,                                                     March 8, 2019.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I write in reply to your letter       regarding H.R. 1617, the ``KREMLIN Act.'' I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; and that       the Committee on Foreign Affairs will not take up H.R. 1617       formally. I further agree that your Committee's inaction       regarding the bill will not waive any future jurisdictional       claims over matters addressed in H.R. 1617 which fall within       your Committee's jurisdiction under Rule X of the Rules of       Procedure for the House of Representatives for the 116th       Congress.        At your request, I lastly will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, for the health of our democracy, I  strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan KREMLIN Act, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
