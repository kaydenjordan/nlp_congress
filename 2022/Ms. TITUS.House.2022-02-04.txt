 Madam Speaker, a recent United Nations report confirmed  that climate change represents nothing less than a code red for  humanity.   We know the largest contributor to emissions is transportation, and  that is why efforts to decarbonize this sector are so important if we  are serious about fighting climate change.   Modernizing our transportation sector and moving toward a clean  energy future means building electric vehicle infrastructure, something  that the new law does with the first-ever Federal investments in a  national EV charging network.   In Nevada, this will bring over $38 million to build EV stations  throughout the State, helping us to have a higher percentage of  electric vehicles on the road, reduce our emissions, and address  climate change.   People often come to Las Vegas to recharge, and now, thanks to the  infrastructure law, they will be able to do it in other ways and in  other places.                            ____________________
