 Mr. Speaker, during his testimony before the Intel  Committee, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman had a message for his  father: ``Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.''   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is a war hero who has earned far better  than the treatment he received from the administration last week. But  this behavior should not surprise us. It is part of a pattern.   Let us remember the campaign waged against Ambassador Marie  Yovanovitch last year. Ambassador Yovanovitch is an exemplary public  servant who deserved our gratitude. Instead, the administration  shamelessly attacked her and fired her to further the President's  personal agenda.   But I agree with the Ambassador when she wrote:         I remain optimistic about the future. The events of the       past year, while deeply disturbing, show that even though our       institutions and our fellow citizens are being challenged in       ways that few of us ever expected, we will endure and we will       persist.    Indeed.                            ____________________
