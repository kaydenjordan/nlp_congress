 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 868 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 868         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       5746) to amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the       authority of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration to enter into leases of non-excess property of       the Administration, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       House Administration or her designee that the House concur in       the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text       of Rules Committee Print 117-28. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House       Administration or their respective designees. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its       adoption without intervening motion.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  [[Page H65]]  Fischbach), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks    Madam Speaker, today the Committee on Rules met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 868, providing for consideration of  the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746.   The rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the  Committee on House Administration or her designee that the House concur  in the Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of the  Freedom to Vote, John R. Lewis Act. The rule provides 1 hour of debate  on the motion equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on House Administration or their  designees.   Madam Speaker, this is about more than a bill, and it is about more  than a process. This is a rescue mission to save American democracy.  Because right now, we are in the midst of the most significant period  of voter suppression in recent history.   All across the country, in service to a lie started by the former  President and spread by some in this very body, State legislatures are  moving to make it harder for people to cast their ballot. Polling  places are being closed so the nearest location is now miles and miles  away. Early voting times are being slashed during this global pandemic,  so it is now too unsafe for some people to vote. Purges of voting  rolls, including faulty voter purges, are becoming more likely and more  common. And strict voter ID laws are being used to disenfranchise more  and more people from casting their ballots.   Madam Speaker, in one State, it has even become illegal to provide  voters waiting in line with food and water. That is why we are here  today, because some believe that the only way for them to win is to rig  an election. This is voter nullification pure and simple.   Now, many on the other side want us to turn a blind eye to all of  this, just like they turned a blind eye to the insurrection and the  creeping authoritarianism. Well, I am not willing to look away. People  fought and died for the freedom to vote in this country. We served with  someone who nearly gave his life for the right to vote--Congressman  John Lewis.   He was beaten by mobs using baseball bats and chains, attacked by  racist members of the KKK, and even thrown in jail. But still, still he  fought for the freedom to vote. If he was willing to withstand all that  to do what is right, then certainly we can cast a vote to defend our  democracy.   John once said, ``Change often takes time. It rarely happens all at  once. In the movement, we didn't know how history would play itself  out. When we were getting arrested or waiting in jail or standing in  unmovable lines on the courthouse steps, we didn't know what would  happen, but we knew it had to happen.''   Madam Speaker, I don't know what will happen in the Senate, but I  know that this vote has to happen, because the freedom to vote is under  assault. We have a system today that undermines the civil rights of the  young, the poor, and those who don't look like me. It is a system that  has allowed Presidents to win elections despite losing the popular  vote. It is a system that has allowed politicians to gerrymander their  way into office. And it is a system that gives the 26 least popular  States, representing just 17 percent of the country, the chance to  derail legislation that the vast majority of Americans support.   Madam Speaker, that is the reality of the Senate filibuster. And make  no mistake, despite the claims by some, the filibuster is not  sacrosanct. It has been changed over 161 times in the last five  decades. And nowhere--nowhere--does it appear in the Constitution of  the United States.   Just recently, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to  advance a filibuster carveout to raise the debt ceiling. Now, I am glad  that they did. That was the right thing to do. A default would have  been catastrophic for our economy. Certainly, allowing a carveout for  voting rights is also the right thing to do.   We need to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to ensure that  every American has the ability to make their voice and vote heard in  our democracy. And I wish we could get a majority of Republicans to  support voting rights. You know, they used to. The Voting Rights Act  was reauthorized four times with overwhelming bipartisan support,  including in 2006 under the Presidency of Republican George W. Bush.   But something has changed. This isn't your grandfather's Republican  Party anymore. It is a party defined by the big lie, wild conspiracy  theories, and winning elections by trying to suppress the vote. To set  a standard that we must act on this bill or that the Senate should act  on filibuster reform only if Republicans come along is a fool's errand.   Madam Speaker, on what planet are the people causing the problem  going to help solve it?   Now, I would rather be on the side of John Lewis than cast my lot  with the big lie. I would rather go it alone to defend our democracy  than do nothing together. And yes, I would rather lose an election than  win by rigging the outcome. This fight may not be new but it has never  been more urgent.   Madam Speaker, history is watching. And this moment is bigger than  any of us. With the future of our democracy in the balance, I pray that  my colleagues join me in saying the same and supporting this rule and  the underlying measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I am not going to be lectured about  respect for this institution by anybody who after a violent attack  against this Capitol, the people who work here, this democracy--after a  violent attack, them then coming to this House floor and voting to  overturn, to nullify the will of the American people with no basis of  fact at all to do that. I will not be lectured by anybody who would do  such a thing. Quite frankly, I think it is unconscionable.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just remind my colleagues that voter suppression takes many  forms. Sometimes it is Republican State legislatures making it more  difficult for people to vote. Sometimes it is members of bodies like  this that, on one hand, brag about the record turnout in the last  election but have been working overtime to try to nullify and to try to  disqualify the votes of the people of this country. It is stunning.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a July 2, 2021, U.S. News and  World Report article titled ``Report: Republican-Led State Legislatures  Pass Dozens of Restrictive Voting Laws in 2021.''                       [From U.S. News, July 2, 2021]   Report: Republican-Led State Legislatures Pass Dozens of Restrictive                            Voting Laws in 2021                              (By Horus Alas)      States with Republican legislatures have passed waves of new laws     making it harder for constituents to vote in response to the 2020                           election, experts say         The Supreme Court issued a new ruling on Thursday that       upheld two Arizona laws restricting organizations' ability to       collect mail-in ballots as well as invalidating ballots cast       in the wrong precinct. Critics say the court's decision       further erodes landmark voting protections codified by the       Voting Rights Act of 1965.        The court's ruling follows a report finding that as of mid-      June, 17 states had passed 28 laws making it harder for       constituents to vote in 2021, according to the Brennan Center       for Justice at New York University's School of Law. The       report notes that the last year a similar number of laws       passed restricting access to the ballot was 2011--when 14       states had enacted 19 such measures by October.        Eliza Sweren-Becker, a voting rights and elections counsel       at the Brennan Center, called the new wave of voting laws       ``an unprecedented assault on voting rights'' as well as ``a       voter suppression effort we haven't seen since the likes of       Jim Crow.''        The nation's high court previously gutted a key provision       of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, when Chief Justice John       Roberts wrote a majority opinion arguing that jurisdictions       with a history of racial discrimination in voting should no       longer be subject to oversight from the Department of Justice       before effecting changes to their voting laws.        The Brennan Center report attributes this year's batch of       restrictive voting laws to ``racist voter fraud allegations       behind the Big Lie (a reference to former President Donald       Trump's repeated false claims of a rigged election) and a       desire to prevent future elections from achieving the       historic turnout seen in 2020.''        Commenting on the former president's claims of mass voter       fraud, Sweren-Becker says, ``We know that's false, but we       have officials at the state level passing these laws making       it harder for people to vote.''        Some of the specific provisions in these laws that can have       a negative impact on voter turnout according to the Brennan       Center include restrictions on voting by mail--some 63.9       million ballots had been sent as of Election Day 2020, data       from the U.S. Elections Project indicated--challenges to in-      person voting, and limitations on the number of mail ballot       drop boxes in precincts.        According to Sweren-Becker, Republican lawmakers in state       legislatures across the country are capitalizing on Trump's       repeated claims of voter fraud to pass these measures.        ``What is very clear is that we had a very successful       election last year with historic turnout that was certified       as one of the safest, most secure elections,'' she says.       ``And we are hearing (about claims of voter fraud) as       pretextual motives .... These laws are being enacted in       Republican-controlled legislatures, in many cases on purely       party-line votes.''        States differ in their structuring of these laws as well.        The report specifically calls out Florida, Georgia and Iowa       for passing comprehensive omnibus bills that ``undertake a       full-fledged assault on voting.'' In contrast, certain states       including Arkansas and Montana have passed piecemeal voting       restrictions through four separate bills each.        Sweren-Becker says advocates are considering two primary       avenues to challenge some of these new voting laws: court       litigation and federal voting reform legislation.        ``Litigation is happening already, in states like Georgia,       Iowa, Florida. But that is a piecemeal state-by-state       approach,'' she says. ``And that's why a federal policy like       the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act       are so necessary because they will be applicable to people       across the country.''        As of mid-June, Senate Democrats were still wrangling the       necessary votes to pass either of these voting rights       measures in the face of expected unified Republican       opposition.        But even as some states face litigation for measures       they've passed, others still have active legislative sessions       where observers worry that more voting restriction measures       may follow.        Sweren-Becker says voting rights advocates should focus on       pressuring state lawmakers in Pennsylvania--a state with a       Republican-controlled legislature that adjourns in December--      and Texas, where a special session will begin July 8, after       Democrats walked out on a vote for a bill that would increase       vote by mail restrictions and limit early voting hours at the       end of the regular session.  [[Page H69]]         Despite outcry from Democrats, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has       struck a defiant tone on his state's omnibus voting measure,       SB7. In response to a tweet from the Texas Attorney General       detailing the booking of a suspect charged with voter fraud,       Abbott wrote: ``Voter fraud is real and Texas will prosecute       it whenever and wherever it happens. We will continue to make       it easy to vote but hard to cheat.''        Sweren-Becker says the frenetic pace of this year's       restrictive voting bills--the Brennan Center's report noted       61 bills with restrictive provisions continuing to move       through 18 state legislatures as of June 21--makes it       ``essential to pass federal democracy reform that ensures       that people can freely and safely cast their ballots.''        And while these bills' language tends to omit race, Sweren-      Becker says that several of their provisions do end up       targeting access to the ballot for voters of color.        She notes ``the policy in the Texas bill that banned early       voting hours during the Sunday before Election Day, which       very clearly targets souls to the polls efforts that are       clearly organized by Black churches,'' as well as increased       challenges to voting by mail, ``after a wave of increased       mail voting last year, and particularly by voters of color       and young voters.''     Madam Speaker, one voting rights expert said in this  piece that we are in the midst of ``a voter suppression effort we  haven't seen since the likes of Jim Crow.''   To suggest that this isn't happening is to ignore reality.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a December 24,  2021 Guardian Article entitled ``Report Shows the Extent of Republican  Efforts to Sabotage Democracy.''                     [From The Guardian, Dec, 24, 2021]    Report Shows the Extent of Republican Efforts To Sabotage Democracy         The Republican assault on free and fair elections       instigated by Donald Trump is gathering pace, with efforts to       sabotage the normal workings of American democracy sweeping       state legislatures across the US.        A year that began with the violent insurrection at the US       Capitol is ending with an unprecedented push to politicize,       criminalize or in other ways subvert the nonpartisan       administration of elections. A year-end report from pro-      democracy groups identifies no fewer than 262 bills       introduced in 41 states that hijack the election process.        Of those, 32 bills have become law in 17 states.        The largest number of bills is concentrated in precisely       those states that became the focus of Trump's Stop the Steal       campaign to block the peaceful transfer of power after he       lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. Arizona,       where Trump supporters insisted on an ``audit'' to challenge       Biden's victory in the state, has introduced 20 subversion       bills, and Georgia where Trump attempted to browbeat the top       election official to find extra votes for him has introduced       15 bills.        Texas, whose ultra-right Republican group has made the       state the ground zero of voter suppression and election       interference, has introduced as many as 59 bills.        ``We're seeing an effort to hijack elections in this       country, and ultimately, to take power away from the American       people. If we don't want politicians deciding our elections,       we all need to start paying attention,'' said Joanna Lydgate,       CEO of the States United Democracy Center which is one of the       three groups behind the report. Protect Democracy and Law       Forward also participated.        One of the key ways that Trump-inspired state lawmakers       have tried to sabotage future elections is by changing the       rules to give legislatures control over vote counts. In       Pennsylvania, a bill passed in the wake of Trump's defeat       that sought to rewrite the state's election law was vetoed by       Democratic governor Tom Wolf.        Now hard-right lawmakers are trying to bypass Wolf's veto       power by proposing a constitutional amendment that would give       the legislature the power to overrule the state's chief       elections officer and create a permanent audit of election       counts subject to its own will.        In several states, nonpartisan election officials who for       years have administered ballots impartially are being       replaced by hyper-partisan conspiracy theorists and advocates       of Trump's false claims that the election was rigged. In       Michigan, county Republican groups in eight of the 11 largest       counties have systematically replaced professional       administration officials with ``stop the steal'' extremists.        Several secretaries of state, the top election officials       responsible for presidential election counts, are being       challenged by extreme Republicans who participated in trying       to overturn the 2020 result. Trump has endorsed for the role       Mark Finchem in Arizona, Jody Hice in Georgia and Kristina       Karamo in Michigan who have all claimed falsely that Trump       won and should now be in his second term in the White House.        Jess Marsden, Counsel at Protect Democracy, said that the       nationwide trend of state legislatures attempting to       interfere with the  [[Page H70]]       work of nonpartisan election officials was gaining momentum.       `It's leading us down an antidemocratic path toward an       election crisis,'' she said.     Madam Speaker, more than 260 bills were introduced in  41 States last year to hijack the election process. If this isn't a  national emergency, I don't know what the hell is.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say to my colleagues, this is kind of pathetic. It is a  nonbinding resolution that does nothing, and I guess attacks immigrant  parents who are involved in local school boards, I guess.   But I mean, really? I mean, this is your response to what is  happening all across this country in terms of the attacks on voting  rights?   The bill that we are talking about bringing to the floor, let me just  tell you some of the things it does. Our bill, which will become law,  would enhance protections for individuals with disabilities.   It would make Election Day a national holiday. It would improve  election security by requiring post-election audits and voter- verifiable paper records of votes.   It would protect elections from foreign interference. It would  promote digital ad transparency.   It would end partisan gerrymandering. I can go on and on and on and  on.   But the difference here is that I think we recognize, and I think,  unfortunately, this has become a partisan issue because I think there  are a lot of Independent voters and Republican voters across the  country who are concerned, like Democrats in the House are, about the  attacks on voting rights.   I mean, the idea that we have one State that passed a law that said  it is going to be illegal to give people water who wait in a line to be  able to cast their vote? And we know in some States, people have to  wait for hours and hours and hours to vote. But somehow, that would be  criminalized; that that would be forbidden? I mean, give me a break.   I mean, I don't know what the hell happened to the Republican Party.  I mean, I don't know when they decided that the basis for who they are  was a big lie.   We had an election in 2020. As one of my colleagues pointed out, a  lot of people showed up and voted. I mean, the people who voted  returned me and returned my Republican colleagues and brought new  Members to this body.   And yet, they have been working overtime to embrace a big lie, after  a violent insurrection, where people's lives were threatened. Our  staff, the people who work here, their lives were threatened. Madam  Speaker, 140 Capitol police officers were injured. After all of that,  they still embraced the big lie and are working to try to nullify the  legitimate votes of the people of this country.                                time  2210    It is stunning to me.   So, yeah, to take this, whatever it is, meaningless, nonbinding  resolution, and, I guess, maybe you can say you are for something. But  it is nothing. It is pathetic. Or we can actually do something about  protecting the right of every single person in this country to vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me remind everybody: If you vote ``no'' on the previous question  like my Republican colleagues would like you to do, you get to pass a  meaningless, nonbinding resolution. Wow, what a courageous thing my  friends are doing today.   Let me just say to my colleague from Minnesota, Mrs. Fischbach, whom  I have a lot of respect for, yes, some of us raised objections in 2016  because we were concerned about Russian interference in our election. I  think the Mueller report actually proved that we were right on that.   But let me ask her: How many votes did we have? None. Of all the  people that objected, how much time did it take? Less than 8 minutes.  How many Capitol Police, Mrs. Fischbach, were wounded that day? None.  How much violence occurred in this Capitol that day? There was none.  How much property was destroyed that day? None.   Compare that to what happened here, when many of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, after a violent insurrection, after an attack  on this democracy, came here, with absolutely no basis of fact or  evidence, and voted to nullify the results of a free and fair election  in the United States of America.   So when people in this country express concern--not just Democrats,  but Independents and Republicans--when people express concern about the  future of our democracy, that is what they are talking about.   Voting rights are under attack in State after State after State. We  see what State legislatures are doing. But the right to vote is also  being attacked when we have Members of this Chamber who actively try to  subvert the will of the American people.   So you may think it is no big deal. Maybe you think that is what you  have to do to try to maintain power. But the bottom line is, as John  Lewis said, the right to vote is precious; it is almost sacred. We all  have to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and we have to stand  up and we have to protect it. That is what this is about.   So talk about whatever you want to talk about, but the bottom line  is, we need to do this. This is the right thing to do. And by  proceeding in this way, we will at least ensure that there is a debate  in the United States Senate, and hopefully there will be a vote to  actually make this into the law of the land.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a few quick things. One is, you know, I got a little whiplash  here because, on the one hand, I am hearing my friends say they don't  want Federal interference in local elections, yet that is what they are  proposing here. Except I guess they are not because this is nonbinding  and doesn't mean anything. I just point that out for the record.   Secondly, I know my colleague from Minnesota. I may have misheard her  when she said that I voted to nullify the election in 2016. There were  no votes on any of the State electoral college results. I am a stickler  for accuracy on things like that.   Thirdly, let me remind people why we are here today. We are here to  pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which would expand  automatic voter registration and same-day registration. It would expand  early voting. It would enhance protections for individuals with  disabilities. It would make election day a national holiday. It would  improve election security. It would protect elections from foreign  interference.   It will do things that, quite frankly, I think most reasonable  people--I don't care what their politics may be--would think is the  right thing to do.   Unfortunately, what is reasonable amongst the American people is not  always reasonable here in the Congress. I think the effort that my  Republican colleagues are engaged in really is about nullifying results  that they don't like.   Well, do you know what? We all want to win elections, but sometimes  we lose. It is not pleasant. But if that is what the people want, then  the people should get what they want.   Madam Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support what we are  doing here today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for her service in  this Congress and her service on the Rules Committee.   She said that she hasn't heard any compelling arguments why we should  pass these bills. Maybe she wasn't listening to me because I think I  made a lot of compelling arguments here today about why these bills are  incredibly important.   Something is badly, badly broken, and we must have the courage to fix  it, even if that means fixing it alone. That is what it means to do the  right thing, politics be damned.   This is about more than petty partisanship. This is about whether we  defend democracy or we sit back and watch its demise. I could never  live with myself if I did nothing, and I think I speak for a lot of my  colleagues on this side of the aisle. I wish there were more colleagues  on the other side of the aisle who felt that way.   Working with my colleagues, I am going to try to do everything  possible to stem the insidious tide of voter suppression in this  country and the attempts to nullify the will of the American people  because there is no guarantee that America will forever be a democracy.  It isn't planted in our soil. It isn't floating through our air. It is  us. We are the only ones who can guarantee democracy prevails, and this  vote is about nothing less.   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying  measure.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 868         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H.Res. 866) recognizing that allowing illegal       immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and       diminishes the voting power of United States citizens. All       points of order against consideration of the resolution are       waived. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.Res. 866.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
