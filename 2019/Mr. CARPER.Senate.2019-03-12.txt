 Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Diesel Emissions  Reduction Act of 2019, or DERA, which I am introducing today with  Senators Inhofe, Barrasso, Whitehouse, Sullivan, Booker, Capito,  Gillibrand, Cramer and Van Hollen.   In today's hearing, we will be focusing on legislation that  reauthorizes a program that is near and dear to my heart--the Diesel  Emissions Reduction Act, or DERA. I would like to say thank you to my  DERA co-pilot, Senator Inhofe. Senator Inhofe has been a staunch  supporter of DERA since day one. I greatly appreciate his continued  support and the hard work of his staff on this legislation. I also  thank our cosponsors from last Congress who have joined us again this  year, Chairman Barrasso and Senator Whitehouse. Chairman Barrasso and  his staff teamed up with us last Congress to make DERA work even  better, and I appreciate his strong support. I also would like to say  thank you to our new cosponsors this year, Senators Sullivan, Booker,  Capito, Gillibrand, Cramer and Van Hollen.   In all my years of public service, it's not every day that I've seen  programs that generate this much bipartisan support--but, then again,  not many programs are as effective and commonsense as DERA.   Our Nation still relies heavily on diesel power to transport  commuters and kids, harvest our crops and build our infrastructure.  Today diesel engines are found everywhere, from our schools to our  ports, and from our highways to our agricultural fields.   Many of my colleagues have heard me say that the great thing about  diesel engines is that they last a long time. And the bad thing about  diesel engines is that they last a long time. Diesel engines are  reliable and efficient, but older diesel engines are big polluters.  Dirty diesel engine emissions are some of the biggest contributors to  our Nation's smog, soot and black carbon air pollution. These dirty  diesel emissions harm our health and our climate.   Because of smart emission standards, new and retrofitted diesel  engines using American technology are now much cleaner than older  diesel engines--over 90% cleaner. Unfortunately, diesel engines run  forever and there is little incentive for a diesel engine owner to  replace an engine before it breaks down. That's why today, more than a  decade after diesel emission standards were implemented by the EPA,  millions of older diesel engines that lack the latest pollution control  technology are still in use and will remain in use for decades to come.  [[Page S1795]]    Back in 2005, my very good friend, the late-Senator from Ohio, George  Voinovich, came to me with an idea to help solve this problem--he came  to me with the idea for DERA. Senator Voinovich said to me, let's  provide financial incentives for people to replace or retrofit their  older diesel engines with American-made clean vehicle technology. He  told me that we can dramatically reduce diesel emissions, protect our  health and create jobs here at home. I said ``Sign me up!'' And I've  been DERA's strongest supporter ever since. In 2005, Congress passed  DERA faster than I think we've passed any EPA program ever before. This  simple idea has turned into one of EPA's most effective clean air  program on the books today.   For every dollar spent in the DERA program, our Nation sees $13 in  economic and health benefits. The emission reductions have helped  States meet clean air standards and resulted in more than $12.6 billion  in health benefits alone since the program's inception.   From requests for electric school buses, to replacement ferry  engines, to simple diesel retrofits, EPA tells us that the requests  keep coming in--but, unfortunately, funding for DERA far exceeds the  program's available funds. With millions of dirty diesel engines on our  roads, DERA is as important today as it was when it first started. Now,  we must work together to ensure that every State, Tribe and territory  can still benefit from this unique program.   At a time when our Nation is looking for ways to create jobs, have  healthier air and a better climate, cleaning up dirty diesel engines  through DERA stands out as a prime example of what works.   Today, I'm proud to continue the bipartisan tradition that started  more than 15 years ago with my good friend, Senator Voinovich. I look  forward to working with my colleagues to pass reauthorization of DERA  this Congress.   Thank you Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 752. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide  for teacher and school leader quality enhancement and to enhance  institutional aid; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
