 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Just a few minutes ago, yet again, the American people  received a monthly inflation report that was even worse than the expert  predictions.   The expectation was that Democrats' runaway inflation might finally  begin to actually level off. The top-line inflation rate was expected  to fall. Instead, yet again, the opposite happened. Overall inflation  was up even higher.   The prices this past August were still 8.3 percent higher than they  were in August of 2021. Just a catastrophically high inflation rate.    Food prices went up another 0.8 percent just this past month alone.  Overall food prices just logged their biggest 1-year increase since the  late 1970s. Groceries in particular are now 13.5 percent more expensive  than they were at this time last year. Democrats' policies are sucker- punching American families every time they set foot in the checkout  line. Eggs are up 40 percent. Butter, up 25 percent. Baby food, up 13  percent. Chicken, dairy, bread, cereal, and canned fruits and  vegetables are all up around 16 percent each. Coffee is up even more  than that.   Housing and shelter costs were up. Medical costs were up. Furniture,  up. New cars, up.   Electricity costs were way, way up--a 15.8-percent increase since  last year. So let me say that again. Inflation on Americans'  electricity bills alone--alone--is 15.8 percent in just the last 12  [[Page S4547]]  months. This is the largest 1-year increase in electricity prices since  1981, when the statistic was looking back into the final months of  Jimmy Carter.   Even if you take out energy and food prices--two areas where the  administration likes to pass the buck and pretend they are powerless-- inflation skyrocketed 0.6 percent in just the month of August alone.   Eight-point-three percent inflation--just an astonishing number. And  remember, this figure only looks back 12 months, but we are now more  than 12 months into the Democrats' inflation spiral. Prices are 8.3  percent higher today than in August of 2021, but remember, in August  2021, the baseline, we were already talking about runaway inflation.  Prices were already way up compared to the year before that. So the 12- month number dramatically understates the total damage that Democrats  have caused.   Here is the comparison that matters most to American families,  especially with an election in less than 2 months: How are things today  compared to January 2021, when this all-Democratic government was sworn  in? How are they compared to January 2021? Here is the answer: Food  prices are up a total of 13.9 percent since President Biden was sworn  in. Gas prices are up 58.5 percent. Electricity costs are up 21.6  percent. And the overall, across-the-board inflation rate since  President Biden took office is a catastrophic--catastrophic--12.5  percent.   This very day, President Biden and Democrats are having a big  celebration for their latest reckless spending bill, which they  pretended would reduce inflation but which nonpartisan experts say will  actually make it worse. They could not look more out of touch if they  tried.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, this past  weekend, Vice President Harris made a surprising announcement on ``Meet  the Press.'' The Vice President declared--listen to this--``The border  is secure.''   We are about to close the fiscal year with more than 2 million  illegal immigrant encounters on our southern border, breaking the  alltime record that we only just set last year. Seizures of lethal  fentanyl are also on pace to exceed last year's total. They are up more  than 200 percent in just the latest month on record. These are not the  signs of a secure border, and the American people know it. An outright  majority of the country disapproves of how President Biden has been  handling this issue. The Vice President's claims aren't fooling anyone.   For years now, this crisis has stretched border communities to the  breaking point and caused ripples throughout the entire country. All  the while, Democrats have claimed it would be cruel or uncompassionate  to have a functioning southern border or actually enforce our laws.   Now, in recent weeks, the country has been treated to one of the more  striking displays of irony we have seen in quite a while.   For many years, while the citizens and local governments on the  border have cried out for help and law enforcement, various Democrat- run cities and States that aren't on the border decided to set  themselves up as virtue signaling sanctuary cities, where immigration  laws supposedly simply do not apply. For years, much of the political  left has suggested there are no legitimate practical reasons why our  country would want secure borders or to enforce its immigration laws.  Only racism or xenophobia could possibly explain it.   Well, for several weeks now, some of these overwhelmed States have  decided to try taking some of these Democrat-run jurisdictions at their  word.   Governor Abbott in Texas and Governor Ducey in Arizona have put a  very small proportion of the illegal immigrants pouring into their  States onto buses bound for the self-advertised sanctuary cities of New  York and Washington. And do you know what? Just this very small taste  of chaos, this tiny little sliver of what many places in America have  been dealing with for years, has these cities' Democratic leaders  outraged, anxious, and scrambling.   Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, has only had to receive in 5 weeks  roughly the number of people the Border Patrol encounters in 7 or 8  hours. New York has had over a month to handle a fraction--a fraction-- of 1 day's share of border crossings. Yet the mayor says having to deal  with this is ``horrific.'' New York City officials complain that they  are overwhelmed.   Here in Washington, the destination for fewer than 8,000 illegal  immigrants, the Democrat Mayor has declared a public health emergency.  She begged the Pentagon to send in the National Guard for help. The  Defense Department, of course, turned her down.   It is incredible just how quickly Democrats change their tune when  they have to stomach one single spoonful--spoonful--of the policies  they have been force-feeding the rest of our country. Oh, it is  challenging to have waves of illegal immigrants pouring into your  community? This creates challenges for housing and medical care and  resource allocation and law enforcement? Who knew all this?   As one former mayor from the frontlines of this crisis put it  recently, ``The city of McAllen was able to deal with thousands of  immigrants a day. I think they can handle a few hundred.''   Maybe this will be the wake-up call the Democrats need to finally  understand that functional nations--functional nations--need functional  borders.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
