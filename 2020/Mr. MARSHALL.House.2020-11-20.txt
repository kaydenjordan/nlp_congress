 Mr. Speaker, bells should be ringing today, and I just  don't mean on Wall Street. Across the entire Nation, bells should be  ringing.   Today, as I have been promising since early summer, not one but two  vaccines will ask the FDA for emergency use authorization.   Congratulations to President Trump. Congratulations to Vice President  Pence and his Warp Speed team. Congratulations to Pfizer and BioNTech.  You did it. American innovation has persevered again.   We have three million doses right now, enough to vaccinate every  nursing home patient in America. We will have 50 million doses by  December being distributed, as well.   Thanks to almighty God who inspired the scientists who led to the  discovery.   Indeed, bells will be ringing across America this Thanksgiving. We  have one more thing to be thankful for.                            ____________________
