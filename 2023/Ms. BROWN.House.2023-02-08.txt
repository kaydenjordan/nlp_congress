 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the importance of  closing the disposable e-cigarette loophole to continue our progress in  reducing youth e-cigarette use.   The danger disposable e-cigarettes pose to our young people cannot be  underestimated. Currently, it is estimated that more than 700,000  middle and high school students vape on a daily basis--more than  700,000.   Use of disposable e-cigarettes by our youth has increased by more  than 2,000 percent since 2019. Although disguised with flavors like  apple and strawberry, the truth is that a single e-cigarette can have  the same amount of nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes.   A loophole left by the previous administration excludes e-cigarettes  and disposable e-cigarette products from the tobacco flavoring  guidelines, which are at the heart of this epidemic.   Closing the Trump-era loophole will ensure the flavor ban applies to  disposable e-cigarettes. Keeping America's youth safe and healthy  depends on it.                            ____________________
