 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael  A. Sprayberry, who is retiring as director of the North Carolina  Division of Emergency Management, NCEM, and the North Carolina Office  of Recovery and Resiliency, NCORR. Mr. Sprayberry has served North  Carolina for over 42 years and has exemplified the highest standard of  leadership, effectiveness, and professionalism, and I thank him for his  valued service to our State.   Mr. Sprayberry was born in Atlanta, GA and moved to North Carolina in  high school. He went on to serve our Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps  and in the North Carolina National Guard for 11 years. In 1979, Mike  received his bachelor of science in business administration from the  University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He continued his education  and received his master of arts degree in history.   Mike's entire career has been in service to his country and the Sate.  During his years of service with the National Guard, he was awarded the  Meritorious Service Medal with three bronze oak leaf clusters and the  North Carolina National Guard Distinguished Service Medal. He received  the Order of the Long Leaf Pine in 1998 and was inducted into the North  Carolina National Guard's Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame in  August of 2011.   In 2005, Director Sprayberry began his career in emergency management  as the deputy director and logistics chief. He served in this capacity  until 2013, when he was appointed to serve as director under Governor  Pat McCrory.   Mr. Sprayberry is the longest serving emergency management director  in North Carolina's history. During his tenure, he successfully oversaw  the State's response to 19 State declared disasters and 11 federally  declared disasters. He has led North Carolina through hurricanes,  earthquakes, winter storms, and a pandemic.   Mr. Sprayberry is nationally respected and has served as president of  the National Emergency Management Association and is a member of the  FEMA National Advisory Council.   Mr. President, thanks to Mike's leadership, North Carolina is better  prepared to deal with both natural and man-made disasters. Please join  me in thanking Director Mike Sprayberry, his wife, and his daughters  for his career in public service and wishing him a joyful  retirement.                            ____________________
