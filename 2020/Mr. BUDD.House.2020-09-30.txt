 Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest lessons that the COVID-19  pandemic has taught us is the importance of the phrase ``Made in  America.''   In my home State of North Carolina, we are a national leader in  textile manufacturing, and we have a rich history of producing high- quality products. That is why North Carolina has been at the forefront  of helping our first responders and frontline medical personnel get the  protective equipment that they need to effectively battle the virus.   For these reasons, I want to see our protective equipment made in the  United States and not in a country controlled by the Chinese Communist  Party.   For the last two decades, most observers have predicted that either  the United States or China will lead the world in the 21st century. In  the early 2000s, we saw China as a friendly competitor that we could  work with economically. However, in recent years, the actions of the  Chinese Communist Party have revealed the true colors of an  authoritarian force. They are not our friends, and they are not a force  for good in this world.   Given the fact that it was China that mishandled the virus, and China  that allowed it to spread, and China that lied to the world about it,  how acceptable is it that the American people should be reliant on  China for the essential personal protective equipment that we need to  fight the virus? That would be like having to beg the arsonist to help  you put out the fire that they started.   That is why I introduced the Make PPP in America Act, along with  Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. This bipartisan legislation requires the  Defense Logistics Agency to issue longer term contracts to make  personal protective equipment in the United States.   We have to boost our domestic supply chains and make sure our most  important products come from our shores and not from our adversaries  like Communist China.   Bottom line, we need to ensure that Made in America is more than just  a slogan. Made in America needs to be a guiding principle as we move  into the 2020s and beyond.                            ____________________
