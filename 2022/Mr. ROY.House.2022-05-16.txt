 Mr. Speaker, I wasn't going to use this 1-minute time, but I  just got a text from some contacts down on the border in south Texas  from Eagle Pass with drone footage of yet another enormous group that  is crossing illegally onto private property around Eagle Pass. A Texas  soldier tells us that there have been 2,000-plus crossings in this  specific spot in the last 8 days, yet the Secretary of Homeland  Security testified in the House Judiciary Committee that ``he and this  administration have operational control of the border.''   But this is factually incorrect.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not seem interested  in having a debate or a discussion here on the floor of the people's  House about a crisis facing the State of Texas and the entire country.  Over 107,000 Americans died last year from drug poisonings and drug  overdoses, yet I get crickets from my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, do you want to know what is happening in south Texas?   Hispanics in south Texas are flocking away from a party that doesn't  care if they suffer or if migrants suffer while dead bodies rack up in  the Rio Grande and the ranches of south Texas. They have had enough, I  have had enough, and the people of Texas have had enough.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
