 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it a deadly public health  emergency, an economic crisis, and a disturbing rise in anti-Asian  hate.   Unfortunately, discrimination against the AAPI community is not new.  From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese Americans,  the U.S. has a long history of discrimination towards AAPI immigrants  and their descendants. This new wave of xenophobia has led to fear,  threats, and outright violence.   Madam Speaker, by passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act today, we are  standing up for our neighbors and against discrimination. We take this  vote during AAPI Heritage Month, a time to acknowledge incredible  contributions of this community and also the interconnection of the  American story and our mutual security.   I am proud to represent a large and vibrant AAPI community in my  district, and I have seen that community come together over the last  year and joined to help their neighbors and demand justice for all.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this bill today. It is critical  and long overdue.
