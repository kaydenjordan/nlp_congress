 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Old Glory  Honor Flight organization, as it makes its maiden flight to Vietnam to  bring 53 veterans back to the place where they risked their lives for  our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this important first flight  and to honor their sacrifices.   The all-volunteer organization, Old Glory Honor Flight, was founded  in 2009 by individuals who had a dream of creating an honor flight  experience for military veterans in northeast Wisconsin. A dedicated  board of volunteers launched the first official flight on October 27,  2009, when they hosted 95 World War II veterans on a trip to our  Nation's Capital to experience firsthand the national memorials  honoring American military servicemembers.   The honor flight's mission is to create a safe and memorable  experience for veterans who call Wisconsin home. Until now, each honor  flight has taken place within a single day, sending veterans to  Washington, DC, to thank them for all they sacrificed to keep our  Nation safe and free. Since its inception, Old Glory Honor Flight has  flown more than 3,500 veterans on more than 40 missions.   Through the generous support of individuals and businesses, Old Glory  Honor Flight has grown tremendously in the past decade. This month, for  the first time in its 10-year existence, the organization is sending 53  veterans who served in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand back to  Vietnam for 2 weeks.   Wisconsinites owe a debt of gratitude to these servicemembers who  answered our country's call to serve and defend the United States.  These veterans served with honor and endured the horrors of war. When  they returned home,  [[Page S1323]]  they were shunned and denied their rightful hero's welcome. We must vow  to never let this happen again and to always honor those who serve in  our Armed Forces. Let this flight be a reminder that we can all do our  part to keep the sacred trust we have with our veterans. Let it be a  reminder that there is still more work to do to honor their service,  and let us be inspired by their selfless and heroic service to a  grateful nation.   I am honored to recognize the very first Wisconsin Honor Flight to  Vietnam and I commend Old Glory Honor Flight on this extraordinary  mission to honor our Wisconsin military veterans. It is my sincere hope  that this momentous trip will bring some peace to these brave men  traveling back to Vietnam.                            ____________________
