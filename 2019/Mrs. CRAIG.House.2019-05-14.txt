 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work of the Farmington High School Rogue Robotics Team, a local  robotics team that built a functioning power wheelchair for 2-year-old  Cillian Jackson.   Cillian was born with a genetic disorder that makes it very difficult  for him to get around. Buying a wheelchair would have been cost- prohibitive for his family, so his parents turned to the students of  Farmington High School for their expertise and ingenuity.   The students of Farmington rose to the occasion and reimagined a  Power Wheels into a power wheelchair by outfitting it with a new seat  and a joystick that allow Cillian to move around on his own.   I congratulate the Farmington robotics team for their ingenuity and  hard work in making this possible. They are an example of what is  possible when communities come together and share their talents and  ideas to help our neighbors.                            ____________________
