 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 1:45 p.m. today, all postcloture time be  yielded back and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the Ho  nomination and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise today because I believe that some  here in Washington are under the illusion about what would happen if we  were to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or  NAFTA.   Some people still, inexplicably, believe that this would be a good  thing. They believe the relationship between the United States and  Mexico and Canada is somehow a raw deal for Americans. Let's talk about  Mexico for a while.   In reality, Mexico spends 26 percent of its GDP in its purchasing of  goods from the United States, while we spend less than 1 percent of our  GDP--I think it is 0.2 percent--in our purchasing of goods from them.  Again, for those who obsess over trade deficits with Mexico, Mexico  spends 26 percent of its GDP in its purchasing of goods from the United  States while we spend less than 1 percent of our GDP in our purchasing  of goods from them. Prior to NAFTA, our total trade with Mexico was  under $80 billion. Now that trade approaches $600 billion. That is a  good thing. That is good for us, and it is good for Mexico. Trade is  not a zero-sum game.   These folks also seem to think that terminating NAFTA will have no  lasting impact on this Nation or its economy. In reality, pulling out  of NAFTA would have sweeping negative consequences for Americans all  over the country. Let me briefly describe what America would look like  without NAFTA.   It would be an America with fewer jobs and higher unemployment. Some  of these jobs that would be lost would not return for decades, maybe  even for a generation. Other jobs would never return. It would be a  poorer America without NAFTA. The gross domestic product would drop.  Much of the positive growth that we have seen recently may be erased.  In the last year, we have seen impressive GDP numbers. We have achieved  great growth through strong, conservative policies--in our having a  better regulatory environment, in particular. I hope the days of 1- percent growth are behind us, but if we scrap NAFTA, that may not be  the case. An America without NAFTA would be one crippled by subsidies.  [[Page S8029]]    I agree with my colleague from Kansas and the Senate Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry Committee chairman, Senator Roberts. He  recently explained that the withdrawal from NAFTA would add to farmers'  demands for increased farm subsidies at a time when Congress simply  cannot afford that. These farmers would prefer to sell their crops at  reasonable prices, but in our exiting NAFTA, they will certainly ask  for economic protection through increased farm subsidies. I believe  that many of these subsidies are automatically added and that these  subsidies would substantially grow the national debt and dramatically  curtail any ability to rein in government spending.   Without NAFTA, we will likely find ourselves in a less secure  America. The withdrawal from NAFTA will destabilize the Mexican economy  and create a crisis on our southern border. Terminating this agreement  will seriously undercut the important progress that has been made over  the past several decades--that of improving drug enforcement and  stabilizing the Mexican economy. Efforts toward privatization, criminal  justice reform, and modernization have been good for the Mexican  economy. In turn, it has been good for our economy as well.   According to the Department of Homeland Security, the number of  people trying to cross illegally into the United States from Mexico has  fallen to the lowest level in 46 years. That is largely due to there  being a better economy in Mexico. If we pull out of NAFTA and allow  Mexico to plunge into economic chaos and uncertainty, it will,  certainly, drive up the number of those who want to come to the United  States.   These are the real ramifications of terminating NAFTA--an America  with higher unemployment, a lower GDP, more Federal subsidies,  particularly for agriculture, and increased illegal immigration.   All of this--exiting NAFTA--would come before we would face the  ultimate challenge of negotiating a new trade agreement to replace  NAFTA. Anyone who suggests that this process is quick or easy is sadly  mistaken. In today's global economy, people and nations have more  choices than ever.   For evidence of this, look no further than to the disastrous decision  to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Canada and Mexico, like  other TPP nations, could decide to move ahead without the United  States. These countries have more choices than ever. It used to be that  we were the only game in town. That is not the case anymore. These  countries have and will move on without us. They could simply refocus  their efforts on alternative markets and explore new trade partners. It  is a dangerous game when we in America are no longer seen as a reliable  trade partner. We will have countries that will be reluctant to enter  into agreements with us and that will simply not want to renegotiate.   Let's not be swayed by those who would have us believe that the  impact of exiting this trade agreement would somehow be minor or short- lived. There are some who say that we have to exit the agreement in  order to negotiate a better agreement. As I have explained, just  exiting the agreement will have real ramifications--canceled contracts,  particularly for those in agriculture when you are dealing with  commodities. Let's not be misled by those who are under the illusion  that negotiating an entirely new trade agreement, as I have said, will  be simple or painless. It will not be.   In closing, we have seen the limits to the philosophy of ethno- nationalism and economic nationalism. We have seen those limits  politically, gratefully, this week in Alabama. Let's not follow those  who believe in that philosophy or who are advocating an ethnocentric,  or an extreme, nationalistic trade policy. That would be disastrous for  the economy of the United States in its moving forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
