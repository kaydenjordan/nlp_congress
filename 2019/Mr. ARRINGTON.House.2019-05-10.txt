 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Texas  Cowboy Reunion, which was recently inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy  Hall of Fame.   Located in the small west Texas town of Stamford, the Texas Cowboy  Reunion has been preserving the heritage of the American cowboy and the  West for almost 90 years.   Madam Speaker, Texans have always been a resilient people, and what  started as a way for Stamford to lift the spirit of its citizens from  the depths of the Great Depression has developed into what is known as  the world's largest amateur rodeo. To this day, it continues to attract  people from all over to honor the pioneers of the past, through barrel  racing, calf roping, and other timeless cowboy traditions.   Every year, on the Fourth of July, my family and I look forward to  taking in the rodeo festivities and just being back home with friends  and my fellow west Texans.   So congratulations to Matt Mueller and everyone at the Texas Cowboy  Reunion on this well-deserved recognition. I will see them all in July.   God bless, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
