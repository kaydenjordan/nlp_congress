 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anthony  D'Aleo on his recent induction into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.   Anthony, better known as Tony, served in the U.S. Army and later in  [[Page H8510]]  the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam war.   After leaving Active-Duty service, Tony moved to Jacksonville,  Florida, where he lives today and serves as the president of the  Vietnam Veterans of America Local Chapter 1046. Through this leadership  role, Tony has remained active in advocating for his fellow veterans  suffering from service-related illnesses. His continued commitment to  the veterans of Northeast Florida and dedication to the Nation are  unmatched.   I take this opportunity to thank Tony for his continued efforts to  support those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom and salute  his service to this Nation. We owe Tony and veterans like him a debt of  gratitude that we could never repay.                     Honoring the Service of John Leslie     Mr. Speaker, I congratulate retired Navy Commander  John Leslie for his induction into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.   John spent a total of 39 years in active service and civilian service  to the U.S. Navy, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, three  Meritorious Service Medals, seven Strike/Flight Air Medals, two Navy  Commendation Medals, and numerous other service and unit decorations.   He is known by his friends and neighbors as an honorable officer, a  devoted friend, a true patriot, and a loving husband to his wife,  Patricia, who you see pictured here.   John's commitment to supporting those around him has continued into  retirement through his service to his fellow veterans across Northeast  Florida. He now devotes his time to leadership and volunteer roles at  the Mayo Clinic, Community Hospice and Palliative Care, and Veterans  Treatment Court in St. Johns County. John's legacy of dedication  rightfully earned him a spot in the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.   On behalf of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, I thank  Commander Leslie for his devotion to our Nation.       Honoring the Life of St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember St. Johns  County Commissioner Paul Waldron.   Paul was a lifelong resident of St. Johns County and a vibrant member  of the community. Throughout his young life, Paul worked and operated  his family's small business, Harry's Curb Market, before becoming a  respected real estate professional.   Paul applied his experience running a small business to his role as  St. Johns County commissioner through his efforts to support and expand  recreation and tourism development and strengthen our economy.   Throughout his 6 years as commissioner, Paul also became a powerful  advocate for residents in St. Johns County and continued to volunteer  in a variety of capacities throughout the community.   His recent loss is a devastating blow to our community. He will be  remembered as a strong leader, faithful husband, loving father, and  beloved neighbor and friend. I was proud to call him my friend.   On behalf of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, I extend  sincere condolences to Paul's wife, Stephanie, and their two daughters,  Ashley and Kati.                            ____________________
