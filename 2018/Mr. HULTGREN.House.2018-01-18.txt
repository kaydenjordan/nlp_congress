 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), my good friend. I appreciate his work on this and for calling  this Special Order together tonight.   Once again, it is the time of year where I have the somber privilege  to come to the floor and extend happy birthday wishes to Chinese human  rights defender and prisoner of conscience, Zhu Yufu.   What should be an occasion for celebration remains marred by the fact  that, on February 13, Zhu Yufu will spend his 65th birthday in a  Chinese prison. This will mark his seventh consecutive birthday behind  bars, another birthday separated from his family and children.   Although isolated, Zhu is certainly not forgotten. He has been a  fervent champion for human rights in China for decades. He gives voice  to a very fundamental and foundational principle: all people everywhere  should have the basic freedom to determine the course of their lives  and express themselves according to their convictions without fear of  government repression. For living out that conviction, he languishes in  a Chinese prison in poor health and with irregular access to medical  care.   Stifling voices like Zhu's does not silence their cry nor weaken  their cause. On the contrary, it shines a light on their plight and  renews and strengthens the effort to end repression and injustice in  China, as well as in other places around the world.   As long as Zhu Yufu remains incarcerated, I will continue to call  upon the Chinese Government to provide him with sufficient food, care,  and medical attention, and I will continue to call on the Chinese  Government to release Zhu Yufu from prison.   In honor of Zhu Yufu, I would like to read a short poem that he  wrote, and it was this poem that led to his arrest and imprisonment. I  quote from his poem:       It's time, people of China! It's time. The Square belongs to             everyone. With your own two feet, it's time to head to             the Square and make your choice. It's time, people of             China! It's time.      A song belongs to everyone. From your own throat. It's time             to voice the song in your heart. It's time, people of             China! It's time. China belongs to everyone. Of your             own will, it's time to choose what China shall be.    Zhu, you are not forgotten. Happy birthday, and may God grant you the  strength and His presence and the hope that you will celebrate your  next birthday in freedom.
