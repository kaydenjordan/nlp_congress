 Mr. Speaker, before I was elected to  serve in the House of Representatives, I spent nearly 30 years in the  nonprofit healthcare field assisting those facing life-changing  diseases and disabilities with therapists, rehabilitation service  managers, and a licensed nursing home administrator.   I am acutely aware of the challenges many face when it comes to  obtaining reasonably priced healthcare. It is especially critical for  rural America, like much of the 15th Congressional District of  Pennsylvania that I am honored to serve.   As the Member of Congress representing nearly one-third of the land  mass of Pennsylvania, one of the most rural districts east of the  Mississippi, I am keenly aware of the problems that my constituents  face when accessing medical services.   We are facing a healthcare crisis in our Nation's rural areas. These  often disadvantaged populations are still struggling to access  affordable, quality care. Many remain uninsured. Most are underinsured.  However, access to quality care remains the largest challenge.   Even when people gain access to health insurance, it doesn't mean  equal access to care. Rural hospitals across the country are closing,  leaving patients without access to emergency rooms and long-term care  facilities.   In addition to hospital closures, a workforce shortage plagues rural  America. The patient-to-primary care  [[Page H4389]]  physician ratio in rural areas is only 39.8 physicians per 100,000  people compared to 53.3 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas.  Recruitment and retention of experienced professionals, including  primary care physicians, is an ongoing challenge.   Furthermore, the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the Nation has  ravaged our rural communities, leaving even more of the population in  need of crucial health services.   Adolescents and young adults living in rural areas are more  vulnerable to opioid abuse than their urban counterparts. The  prevalence of fatal drug overdoses has skyrocketed in rural areas. High  unemployment and a greater rate of types of injuries that result in  prescriptions for opioid medications have contributed to this.   On March 5, 2010, Congress passed sweeping legislation--the  Affordable Care Act--which fundamentally realigned our Nation's  healthcare system. Since passage of this bill, my worst nightmares have  become a reality, as the law's interpretation continues to drive up  costs, saddle small businesses with burdensome regulations, and impose  unfunded mandates on people throughout the Commonwealth by shifting  costs from the Federal Government to the States.   Unfortunately, what we have also seen since the passage of this law  is the consolidation of providers in the healthcare industry. Small and  independent providers were unable to bear the burden of the ACA's  various mandates, and many of them were forced to merge with larger  health systems that have dramatically consolidated care over the last  decade.   Luckily, Congress has been able to repeal key components of this bill  since it was first enacted, including the individual mandate.  Additionally, as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic that uniquely  strained rural healthcare systems in Pennsylvania and across the  country, we must always look for ways to stabilize and recover from  what has been a turbulent few years. Moving forward, we must provide  commonsense reforms that improve our Nation's healthcare system and  access across the country, including those in rural America.   One of the best ways to do this is by promoting access to telehealth.  As part of the National Telehealth Awareness Week, this week I plan to  reintroduce the HEALTH Act, which allows community health centers and  rural health clinics to continue to provide telehealth services and  receive fair reimbursement for doing so. It is these types of policies  that promote access to care for all Americans, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to fix our flawed healthcare system.   Currently, healthcare costs have gone up, premiums have increased by  double digits, but choices have decreased. That is not right. It is not  fair, and it is not feasible. There must be a better way, and I know  that together we will work to find a stable transition to a 21st  century healthcare system that works for everyone in America,  particularly those who live in rural regions where the need is great  and services are scarce.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Karen L. Krisch of Centre County for being named the 2023 National  Distinguished Principal of the Year.   An educator for 29 years, Principal Krisch has served in her current  role as principal at Marion-Walker Elementary School in the Bellefonte  Area School District since 2017. Previously, she was principal at  Bellefonte Area Elementary School, principal and vice principal at the  Bellefonte Area Middle School, and an assistant administrator for the  Bald Eagle Area School District. She also taught vocational education  at the secondary level for 6 years, specifically to high-poverty  students.   Principal Krisch encourages the staff and teachers at her school to  expand opportunities for students resulting in excellent representation  at the annual reading competition, participation in Bellefonte READS,  and raising nearly $10,000 per year for the Four Diamond Fund through  the school's minithon.   Outside of the classroom, Karen participates in a polar plunge each  year to raise funds for the YMCA antihunger program and she is a  Pennsylvania Master Naturalist volunteering frequently for conservation  and State park programs.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Principal Krisch on this tremendous  achievement.                            ____________________
