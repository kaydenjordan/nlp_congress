 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Secretary DeVos' new borrower defense rule drastically changes the  existing 2016 rule making it harder for students to get the relief that  they deserve. Only 3 percent of students are projected to even benefit  from this new provision.   Students should be focused on getting the quality education they were  promised, not worrying about being saddled with large debts from  schools that could not and did not deliver on that education promise.   The Secretary's rule takes the burden of repayment away from the  fraudulent institutions and places it on the back of the taxpayer.  Americans should not be responsible for the dishonest actions of a  predatory school.   I thank Congresswoman Lee for introducing H.J. Res. 76, an important  step in protecting our students and holding fraudulent institutions  accountable.
