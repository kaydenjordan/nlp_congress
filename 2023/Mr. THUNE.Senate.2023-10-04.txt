 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the specter of heavyhanded government  regulation of the internet reared its ugly head once again last week  with the Federal Communications Commission's announcement that it will  consider a so-called net neutrality proposal at its October meeting  coming up later this month.   So what is net neutrality? Well, at its most basic level, it is  simply the idea that internet service providers shouldn't prioritize or  block certain internet traffic at the expense of others. Understood in  that way, it is a concept that enjoys broad support in both parties.  But that is not what we are talking about with the Biden FCC's net  neutrality proposal. Like the Obama FCC before it, the Biden FCC wants  to assert broad new government powers over the internet using rules-- get this--that were designed for telephone companies and monopolies  back during the Great Depression.   This is a quote from FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel last week:         Today, there is no expert agency ensuring that the internet       is fast, open and fair.    Proving once again that Democrats' faith in Washington experts is  undying and that nothing scares a Democrat more than the thought of  some aspect of society not being regulated by the Federal Government.   This is not the first time Democrats have sounded the alarm about the  perils that await us if we don't let the Government regulate the  internet with a heavy hand. In fact, back in 2015, the Obama FCC  actually implemented the regulatory regime the Biden FCC is now  considering imposing again. This opened the door to a whole new host of  new internet regulations including--including--price regulations.   Unsurprisingly, broadband investment declined as a result. That was a  problem for Americans generally who benefit when the United States is  at the forefront of internet growth and expansion, and it was  particularly bad news for Americans in rural States like my State of  South Dakota.   Getting broadband to rural communities is already more challenging  than installing broadband in cities or suburbs, and the possibility of  heavier regulations act as a further disincentive to expanding  business. No big surprise there.   Fast forward to 2017, and the FCC under Chairman Pai voted to  repeal--repeal--the heavyhanded internet regulations passed by the  Obama FCC. The prospect of this repeal was greeted with near hysteria  from Democrats. We were told that internet traffic would slow to a  crawl, that innovation would be stifled, that our freedom of speech was  threatened, and more. And in the wake of the repeal, none of the things  that Democrats predicted came to pass. The internet as we know it not  only survived, it thrived. Innovation flourished, the internet remained  a vehicle for free and open discourse. And internet speeds not only  didn't slow down, they got faster and faster.   During the pandemic, despite the explosive growth of internet usage,  American networks had no problem keeping up with demand, delivering the  reliable service that Americans have come to expect. Now contrast that  with Europe--where internet regulation is much more heavyhanded--where  they struggle to deal with increased internet usage. In fact, European  service providers slowed internet speeds to maintain connectivity  throughout the course of the pandemic. The United States is now a  leader in adopting next-generation telecommunications services like 5G  and advanced Wi-Fi, while Europe struggles to keep pace. But that may  not last if the Biden FCC goes ahead with its net neutrality plans.   As I said, the last time a Democrat-led FCC put heavyhanded internet  regulations in place, broadband investment declined. There is a good  reason to believe that the same thing would happen this time. There is  also substantial reason to be concerned that the Biden FCC's proposed  regulatory regime would result in higher internet bills for Americans.   As FCC Commissioner Carr, a Republican appointee who opposes the  Democrats' proposal, recently pointed out:         Since 2017, the prices Americans pay for Internet services       have decreased on an inflation-adjusted basis. Meanwhile, the       prices for utility-regulated services like electricity,       water, and gas have increased over two times faster than the       prices for Internet services. Monopoly regulations invariably       lead to monopoly prices. In addition, Title II regulation       opens the door to regulators adding new taxes and fees to       consumers' monthly broadband bills.    That is from Brendan Carr's statement.   In addition to higher prices for consumers and decreased broadband  investment, another consequence of the Biden's FCC's proposed new  regulatory regime would be government interference in internet traffic.  Ironically, given Democrats' professed concerns, it is precisely the  net neutrality regime they are calling for that could imperil the free  and open internet they claim to want.  [[Page S4924]]    Under the regulatory regime the Biden FCC wants to impose, the  Federal Government would be allowed to block or prioritize internet  traffic or otherwise interfere with the free flow of information. Think  about that one.   Given, I would add, the Biden administration's demonstrated  willingness to use its regulatory power to advance its social and  environmental agenda, it is not hard to imagine the Biden  administration using this proposed new regulatory power to shape  Americans' internet experience for its own ends.   The Biden FCC should be focused on addressing real challenges such as  continuing our efforts to close the digital divide and ensuring that  every American has access to high-speed broadband; it should not be  wasting time and money advancing a solution to a problem that does not  exist.   Thanks, in substantial part, to the light-touch regulatory regime  currently in place, the internet in the United States is thriving and  bringing new benefits to American families and businesses. And if  Democrats really want a free and open internet and to keep the United  States at the forefront of broadband development, they will oppose the  Biden FCC's heavyhanded power grab.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Missouri (Mr. Hawley) and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.  Scott).   Further, if present and voting: the Senator from Missouri (Mr.  Hawley) would have voted ``nay.''
