 Madam Speaker, in the next few days, we are going to be  asked to take another step on our journey to securing our border.   The Congress has to take this very seriously because we have tens of  thousands of people dying every year from drug overdoses with a lot of  those drugs crossing our southern border. Just a few weeks ago we  seized hundreds of pounds of fentanyl, a drug that can kill millions of  people and, in fact, has taken tens of thousands of lives.   We know our border is unsecured. We have to do whatever we can to  give the President and the Department of Homeland Security the ability  to protect our southern border.                            ____________________
