 Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present,  I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 586.                             Peronal Explanation     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of  the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida.   Named after its first director, who ran the hospital for 30 years,  the Malcom Randall VA Center first opened its doors to our Nation's  veterans on October 22, 1967. Since then, it has grown from its  original staff of 500 to be the centerpiece of our Nation's largest  veterans health delivery system.   Today, the Malcom Randall VA Center serves over 140,000 veterans a  year, consists of 14 hospitals and clinics, and acts as a teaching  hospital in conjunction with the University of Florida medical school  and other affiliates.   The services Malcom Randall VA provides to our veterans cannot be  overstated, and I am proud to know that this institution is in my  hometown.   Once again, congratulations to them for reaching this milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Zeldin and  I appreciate him using that word ``learned.'' It feels good.   You know, this is an interesting thing, because I was there during  the time that John Kerry and the President were negotiating this deal.   Keep in mind, this is a deal that John Kerry and the President agreed  to, but nobody signed. We didn't sign it, our Senate never voted on it,  and Iran didn't sign it. So this is a deal in paper only that nobody  has signed. If you  [[Page H8214]]  were to do any business transaction in the real world, this piece of  paper would be worthless.   I want to mention words of one of our previous Presidents. It has  been about 60 years after President Dwight Eisenhower announced that  Atoms for Peace Program, and one lesson is clear: ``Civilian nuclear  programs flourish only through cooperation and openness. Secrecy and  isolation typically are signs of a nuclear weapons program.''   So here we are. I have in front of me the Institute for Science and  International Security, August 31, 2017, and in the introduction, it  says: ``One of the most serious compliance issues concerns the IAEA's  access to military sites and credible verification of Section T, which  prohibits key nuclear weapons development activities and controls dual- use equipment potentially usable in such activities. In this report,  the issue of verifying Section T is discussed. The absence of credible  implementation and verification of Section T undermines the  effectiveness of the JCPOA.''   My colleague, Mr. Zeldin, brought up that we know they are using IR-6  and IR-8 centrifuges. We know they have the carbon fibers that they are  not supposed to have. We also know that they have overproduced heavy  water more than two times. The first time, we bought it at the American  taxpayers' expense. The other two times, it has gone to Russia. The  only reason you would have an excess of heavy water is if you are  producing nuclear fissile material.   In addition to that, the heavy water--the inspections that we are  supposed to do anytime, anywhere,--John Kerry said this over and over-- anytime, anywhere, that we can go, and if they are noncompliant, the  sanctions will snap back. They must have used an overstretched rubber  band because nothing has ever snapped back.   With the IAEA supposedly being able to inspect anywhere, there are so  many places that are off limits. It is only those areas that Iran says  that we can go in and inspect. Parchin military site is a place that we  know they detonated a nuclear trigger. We have not been able to go in  there and check the soil, Yet we have to accept their word that they  are checking the soil.   I brought this up in the committee, and I am going to repeat it here.  It would be like having a drug addict testing his own urine sample and  taking it to the lab. It is just not the way to do business in the 21st  century on something that is so important.   During that time, when we negotiated or when the deal was being  negotiated, there was an intelligence report--I don't know if you were  in the Congress then, but there was an intelligence report that had  always had Iran as a state sponsor of terror. The year this deal was  done, state sponsor of terror was taken off. And when we questioned  about it, they said it was an oversight. This deal just stinks from the  beginning.   John Kerry said: No deal is better than a bad deal.   This is a bad deal. The President should decertify it. It does not  take us out of the deal, but it allows us to put the pressure back on  Iran so that they are fully compliant with the letter of the law.   If we don't hold up people to the letter of the law as we move  forward in future negotiations, i.e., North Korea, why should they  follow the letter of the law?   So this is high time that we do this. I appreciate it, and I thank  the gentleman for doing this.
