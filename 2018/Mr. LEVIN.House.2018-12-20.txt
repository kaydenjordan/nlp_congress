 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal, and I salute his eloquent  statement. I hope everybody listens.   Usually, legislation has either rhyme or reason, or both. This bill  has neither. It is dramatically unreasonable. It adds insult to injury.  It would further increase our growing Federal debt, this time by almost  $100 billion.   Driven by the irresponsible 2017 tax law, our projected annual  deficit has already more than doubled since President Trump came into  office, more than doubled; mainly to benefit, as Mr. Neal has spelled  out so well, the very wealthy.   The majority thought the first tax bill of theirs would at least be  helpful politically. It turned out, for voters, sour music. It was, as  described earlier, hyper-partnership at its worst; no hearings. Nothing  like it.   So, on this last day of votes this session, and close to my last of  thousands and thousands of votes over 36 years, I will proudly vote  ``no.''
