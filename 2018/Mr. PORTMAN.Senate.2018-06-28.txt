 Mr. President, I wish to honor George C. Williams and  the crew of the 42-299-28 B-17 Flying Fortress that was shot down over  Normandy, France, during WWII 75 years ago on July 4, 1943.   George C. Williams, bombardier from Warren, Trumbull County, OH, was  killed in action. While assisting the nose gunner, his chute  accidentally opened inside the aircraft. Pilot Olof Ballinger offered  up his own parachute, but George refused. It is believed that he  attempted to fly the plane after all the crew had evacuated.   Pilot Olof Maximilian Ballinger, of Newton Falls, Trumbull County,  OH, evaded capture and walked alone, with no compass, over the Pyrenees  Mountains. He reached safety in Spain in November 1943 and returned to  the U.S. He eventually moved to California.   Harry W. Basucher, Jr., of Cincinnati, OH, was killed in action  inside the plane by enemy cannon fire.   Copilot John Marshall Carrah, from Chico, CA, evaded capture and  escaped to Switzerland and then to Spain and returned to the U.S. in  March 1944 and continued to assist in the war effort. He was a career  U.S. Air Force officer retiring as a lieutenant colonel.   Byron J. Gronstall, from Van Nuys, CA, who evacuated the plane, was  captured by a German patrol. He was a prisoner of war at Stalag 7A.   William C. Howell, from Goldsboro, NC, who evaded capture, was  seriously wounded.   Francis E. Owens, of Pittsburgh, PA, evaded capture but died of  exposure in the Pyrenees Mountains while trying to assist other crewmen  through the dangerous passage. He was awarded the Soldier's Medal for  bravely dragging wounded men out of harm's way.   John K. Lane, a radio operator from Deland, FL, was captured and was  a prisoner of war at Stalag 7A and 17B. Francis E. Owens found John K.  Lane unconscious and dragged him the length of the plane before  attaching a parachute and pulling the ripcord while assisting him out  of the aircraft.   Paul McConnell, the navigator from Montgomery, AL, evaded capture.   Albert Wackerman, from Salinas, CA, was killed in action by enemy  fire aboard the B-17.   A documentary was created about these 10 brave American aviators and  will be featured at an event in Warren, OH, on July 2, 2018, at the  Samuel E. Lanza Veterans Resource Center.   The son of copilot John M. Carrah, who has done extensive research,  heard first-person accounts from his father, and assisted in filming  the documentary, will speak after the documentary viewing. This event  is sponsored by the Tribune Chronicle with assistance from Warren city  councilman John Brown.   The bravery of the crew of the 42-299-28 B-17 Flying Fortress was  indicative of so many of their generation who risked life and limb to  liberate Europe from an evil unlike anything our country and allies had  ever faced.   We can never repay them for their service and sacrifice, but this  United States Congress and our Nation are forever grateful for their  actions and the actions of so many others like them.                            ____________________
