 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Monday is Memorial Day. It is the day our  Nation pauses to remember all those who laid down their lives in  defense of our country, from Saratoga to Yorktown, to Iraq and  Afghanistan.   We enjoy tremendous freedoms as Americans, tremendous privileges, but  we do not enjoy these privileges by chance. They are hard-fought gains  secured for us again and again by each new generation of American  soldiers who lay down their lives in the cause of the free. It is  important that we do not take what they have secured for us lightly,  that we remember our freedoms have been paid for in blood.   Near the end of the film ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the dying Captain  Miller tells Private Ryan of the sacrifice that has been made on his  behalf. He says: ``Earn this . . . earn it.''   I am not sure we can ever fully earn the gift that has been given to  us by those who have laid down their lives in our defense, but we can  attempt to live lives worthy of their sacrifice and to defend the cause  for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.   When we remember the fallen on Memorial Day, there is one other group  we should remember, and that is their families. Our Nation's Gold Star  families may not have laid down their own lives for our country, but  they gave their loved ones, their fathers and brothers, daughters and  sisters. For the sake of our freedoms, they live with empty spaces at  Thanksgivings and birthdays, at weddings and graduations, at their  dinner tables and Little League practices. We owe them a debt also that  we can never repay.   I have been privileged to visit more than one veterans cemetery, such  as our own Black Hills National Cemetery in South Dakota--which we  recently expanded to ensure that our soldiers will have a resting place  for generations to come--Arlington National Cemetery, and the American  Cemetery at Normandy. There is a special hallowedness to the ground at  these places. Valor and sacrifice still linger in the air, and a deep  peace abounds--the peace of the warrior who has fought the good fight  and found rest from his labors.   General George S. Patton once said:         It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather,       we should thank God that such men lived.    I might disagree with General Patton on the first part, as it is  right and proper that we should mourn our dead, but with General  Patton, I say: Let us thank God that such men and women lived.   May the memory of our honored dead be eternal.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis) would have voted ``yea.''
