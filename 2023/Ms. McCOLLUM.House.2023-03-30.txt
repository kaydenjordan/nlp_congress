 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1.   While the majority claims this bill would lower America's energy  costs, this bill would directly result in policies that would add to  the deficit and incur billions of dollars in environmental costs.   This bill puts polluters over people by putting taxpayers on the hook  for environmental cleanup of our public lands. Public lands are just  that: They are public. They belong to the people, not to major  corporations, not to foreign-owned mining companies who would ship  mined materials over to China for smelting, or to be sold on the global  market. How does that protect our national security?   Let me be clear: We need to reform the permitting process to  guarantee our transition to a clean, green energy economy. When it  comes to leasing our public lands, local communities and Tribal Nations  need to be front and center, not oil, gas, and mining interests.   When companies pollute, they need to be held responsible for the  cleanup, not the American taxpayer. I support people over politics.  H.R. 1 should be rejected.                            ____________________
