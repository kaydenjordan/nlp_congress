 Would the Senator accept a question?    Madam President, just for the reference of everyone,  I believe the majority leader is going to come in for his closing  script. When he does, that will end whatever little colloquy we will  have had here, and I will then do my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech.   In the time that it takes the majority leader to get here, I am  interested in hearing the Senator from Maryland say that the White  House--our White House--the President of the United States--is a  massive roadblock to protecting the integrity of our upcoming election  from foreign interference. How does that make sense? Why would it be an  American President who doesn't want to defend the integrity of an  American election from foreign interference?    He did say it very strongly.    Yes.   In fact, even the Mueller report showed that there was considerable  Russian activity and support in the election that made Donald Trump our  President. They couldn't prove an ongoing conspiracy between the Trump  campaign and the Russian election interference effort, but they  confirmed that there was a Russian election interference effort. If I  recall correctly, they confirmed that the Trump campaign was witting of  it, just not conspiring with it, just not directly engaged with it.   So I don't know. Perhaps it is just the hope that, perhaps, he will  get elected again with foreign interference and that he doesn't want to  close off that option, but it is a little bit odd for the President of  the United States not to take the protecting of the security of the  American election more seriously.    I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Maryland  on this, and I wish him success with his legislation.    Madam President, I come to again raise an alarm about  the massive carbon pollution that we are dumping into our natural world  and to tell the stories of two ocean creatures that are suffering from  that pollution. Now, we may mock or ignore these creatures--these  lesser creatures so far down the food chain from us--but we are fools  to ignore the message of what is happening to them.   Matthew 25:41 admonishes, ``as you did it to one of the least of  these . . . you did it to me.'' So we ought not mock and ignore these  lesser species because they also have a lesson for us, a warning. If we  keep up what we are doing to them, it will soon enough be we who  suffer. As Pope Francis warned: Slap Mother Nature, and she will slap  you back.   Let's start, before we get to the two species, with an overview.   First, it is not just these two species. Science writer Elizabeth  Kolbert has warned that we have entered a sixth great extinction--the  first and only great extinction in humans' time on the planet--and that  this great extinction is driven by manmade pollution and climate  change. Scientists from around the globe have just issued one of the  most comprehensive reports ever on Earth's biodiversity, and the head  of that panel, Sir Robert Watson, summarized its findings this way.   I quote him here:         The overwhelming evidence . . . presents an ominous       picture. The health of ecosystems on which we and all other       species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We       are eroding the very foundations of our economies,       livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life       worldwide.    The legendary David Attenborough warns that we face what he calls  ``irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our  societies.''   He says: ``It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is  that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we  could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of  our societies.''   In all of this, we need to remember our oceans. Oceans are warming  and acidifying and literally suffocating ocean species as oxygen dead  zones expand. Earth's oceans warm at the rate of multiple Hiroshima  explosions' worth of heat per second--per second. They acidify at the  fastest rate in at least 50 million years. They are also fouled with  our plastic garbage and polluted by runoff from farming and stormwater.  Our oceans' warnings are loud and clear and measurable. They are  chronicled by fishermen and sailors and measured with thermometers,  tide gauges, and simple pH tests that measure acidification.   It is this acidification that takes me to these two species. The  oceans are absorbing around 30 percent of our excess carbon dioxide  emissions, and they do that in a chemical interaction that takes up the  CO2 but acidifies the seawater. Don't pretend there is any  dispute about this. Acidification is a chemical phenomenon. You can  demonstrate it in a middle school science lab. You can demonstrate it  with your breath, an aquarium bubbler, a glass of water, and a pH  strip. In fact, I have done so right at this desk.   Here is the first species pictured--the tiny pteropod. It is an  oceanic snail about the size of a small pea. It is known as the sea  butterfly because it has adapted two butterflylike wings that can  propel it around in the ocean.   Acidifying waters make it harder for pteropods and a lot of other  shelled creatures to grow their shells and develop from juveniles to  adults. Researchers in the Pacific Northwest have reported what they  called ``severe shell damage'' on more than half of the pteropods they  collected from Central California to the Canadian border.   These images show the pteropod's shell when the creature's underwater  environment becomes more acidic--not good for pteropods. Maintaining  their shells against that acidity requires energy--energy that would  otherwise go into growth or reproduction. So acidification makes it  harder for species, such as the pteropods and other shell creatures at  the base of the oceanic food chain, to survive.   Who cares? Who cares about the lowly, humble pteropod? Who cares  about some stupid ocean snail? Well, for one, salmon do. Half the diet  of some salmon species in the Pacific is pteropods. Salmon fisheries  support coastal jobs and economies across our Pacific Northwest.  Offshore fishing in the United States is a multibillion dollar industry  connected to hundreds of thousands of livelihoods. If you care about  our fisheries industry, you should care about the humble pteropod. An  entire food chain stands on its tiny back, and we are in that food  chain.   Move up the food chain a little, and you find another creature facing  peril from acidification--the Dungeness crab. You see this crustacean  on ice in your local fish market. It is an important commercial catch  along our west coast. In 2014, the last year the Pacific States Marine  Fisheries Commission did a comprehensive report, the Dungeness catch  was worth $170 million. It is Oregon's most valuable fishery, and it is  important also for Washington State and for California, where annual  landings run between $40 and $95 million. Up north, in 2017, Alaska's  commercial landings of Dungeness crabs totaled more than 2.1 million  pounds.   Last month, marine scientists reported that acidified oceans are  dissolving the delicate shells of Dungeness crab larvae. The acidic  environment is not just damaging the shells but also damaging the  larvae's mechanoreceptors, the hairlike sensory organs that crabs use  to hear and feel and make their way around the sea. The damage to the  crabs is bad news, but worse is that we are seeing it now. Scientists  thought hardy Dungeness crabs wouldn't be affected by acidification for  decades. Richard Feely, senior NOAA scientist and coauthor of the  study, reports that these ``dissolution  [[Page S1142]]  impacts to the crab larvae . . . were not expected to occur until much  later in this century.''   The sentinel implications for the entire ecosystem are grave. If the  Dungeness are feeling the effects of ocean acidification now, what  other creatures are feeling those effects too? Another lead author of  this study said: ``If the crabs are affected already, we really need to  make sure we start to pay much more attention to various components of  the food chain before it is too late.''   These concerns about the Dungeness crab and its happening too soon  echo what scientists actually said of early findings about the  pteropod. Oceanographer William Peterson, who is the coauthor of an  early study on the pteropod, said: ``We did not expect to see pteropods  being affected to this extent in our coastal region for several  decades.''   So we are way ahead of schedule in terms of what scientists have  predicted for ocean acidification outcomes for these foundational  creatures in our ocean ecosystem. Together, the pteropod and  the Dungeness crab send a common message, one echoed by a Rhode Island  fishing boat captain who told me: ``Sheldon, things are getting weird  out there.''    And they are getting weird faster than expected. The rapid ocean  acidification that we are measuring now and that we are causing now  with further carbon pollution is nearly unprecedented in the geological  record. Scientists look back to try to find historical analogs for what  is happening. The closest historical analogs scientists can find for  what they are seeing now in the oceans go back before humankind. There  is no analog in human time. You have to go back before humans existed,  back into the prehistoric record, back to the prehistoric great  extinctions, back when marine species were wiped out and ocean  ecosystems took millions of years to recover. That is the historical  analog that best matches our current direction.   In his encyclical ``Laudato Si,'' Pope Francis, who is a trained  scientist himself, reflected on what he called ``the mysterious network  of relations between things'' in life. In that mysterious network of  relations between things, the pteropod and the crab larva give their  lives to transmit food energy from the microscopic plants they eat,  which would be of no use to us, up to the fish that consume the  pteropod and larva--fish, which we, in turn, consume--all in that great  mysterious network of relations between things.   What is happening to these two species is more than just an event. It  is a signal. It is a signal of a looming global ecological catastrophe.  Lesser species, species that we may mock or ignore, can sometimes be  sentinels for humans, like the legendary canaries taken down into coal  mines. When the sentinels start to die, it is wise to pay attention.   What happens when, in our arrogance and pride, we refuse to heed the  warnings from creatures so humble as the pteropods or crab larvae?  Well, remember why Jesus was so angry with the Pharisees. What was  their sin? Their arrogance and their pride blinded them to the truth.  The Senate, this supposedly greatest deliberative body, has blinded  itself to the devastation fossil fuels are unleashing on our Earth's  mysterious network. We careen recklessly into the next great  extinction.   Pope Francis says:         Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give       glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their       message to us. We have no such right.    Indeed, we have no such right.   So I come here today to challenge us to see the damage we have done-- the damage we are doing now, today, to this mysterious network of life,  this mysterious God-given network of life that supports us. I challenge  us also to turn away from dark forces of corruption and greed-- specifically, the fossil fuel industry forces that have deliberately,  on purpose, crippled our ability in Congress to stop their pollution.   I close by challenging us to heed the message of the humble creatures  sharing this planet with us--the least of us, who share God's creation.  They suffer at our hands, and in their suffering they send us a  message, a warning, that we would do well to hear.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
