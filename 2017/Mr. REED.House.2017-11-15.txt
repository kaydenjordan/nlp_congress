 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his hard work  in putting this bill together.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been in the process for over 7 years in  regards to the time I spent on the committee. There have been multiple  hearings on the issue of tax reform, well over 40-plus. There have been  hours upon hours of debate.   There were efforts done by our former chairman, Dave Camp. I know my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have recognized, during our  committee markup process, the hard work that Chairman Camp did with  rewriting the entire Code from the bottom up.    These issues have been out there for the American people and for the  people from across the country to look at, to digest. Now is the time  to rise in support of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, because what we  have before you is a new Tax Code for the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, we have a Tax Code that is going to, for once in 31  years, put our corporations on the multinational level across the world  in a competitive position by lowering the rates and getting to a 21st  century taxing program on a territorial basis.   Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we deliver tax relief. I know the  folks on the other side aren't going to agree with this because they  are going to say this is a Tax Code for the rich, this is a Tax Code,  tax reform for the rich and the almighty 1 percent.   But, Mr. Speaker, I have done the math. I have looked at this bill  inside and out, and it delivers a simplified Code where $1,600 is left  in the pockets of my constituents in western New York. That is $1,600  that they earned that the government won't have to take from them  anymore; $1,600, Mr. Speaker, that will allow them, as senior citizens,  to go visit their grandkids in the South because New York State has  driven them out of New York State with its high tax policies at the  State capital. That is $1,600 that maybe they can go on a trip with  their family and experience a little relaxation because of the hard  work that generated those moneys and those dollars in their pockets.   Mr. Speaker, these are the people whom we represent, the Perrys. Mr.  and Mrs. Perry are hardworking people of western New York, and those  are their two beautiful children. What this is going to allow them to  do is get a little bit more of their money kept in their pocket so they  can spend a little bit more time with their kids and enjoy the fruits  of their labor.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side advocate because  there is another issue with tax reform that I want to highlight real  quick.   The easy approach of government is to spend more money, develop more  programs, and maybe give a little bit in regards to a government  welfare check. But what this Tax Code and reform does is deliver a job  opportunity for these people, and I don't know a better program in  America that serves more people than an honest day's work and an honest  paycheck and an honest job, and that is what this Tax Code will do.
