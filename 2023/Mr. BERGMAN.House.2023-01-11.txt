 Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of the most  vulnerable population, the unborn.   As we consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and  the concurrent resolution to condemn attacks on pro-life pregnancy  centers, I hope that it is those innocent lives on our hearts and  minds.   I implore my colleagues to stand with me in pursuit of doing what is  [[Page H166]]  right by, as I say, those voiceless and vulnerable and to consider the  divine worth of every human life that we have taken an oath to serve,  from womb to tomb.   It is written in Psalm 139: ``For You created my innermost being; You  knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am  fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that  full well.''   We should do all in our power to stand for life and to ensure that  the unborn get to live out each of the days that God ordained for them  before one ever came to be.   Let us unite as a legislature to determine that, in the United  States, we will preserve the most basic right to life and the ability  of good-willed Americans to provide life-affirming care in pursuit of  that cause.                            ____________________
