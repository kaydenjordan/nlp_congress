 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th  anniversary of the Utica Observer-Dispatch. Founded in 1817, the Utica  OD was one of only 421 papers in the country, and the fifth newspaper  founded in New York State.   For the past 200 years, the Utica OD has kept our region informed  through quality reporting on important issues impacting our local  community.   As an unwavering member of the fourth estate, the Utica Observer- Dispatch had a leading role in exposing the inner workings of our once  organized crime-influenced city. For this dedicated service on this  very issue, and its campaign for justice against corruption, the Utica  Observer-Dispatch was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959.   I commend the Utica OD for its 200 years of steadfast reporting, and  I encourage the Observer-Dispatch and its committed members of the  fourth estate to continue with its stated mission, to keep our citizens  informed through impartial investigative reporting.   Also, on a personal note, when I was a teenager, I actually delivered  the Utica Observer-Dispatch, and it was an honor to do it and a small  way for me to start off my earning a living.   So I just want to thank the Utica OD and congratulate them again on  200 years.                            ____________________
