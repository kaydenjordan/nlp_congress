 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Marny  Xiong, the chairwoman of the Saint Paul Public Schools Board of  Education, who passed away from COVID-19 on June 7 at the age of 31. We  mourn the loss of this young woman, a rising star whose legacy was an  inspiration to us all.   Marny was a trailblazing activist and a proud member of Saint Paul's  Hmong community. She was a dedicated advocate for young people, and she  stood up for equality and racial justice. She understood the  disparities that students of color face in our State, and she worked to  make sure that every child had an opportunity to succeed.   As chairwoman of the board, her leadership was critical to  successfully resolving the district's first ever teachers' strike. When  confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, Marny helped to steer the  district's unprecedented transition to distance learning for 37,000  students.  [[Page H2581]]    It is heartbreaking that this pandemic has taken one of our  community's rising leaders.   Madam Speaker, please join me in extending condolences to Marny's  parents, her seven siblings, her extended family, and her friends at  this time of great grief.                            ____________________
