 Mr. President, I rise today to salute Robert  ``Bob'' Sculley for his many years of dedicated service at the New  Hampshire Motor Transport Association, NHMTA. Bob is retiring from his  longtime role as president and CEO of an association that represents  multiple occupations and hundreds of members across the Granite State,  and he leaves a legacy worthy of our praise and our gratitude.   Bob draws on decades of experience and in-depth knowledge in his  advocacy for the motor transport industry. After earning a bachelor of  science from the University of Rhode Island in 1977, Bob started a  career with Federal Express that brought him around New England to  posts in Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, and New  Hampshire. His quick rise in the ranks--from his first role as courier  to his last as station manager--is a reflection of his work ethic, his  sound judgment, and his eagerness to learn the nuts and bolts of an  industry that is vital to our American way of life.   When he was hired as the president and CEO of the New Hampshire Motor  Transport Association in 1989, Bob assumed leadership of an  organization with 110 members and 2 employees. He was responsible for  growing the trade association and enriching the programs and services  that it provides to its members. In addition to increasing membership  among New Hampshire truck owners and operators, Bob also entered into  agreements to represent the interests of the Energy Marketers  Association of New Hampshire and the Vermont Truck and Bus Association  under the NHMTA umbrella. Thirteen employees now provide advocacy and  services within an association that boasts a combined membership of  approximately 700 members. Each employee and each member of NHMTA knows  Bob Sculley as a knowledgeable resource, a skilled advocate, and a good  and generous man.   Throughout his tenure as president and CEO, Bob established programs  that simplified operations and offered a variety of benefits to  members. He kept truck owners and operators aware of government  regulations, and he created a drug and alcohol testing consortium and  clearinghouse compliance program to ensure drivers meet Federal and  State requirements. He moved NHMTA to a new 10,000-square-foot facility  in Concord, NH--named the Robert J. Sculley Building in his honor--that  offers ample workspace for staff and in-house training opportunities  for members. He launched a self-insured workers compensation fund that  comprises nearly 100 small businesses, improves the safety of their  operations, and ensures prompt care for employees who need it. The  program is administered at NHMTA's Concord facility and has returned  more than $19 million in dividends to members. He started a voluntary  dental program that pools purchasing power to allow small businesses to  access volume discounts not otherwise available to them. Bob's  achievements over the years have reinforced an industry that plays a  pivotal role in our regional and national economy.   I have known Bob for decades. As State senator, Governor of New  Hampshire, and now U.S. Senator, I have crossed paths with him at many  meetings and events around the State. I always welcome his perspective  and advice on ways we can strengthen the motor transport and energy  industries.  [[Page S5255]]  His wisdom was essential to these industries as they navigated the  challenges of a global pandemic and felt the effects of a strained  supply chain. We relied on this essential workforce just as these  indispensable truck owners, operators, and energy providers relied on  Bob for his advocacy and guidance through tough times.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Robert Sculley for his years of  service and advocacy. We wish him and his beloved family--wife Theresa  as well as their many children and grandchildren--all the best in this  new chapter of their lives.                            ____________________
