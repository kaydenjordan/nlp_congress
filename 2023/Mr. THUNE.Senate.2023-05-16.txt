 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, talks on the debt ceiling continue, and the  Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate are meeting  with President Biden again today. I hope that is a positive sign  because, if the President's Treasury Secretary is correct, we could be  2 weeks away from the United States beginning to default on its debts,  something that would have very serious consequences for our economy and  for our Nation's financial standing.   If we are going to get a debt limit increase, the President is going  to have to negotiate with Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans-- really negotiate, Mr. President--which means that President Biden is  going to have to accept some real spending reforms because, otherwise,  a debt limit increase is not going to make it through the House of  Representatives. Those are the just the facts.   Democrats, of course, have been kicking and screaming at the idea of  spending reforms. You can witness their frantic campaign to portray the  responsible reforms in the House Republicans' bill as extreme.  Apparently, suggesting that we should return to 2022 discretionary  spending levels for 2024 is an extreme position, despite the fact that  we were clearly doing just fine at those levels mere months ago.   The Senate Democratic leader came down to the floor last Thursday and  suggested the Republicans were attempting to pair a debt ceiling  increase with ``unrelated partisan priorities''--``unrelated partisan  priorities.'' Well, let that just sink in for a minute because,  according to the Senate Democratic leader, spending reform is a  partisan priority that has nothing to do with increasing our Nation's  credit card limit. If a discussion over increasing our Nation's credit  card limit isn't a good time to have a discussion about spending, I  don't know what is. And if spending reform is just a Republican  priority, then there is something seriously wrong with the Democratic  Party because, with a national debt like ours, spending reform should  be a priority for everyone.   Our national debt currently stands at more than $31 trillion--$31  trillion. Our debt has already exceeded the size of our economy. Within  a few short years, we are going to be spending more just meeting the  interest on our Nation's debt than we will on national defense.   How do Democrats not realize that a national debt of that size has  serious consequences? By 2044, we will be spending more on interest  than on Medicare. By 2050, we will be spending more on interest than  Social Security. That is barely going to leave enough money for the  government to meet its most basic obligations, much less invest in all  the new or expanded government programs Democrats would like to  implement.   Yet Democrats are apparently content to simply ignore this reality.  It is like they think that we are going to find a pot of gold at the  end of the rainbow to rescue us once we have spent the Federal  Government into the ground. But there is no magic pot of gold.   And before Democrats suggest it, let me just say that taxing the rich  will not provide enough money to dig us out of the hole that we are in.  We have to find a way to rein in Federal spending; otherwise, the size  of our national debt is going to crush our economy and seriously limit  the Federal Government's ability to meet even its most basic  responsibilities, like funding Social Security and national defense.   Democrats would like Americans to believe that the ``clean'' debt  limit bill they are calling for is the standard when it comes to  raising our Nation's credit card limit; but, in fact, that is very far  from being the case, as the Democratic leader should know from his own  experience in using the debt limit as leverage in negotiations.   As Democrats should be well aware, 7 of the last 10 debt limit  increases have included some mix of policy or budgetary changes rather  than just a clean increase, and, historically, spending reform has  frequently gone hand in hand with debt ceiling legislation. Indeed, one  expert recently noted in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee  that ``of the eight largest deficit-reduction laws since 1985, all  eight were attached to debt limit bills.''   Let me repeat that. And this is from an expert who recently provided  testimony before the Senate Budget Committee. This was his quote.         Of the eight largest deficit-reduction laws since 1985, all       eight were attached to debt limit bills.    Now, Mr. President, I am getting a little tired of hearing Democrats  dance around the facts or suggest that if Republicans just agree to the  ``clean'' debt ceiling increase that Democrats want, Democrats would be  ready to talk about spending once we move on to the budget.   Does anybody really seriously believe that if Democrats won't  consider spending reforms now that, somehow, they will develop a  serious enthusiasm for reining in spending once we get to the budget?  Somehow it doesn't seem likely.   Democrats and the President have spent a lot of energy over the past  couple of weeks tearing down Republican proposals. If they had spent  half that time coming up with spending reforms of their own, we might  already have a debt ceiling agreement.   And I hope that the meeting at the White House later today is a sign  that the President is actually getting serious about negotiating  because, if he isn't, he will have only himself to blame if our Nation  defaults on its obligations. Democrats have already spent us into an  inflation crisis. Let's hope that they don't push us into a default  crisis as well.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: The Senator  from Wyoming (Mr. Barrasso).   The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 126 Leg.]                                  YEAS--56       Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hassan      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      King      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Sinema      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--43       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      Klobuchar      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Smith      Stabenow      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Barrasso           The joint resolution (H.J.
