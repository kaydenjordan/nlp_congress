 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great men and  women and their families that drive Minnesota's dairy industry. This  month is National Dairy Month. In fact, considering the amount of milk  and other dairy products we consume on a daily basis in the United  States and beyond, one could argue that we already remember and  recognize our dairy farmers every day.   In Minnesota, our dairy farmers produce nearly 10 billion pounds of  milk each year. Our dairy farmers, along with their industry colleagues  across the country, not only bring billions of dollars to our economy,  they are vital to a strong and healthy population.   Our dairy farmers work extremely hard. Many, in addition to their  dairy operation, have to maintain a job off the farm to make ends meet.   So, during National Dairy Month, when you drink a glass of milk, have  a milk-filled bowl of cereal, eat a piece of cheese or that cup of  yogurt, let's stop and remember the hardworking men and women of our  dairy industry and their importance to our economy and their commitment  to our health.                            ____________________
