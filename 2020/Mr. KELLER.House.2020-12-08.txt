 Mr. Speaker, today's passage of the Water Resources  Development Act of 2020, as amended by the Senate, marks a new chapter  for a critical infrastructure project that is very important to the  residents of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.   The Williamsport levee, located in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, in  the heart of PA-12, is in dire need of repair to protect the  livelihoods of local residents and businesses.   The flood zone behind the 20-mile levee system is responsible for  nearly 87 percent of Lycoming County's economic activity. This area  employs more than half of the region's workforce and is home to 24 of  the county's 50 largest employers.   This bill authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out a  feasibility study of the imminent threat the levee poses to Lycoming  County's residents and economy. This study is a precursor to  construction and funding for the levee and represents an important step  toward addressing this critical infrastructure need.   I will continue to do everything in my power to work with the Army  Corps of Engineers to prioritize this project. Today, we take an  important step forward in our community's collective effort to get this  infrastructure project across the finish line, and for that, I am  grateful.                            ____________________
