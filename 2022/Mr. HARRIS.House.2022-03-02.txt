 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  bicentennial birthday of a true American hero, Harriet Tubman.   Born in Dorchester County, in Maryland's First Congressional  District, Harriet Tubman is best known as the conductor of the  Underground Railroad. Born a slave, Tubman escaped and risked her own  freedom to guide countless other slaves to freedom at great personal  risk.   In honor of her life achievement, in the next few weeks, numerous  events will be held in and around Dorchester County to celebrate her  200th birthday. The Harriet Tubman State Park and Visitor Center will  be hosting discussions with archaeologists and historians, as well as  conducting walking tours, live music events, artifact displays, and a  film premiere.   As we close out Black History Month and begin Women's History Month,  I urge my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the  memory of Harriet Tubman. She truly embodied the American spirit. From  her thirst for freedom to her courage under fire and her passion for  helping her fellow man, she is an example to us all.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to celebrate her  here today on the floor of the people's House.                            ____________________
