 Mr. Speaker, President Eisenhower said: ``The supreme  quality for leadership is unquestionable integrity. Without it, no real  success is possible.'' Today, I rise to recognize a man of integrity, a  friend, and a true community leader.   Carl Adrian has served as president and CEO of the Tri-Cities  Economic Development Council for 16 years. During his tenure, Tri- Cities has added more than 35,000 jobs, over 1,300 new businesses, and  nearly 90,000 new residents, which is a 30 percent increase in  population.   Tri-Cities is a national leader in agricultural food processing and  viticulture, cutting-edge science and technology advancements, and  energy sector development--in countless ways, due to Carl's advocacy  and vision.   From his service on numerous boards, including Visit Tri-Cities and  Benton-Franklin Council of Governments, and his efforts co-chairing the  search for a new WSU Tri-Cities chancellor to his lasting commitment  for the cleanup at Hanford, Carl Adrian demonstrates the best of what  it means to be a public servant.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Carl and Rheta on his much-deserved  retirement. Our sincere thanks for all of his service to the Tri- Cities.                         Congratulating Kayla Barron     Mr. Speaker, when Kayla Barron, of Richland,  Washington, graduated from high school, she attended the Naval Academy,  commissioning as a Navy officer, and was among the first class of women  commissioned to be a submarine officer.   Now she is one of just 48 NASA astronauts in the Nation and could be  the first woman to land on the Moon. Kayla was chosen as one of more  than 18,000 applicants for NASA's astronaut basic training program,  graduating with her 12 classmates on January 10.   As she works to design the spacesuit for NASA's Artemis program, she  and her classmates will prepare to complete the program's mission:  return humans to the Moon by 2024 and send people to Mars.  [[Page H248]]    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kayla on her remarkable accomplishments.  I applaud her ability and willingness to go above and beyond to set an  example for women of all ages who may be interested in going where no  woman has gone before. She has made, and continues to make, our  community proud. Central Washington is rooting for her.                                time  1100             Central Washington Firefighters Aiding in Australia     Mr. Speaker, over the past month, devastating bushfires  have burned over 12.5 million acres of land in Australia. More than 200  American firefighters have been dispatched to Australia to help combat  and contain these devastating fires, including two firefighters from  central Washington.   In the West, we recognize the catastrophic impact wildfires have on  local communities, on ecosystems, and on environments. My congressional  district recently experienced some of the worst wildfires in our  State's history. When we were in need, Australian firefighters were  eager to help, and now our local heroes are returning the favor.   As we work to improve land management here at home, I am proud to  cosponsor a resolution introduced by my friends Representatives Panetta  and LaMalfa of California to support the longstanding partnership  between the U.S. and Australia as we share firefighting resources in  times of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in applauding the  firefighters, both American and Australian, who put their lives on the  line to protect our land, our wildlife, and our loved ones.                            ____________________
