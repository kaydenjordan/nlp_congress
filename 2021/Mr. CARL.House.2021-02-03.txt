 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of millions  of innocent babies who lost their chance at life because of Roe v.  Wade.   Life is precious. Life is a gift from God, and every human is made in  God's image. Every person born, or pre-born, has inherent dignity and  has the right to life.   We have a fundamental duty to fight for the vulnerable and ensure  that life is protected, recognizing the right to life is a worthy  cause. It is not radical, and it should be bipartisan.   I am proud to be an advocate for the unborn. I firmly believe in our  responsibility as a society to defend life. I will continue to push for  pro-life legislation in Congress, including eliminating the use of  taxpayers' funding in any way to perform abortions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for life  to protect the most vulnerable among us. Together, we can build a  culture that respects God's gift. That gift is life.                            ____________________
