 Madam Speaker, so many areas to pick from in which we  talk about the first year of this administration.   No country can exist if you don't have immigration laws, and I can't  think of anywhere where the new administration is more of a change from  the old.   We have gone through a situation in which about 25,000 people every  year crossed our southern border, and now routinely over 75,000,  tripling the amount of people who have come across our border.   That has received a lot of attention, but not enough attention has  been received for the lack of people being pushed back across the  border if they are caught here breaking crimes or otherwise.   In the first 6 months of 2020, about 93,000 people were kicked out.  This  [[Page H242]]  time around, it is about 18,000. So we have about another 70,000 people  who we don't want in this country, primarily because they have broken  the law. Under the Biden administration, we don't kick them out.   We have to also look at the carrot that they are giving people to  come here in the Build Back Better bill, trying to give free college  education to people who come here illegally. Every Democrat but one in  this body voted for it, saying: Yes, absolutely. We not only want  people to come here illegally, but we will give them free college  education, free medical care.   Unbelievable.   Showing that the number one priority is to get people here illegally,  they are not even giving tests for COVID, which says something or  other. I mean, on the one hand, it is important that everybody even get  a shot if they are hanging around Washington, D.C., but if you are  coming across the southern border, we don't care. Unbelievable.   Quite a change in America compared to what it used to be, and it is  going to take a lot of work when we get a new President to undo the  huge amount of damage that has been done to the fabric of this country  in the first 12 months of Joe Biden.    Madam Speaker, there are several issues of importance  that I don't feel this body has spent enough time discussing, and  unless  [[Page H250]]  they are addressed could result in a great deal of discomfort for a lot  of Americans.   The first is the issue concerning sheltered workshops, also known as  work centers or community rehabilitation programs.   Perhaps you folks are familiar with them. They are places where  people of different abilities frequently work, frequently doing  packaging, maybe light manufacturing.   Because of the different abilities that some people have, they have  to get what are called 14(c) certificates and may work for less than  minimum wage. Disabilities they may have would include things like  perhaps spina bifida or similar things that make it a little bit more  difficult for them to work.   Nevertheless, throughout my political career I have always enjoyed  touring the sheltered workshops in part because the employees that work  there are so proud of the work they are doing and so proud of the fact  that they are able to earn a paycheck and purchase some of their own  clothes, perhaps purchase gifts for their relatives.   Right now these sheltered workshops are under attack in the Build  Back Better bill, and that bill may easily pass some time in the next  year. I am afraid even the majority of Democrats who voted for the bill  are unaware that these sheltered workshops are under attack.   There are two reasons why people want to get rid of sheltered  workshops. There are people who feel under no circumstances should  somebody make less than minimum wage. This is ignoring the economic  reality and ignoring the reality of the type of jobs that are available  for these folks.   The second concern they have is they feel that these people are  segregated from the rest of society working in a sheltered workshop.  That is, of course, not true. There are people of all sorts of  abilities in these workshops; and in my opinion, people who work in  these workshops frequently work there for 25 or 30 years. And people in  management also work there for an extended period of time.   Nevertheless, there is an extreme group which feels that we are  taking advantage of people by having them work in the workshop.   I will point out that in addition to the ability to have some of your  own economic independence, you develop lifelong friends in these  workshops that you wouldn't develop if you were looking for other jobs  out in the community.   One of the concerns for people with different abilities is that it is  important that they develop friendships other than just their parents  or immediate family. It is something that is always of great concern  for parents of people in situations like this, and insofar as the  sheltered workshops were shut down, you wouldn't have this natural  grouping of friends or lifelong coworkers that you are going to be able  to interact with.   It is time for the sheltered workshop community to wake up and  realize in this bill of thousands of pages the radical group that wants  to shut down the sheltered workshops may finally get their dream. And  if they get their dream, they will find that some of these folks are  going to find jobs in the community, but they are not going to find 35  or 40 hour a week jobs in the community. They may find 3 or 4 hour a  week jobs in the community. They will lose the pride that comes with  having a full-time job. They will no longer feel they are like their  siblings or friends who go to work every day and earn a paycheck. It  will be devastating for these folks. Some folks have been working in  these sheltered workshops for 25 or 30 years and have years left to go.  It is tragic that some people want to take this freedom away from them.   I should also point out that nobody forces anybody to work in these  sheltered workshops. If there were other jobs in the community they or  their guardians could take them out and have them work fast food or  have them work light retail or have them work in some light  manufacturing. But what these people who are trying to get rid of these  sheltered workshops are doing is they are taking away the choice that  these folks have made for themselves, the choice that makes them feel  so happy, makes them feel so good.   So I strongly encourage people who know someone in these workshops to  get politically involved before these folks' lives are devastated.   And insofar as we have any of the Democrats paying attention to what  I am saying right now, I beg you to go in your district and tour one of  the sheltered workshops yourself because they will make you feel so  good.   There are very few things in this job that make me feel as good as  touring these workshops because you see how happy and productive people  can be that on the face of it seem to be dealt a tough hand in life.  But they have made what they can of themselves. They are very happy.  And I beg the majority party not to take away this right.   The second issue that I would like to talk about a little bit today  is with regard to COVID.   One of the frustrating things about the establishment--and I think  this goes back even before the Biden administration--is there has not  been enough discussion of the correlation of inadequate amounts of  Vitamin D and getting severe cases of COVID.   Right now in this country, all Americans should be aiming at having  30 nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin D. People who fail to get that  30 nanograms disproportionately wind up getting COVID and getting COVID  severely.   There are other things that make you more likely to get COVID. If you  have diabetes, if you are overweight, these are other things that  correlate with getting COVID. And we know that if you lose a little  weight, your situation would improve.    Vitamin D or a lack of having 30 nanograms per milliliter of Vitamin  D does correlate with problems. Right now in our society, sadly, 96  percent of Black Americans are insufficient to that level, 88 percent  of Hispanics, 65 percent of Whites. It is not something that has been  talked about anywhere near enough, and it is a question as to why the  public health establishment has not done a better job of explaining the  correlation between bad Vitamin D outcomes and bad COVID outcomes.   Some people feel it is not something that is talked about enough  because there is no money to be made. And, of course, a lot of people  are making a lot of money on COVID; but if you solve your Vitamin D  levels by just going to the local drugstore and buying 20 or $40 worth  of Vitamin D pills, there is not the possibility of people to make  billions of dollars.   Nevertheless, if you are out there, I strongly encourage all  Americans to get a hold of Vitamin D. Vitamin C and zinc are good, as  well, but today I try one more time to beg my friends back home to go  get some Vitamin D, and I beg the medical community who right now does  not test for Vitamin D like they should; I am told it is because there  is not enough reimbursement in Medicare, and we don't want to lose  money on what we are doing, but the medical community ought to be  testing everybody for Vitamin D if they come in for their annual  checkup. All Americans should be looking to get that level above 30  nanograms per milliliter.   There are other things, as well, that could be done to reduce the  high number of deaths from COVID. Fenofibrate is a drug which some  Israeli researchers had success with. It is a generic drug, and as a  result, it is very reasonable to get a hold of. The same thing is true  with hydroxychloroquine. And there are doctors I know who have had  success with that. I don't think it is quite as successful with the  omicron variant, but it was very successful with the alpha variant. And  there is ivermectin, and I have known doctors who have used that, and  they have had success curing people there. But for whatever reason, on  some of these cheaper alternatives that I think could have saved  hundreds of thousands of people, the public health establishment and  the medical establishment has not been as outspoken as they should.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline.)    Madam Speaker, I would like to address another, perhaps  inadvertent, perhaps not so inadvertent, group of provisions in the  Build Back Better bill.   As we look across the country, when one compares to where America is  today compared to where America was 50 years ago, certainly one area  that I think most Americans would think is a step in the wrong  direction is the breakdown of the traditional family. However, not all  people consider the breakdown in the so-called western prescribed  nuclear family structure as a bad thing.   Black Lives Matter, which played such a big role in the elections  last November, on their website came out saying we want to disrupt the  western prescribed nuclear family structure.   They are not the only ones who don't like the western family. We know  Karl Marx felt that as he wanted to work his way towards paradise, we  had to get rid of the traditional family.   I don't know whether it is a coincidence or not, but our current  welfare system with all of the programs that are part of it, be it the  education grants, be it the medical grants, be it the food stamps, be  it the low-income housing, are all set not to benefit families in which  there are two parents at home to raise the children.   In other words, the United States for years and years has been trying  to get rid of the nuclear family. It is like Karl Marx himself were  writing the welfare policies.   In the Build Back Better bill, we are going further on down this  line. I don't know that this is exactly supposed to be a pay back to  Black Lives Matter, but the reconciliation bill will more than double  the earned income tax credit marriage penalty. It has provisions for  greatly increasing the number of low-income housing units. And I feel  that the way those units are doled out, again, very difficult to get  those units if you have a mom and dad at home. But there are people who  want to get rid of that sort of family.   I would strongly encourage the majority party, before they push this  bill any further, to have a study done on who benefits from these new  provisions and who doesn't, and is it one more time a situation which  we are bribing people not to have old-fashioned nuclear families.                                time  1600    I am afraid, like I said, right now, this looks like another victory  for the hard leftwing of the Democratic Party that embraces the idea  that we ought to get rid of the nuclear family. It is not a  coincidence. It is in the bill.   In any event, these are things I will leave our audience with as we  break for the following week. If you know somebody who works in a  sheltered workshop or work center, or know a Congressman, invite them  to the sheltered workshops to see what they are in danger of shutting  down.   If you know people who do not yet have COVID, remind them to get more  vitamin D. If there are any doctors out there--I know sometimes you  can't be reimbursed for everything, but you guys make enough money-- make sure you begin to do some testing of vitamin D levels so that if  people are below 30 nanograms per milliliter, they know it and they  know that they should go to the drugstore and begin to get more vitamin  D, together with zinc and vitamin C.   Finally, I encourage the majority party, before they do any more with  Build Back Better, to have some work done and see whether you really  want to go ahead and further steepen the penalty for married couples  who have children, which already, like I said, is like the policy of  the United States: We don't want to have old-fashioned nuclear  families.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
