 Mr. President, I am going to speak and make a unanimous  consent request in a moment, and I am so anxious because a number of my  Republican colleagues--I remember being in middle school as well. You  don't want to be the first; you don't want to be the last.  Unfortunately, that is where we rank right now in terms of comparison  to OECD, in terms of raising corporate revenue. I don't think that is  fair for hard-working Americans.   And the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee is someone  that I have huge, huge respect for and have worked with on many, many  items. We are going to have a chance to debate part of these  components, I think, going forward. But I would say this. When I first  got the note: Well, the Senator from Idaho--it was one of my first  times I was a gang member. The Senator from Idaho and I were part of  something called the ``Gang of Six,'' and we were audacious enough to  think that a proposal put forward by the so-called Simpson-Bowles  Commission to take on the debt and deficit issues in our country was  worthwhile and worth us both, frankly, offending folks in each of our  respective parties.    We were astonished that in the 2010-2011 timeframe, the country was  looking at $15 trillion of debt. We, obviously, were not very  successful, since we are now at about $27 trillion in debt; and, I  would argue, both sides bear lots of responsibility. I believe we cut  revenues way too much. In the last year or so alone, we jointly added  $5 trillion-plus in terms of spending around COVID.   But the one thing, I think, we both realized was what we shouldn't do  is ever mess with the full faith and credit of the United States of  America because that is like giving an irresponsible politician a hand  grenade and saying: Let that politician pull the pin out at any moment  in time.  [[Page S6576]]    Well, there may be some folks now who are prepared to pull the pin  out and put in jeopardy the full faith and credit of United States of  America. If that happens over the next 30 days, the one thing that we  can be guaranteed is it will rock the bond markets. It will rock how  America views--how the rest of the world views America's ability to  honor its commitments.   I fear, unless somebody--and, again, my friend from Idaho, I know,  realizes this as well, is that if we mess with this, if we were to  see--pull that hand grenade and have it explode on all of us, the  American people aren't going to decide whose fault it was or whose  responsibility it was. All they are going to end up seeing, I believe,  is that interest rates are going to go up because we have not dealt  with the debt and deficit. At $27 trillion, if interest rates go up 100  basis point, 1 percent, that is the equivalent of a--call it a tax or  spending obligation--of $200 billion a year of additional interest  payments. And those interest payments come before Medicare, come before  Social Security, and come before payment to our soldiers.   So I know we are rallying against spending, but let's make sure--and  we both ought to bear some responsibility on this--we don't mess with  the full faith and credit of the United States; because if we do that,  in addition to all the things that you are making criticisms of this  reconciliation plan, you have just added another $2 trillion of  spending--mandatory spending--over the next decade.   So we can agree or disagree on the reconciliation pieces and what  parts, but let's guarantee one way or the other we don't mess with the  full faith and credit of the United States.   And I thank my good friend from Idaho and all the good work that we  have done together and continue to do together. And I am anxious to  come back and--you know, some parts of your critique, I agree with;  many I don't. I know I am holding up also my colleague and friend from  the Intelligence Committee, the Senator from Texas.                 Unanimous Consent Request--Calendar No. 347     Mr. President, I rise today to seek unanimous consent to  confirm Mr. Matthew G. Olsen, President Biden's nominee to be the next  Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division at the  Department of Justice.   As we all know, America recently marked the 20th anniversary of one  of the darkest days in our history: the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001.   As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I am privy to the  intelligence information being collected from across our IC community,  which sets forth the myriad threats our Nation continues to face both  at home and abroad. And the Senator from Texas, who is a great member  of the Intelligence Committee, is aware of those threats as well.   Our ability to counter these threats and ensure our national security  is dependent on having qualified individuals nominated by the President  in place so they can do their jobs and, importantly, be held  accountable through the confirmation process.   Prior to the attacks of 9/11--and this was one of the things that  were pointed out by the commission afterwards--literally 57 percent of  the Federal Government's Senate-confirmed top, top national security  jobs remain vacant--57 percent. And one of the key recommendations of  the 9/11 Commission was to accelerate the process of national security  appointments.   Unfortunately, if we fast-forward 20 years, today you would think we  would have learned the lesson, but today the situation is actually  worse than it was prior to 9/11. Of the 170 confirmable national  security-related positions, only 44 have been filled. That is just 26  percent. You know, my math shows that that means we have got about 74  percent that are unfilled. We have got to do better.   That is why it is essential for the Senate to swiftly confirm every  single qualified national security intelligence professional whose  nomination is pending on the Senate floor. That is why I strongly  support the swift confirmation of Matt Olsen.   The National Security Division, or NSD, at the DOJ has remained  without a confirmed senior leader for several months. Created in 2006,  the NSD consolidates the Department's primary national security  operations and serves as a key link between the Department and the  intelligence community. Its mission is to carry out the Department's  highest priority: protecting the United States from threats to our  national security by pursuing justice through law.   Matt Olsen is eminently qualified for this position, given his years  of service at the DOJ; as general counsel for the NSA; and a director  of the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC, in which capacity he  regularly briefed our Intelligence Committee. Matt is a consummate  intelligence professional and an effective leader of the highest  caliber and personal and professional integrity.    The NSD needs a confirmed leader in place. So I am urging my  colleagues to confirm Matt Olsen immediately.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the following nomination, Calendar No. 347, Matthew G.  Olsen, of Maryland, to be an Assistant Attorney General; that the  nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to the nomination; and that the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I just want to make a couple of quick  comments in response to my friend from Texas.    We have worked on a number of--or continue to work on a  number of important items. But I think it is--various--he is citing a  couple of lawyers at the front end of the legal process that have  either been arrested or have not gone through the whole judicial  process yet.   I don't have the whole list in front of me, but I would be happy to  present for the record the list of individuals affiliated with the  Trump campaign who have been arrested and convicted and pled guilty  because of lying to the FBI or involvement with Russia. I think our  investigation, of which I am quite, quite proud--bipartisan,  successful--clearly showed Russian interference in the 2016 elections.   We have seen the results of the Mueller investigation. I can't recall  the exact number of convictions that arose out of that. And I agree  with my friend, the Senator from Texas, that we don't want--the last  thing I want is any more partisanship between the intelligence  community.   And that is why I just again want to cite for the record the  individuals--yes, Mr. Olsen joined a lot of intelligence professionals  in raising concerns about the way the previous administration ran the  intelligence community. Frankly, I think they ran it, in many ways,  disrespectful to the folks who worked in that community.    But, again, talking about Matt Olsen and his career, I have got a  letter here that has got literally hundreds of intelligence and DOJ  professionals who support Mr. Olsen. Let me just cite a couple of  them--all of them individuals, by the way, who have served Republican  Presidents: Michael Chertoff, as we all know, Assistant Attorney  General, also then subsequently head of DHS; Zach Terwilliger, U.S.  attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, served under President  Trump; Kenneth Wainstein, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia,  2004 to 2006, under President Bush; Charles Rosenberg, served under  President Bush in the Southern District and the Eastern District; Paul  McNulty, again, served under President Bush, Eastern District of  Virginia, U.S. attorney; Michael Mukasey, Attorney General under  President Bush; Jesse Liu, U.S. attorney under President Trump in the  District of Columbia. The list goes on and on.    All I am hoping is that we would get a chance to debate  Mr. Olsen's qualifications and bring it to the floor for a vote.  Instead, we have a whole clump of individuals who have been put on  hold, a process that 99.9 percent of Americans don't understand.   I think Mr. Olsen's career and his service to our country deserves a  free and fulsome debate. Those individuals who don't want to vote for  him, have at it. But we are not getting that opportunity because--and  it is not my friend from Texas. Let me be clear. He is not the person  who placed holds. That process is taking place, and, unfortunately, I  believe Mr. Olsen is not going to have his--not even his day in court  but his day on the floor of the Senate, which I think, with his service  to our country, he merits and deserves.    Of course.    I would say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  you know, we all reflected recently where we were 20 years ago on 9/11.  But one of the astounding things that came out of the report after 9/11  was that, at that moment, on 9/11 in 2001, 57 percent of the senior  officials in the intelligence community had not been confirmed. Those  positions weren't filled. The amazing thing is, 20 years later, 74  percent of those top positions are not filled. I think that is a  disservice to the memory of those who perished on 9/11, and I think it  is unfortunate, to say the least.   If Members have, in good faith, concerns with Mr. Olsen, let's debate  and have at it. But the idea of a large block of intelligence and law  enforcement professionals--and we need this position at the Justice  Department--sitting unfilled because of an individual Member, on an  issue not related to their qualifications, to put a blanket hold on a  series of this President's nominees does not make our Nation safer.
