 Madam Speaker, today we celebrate the adoption of the  stars and stripes as the official flag of our Nation. In 1777, six  years before the end of the Revolutionary War, is when it was adopted  by Congress.   Over the past year, however, we have seen a constant stream of  disrespect for our stars and stripes.   We expect the flag to perhaps be beaten and burned on the streets of  Beijing or in the Middle East or other cities of our global  adversaries, but we do not expect that to happen within the United  States.   This past year, we have all fought against the raising of political  flags in military bases and atop our embassies and consulates. Our flag  is the only flag that belongs above those buildings.   Our flag is a symbol of hope and unity.   I hope today, of all days, we can remember who fought to raise the  flag and why.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the State of  Washington, a good friend and chairman of our Western Caucus. I  appreciate the time and the effort to have this time of education here  tonight on the House floor, and for those who would watch and want to  actually learn what goes on.   So where do we start on the Endangered Species Act?   Passed in 1973, signed by Republican President Richard Nixon.   Now, if you were to listen to the rhetoric any time Republicans want  to talk about reforming the Endangered Species Act or doing things that  make sense, I think, out in the woods or with water storage, with  mining the critical minerals we are going to need for a lot of these  idealistic views, we are going to have more and more use of  electricity, you would think that we were  [[Page H2740]]  going to be the plunderers of the land. Completely not the case.   The things that are going on right now in the time of drought we have  in the West, in my home State of California, and the ongoing problems  we have with nonmanaged timber lands, U.S. forest lands, and the  resulting effect that has on private lands with the bad neighbors of  U.S. lands are typically to them.   If we are in a time of drought, we need to up our game more so on  forestry, forest management, thinning, and using these materials for  the good of people.   We had a toilet paper shortage months ago, as ridiculous as that  sounds in a first-world country like the United States, yet we are  burning millions of acres every year. You could trace a lot of this  back to the misuse, the abuse of the Endangered Species Act to stop and  block the type of work we need to be doing.   We have had hundreds of thousands of acres of fire like over there on  the Western Coast, north coast of California. They try to put in a  project after a 400,000-acre burn to do a minimal amount, 7,000 acres  of clean up, of restoration, of removing some of the dead trees and  brush and other things that were left behind along roadways and  somewhere around communities, et cetera. Environmental lawsuits come in  and stop them from doing 7,000 acres, less than 2 percent out of the  fire.   So what is the solution to this? Just watch these ghost trees stay  there, watch the brush grow up around all this and become the next  tinderbox for the next fire in 5 or 7 years?   That seems to be the solution by those on the far left that use the  Endangered Species Act as a weapon to stop progress for people, as well  as nature, as well as the environment.   California is in the throes of drought right now big time. Our  reservoirs are way down from just 2 years ago when they were all  practically full, and 2 years before that topped off, too. You may  recall Lake Oroville, the Oroville Dam had the spillway break apart in  the early part of 2017, because the lake was actually flowing over the  top of the emergency spillway. The dam is in fine shape. The spillway  has been rebuilt. And we have stored a lot of water between then and  now.   So what has gone on?   So much water has been released out to the Pacific Ocean and not used  for people use, for agricultural use or even smart environmental use.   The usage of the Endangered Species Act as a weapon has devastated so  much of agriculture in California, which maybe people don't realize  that 90 percent of certain types of crops, the vegetable crops that the  United States people use come from California. Most of the almonds that  you would use come from California.   Where is this going to come from if California is out of business  because of the misuse and abuse of the Endangered Species Act, because  someone might decide the coho salmon up in the Klamath Basin is more  valuable than the sucker fish in the Klamath Lake or the water foul  that gets forgotten about in the basin right around there?   Last year, we had a devastating kill on ducks and other wildlife in  that Klamath Basin area because they couldn't get water through the  agricultural system to where the refuges are for the ducks.   So what species is it we are going to pick?   The water in the Klamath project actually is assigned agriculture  use. The Klamath project added additional water storage space to the  existing Klamath Lake. Oregon courts have already ruled a couple times  that additional water belongs to agriculture. It is not something for  the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Interior to use in  order to make their equations work out on the failed application to  salmon in order to, in their idea, flush a virus out of the Klamath  River.   There is other evidence out there saying this is actually the  opposite of what you should do. That the virus--the C. shasta virus is  actually propagated by these additional flows. It is done year after  year after year, and the virus keeps returning. Maybe you need to let  that stuff dry out.   Also, the sucker fish that they are trying to protect in the lake,  the bottom feeding fish, too much water in the lake studies show by the  NAS--National Academy of Sciences--that too much water in that lake  makes them more vulnerable to predators and doesn't help the sucker  fish, which is good at living in a shallow amount of water. So we are  going in opposite directions.   Agriculture is devastated in the Klamath Basin. You are probably not  going to see the potatoes that In-N-Out Burger uses, horseradish, mint,  other products, as well as a lot of hay crops. They are not going to  happen this year, except for whatever water they can get from wells up  there; not going happen.   So when you see these things not on your store shelf anymore, you  will know that there is something going on, or when you see them highly  overpriced because we have to get them from some foreign country. You  are going to see the root causes because the California water supply  has been frittered away for other things besides useful purposes.   And this isn't in defiance of the ESA or helping species, but the  right science isn't being used. When you have one-term paper written  being used as gospel on the Klamath River as setting policy versus a  lot of other evidence--they want to remove the hydroelectric dams on  the Klamath River.    Now, when we are talking about drought in California, when we already  have lakes and reservoirs that are low, we have--Lake Oroville is going  to be at dead pool probably about mid-August.   Now, what is the temperature in mid-August?   Not quite near what my colleague in Arizona was speaking about, but  it is hot. So when we have this water supply run out, unable to produce  the hydroelectric power that we normally could because we could store  it, then we are going to have more power shortages, not just because of  power shutoffs. Because when the wind blows in California, now we have  to shut off the power because trees and things might blow branches into  the power lines and cause another devastating fire, like what is known  as the Camp Fire that devastated the town of Paradise, also in my  district.   Where is the common sense with this? Where is the common sense of  applying if we have drought conditions or, as the left likes to talk  about every other speech in this Chamber, climate change, the religion  of climate change?   Okay. If the blankety-blank climate is changing, why aren't we  storing more water since we, as people, are smart enough to know we  will need a water supply?   Why aren't we doing more to cause electricity be generated at that  water storage site?   Why aren't we doing more to trim and manage our forests that are  overcrowded?   Way too many trees per acre when they have been managed that way for  100 years.   Instead, we go on and on, and somebody comes up with a lawsuit to  prevent us from managing forests that way, prevent us from storing  additional water.   Not to mention when we talk about all cars have to become electric by  2035. I know a lot of people who aren't interested in buying electric  cars.   What happened to the choice people have of vehicles, the size and the  style they seek to have?   Yet we are hell-bent on electrifying everything. In the bay area,  they want to ban gas stoves and gas appliances in people's homes  because of some idealistic view of the environment and somehow tying  that back to the misuse of the Endangered Species Act.   All this ties together. The Endangered Species Act has been a great  tool to shut down the things we need to do, whether it is the expansion  of a highway, water storage. Shasta Dam right now in my district could  be raised 18 feet and add right away 640,000 acre-feet of water on  those full years. 640,000 acre-feet would be enough for 1.2 million  homes or 200,000 acres of crops that people watching this right now  like to have for their fresh fruits, for their salads, for their  vegetables, whatever it would be. And this is all going to be gone.   Do you like imported oil? Did you love the oil shortages back in the  seventies? Do you like this $4 or $5 or $6 gas and diesel we are having  right now?  [[Page H2741]]    Then you are going to love imported food.   And the Endangered Species Act has been used as a weapon to stop  people from farming, from timbering, from mining, basic things that we  need in order to have our electronics, to have copper for our wiring,  any of those things.                                time  2120    It has been such a weapon since 1973, when it was passed with good  intentions. And I still think we need to have it. It saved the bald  eagle. It saved a lot of things. But also, its record overall, looking  at savings of endangered species, is a pretty low number. Why? Because  of ridiculous regulations and ridiculous biological opinions that don't  even connect the dots of how this is going to help the salmon in the  Klamath River or farther up in Washington where they want to rip some  of those dams out, too, and take away that hydroelectric power.   Where are we going to get the stored water? Where are we going to get  the hydroelectric power? You want to completely rely on what is a  narrow part of the grid, solar power or wind power? You can't even rely  on those, not for a major part of the grid. We need to have 24-7  electricity you can count on with either biomass, wood products stacked  on the deck, the waste wood that should come from the forestry that we  should be doing but aren't doing nearly fast enough, or natural gas  plants. We have so much gas in this country now because of hydraulic  fracturing, but that is vilified, too.   Pipelines bringing energy where it is needed is vilified, too,  because they are using an endangered species somewhere as a tool to  stop these developments.   Americans, enjoy these high prices you are getting right now. Enjoy  these shortages of electricity, of fuel, the higher cost of food, the  shortage of certain food items, because the usage of the Endangered  Species Act--and the usage of other environmental laws that have been  abused--that has been completely taken out of context from the original  intent like Congress passed back in 1973 or layered upon in recent  years.   We have to reform this process. It is not because Republicans want to  plunder the planet. That is so tiresome. Any time we talk about forest  management, oh, you are going to clear cut everything--I'm from  northern California--from here to Oregon, or somewhere else.   That is not it at all. Talk to any smart timber operation, and they  have 80- to 100-year plans for the private lands that they manage. If  you could fly over and look at how these timberlands are managed, you  can tell there is generally a checkerboard of private land versus  Federal land. You can see the different squares as they are managed  either before a fire, ongoing, or after a fire.   Just fly over one 3 years after a fire and see who has actually been  out there cleaning up their lands and trying to restore things versus  unmanaged Federal land, which is still the big mess it was right after  the fire. You will see the way the government is doing it, the way the  left is foisting these ridiculous rules and laws upon us and not  allowing us to do reasonable reform to bring just a little bit of  balance back into what was passed 50 years ago into what we have to  deal with.   At this time, when we are watching things go way off-kilter here  under this administration, I just remind those watching to look at the  root cause. It all ties together, the Endangered Species Act, other  environmental laws, other lawsuits, when you can't even turn around to  do a simple thing without somebody coming after you, suing you over it.   Look around your own home. Try to build a deck on your own home and  someone is going to try to environmentally slow you down on that these  days. Farmers are getting fined for building a pond on their land in  the Western States in order to retain a little more water for their  cattle.   When you see the high prices of these things all happening, look at  the root cause. Enjoy these high prices of fuel and electricity and the  shortage there, and know it is not because of our policies here but  because of the policies of misuse and abuse of endangered species laws,  of environmental laws, and all the lawsuits that go along with them.
