 Mr. Speaker, every day men and women in the  police force put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Let me tell  you about one of these extraordinary heroes: San Diego Police  Department Officer Jonathan De Guzman, or JD, as his friends knew him.   JD dedicated his life to protecting the San Diego community he loved.  His bravery shows the kind of unique selflessness found in police  officers. After suffering a brutal stabbing from a suspect, JD went  back to the force, and that same year he won the San Diego Police  Department Purple Heart award for bravery in the line of duty.   Tragically, on July 28, 2016, Officer De Guzman, a 16-year veteran of  the force, was shot and killed, a hero taken from us too early.   There is a special honor in representing those who serve us every  single day, those like San Diego's own JD, Officer De Guzman. Thank you  to the brave men and women of our police force. Your sacrifice and your  strength keep us safe.  [[Page H4237]]                                ____________________
