 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life and work  of Bill Habel, of Naperville, who passed away suddenly just a few weeks  ago at the age of 63.   Bill was a tireless champion for workers and their families, and he  never missed an opportunity to help amplify their voices. He started  his career as a union electrician in 1986 and was a dedicated member of  IBEW Local 701.   Beyond his day-to-day work, Bill made it a priority to give back and  to help others begin their careers. He spent 23 years as an instructor  for the electrical workers' apprenticeship program, helping introduce  others to good-paying career opportunities in the building trades.   He was a leading voice for the economic development of the Naperville  community and never missed a chance to advocate for job creation and  infrastructure development that attracted so many people to Naperville  and to DuPage County.   Madam Speaker, Bill knew instinctively what many of us have learned,  that when you prioritize workers and their families, the entire  community benefits. Simply put, the Naperville community is a better  place because of the work that he did and what he did to help build it  up.   I am proud to call Bill a friend and even more proud of the work that  he accomplished for his community. We will all miss him dearly.                            ____________________
