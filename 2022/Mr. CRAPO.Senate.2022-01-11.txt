 Madam President, I congratulate Idaho Operation  Lifesaver on its 50-year anniversary of working to keep people safe  around railroad tracks and railway crossings. Thank you to all those  involved with this highway/rail safety effort for advancing rail safety  across Idaho and our country.   Idaho Operation Lifesaver was started in Post Falls, ID, in 1972 and  was adopted in other States and nationally. According to Idaho  Operation Lifesaver, the average number of highway/rail incidents was  12,000 annually when Idaho Operation Lifesaver was created. Idaho  Operation Lifesaver is credited with a 43-percent decrease in incidents  in its first year following a 6-week public awareness campaign started  through cooperative work between then-Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus, the  Idaho State Police, and Union Pacific railroad.   This effort is currently supported by 78 volunteers across our great  State of Idaho who assist with providing safety presentations to school  groups, driver education classes, community members, professional  drivers, law enforcement officers, and emergency responders. The  group's focus on education, engineering, and enforcement is also part  of its Officer on a Train Program, employed for the past nearly 30  years to decrease car-train collisions. Through the program, Idaho  State Police Troopers and Officers from local police departments work  together to stop drivers committing track safety violations to prevent  collisions, prevent trespassing on railroad property, and save lives.   Idaho is filled with problem-solvers and doers. So it is no surprise  this railway safety effort got its start in our great State. I  congratulate Idaho Operation Lifesaver on this significant milestone. I  wish all those involved with Idaho Operation Lifesaver well, as you  continue to work to keep people safe from rail accidents across our  State and Nation.                            ____________________
