But, Madam Speaker, it is not enough just to say their names. It is  not enough just to say that Black lives matter. We must fight for Black  lives and for real transformative justice.   Let us pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act as a bold,  urgent, necessary first step. It bans chokeholds and defines them as  civil rights violations. It bans no-knock warrants for drug cases. It  establishes a public police misconduct registry. It reforms qualified  immunity and ends racial profiling by law enforcement.   It requires reporting of incidents of use of force, stops, and  searches, and the demographics of those involved, too.   It demilitarizes law enforcement by restricting the transfer of  military equipment to local police departments.   It finally classifies lynching as a Federal hate crime and gives the  Department of Justice the power to subpoena law enforcement departments  for pattern and practice investigations.   And so critically important, it invests money into Black and Brown  communities to reimagine what policing should look like, so everyone is  safe.   Madam Speaker, hundreds of thousands of people in communities across  America are standing up and speaking out for bold reform, organizing  day after day, night after night, in big cities and small towns. They  have not just forced a necessary conversation; they have prompted  necessary action.   So let us, today, heed these righteous voices of the powerful  movement on the ground so local communities, led by Black voices, can  move forward on transformational changes. That begins today by passing  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
