 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor our Texas 24  Hometown Hero of the Week, my hometown hero, Irving Chief of Police,  Jeff Spivey.   Chief Spivey will be retiring this year after selflessly serving our  community for 35 years working to strengthen community relations and  serving in roles from patrol to criminal investigation. Irving is a  better, safer city because of his dedication. He pioneered peer support  services, formed a mental health response unit, and led a departmental  reorganization.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chief Spivey for his service and the lasting  impact he has made on our community.                            ____________________
