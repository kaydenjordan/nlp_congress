 Madam Speaker, last week, Human Rights Watch reported  that the Chinese Government has imposed draconian new controls on  Larung Gar, the famous Tibetan Buddhist center of learning.   An official document says Communist Party cadres are taking over  management, finances, security, admissions, and even the choice of  textbooks. This follows last year's demolitions and expulsions.   China says it respects constitutionally protected religious beliefs.  That is a lie. When the state puts officials who are required to be  atheists in charge of your religious institutions, that is not  religious freedom. When admission requires a firm political stand, when  the state tells you what to teach and students must honor the Communist  Party, that is not religious freedom.   Sadly, the White House has been silent as human rights abuses in  China worsen. Enough is enough. Congress must pass the Reciprocal  Access to Tibet Act. If the President won't act, Congress must ensure  there are consequences for China's egregious actions to control and  destroy Tibetan Buddhism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney) for the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, here we go again, literally. Today we are considering,  for the third time, the FY 2018 Defense Appropriations Act. The House  took up and passed this bill in July. The House took up and passed this  bill in September. And now, we will take it up and pass it once again  under a completely closed process for the third time.   I know, Mr. Speaker, that many people think that the third time is  the charm, but in this case, I think the third time is a farce.   There are a couple of minor changes to this version of the bill. For  example, once again, it has $1.18 billion to fund President Trump's  request to send 3,500 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, funding which  has been attached to prior spending bills.   It also has a general provision that turns off sequestration for  defense spending. So it busts the budget caps but exempts itself from  any consequences. That is a neat little trick, Mr. Speaker.   But, really, why are we wasting our time on this bill for a third  time?  [[Page H692]]    Here is a little bit of a reality check, Mr. Speaker. Neither this  defense bill nor any other appropriations bill can move until the House  and Senate Republican leadership get their act together, negotiate a  budget agreement that works for all our Federal programs, and finally  set the top-line numbers for all the appropriations bills. Then, and  only then, will our appropriators be able to begin negotiations on the  final FY 2018 omnibus spending bill to fund all our Federal programs,  defense and nondefense alike, through the rest of the fiscal year.   It would have been nice if this had been done in September, Mr.  Speaker, or maybe by October or the end of November or the end of  December. One might have hoped to have finally completed the job by the  end of this month. That would be 4 whole months into fiscal year 2018.  But we all know that is not going to happen.   Now, I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but I sure hope we can get  these FY 2018 appropriations bills all done before we have to start  working on the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills.   There is a very simple reason why there is no budget agreement. The  Republicans are squabbling among themselves over either raising the  budget caps or making even deeper cuts in domestic spending. It is like  the Republican rightwing is fighting with the Republican extreme  rightwing.   I will again remind my colleagues, as my colleague from Wyoming did,  Republicans control everything. They control the House. They control  the Senate. They control the Presidency. I wish they didn't, but they  are in charge. It is their job to keep the lights running. But there is  an incompetence that is on display here that I have never, ever seen in  all my years of government.   What should be happening is that the Republican leadership should be  reaching out to the House and Senate Democratic leadership and  negotiating a real bipartisan budget agreement, one that has votes in  both Chambers.   What a radical idea, to actually sit down and negotiate a bipartisan  agreement that will get bipartisan votes. The notion that they can  present legislation on the House floor in this kind of my-way-or-the- highway approach and expect Democrats to vote for it is ludicrous. We  are not going to get everything we want. We know that. We are in the  minority. But our values need to be represented in these overall budget  negotiations as well.   So they should do their job. Sit down and work out a deal. That is  what they are supposed to do when they are in charge. Instead, here we  are entering our fifth month of fiscal year 2018 and no budget  agreement, which translates into no final appropriations bills because  the appropriations committees don't know what their top-line spending  ceiling is for any of the remaining bills, including defense.   It doesn't matter how many times they send this same bill over to the  Senate. It can't come back to us as a final House-Senate conference  report without a budget agreement.   They should do their job. We can't get a budget agreement until the  Republicans stop fighting amongst themselves and decide to work for the  good of the American people and the American military. They should do  their job.   I know today that we will hear a lot about how important it is to  fund our military. Of course, that is important. You won't hear anybody  in this House argue against that. But it is also important to fund  things like the Department of Homeland Security. They help protect us  here in the United States from potential terrorist attacks.   It is also important to fund the Justice Department. There are many  antiterrorism programs in the Justice Department that are important to  protecting the citizens of this country. To suggest that somehow they  don't matter, I think, is just wrong.   Isn't it important that we support our Veterans Affairs Department to  support our veterans who have sacrificed so much for this country? To  say that somehow they are not a priority, I don't think that is right.   It is important to fund the State Department. It is important to fund  Transportation, Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Education,  Housing and Urban Development, the Energy Department, the Interior  Department, and all our Federal bureaus, agencies, and programs.   America's national security is more than just our military. It is our  local law enforcement. It is our courts. It is our hospitals, our  schools, our roads, and our bridges. It is investing in our  communities, cities, and our towns. It is taking care of our veterans,  our seniors, and our children. It is helping our local farmers,  businesses, and companies survive and thrive.   If we fail in these duties, Mr. Speaker, then what is there left to  defend?   Time and time again, Secretary of Defense Mattis has declared that  the greatest damage to our military comes from continuing to fund  defense by a series of short-term continuing resolutions, one after  another after another. Yet that is exactly what Republicans in Congress  are doing.   So, please, Mr. Speaker, let's have no more crocodile tears about  defense spending and how important our military is. If the military  were really a priority for the Republican leadership and not just a  good sound bite, then they would have reached a budget agreement and  finished the FY 2018 appropriation bills--all of them--last year.   Mr. Speaker, right now, Federal agencies, including the Pentagon, are  operating under a fourth continuing resolution. Even if, by some  miracle, a budget agreement is reached today or by next Monday,  Congress will still need to pass a fifth CR by next Thursday, February  8, because there is no way the appropriators will be able to start and  finish their negotiations on a final omnibus in just a few days.   So, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, under a completely closed  process, is theater. It is not about our military. It is not about the  defense of this country. It is about a sound bite. It is about trying  to provide some smoke so the people don't realize that the Republicans  who run this government don't know how to do their job. It is nothing  more than face-saving for the most extreme Members of the Republican  Conference. It does nothing that hasn't been done twice before. It  means nothing. It is a waste of time.   Since the House is really only working 1 day this week--namely,  today--then we could have brought up legislation that hasn't already  moved twice through the House but for which action is desperately  overdue.   We could have brought up the reauthorization of our community health  centers, which help more than 24 million Americans access essential  healthcare. Or how about the reauthorization of the Maternal, Infant,  and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which helps young families  all across this country?   The Republican leadership deliberately chose to let the authorization  for each of these critical programs expire in September. They haven't  even lifted a finger since to reauthorize them. We could have easily  taken care of their reauthorization today in a couple of hours and sent  those bills over to the Senate rather than spending the same amount of  time passing the same defense bill for a third time.    Mr. Speaker, defense spending and all other Federal programs are in a  mess today because the Republicans are incapable of running the  government. It is that simple. Each day it becomes even more clear that  the Republican leadership not only can't govern, they are not even  interested in governing. Everything we are doing on this day is going  nowhere, and my Republican friends know that.   This, again, is about theater. It is not about troops. It is not  about our security. It is about giving them some cover to justify the  incompetence that is on display here.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleagues on the  Republican side that we don't need lectures from them about America's  national security. When it comes to forcing their terrible policies on  the American people, they say ``yes, yes, yes'' to President Trump; but  when it comes to holding President Trump accountable and protecting  American democracy, all they say is ``nyet.''   Clearly, House Republicans' desire to protect President Trump has  clouded their judgment and caused them to lose sight of what is at  stake: the security and integrity of our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's own CIA Director, our former  colleague,  [[Page H693]]  CIA Director Mike Pompeo, recently admitted that Russia is currently  working to undermine the upcoming election and has been doing so for  decades.                                time  1245    And, just yesterday, President Trump refused to impose defense and  intelligence sanctions on entities purchasing Russian military  equipment. In July, Congress passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill  requiring President Trump to impose defense and intelligence sanctions  on entities purchasing Russian military equipment. His decision,  yesterday, to refuse to do so tells us all we need to know about where  his loyalties lie.   And still, Mr. Speaker, all the other side continues to do, day after  day, is assault the rule of law. They have led an all-out assault on  our Department of Justice and on our FBI to smear Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's investigation, attempting to tarnish the credibility  of our Federal law enforcement along the way, and sowing doubt and  confusion about the very ability of anyone in law enforcement to  conduct an impartial investigation.   And let's not forget that we are not talking about some hypothetical  investigation. Here are the facts:   The President's former National Security Advisor has pled guilty to  lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador.   The President's former foreign policy adviser pled guilty after he  lied about his contacts with the Russian Government.   And the President's former campaign manager has been indicted by a  grand jury for, among other things, conspiracy against the United  States of America.   Now the Republicans are trying to whip up a controversy out of thin  air with a misleading cherry-picked memo written by their own staff,  which contains significant inaccuracies and omissions that misrepresent  the underlying intelligence.   Associate Attorney General Stephen Boyd stated:   ``We believe it would be extraordinarily reckless for the committee  to disclose such information publicly without giving the Department and  the FBI the opportunity to review the memorandum and to advise the  committee of the risk of harm to national security and to ongoing  investigations that could come from public release.''   ``Indeed, we do not understand why the committee would possibly seek  to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information  without first consulting with the relevant members of the intelligence  community.''   Mr. Speaker, Republicans are doing this in a ridiculous attempt to  discredit an entire investigation, which has already found a serious  effort to attack our democracy.   This is a deeply, deeply irresponsible attempt to undermine Special  Counsel Mueller's investigation, regardless of the profound damage that  it does to our democratic institutions and national security agencies.  It is offensive to the Nation, and it is just plain wrong.   I would remind my Republican colleagues that we are here to uphold  the rule of law, not the rule of Trump. I understand that, in this  Chamber, there are powerful political incentives to circle the wagons  amongst my Republican friends around this White House, but the truth is  the truth, and there is nobody, nobody in this country, including the  President of the United States, who should be above the law.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my colleagues that when we are talking  about defending the national security of our country, what has gone on  in this Chamber these last few days, in my opinion, is a threat to our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just respond to my colleague from Wyoming who  said that talk will not fund our military, or that talk will not  upgrade our military equipment, and I agree. Nobody is asking the other  side to talk. We are asking them to do their job. We are asking them to  go and sit down with Republicans and Democrats and work out a deal on  the budget caps.    In order to do any of this stuff, we have to know how much we can  spend. Before you go shopping, you have to know how much you are going  to spend.   I know my Republican friends don't want to take responsibility for  what is clearly incompetence, but, the bottom line is, in the Senate,  the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hasn't even marked up  the Defense Appropriations bill yet. And the last time I checked, the  Republicans controlled the Senate--I wish they didn't, but the  Republicans control the Senate. And as my colleague from Wyoming knows,  bills don't move in the House or the Senate without the Republican  leadership moving it.   So I think it is clear that this Republican-controlled government  can't do its job, and November can't come soon enough, for me, because  I think there needs to be a major change here. We need people in charge  who understand that the American people come first, not some rightwing  ideology, who understand the meaning that the American people comes  first means doing your job.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that my colleagues vote to defeat the  previous question, and I will give a little explanation why.   Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, President Trump tweeted that he wants  to show that ``Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it.''  Well, I would beg to differ. This is the 19th time that we have  attempted to bring the bipartisan bill, H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, for a  vote on the House floor, and, if we defeat the previous question, we  will bring that bill up.   We have made our position clear: we want immigration policies that  make America safer, without betraying our core values as a nation.   President Trump made his position clear as well. He has tweeted and  said, time and time again: ``My standard is very simple: America First  and Make America Great Again.''   Exactly what does he mean by America First?   According to the conservative Cato Institute, repealing DACA would  cost the government over $60 billion and would reduce economic growth  by $280 billion over the next decade. That doesn't sound like an  America First policy to me.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act: this bipartisan, bicameral  legislation that would help hundreds of thousands of young people, who  are American in every way, except on paper.   I regret very much that the leadership in this House has refused,  time and time again, to allow us to debate and deliberate on this  issue. We have a bill called the Dream Act. If it was brought to the  floor, it would pass overwhelmingly. Every Democrat would support it,  and I bet a big chunk of Republicans would support it as well, and we  could end this once and for all.                                time  1300    The Republican leadership is so pathetically terrified of a narrow,  xenophobic, bigoted element of their base that they cannot bring  themselves to allow us to even consider such a bill, and I regret that  very much.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the people who write the Republican  talking points because they keep on trying to change the subject to try  to confuse the American people.   My colleague knows that this battle is not over the DREAMers,  although we all think it is immoral that these young people have been  treated so terribly and so cruelly, and we believe that there needs to  be a resolution to that.   The bottom line is that we need to negotiate budget caps so we know  how much we can spend on not only defense, but nondefense  appropriations so we can keep our government running. This should have  been done months ago.   So if we really care about our troops, then where is the bipartisan  agreement to raise the budget caps so that we know we have a budget  deal? Where is this bipartisan agreement?   My Republican friends have known that this is the deal for a long  time, yet, again, they are tied in knots because they are fighting  amongst themselves. Their rightwing is having a battle with their  extreme rightwing; and there is even an extreme, extreme rightwing that  not only does not want to raise any nondefense spending budget caps,  but wants to cut domestic spending.   I would say to my colleagues that this is about more than the  DREAMers. In fact, this is about community health centers. I mean,  people rely on community health centers all across this country to get  their healthcare. We are not dealing with that.   This is about funding our veterans. The men and women who serve our  country, who we put their lives in harm's way, shouldn't we make sure  that their budget is funded? I mean, Homeland Security.   So, I mean, there is a whole bunch of stuff here, but this is really  simple to fix. It requires the Republican leadership and this  Republican government to do its job. That is all we are asking. Do your  job, negotiate a deal for a budget agreement to fund the government for  the rest of the year, then we are done, and we go on to fight other  things. But there is an easy way to do this: come up with some numbers,  work it out with your leadership, work it out with our leadership, and  let's move that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say again, the Republicans are in charge. I wish  we were in the majority. If we created this mess, the Republicans would  have every right to criticize us, but we are not in charge. I regret  that very much. I think it is not good for the country that we have a  Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President,  because I think a lot of the priorities of the American people are not  being addressed.    All the Republican leadership needs to do is get together and do  their job and negotiate a deal on the budget caps, and let us approve  defense and nondefense spending for the rest of the year and get away  from these CRs. It is in their hands.   As I said, the Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations hasn't  even had a markup in their committee. I mean, they are controlled by  Republicans. You can't blame us for everything.   Bottom line is you are in charge. When you are in charge, you have to  keep the lights on. That is your responsibility. Unfortunately, my  Republican friends don't want to do this.   I have never, ever, seen this kind of incompetence in our government,  ever, in all my years. This has to end. Again, the way it ends is when  the Republican leadership decides to negotiate a budget agreement with  the House and Senate leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike.   Mr. Speaker, we all believe that we ought to support our military, we  ought to make sure we have the best military, second to none. We want  to fund that, but we also understand that it is important to fund the  Department of Homeland Security, which protects us from terrorist  attacks here at home. I am sorry my Republican friends don't see that  as a priority.   We also believe we ought to fund veterans' health. I am sorry my  Republican friends don't see that as a priority.   We believe in funding community health centers. We believe in making  sure that our States have the money to be able to rebuild their aging  infrastructures. I am sorry that that is not a priority, but it is to  us.   The entire budget is a priority to us, and I don't think it is too  much to ask the leadership of this House and the leadership of the  Senate to make sure that everything is funded and that the needs of the  entire country are met, and not kind of picking one over another over  another.   The other thing I would say is that, if we want to have a talk about  national security, we ought to focus on what is happening right here  with the Republicans and the House Intelligence Committee playing  politics with an investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy.   You ought to be concerned about a President of the United States who  doesn't seem at all worried that the Russians interfered in our  election, that according to his own CIA head says they are still trying  to interfere in our election, and we can't even get this President to  impose congressionally mandated sanctions.   Is there anything that Russia can do to us that will cause this  President to stand up and defend our country or to even say something  mildly critical about Vladimir Putin, whom he praises, a man who kills  journalists and human rights defenders and political opponents?   Enough. I mean, stop this politicization of the Russia investigation.  This should be bipartisan, getting to the bottom of this. Wherever it  leads, it leads, but this is serious. You want to talk about a threat  to our country, to our homeland, and to our democracy, look at what  Russia is doing to us each and every day.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  the previous question so that we can bring up the Dream Act so we can  actually protect these wonderful people who have been such great  members of our community, who have been first responders, who have  saved lives in the aftermaths of hurricanes, who serve in our military.   We have to stop holding them for ransom. They are not hostages. We  ought to stop holding them for ransom for a stupid wall that costs $25  billion.   When I think about $25 billion, I can think of a lot of things to do  with $25 billion that could help the people of this country rather than  building a ridiculous wall that someone could buy a ladder to climb  over or a shovel to dig under.                                time  1315    We have to do better, so vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote  ``no'' on this rule, and send a message to the leadership of this  House: Get back to work and do your job. You are in charge. It is your  job to keep this government running. Work out a deal on the budget cap.  Fund everything. That is your job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
