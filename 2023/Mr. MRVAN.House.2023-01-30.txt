 Mr. Speaker, as the Representative for the First District  of Indiana, I rise today to express my appreciation for the provisions  in the fiscal year 2023 omnibus bill that support the Great Lakes.   As the largest body of freshwater in the world, the Great Lakes and  the Lake Michigan shoreline in northwest Indiana powered our Nation's  industrial revolution and steel production capabilities, and today we  continue to harness our region's environmental wonders to grow our  economy.   I am grateful that the 2023 omnibus bill included robust funds for  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, my Community Project Funding  request to improve our shoreline and the Michigan City Harbor, as well  as the provisions championed by my friend, Representative Marcy Kaptur,  to establish the Great Lakes Authority.   As we move forward, I look forward to continuing to work through the  appropriations process to support the economic strength and  environmental protection of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes.                            ____________________
