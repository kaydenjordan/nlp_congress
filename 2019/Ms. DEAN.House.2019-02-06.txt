 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about Peter Biar Ajak,  a husband, father, and renowned peace activist unlawfully detained in  South Sudan.   In July of 2018, Peter was arrested by South Sudan security forces.  He has been held without charge or trial ever since, and has frequently  been denied access to his family, counsel, medical care, and adequate  food.   Peter was one of Sudan's Lost Boys who resettled to Philadelphia and  attended La Salle University where I taught for 10 years. I knew Peter  as a brilliant student and leader. He later went on to Harvard and  Cambridge.   He is a dedicated peace activist, who cofounded South Sudan Young  Leaders Forum. In his work, he has criticized South Sudan's leaders for  failing to secure permanent peace for their people.   Incredibly, Peter is now under investigation for crimes, including  treason and terrorism. If charged and convicted, Peter could be  sentenced to death. In reality, he is being persecuted for speech. I  call on President Kiir to release Peter and all political prisoners in  South Sudan.                            ____________________
