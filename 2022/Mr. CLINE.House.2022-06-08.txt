 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate retired Army  Master Sergeant Silverine James on the naming of the Salem VA Medical  Center's Women's Health Clinic in her honor.   Allowed to enlist by her mother, James joined the Army in 1949 and,  after leaving in 1951, she eventually returned to the service in 1953  as an administrative specialist at the New York Point of Embarkation.   Though the Army was still segregated at the time of her rejoining,  Mrs. James was given an assignment that would help lead to the  integration of her company and later was a trailblazer while serving at  Camp Zama in Japan as the only African American in the Judge Advocate  General section of the Far East Command.   By the time she retired in 1973, Master Sergeant James had completed  22 years of service. Taking a well-deserved year off after retirement,  James began a job at the Salem VA, where she spent nearly 5 years  before taking a job with FEMA.   In an article chronicling her life, Master Sergeant James said  simply, ``I gave my country the best part of my life.''   It was great to be with Mrs. James last week to name the center in  her honor. She surely did give the VA the best part of her life and her  country the best part of her life.   Congratulations on this well-deserved honor.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to the so-called Protecting Our Kids Act. What  we saw 2 weeks ago in Uvalde, Texas, was tragic and horrific, and we  should take action to prevent future tragedies such as this one, but  this bill is not the solution for several reasons.   First, the bill restricts the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding  adults. With very limited exceptions, the bill would prohibit 18- to  20-year-olds from buying nearly all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns.   During the markup of this bill, the Judiciary Committee chairman  argued that this is applicable because these young adults don't have  fully formed brains. Yet, we entrust these same young adults to serve  our country in the military and die for our country. We trust these  young adults to vote in our elections.   What is even more interesting is while Democrats believe that these  young adults don't have fully formed brains, they certainly are more  than willing to try to reduce the age at which a person can vote to 16.   Second, the bill makes it more difficult for a domestic violence  victim to keep a firearm for protection. As drafted, the bill would  criminalize a domestic violence victim's attempt to seek help from a  friend or neighbor in obtaining a firearm.   The safe storage requirements of the bill make it harder for people  to access a firearm in an emergency by mandating a one-size-fits-all  approach for firearm storage.   Finally, the bill's limits on magazine capacity will essentially ban  many common firearms, some of which may accommodate between 15 and 30  rounds of ammunition.   Overall, this bill is an attempt to restrict the constitutional  rights of law-abiding citizens while ignoring the broader problems of  why these tragedies are happening.   Let's talk about school resource officers in our schools. Let's talk  about fortifying school buildings. Let's talk about ending the  dangerous mirage of gun-free zones. And yes, let's talk about mental  health.    We have to look for commonsense solutions that make it easier for  Americans to protect themselves and their loved ones. I oppose this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
