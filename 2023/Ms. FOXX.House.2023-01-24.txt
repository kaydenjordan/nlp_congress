 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats can agree that every  hardworking, taxpaying American deserves a Federal Government that is  built upon a solid foundation that breathes efficiency and is peopled  by those with appropriate skills, not necessarily degrees.   To achieve that end, we must eliminate the bureaucratic snares that  have hamstrung the Federal hiring process over the course of decades,  and fast.    In its current state, this dilapidated and archaic hiring process  serves as a deterrent to attracting qualified and high-quality  candidates. The simple truth is that it seriously undermines the  Federal workforce's ability to serve the American people in both a  proper and efficient manner.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that something must be done to turn the  tide. That is precisely why I have introduced the Chance to Compete Act  of 2023 alongside Representative Gerry Connolly, Oversight and  Accountability Committee Chairman  James Comer, and Representative Ro  Khanna.   This legislation builds upon a solid record of bipartisan  collaboration and proven success in codifying key skills-based hiring  reforms.   More specifically, under this legislation, Federal agencies will be  able better to distinguish practical performers in a field of  candidates and focus on hiring individuals who can perform at the  highest level in the jobs they assume within the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this much-needed bipartisan legislation.    Mr. Speaker, the benefits of school choice cannot be  overstated. On average, students participating in school choice  programs perform better academically and see higher college admission  rates.   These factors make school choice a no-brainer, and charter schools  serve as a foundational cornerstone of the educational freedom school  choice delivers. Yet, even as many traditional government-run schools  do not meet the needs of students, President Biden is erecting  unreasonable barriers for new charter schools and arbitrary funding  restrictions. This is an abject attempt to expand teachers unions'  monopoly over K-12 education.   A great education is a gateway to success, but Democrats are working  hard to lock that gate and hide the key. Students deserve the  opportunity to find a learning environment that suits them. That begins  by ending Democrats' anticharter school crusade.                            ____________________
