 Mr. Speaker, in March, the House passed legislation to  award a Congressional Gold Medal to the men and women of the U.S.  Capitol Police for their heroism on January 6 and for their daily  efforts to protect the institutions of our democracy.   On April 3, once again, we saw an example, of not only the dangers in  which they place themselves through their service, but also the courage  they bring to that service.   In the short span of fewer than 100 days, the U.S. Capitol force lost  three members as a result of attacks on the Capitol complex. Yesterday,  we honored one of those Capitol policemen, Billy Evans. But in a real  sense, we honored every member of the United States Capitol Police.   Some years ago, I lost a member of the Capitol Police who lived in my  district, J.J. Chestnut. Wendy, his wife, was at the ceremony yesterday  for Billy Evans. That was in 1998. He and Officer Gibson lost their  lives in defending this Capitol on that date. And while a Congressional  Gold Medal is a very fitting tribute, it can neither lessen the grief  felt by their fellow officers nor reduce the sense of unease that so  many of them must still be feeling today.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a challenging time for the Congress and  for all of us, but it certainly has been a time of challenge for the  Capitol Police force. And surely the force will be going through a  period of change and adaptation for some time to come, as will all of  us who serve here in the Capitol complex.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a moment on this floor to say thank you  for those who still stand watch at the doors and the vehicle barriers,  who patrol the neighborhoods and the office buildings, who sit ready to  respond quickly and courageously to any emergency, never knowing what  the next alarm might bring.   Mr. Speaker, in particular, I thank the men and women who have served  on the security detail that the Capitol Police have assigned to me in  my role as majority leader. You get to know them as friends, as  protectors, and as family.   Since being elected to House leadership, I have been privileged to  know some of the best of the force. They are representative of an  extraordinary group of people. In order to protect their safety and  privacy, I will not share their names, but they know who they are. Each  and every one of them not only have my immense gratitude and respect,  but they have the admiration of my entire staff, whom they have gotten  to know very well.   Mr. Speaker, again, as I know them, I know that they are  representative of an extraordinary group of people that we call the  United States Capitol Police.   On January 6, when the rioters first breached the Capitol's defenses,  these officers acted without delay, according to their training, to get  me quickly to a safe location, but they couldn't get everybody. And so  many were still in this Chamber as the insurrectionists cried for the  lives of Members of Congress.   Capitol Police checked in with staff and did their best to get us  information in a situation that was chaotic and rapidly changing for  us, but more importantly, for them on the front lines. My security  detail until the last Congress had been led by an officer, who now  serves in the force in a more senior capacity. He was by my side almost  every day for nearly two decades. I came to know him and his family  well, just as I have other members of my detail. As I said, they are  like family to all of us in the majority leader's office. I know that  is true of the minority leader's office and the whip's office and the  Speaker's office and the Democratic whip's office, and our Senate  counterparts.   The senior officer on my detail formerly was present at the Capitol  on January 6, and he acted heroically, and he was the one that tried to  save the life of the woman who was shot--who was an insurrectionist-- because he stood next to her, unarmed, when that incident occurred. He  acted heroically in trying to keep the rioters away from the House  Chamber and in responding when one of them was shot in the hallway, as  I just pointed out.   I know that the events of that day still weigh very heavily on him  and on each of us--on his colleagues, on all of us. And I hope that he  and his colleagues know that their grief weighs heavily on all of us  whom they protect and serve.   President Joseph Biden, in speaking yesterday to the family of  Officer Evans, showed empathy. He showed that he felt their pain, their  concerns, their trauma. And I would urge all my colleagues, when you  see members of the United States Capitol Police, uniformed or in plain  clothes, that you thank them.   Mr. Speaker, I talked about Officer Chestnut. Wendy, his wife, as I  said, was here yesterday. He was shot in the back by the assailant, who  then shot Officer Gibson in the office that I now occupy. It was Tom  DeLay's office at that point in time.   Mr. Speaker, we thank them, we honor them, but the way we really need  to respond to them is to make sure they have the resources, the  training, the equipment, and the authority to respond to those who  confront them with violence and fatal force.   We lost Officer Sicknick. This Capitol was invaded because there were  restraints, frankly, on the United States Capitol Police. We need to  make sure that they have the authority to respond, to protect this  Capitol, this democracy, our Members, our staff, the visitors to this  Capitol, but also, importantly, themselves.   We know that this is a difficult moment and the Capitol Police force  is facing challenges like never before in its 193-year history.   In the early 1960s, I worked here as an intern in a United States  Senator's office, and I had a number of friends who also were in law  school or some other school, who were ``Capitol cops'' we called them.  Thankfully, the risks were minimal. That is not true today. And as the  risks are great, we must respond robustly to ensure that we have the  capacity and the will to meet those risks.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless and protect our U.S. Capitol Police  officers.                            ____________________
