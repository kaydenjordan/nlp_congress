 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act. It is comprehensive infrastructure legislation that  will rebuild and modernize our infrastructure, build a clean energy  future, and put people to work across the country. The bill also  includes my bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act,  provisions from that act.   I have heard, in my State of Washington, from several housing  projects that are halted due to the falling 4 percent rate. This bill  would establish a permanent 4 percent credit, helping projects that are  currently stalled across the country.   The bill makes a substantial investment in the housing credit by  increasing the annual allocation by more than 50 percent over 2 years.  It also adds important incentives for rural and Tribal communities and  for projects that  [[Page H2935]]  serve extremely low-income families. In total, the affordable housing  credit provisions in H.R. 2 will produce more than 600,000 affordable  housing units over 10 years.   H.R. 2 is a crucial step for relief and recovery, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
