 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2159) to designate the community-based outpatient clinic of  the Department of Veterans Affairs located at 400 College Drive,  Middleburg, Florida, as the ``Andrew K. Baker Department of Veterans  Affairs Clinic'', and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2159         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ANDREW K. BAKER DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC.         (a) Designation.--The community-based outpatient clinic of       the Department of Veterans Affairs located at 400 College       Drive, Middleburg, Florida, shall after the date of the       enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ``Andrew       K. Baker Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic'' or the       ``A.K. Baker VA Clinic''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       community-based outpatient clinic referred to in subsection       (a) shall be considered to be a reference to the Andrew K.       Baker Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 2159.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of U.S. Navy Chief Petty  Officer Andrew Kenneth Baker, an esteemed antisubmarine warfare chief,  a distinguished combat search and rescue swimmer, and a faithful  servicemember who gave his life honoring his commitment to his country.   The bill before us, S. 2159, would appropriately name VA's community- based outreach clinic in Middleburg, Florida, the Andrew K. Baker VA  Clinic.   Chief Petty Officer Baker represented self-sacrifice and courage in  the name of public service.   Born in West Virginia in 1960, Chief Petty Officer Baker moved to  Pensacola, Florida, in 1980 to begin what would be a remarkable 17-year  stint in the U.S. Navy.   In Pensacola, CPO Baker graduated from the Search and Rescue Swimmer  School before entering Fleet Replacement Aircrewman training at the  Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, where he earned his ``Wings of  Gold.''   Upon graduation, CPO Baker served on the USS Nimitz, reporting to HS- 9, a helicopter antisubmarine warfare squadron for the Navy. From  there, he served on HS-3 as the Training and Operations Chief for  another antisubmarine warfare squadron safeguarding American interests  over and under the seas.   Tragically, on March 13, 1997, while serving aboard the USS John F.  Kennedy, Chief Petty Officer Baker and three others perished when their  H-60 ``Sea Hawk'' helicopter crashed at sea during a Navy SEAL training  mission.   Though his life was tragically cut short, in his 17 years of service,  CPO Baker managed to cement a legacy of leadership, dedication, and  steadfastness which will reverberate for generations to come. Indeed,  today, Chief Petty Officer Baker is survived by his wife, Tina, and  their son, who, himself, has completed six tours in Iraq, carrying on  his father's legacy as a decorated patriot.   During his lifetime of service, Chief Petty Officer Baker won various  honors, including the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement  Medal, and the American Defense Service Medal, among others.   Today, I hope we will come together to honor Chief Petty Officer  Baker one more time by renaming the VA's community-based outreach  clinic in Middleburg, Florida, the Andrew K. Baker VA Clinic.   As an institution dedicated to supporting those who served, it is  fitting that this VA clinic bear the name of a Navy chief who placed  service to others above all else. With this legislation, we will take  an important step in commemorating one servicemember's courage and  bravery, as we continue to honor all those who have served our country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for S. 2159  from The American Legion, VFW, and Disabled American Veterans as well  as the Florida delegation.

Re Support for S. 2159, to name the Department of Veterans           Affairs in Middleburg, Florida located in Clay County as           the ``Andrew K. Baker Department of Veterans Affairs           Clinic''.       Hon. Marco Rubio,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Rubio: On behalf of The American Legion,       Department of Florida, Inc., we write to lend our support in       naming the new Clay County Veterans Affairs Clinic after       Chief Andrew K. Baker of Middleburg, Florida.        Chief Baker was an esteemed antisubmarine warfare chief and       combat search and rescue swimmer of HS-3 in Jacksonville,       Florida. After quickly rising through the ranks at Naval       Aircrew Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, Chief Baker       earned his Wings of Gold for distinguished performance and       served a tour on the U.S.S. Nimitz, being assigned as the       Training and Operations Chief. In 1997, Chief Baker lost his       life during a mission in North Carolina when his H-60 Seahawk       helicopter crashed at sea during a SEAL training mission. His       legacy currently lives on in his son who has completed six       tours in the Middle East and has proven himself a dedicated       hero.        We know that in naming the new Veterans Affairs clinic for       Chief Baker, his heroic legacy will be enhanced in the Clay       County community and will inspire future servicemen and women       from across our great state.            Sincerely,                                                      Jerry Brandt,      Department Commander.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                      Ocala, FL, September 30, 2021.      Hon. Marco Rubio,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Rubio: On behalf of the Veterans of Foreign       Wars Department of Florida we write to lend our support in       naming the new Clay Country Veterans Affairs Clinic after       Chief Andrew K. Baker of Middleburg, Florida.        Chief Baker was an esteemed antisubmarine warfare chief and       combat search and rescue swimmer of HS-3 in Jacksonville,       Florida. After quickly rising through the ranks at Naval       Aircrew Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, Chief Baker       earned his Wings of Gold for distinguished performance and       served a tour on the USS Nimitz being assigned as the       Training and Operations Chief. In 1997, Chief lost his life       during a mission in North Carolina when his H-60 Seahawk       helicopter crashed at sea during a SEAL training mission. His       legacy now lives on in his son who currently has six       completed tours in the Middle East and has proven himself a       dedicated hero.        We know that in naming a new VA clinic for Chief Baker, his       heroic legacy will be enhanced in the Clay County community       and will inspire future service men and women from across our       great state.            Yours in Comradeship,                                            Danette Jean Hernandez,                                                   State Commander.

Re Support for S. 2159 and H.R. 1960, to name the new Clay           County Veterans Affairs Clinic in Middleburg, FL, the           ``Andrew K. Baker Department of Veterans Affairs           Clinic.''         The Disabled American Veterans, Department of Florida is       writing this letter in support of legislation introduced by       Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott. The propose legislation       S. 2159 and H.R. 1960, would name the new Clay County       Veterans Affairs Clinic in Middleburg, Florida after U.S.       Navy Chief Petty Officer Andrew K. Baker, Department of       Veterans Affairs Clinic, who was killed during a training       mission.        An antisubmarine warfare chief, CPO Baker was a combat       search and rescue swimmer attached to HS-3 homeported at NAS       Jacksonville. Baker served on the USS Carl Vinson and USS       Coral Sea as a ship's serviceman. Baker was killed when       Trident 615, a H-60 Seahawk, crashed at sea on March 13,       1997, during a SEAL training event. CPO Baker served for       seventeen years before his death.        We believe that naming the Clay County VA Clinic after       Chief Petty Officer Andrew K. Baker will ensure the honor of       duty he displayed for our grateful Nation. We respectfully       request the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees       quickly consider this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                        John Raber,      Department Commander.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2022.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Tester and Takano, Ranking Members Moran and       Bost: As Members of the Florida Delegation, we write in       support of S. 2159 and H.R. 1960, legislation that would name       the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic in Clay       County, Florida after U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer Andrew       Kenneth Baker. Chief Baker served his country honorably for       17 years before tragically perishing while aboard Trident       615, an HH-60H ``Sea Hawk'' helicopter that crashed at sea on       March 13, 1997.        Chief Baker served on the USS Carl Vinson and USS Coral Sea       as a Ship's Serviceman. He is a graduate of Search and Rescue       Swimmer School in Pensacola and Fleet Replacement Aircrewman       training at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, where he earned       his ``Wings of Gold.'' Chief Baker then reported to HS-9,       where he served on the USS Nimitz; and then at HS-3, where he       was assigned as the Training and Operations Chief. His       dedication to our nation reflects great honor on his family       and our community. It is fitting that a VA clinic, an       institution dedicated to supporting those who served, should       be named after a faithful service member.        We respectfully request the Senate and House Committees on       Veterans' Affairs quickly consider this important       legislation. Please see the attached letters of support from       the Florida Chapters of Several Veteran Service       Organizations.            Sincerely,        Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator; Rick Scott, U.S. Senator; Kat       Cammack, Stephanie Murphy, Matt Gaetz, Lois Frankel, Carlos       Gimenez, Gus Bilirakis, Mario Diaz Balart, Bill Posey, Brian       Mast, W.

Wilson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bryon       Donalds, Kathy Castor, Vern Buchanan, Darren Soto; Member of       Congress.     I thank Representative Cammack and the Florida delegation  for their work on this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support  it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman on this  accomplishment, and I congratulate her also on her hard work in  securing funding for the community-based outreach clinic.   I know how much of a difference they make, and I take this moment to  call attention to the fact that the bipartisan achievement of funding  so many community-based outreach clinics in the Honoring our PACT Act  was transformational for this country, transformational for America's  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing S.  2159, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5481) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community- based outpatient clinic in Forest City, North Carolina, as the  ``Corporal Jerry K. Crump VA Clinic'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5481         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, FOREST CITY, NORTH                     CAROLINA.          The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in Forest City, North Carolina, shall after       the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated       as the ``Master Sergeant Jerry K. Crump VA Clinic''. Any       reference to such clinic in any law, regulation, map,       document, record, or other paper of the United States shall       be considered to be a reference to the Master Sergeant Jerry       K. Crump VA Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5481, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Master Sergeant J.K. Crump,  a native of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and a Korean war  veteran who embodied the courage and indomitable fighting spirit of our  Nation's Armed Forces.   This bill, H.R. 5481, as amended, will name the Department of  Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Forest City,  North Carolina, the Master Sergeant Jerry K. Crump VA Clinic.   I thank my colleague, Representative Virginia Foxx, for introducing  this bill.   In early September 1951, Master Sergeant Crump, then an 18-year-old  Army rifleman, and fellow members of Company L of the 3rd Infantry  Division were attacked by invading Chinese forces near Chorwon, Korea.  In the firefight that ensued, Master Sergeant Crump left cover twice:  first, to retrieve a wounded comrade, and then again to recapture a  machine gun from advancing Chinese soldiers.   After returning to his position, an enemy grenade was flung into the  foxhole that Master Sergeant Crump shared with four wounded  infantrymen. With no regard for his own well-being, Master Sergeant  Crump covered the explosives with his own body. The grenade detonated,  but miraculously, Master Sergeant Crump survived.   The heroism that Master Sergeant Crump displayed that day more than  70 years ago undoubtedly saved the lives of fellow soldiers and  rightfully earned him the Medal of Honor, our highest military  decoration for valor, which President Truman awarded him in 1952.   Master Sergeant Crump went on to serve another 26 years in the U.S.  Army before retiring in 1976. He died a year later and was interred at  the Mount Zion Community Cemetery in Cornelius, North Carolina.   Master Sergeant Crump's actions in combat were emblematic of the  selfless sacrifice and devotion to duty that so many who don the  uniform of our great Nation display. He, and the generation of those  who served alongside him, truly represented the best ideals of our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R.  5481, as amended, from The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars,  and the Disabled American Veterans.

Dear Congresswoman Foxx, It is with a great deal of pride       that I endorse the naming of the Veterans Affairs (VA)       outpatient clinic in Forest City, North Carolina, after the       Medal of Honor recipient and North Carolina native, Jerry       Crump.        I am personally familiar with the facility in Forest City.       I receive my medical attention at that clinic. The Forest       City VA clinic is a wonderful facility, and the staff is       outstanding.        I have met with the American Legion members in Forest City       and in Henrietta, NC who have advocated for the renaming to       the Jerry Crump VA Medical Clinic. There are a few older       American Legion members that remember attending school with       Jerry. The communities of Forest City and Henrietta are proud       of the native son and have often advocated for this honor.       The American Legion Department of North Carolina does whole       heartily support the renaming of the Forest City VA clinic       after Medal of Honor Recipient Jerry Crump.        The honor of naming a Forest City VA Clinic after this       courageous American would be a fitting tribute to Corporal       Crump.            Respectfully,                                                    Jim Quinlan,                                                The American Legion,      Department of North Carolina.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                        Raleigh, NC, March 10, 2022.      Rep. Virginia Foxx,      Washington, DC.      Re Endorsement of naming the VA Outpatient Clinic in Forest           City, NC after MOH Recipient Jerry Crump.         Dear Rep Foxx: As the State Commander of the Veterans of       Foreign Wars of America, Department of North Carolina, I am       writing you to express full support of the naming of the VA       Outpatient Clinic in Forest City, NC, after Medal of Honor       recipient and North Carolina native, Jerry Crump. Mr. Crump       embodied the spirit of patriotism, valor. fidelity and       selfless service needed to save the Soldiers of his Platoon       from death or serious injury when they came under attack on       September 6-7, 1951 during the Korean War. Mr. Crump       heroically flung himself on a grenade from an enemy Soldier       and shielded his comrades from the blast. Naming this VA       Outpatient Clinic in his name would be a great honor to this       distinguished Soldier                                               Russell Chambers,                                                    State Commander,      Department of North Carolina.                                   ____                                         Disabled American Veterans,                                    Department of North Carolina,                                         Raleigh, NC, March 8, 2022.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Chairman Mark Takano and Ranking Member Mike Bost: On       behalf of Disabled American Veterans, Department of North       Carolina, we are honored to extend our support to the efforts       of Congresswoman Virginia Foxx to designate the Veterans       Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic in Forest City, North       Carolina, after Medal of Honor recipient and North Carolina       native, Cpl. Jerry Crump.        During the Korean War, on September 7, 1951, Cpl. Crump       embodied outstanding courage above and beyond the call of       duty to save his brothers in arms. His selflessness and       gallantry inspired his comrades to aggressively counterattack       and drive enemy forces from their perimeter. In memorializing       his name may everyone who enters this facility remember that       all gave some and some gave all.            Sincerely,                                         Vertis R. Richardson, III,                                              Department Commander.                                                   Janice Weathers,                                               Department Adjutant.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5481,  as  [[Page H8447]]  amended. By doing so, we will bestow a befitting name on this facility  in Rutherford County, North Carolina, where so many military veterans  receive top-notch medical care.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that our good friend,  Virginia Foxx, is not here, but I thank Ranking Member Foxx for  bringing to our attention the amazing story of this American hero.   I know the gentleman from Texas shares the growing emotion that I  feel as we recognize these American heroes. It is truly remarkable.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I likewise urge all of my colleagues to join  me in passing H.R. 5481, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6722) to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs  community-based outpatient clinic in French Camp, California, as the  ``Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6722         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Richard A. Pittman was born on May 26, 1945, in French       Camp, California.        (2) Richard A. Pittman enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1965       and was later promoted to Lance Corporal.        (3) On July 24, 1966, Lance Corporal Pittman's unit, First       Platoon, Company I, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, was       moving along a trail near the Demilitarized Zone in the       Republic of Vietnam when the Marines ahead of them came under       attack.        (4) Upon hearing the attack, Lance Corporal Pittman took a       machine gun and several belts of ammunition and rushed to aid       his comrades. As he advanced, Lance Corporal Pittman       encountered intense small-arms fire at point-blank range. He       was able to return fire and silence the enemy combatants.       Continuing towards the attacked Marines, Lance Corporal       Pittman came under heavy fire from two automatic weapons,       which he was able to destroy.        (5) When Lance Corporal Pittman learned there were       additional wounded Marines further along the trail, he       endured enemy mortar and gunfire to get to them. As he       reached them, he faced an attack by 30 to 40 enemy fighters.        (6) Lance Corporal Pittman used a combination of machine-      gun fire, an enemy submachine gun, a pistol from a fallen       comrade, and a grenade to cause enemy forces to withdraw. Due       to his courageous actions, many of his wounded comrades were       saved.        (7) In recognition of his bravery that day, Richard A.       Pittman, who was then a Sergeant, was awarded the Medal of       Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 14, 1968.        (8) Richard A. Pittman retired in 1988 as a Master       Sergeant, after having served in the Marine Corps for more       than two decades.       SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, FRENCH CAMP,                     CALIFORNIA.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic in French Camp, California,       shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known       and designated as the ``Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a       reference to the ``Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6722.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of a remarkable  Californian, Master Sergeant Richard Allan Pittman, by naming VA's  brand-new, state-of-the-art outpatient clinic in French Camp,  California, the Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic.   I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Jerry McNerney of  California, for leading this legislation, which will appropriately pay  tribute to Master Sergeant Pittman, a marine who served his Nation with  honor and distinction during and after the Vietnam war.   A native of the San Joaquin Valley, Master Sergeant Pittman was born  in French Camp, California, in 1945 and graduated from Franklin High  School in nearby Stockton in 1964.   Declared legally blind in one eye, Master Sergeant Pittman was  considered medically unfit for combat by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marines, but he did not let that deter him. Set on serving in the  military, Master Sergeant Pittman somehow bluffed a vision test and  enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1965. He was soon deployed to  Vietnam.   On July 24, 1966, as his unit moved along a narrow jungle path near  the demilitarized zone, marines ahead of him came under heavy fire.  Master Sergeant Pittman immediately leaped into action, grabbing a  machine gun and several belts of ammunition as he rushed to his  comrades' defense.   Facing a frontal assault by dozens of North Vietnamese troops, Master  Sergeant Pittman boldly repelled the enemy attack by using a  combination of weapons he had at his disposal.   His actions that day no doubt saved the lives of several wounded  marines. For this ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk  of his life,'' Master Sergeant Pittman was awarded the Medal of Honor  by President Johnson in 1968.  [[Page H8448]]    He was discharged from the service that year, but Master Sergeant  Pittman chose to reenlist. He went on to serve another 18 years in the  Marines before retiring in 1988. He died in 2016 at the age of 71.   In addition to the Medal of Honor, the U.S. Armed Forces' highest  declaration for valor, Master Sergeant Pittman also received the  National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with two  bronze stars, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.   These distinctions, like the naming of this VA clinic, are just  symbols, however. The true measure of Master Sergeant Pittman's  character was revealed to the world on that July day in 1966 and is  evident in the lives of the marines that he saved.   I am humbled to be able to honor Master Sergeant Pittman's service,  and I am proud to count him among the brave and dutiful servicemen and  -women who have fought for centuries in defense of the American ideals  we hold so dear.   Mr. Speaker I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 6722  from the California delegation, as well as The American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans.                                   Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, August 1, 2022.      Chairman Jon Tester,      Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Chairman Takano, Ranking Member       Moran, and Ranking Member Bost: We write in support of H.R.       6722, legislation that would designate the Department of       Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in French       Camp, California, as the Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic.        In July of 2021, Congressman McNerney appointed a committee       of five veterans to collect and review potential names for       the clinic. He called upon local veterans to submit name       suggestions to be considered for the process. The committee       ultimately recommended naming the facility after the late       Richard A. Pittman, a highly decorated veteran who was the       embodiment of bravery and service.        Richard Pittman was born in French Camp and enlisted in the       Marines in 1965. On July 24th, 1966, his unit was moving       along a trail near the Demilitarized Zone in the Republic of       Vietnam when the Marines ahead of them came under attack.       Upon hearing this, Pittman took a machine gun and several       belts of ammunition and rushed to aid his comrades. As he       moved towards the attacked Marines, Pittman came under heavy       fire from two automatic weapons, which he was able to       destroy. When he learned there were additional wounded       Marines further along the trail, he endured enemy mortar and       gun fire to get to them. As he reached his fellow service       members, he faced an attack by 30 to 40 enemy fighters, and       used a combination of machine-gun fire, an enemy submachine       gun, a pistol from a fallen comrade, and a grenade to cause       the enemy forces to withdraw. His actions that day saved many       wounded comrades, and he was awarded the Medal of Honor by       President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 14, 1968.        We urge you to swiftly advance H.R. 6722 to recognize this       heroic veteran and his immense contribution to our nation. We       believe the Richard A. Pittman VA Clinic will serve countless       veterans throughout the region and uphold our promise to       those who gave our country their all.

Dear Chairman Tester, Chairman Takano, Ranking Member       Moran, and Ranking Member Bost: I write to inform you that       the California Department of The American Legion       wholeheartedly supports H.R. 6722, legislation that would       designate the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic in French Camp, California, as the Richard       A.

After retiring from the Marine Corps as a Master Sergeant,       Richard Pittman remained a visible and active member of the       community in the city of Stockton and San Joaquin County,       California, promoting patriotism and citizenship.        We urge you to swiftly advance H.R. 6722 to recognize this       heroic veteran and his immense contribution to our nation. We       believe the Richard A.

Re Department of California supports naming the Stockton           Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) after the late           Master Sergeant Richard Pittman, USMC (Ret).         Dearest Chairs and Ranking Members of the House and Senate       Veterans Affairs: As Commander of the Department of       California Disabled American Veterans representing over       70,000 DAV Life Members in the State of California and in       recognition of our fallen veterans and their survivors . . .       as a department of veterans--who advocate daily for the       heroes that served this nation; we sincerely support the       renaming the Stockton Community-Based Outpatient Clinic       (CBOC) after the late Master Sergeant Richard Pittman, USMC       (Ret).        Master Sergeant Pittman, received the Medal of Honor for       his Bravery for the following: While Company (I) was       conducting an operation along the axis of a narrow jungle       trail, the leading company elements suffered numerous       casualties when they suddenly came under heavy fire from a       well-concealed and numerically superior force. Hearing the       engaged marines' calls for more firepower, MSgt. Pittman       quickly exchanged his rifle for a machine gun and several       belts of ammunition, left the relative safety of his platoon,       and unhesitatingly rushed forward to aid his comrades.        Taken under intense enemy small-arms fire at point-blank       range during his advance, he returned the fire, silencing the       enemy position. As MSgt. Pittman continued to forge forward       to aid members of the leading platoon, he again came under       heavy fire from two automatic weapons which he promptly       destroyed. Learning that there were additional wounded       marines 50 yards further along the trail, he braved a       withering hail of enemy mortar and small-arms fire to       continue onward. As he reached the position where the leading       marines had fallen, he was suddenly confronted with a bold       frontal attack by 30 to 40 enemy.        Totally disregarding his safety, he calmly established a       position in the middle of the trail and raked the advancing       enemy with devastating machine-gun fire. His weapon rendered       ineffective, he picked up an enemy submachine gun and,       together with a pistol seized from a fallen comrade,       continued his lethal fire until the enemy force had       withdrawn. Having exhausted his ammunition except for a       grenade which he hurled at the enemy; he then rejoined his       platoon.        MSgt. Pittman's daring initiative, bold fighting spirit,       and selfless devotion to duty inflicted many enemy       casualties, disrupted the enemy attack, and saved the lives       of many of his wounded comrades.        We feel that this is a non-controversial name--in fact, one       that reflects great credit on our San Joaquin County       community, and which will serve as an inspiration to the       clinic's staff and to the veterans whom they will serve.        Please join me in honoring the incredible life of Master       Sergeant Richard Pittman, USMC (Ret) and signing onto the       letter of support to the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs       Committee.        Thank you for your support of America's disabled veterans       and their survivors.            Sincerely,      Michael Kerr,        Commander.

It will serve Stockton-area veterans  well for decades to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  6722, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney), my friend, the author of this legislation,  who serves on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology.

VA                     MEDICAL CENTER.         The medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs       located in Memphis, Tennessee, shall, after the date of the       enactment of this Act, be known and designated as the ``Lt.       Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center''. Any reference in       any law, regulation, map, document, paper, or other record of       the United States to such medical center shall be considered       to be a reference to the Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA       Medical Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6863.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Lieutenant Colonel Luke  Joseph Weathers, Jr., a combat fighter pilot with the legendary  Tuskegee Airmen, the first ever African-American air traffic controller  in Memphis, and a trailblazing advocate for African Americans' military  service.   The bill before us, H.R. 6863, would appropriately name the VA's  medical center in Memphis, Tennessee, the Lieutenant Colonel Luke  Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center.   Lieutenant Colonel Weathers embodied service to country in a way that  we all can admire. Born in 1922 in Mississippi, Lieutenant Colonel  Weathers moved to Memphis, Tennessee, at age 5, the place he would call  home for decades after.   After graduating from Xavier University in 1942, Lt. Col. Weathers  returned to Memphis where he read a newspaper article about the newly  created aviation cadet program in Tuskegee, Alabama, one of the first  such programs in the country meant for aspiring African-American  pilots.   Despite the racial discrimination he endured, Lieutenant Colonel  Weathers secured a one-on-one meeting with Memphis political boss E.H.  Crump, who personally recommended Weathers' nomination to the Tuskegee  program to President Roosevelt. From there, Lieutenant Colonel Weathers  began his distinguished military service, fighting as a combat pilot  among the legendary Red Tails during World War II.   His noble accomplishments during the war included shooting down two  German planes while protecting U.S. Army Air Corps bombers and shooting  down two additional enemy aircraft in Italy while escorting a damaged  B-24 Liberator bomber.   Even after the war, Lieutenant Colonel Weathers' service to his  country continued. In 1960, he became an air traffic control specialist  with the Federal Aviation Administration, and soon after he became the  first Black air traffic controller in Memphis.   Lieutenant Colonel Weathers retired in 1985, all the while serving as  a reservist in the military for 23 years. In retirement, he advocated  tirelessly on behalf of African Americans in the military, paving the  way for generations of citizens to serve this country honorably, just  as he did.   Lieutenant Colonel Weathers' lifetime of service earned him multiple  honors and awards, including the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007,  alongside 300 surviving Tuskegee Airmen.   Lieutenant Colonel Weathers passed away in October 2011. Today, he  and the Tuskegee Airmen continue to be a symbol of justice,  determination, and solidarity, ideals which embody the very best of  this country.   The naming of the Memphis VA Medical Center in Lieutenant Colonel  Weather's honor is a fitting tribute to his lifetime of service.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 6863  from The American Legion, the VFW, and Disabled American Veterans, as  well as the Tennessee delegations of the House and Senate.

Steve Cohen,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Cohen: Please accept this letter as a       demonstration of the total support of the American Legion       Department of Tennessee, in recognition of renaming the       Memphis Veterans Administration Medical Center in Memphis,       Tennessee as ``Lieutenant Colonel ``Luke'' Weathers Veterans       Medical Center.''        Lieutenant Colonel Weathers was a Grenada Mississippi       native and was the first-ever black Air Traffic Controller in       Memphis. Lieutenant Colonel Weathers was a member of the       famed Tuskegee Airman from 1942 to 1945.        The Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 missions over North Africa       and Europe during the Second World War. Luke downed two       German fighter planes that attacked Army Air Force Bombers       that he had been charged with escorting.        Lt Colonel Weathers, like other Tuskegee Airmen during       World War II, conducted missions throughout Northern Africa       and Europe for allied Forces and when Lt Colonel Weathers       returned to Memphis from the war in 1945, he was presented       with a parade down Beale Street and with the job       opportunities for a star black pilot were scarce and Luke       Weathers was fortunate to obtain a job as the first black air       traffic controller at the FAA in Memphis.        The American Legion Department of Tennessee would like to       honor his amazing legacy of service to God, Country, his       fellow veterans, and his community of Memphis, TN with our       full support and we wholeheartedly support and encourage the       committee to sponsor and support legislation naming the new       Aurora Veterans Clinic after this distinguished WWII Veteran.        On behalf of the 20,000 members of The American Legion in       Tennessee I am proud to fully, endorse this effort.            Sincerely,                                                Larry V.

Re Support Legislation in Naming the Memphis VAMC After Lt.           Col. Luke Weathers Jr.       Congressman Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Bost: Disabled American Veterans (DAV)       Department of Tennessee, with its membership of over 17,600       Veterans; wishes to support a legislative initiative by       Congressman Steve Cohen in naming the Memphis VA Medical       Center after Lt. Col. Luke Weathers Jr. Lt. Col. Weathers       flew as one of the original Tuskegee Airman with the ``Red       Tails'' during World War II and later returned to Memphis,       Tennessee to work in aviation and serve as a mentor to many       in the military and aviation communities. Weathers, who died       in October in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 90, was credited       with shooting down two Messerschmitt 109's in Italy while       escorting a damaged B-24 Liberator bomber in 1944. He       returned to a parade in his honor in his home town of Memphis       in 1945 and was given the keys to the city.        DAV Department of Tennessee's membership would appreciate       your support in honoring Lt. Col. Weathers by naming the       Memphis, Tennessee VA Medical Center after him. Thank you for       your consideration in this matter.            Sincerely,      Michael L. Harman, II,        Commander, Department of Tennessee, Disabled American       Veterans.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2022.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: Please accept       this letter as a demonstration of our support for H.R. 6863,       a bill that would designate the Memphis Veterans Affairs       Medical Center (VAMC) in Memphis, Tennessee as the ``Lt. Col.       Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical Center.''        Luke Joseph Weathers, Jr. was born in Grenada, Mississippi       and moved to Memphis, Tennessee when he was five. He       graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Memphis       and Xavier University in New Orleans. He then enlisted in a       training program for Black pilots, beginning his journey as a       Tuskegee Airman in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Weathers flew       with the ``Red Tails'' in North Africa, Italy, France, and       Germany. He served with distinction, rising to the rank of       Lieutenant Colonel and receiving numerous honors and awards       throughout his career.        At the end of the Second World War, Lt. Col. Weathers       returned to Memphis where he received a hero's welcome and a       key to the city. He participated in a war bond effort,       raising $1.5 million, the most raised by any African American       Group. In honor of this achievement, a B-24 Liberator was       named ``Spirit of Beale Street.''        Weathers began a career as an Air Traffic Control       Specialist and in 1965 became the first Black air traffic       controller in Memphis. Throughout his life, he remained       active with the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. and was a mentor to       countless youth who had an interest in the military or       aviation.        It is fitting to have the Memphis VAMC to be named after a       veteran with such a distinguished career and who represents       the city so well. We are proud to support this effort.            Sincerely,      Tim Burchett,      Jim Cooper,      Scott DesJarlais,      Mark E.

Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: We write to       express our support for H.R. 6863, a bill that would name the       Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Memphis,       Tennessee the ``Lt. Col. Luke Weathers, Jr. VA Medical       Center.''        Luke Joseph Weathers, Jr. was born in Grenada, Mississippi       and moved to Memphis, Tennessee at age five. Upon his       graduation from Booker T. Washington High School and Xavier       University, he enlisted in a training program for African-      American pilots. Upon completion, he began his career as a       Tuskegee Airman in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Weathers flew       with the ``Red Tails'' in North Africa, Italy, France, and       Germany. He was decorated with honors and awards throughout       his career. For his exemplary service, Weathers rose to the       rank of Lieutenant Colonel.        Lt. Col. Weathers received a hero's welcome and a key to       the city upon his return to Memphis following World War II.       He then raised $1.5 million in a war bond effort--the most of       any African-American Group. A B-24 Liberator was named the       ``Spirit of Beale Street'' to honor this great achievement.        In 1965, Lt. Col. Weathers became the first African-      American air traffic controller in Memphis. He would spend       the rest of his career as an Air Traffic Control Specialist.       He remained active with the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. throughout       his life and mentored countless youth with interests in the       military or aviation.        It is fitting to have the Memphis VAMC named after a       veteran with such a distinguished career, who embodied the       spirit of the Volunteer State. We wholeheartedly support this       effort.            Sincerely,      Marsha Blackburn,        U.S. Senator.      Bill Hagerty,        U.S. Senator.     Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), my very good friend, who is the author of this  legislation. He serves on the Committee on the Judiciary as chairman of  the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Subcommittee. He  also serves on  [[Page H8452]]  the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be associated with the  passage of this bill to honor Lieutenant Colonel Weathers. I have the  distinction of representing the University of California, Riverside,  where resides the Tuskegee Airmen Archives.   I am reminded by the Speaker's presence on the dais and the presence  of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ellzey) that you are both veterans and  that serving our veterans and remembering our veterans is not about two  colors. It is not about red or blue, but it is about red, white, and  blue, and that all colors of America have fought for the three colors,  and they bled one color.   It is important for us to remember the poignancy of our segregated  fighting units of World War II, the last war in which we had segregated  fighting units, and mark the progress that this country has made and  that we must continue to make, so it is fitting that I call on all my  colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 6863.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7903) to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs  community-based outpatient clinic in Canton, Michigan, as the ``Major  General Oliver W. Dillard VA Outpatient Clinic,'' as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7903         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DESIGNATION OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC LOCATED IN                     CANTON, MICHIGAN.

Dillard VA       Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 7903, as amended.  [[Page H8453]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Major General Oliver  William Dillard, Sr., a decorated soldier, an exemplary Army  intelligence officer, and a pioneer for other Black and minority  military leaders.   I thank my colleague, Representative Haley Stevens, for introducing  this bill, H.R. 7903, as amended, which will designate the VA  outpatient clinic in Canton, Michigan, as the Major General Oliver W.  Dillard VA Outpatient Clinic.   Originally from Margaret, Alabama, deep in the Jim Crow South, Major  General Dillard enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute at age 15 shortly  after the famed Tuskegee Airmen program was established. He was a proud  ROTC cadet and student instructor at Tuskegee and an exceptional  student as well.   Major General Dillard postponed his academic studies, however, after  being drafted into the U.S. military in 1945. He completed basic  training at Fort McClellan, Alabama, and was sent to Bavaria, Germany,  where he served as an administrative specialist in the Army's 349th  Field Artillery Group during World War II.   Following the war, Major General Dillard chose to remain in the Army.  He completed Officer Candidate School and was assigned to the all-Black  356th Infantry Regiment at Fort Dix, New Jersey.   He served admirably throughout five campaigns in the Korean war and  graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort  Leavenworth in 1958 as one of only three Black officers in his class.   Major General Dillard later assisted a U.N. peacekeeping mission in  Monrovia, Liberia, before returning to the United States and working as  a senior intelligence officer in Washington, D.C.   In 1964, he became the first Black officer to attend the Army's  prestigious National War College and was selected to command a  battalion of the 5th Combat Support Training Brigade at Fort Dix.   He served honorably with the U.S. Military Assistance Command during  the Vietnam war, and upon his return he was promoted to brigadier  general, making him just the fifth Black flag officer in U.S. Army  history.   Major General Dillard went on to serve posts at Fort McPherson,  Georgia; Fort Hood, Texas; and Heidelberg, Germany, before retiring  from the Army after a 34-year career in 1980.   He remained committed to advancement opportunities for Black and  minority officers in his retirement and was a steadfast advocate for  equality within all branches of the Armed Forces, supporting the  overturning of the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for LGBTQ  servicemembers before it was officially repealed in 2011.   For his dutiful service to this Nation, Major General Dillard  received nine military awards and two civilian medals, including the  Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, and the  Combat Infantryman's Badge with a star.   Veterans who receive care at the VA clinic in Canton, Michigan,  should feel honored to enter a facility bearing Major General Dillard's  name. I know we, as Members of Congress, are profoundly honored and  grateful for his service to our country as well.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R.  7903, as amended, from The American Legion, VFW, and DAV, as well as  the Michigan delegation.

Dillard VA       Outpatient Clinic''.        Oliver W. Dillard was born on September 28, 1926, in       Margaret, Alabama, and began a distinguished career of       service in 1945 when he was first drafted and assigned to the       349th Field Artillery Group following basic training. He was       selected to serve as company clerk and began to work his way       through the ranks.        In January 1947, Mr. Dillard was accepted to attend the       Infantry Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, where he       received a commission as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry. He       served in command and intelligence positions in Korea,       Germany, and Vietnam. In 1965, Mr. Dillard graduated from the       National War College, becoming the first Black officer to do       so.        Throughout Major General Dillard's distinguished service       career, he held various esteemed positions and received many       military and civilian awards. He served as the first black       General Officer in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff       of Intelligence, served as Deputy Chief of Staff to the U.S.       Army Forces Command, and Deputy Chief of Staff of       Intelligence for the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. Major       General Dillard received nine military awards and two       civilian metals during his years of service, including the       Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Purple       Heart, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge with Star.        Mr. Dillard retired in 1980 from military service--US Army       as a Major General after 34 years of service and resided in       Canton, Michigan, where he later passed.        It is in recognition of this barrier breaking service to       his country that we express our support for renaming the       Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Canton, Michigan in       his honor. We appreciate your time and consideration of this       of this important matter. We look forward to working with you       to recognize the life and service of Major General Dillard.

Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman       Takano, and Ranking Member Bost: We write in support of H.R.       7903, a bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic in Canton, Michigan, as the       ``Major General Oliver W.

Major General Dillard retired from military service in 1980       and resided in Canton, Michigan, until his passing in 2015.       In recognition of Mr. Dillard's exemplary service to his       country, we express our strong support for renaming the       Canton, Michigan Department of Veterans Affairs community-      based outpatient clinic in his honor and ask for the       Committee's consideration of this important matter.        Sincerely,      Debbie Stabenow,        U.S. Senator.      Gary C. Peters,        U.S. Senator.                                   ____                 The American Legion, Department of Michigan       Submitted By Department Legislative Committee      Subject Naming the Canton V.A. CBOC                               RESOLUTION 22-17         Whereas, Oliver W. Dillard Sr. lived in Canton, Michigan at       the time of his passing; and        Whereas, Oliver W.

Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, Canton, Michigan,       the Major General Oliver W. Dillard Sr. Department of       Veterans Affairs Health Clinic''.                                   ____                                           Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                          Department of Michigan,                                           Lansing, MI, May 4, 2022.      Representative Haley Stevens,      Washington, DC.        To the Hon. Representative Haley Stevens: The Veterans of       Foreign Wars Department of Michigan enthusiastically supports       the renaming of the VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic,       Canton, Michigan to be the ``Major General Oliver W. Dillard       Sr. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Clinic''.        Major General Oliver W. Dillard Senior's 34 years of       exemplary service to our Nation cannot be understated, and       the renaming of this facility is a small step towards       recognizing his incredible service to our Nation. Through the       renaming of this facility, our Nation can begin to express       its gratitude for all he represented for his accomplishments       during his service and in breaking down barriers for African       American service members: his graduation as the first African       American from the National War College in 1965; being       selected as the first African American U.S. Army Forces       Command Deputy Chief of Staff, Intelligence, and being       recognized in the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and       Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame just to name a few.        We thank you for your endurance of bringing this task to       our attention allowing us to recognize those who served our       Nation honorably.      Kevin A. Conklin,        State Commander,        Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Michigan.      Derek Blumke,        State Adjutant & Quartermaster,        Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Michigan.                                   ____                                         Disabled American Veterans,                                          Department of Michigan,                                   Fraser, Michigan, April 28, 2022.      The Office of Congresswoman Haley Stevens:        To Whom It May Concern: The Disabled American Veterans,       Department of Michigan supports Congresswoman Haley Stevens'       initiative to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic in Canton, Michigan, as the       ``Major General Oliver W. Dillard VA Outpatient Clinic''.        The DAV Department of Michigan believes naming the Canton       Outpatient Clinic in honor of General Dillard is a fitting       tribute to his dedication to duty and selfless sacrifices       over a lifetime of service to our country. General Dillard is       not only an inspiration to all of us who have served, but       also to generations of future veterans that will answer our       nations call.            Sincerely,                                                    Paul Kaiser,                                                           Adjutant,                                        DAV Department of Michigan.     Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Stevens) and all Members of the Michigan delegation for their  initiative on this bill.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), who serves on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), another very good friend, who is the author of  this legislation. She serves on the Education and Labor Committee, on  which I also serve, and as the chairwoman of the Research and  Technology Subcommittee on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I share the sentiment of my colleague from Texas. You cannot be  indifferent to the stories as we read the accounts of these great  American heroes. I am personally affected by the part of Major General  Dillard's history in terms of his opposition to Don't Ask, Don't Tell  way before it was overturned. The fact that he himself knew the sting  of discrimination and could not brook that this discrimination would  apply to any other group of Americans is especially poignant to me.   I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for bringing Major General  Dillard to our attention to memorialize him in the way that she has  done.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 7903, as  amended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7925) to designate the outpatient clinic of the Department  of Veterans Affairs in Palm Desert, California, as the ``Sy Kaplan  Veterans Center'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7925         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DESIGNATION OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     COMMUNITY-BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC LOCATED IN                     PALM DESERT, CALIFORNIA.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic located in Palm Desert,       California, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act       be known and designated as the ``Sy Kaplan VA Clinic''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Sy Kaplan VA Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 7925, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Technical Sergeant  Seymour ``Sy'' Kaplan, a wounded warrior, a World War II veteran, and a  decades-long advocate for other veterans living in the Coachella Valley  of southern California.   I thank my colleague, a fellow Californian and member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, Dr. Raul Ruiz, for his work on this bill,  which will designate a brand-new VA outpatient clinic in Palm Desert,  California, the Sy Kaplan VA Clinic.   The state-of-the-art Palm Desert clinic provides primary care,  behavioral health services, and preventative medicine to thousands of  veterans in the Inland Empire as part of VA's Loma Linda Healthcare  System.   Sergeant Kaplan enlisted in the military in 1942 and served overseas  as a combat engineer in northern Africa, Italy, and France. He fought  under  [[Page H8456]]  General Patton in the Battle of the Bulge, which helped ensure Allied  victory in the Second World War. In 1945, he was seriously wounded by  an enemy mortar attack during a bridge-building mission in  Czechoslovakia.   For his heroism, Sergeant Kaplan earned three battle stars and two  Purple Hearts and returned home 100 percent disabled.   His injuries did not impede Sergeant Kaplan's unwavering commitment  to our Nation's veterans, however. For 25 years, he served as commander  of Disabled American Veterans Chapter 78 in the Coachella Valley. In  this role, Sergeant Kaplan assisted countless veterans, helping ease  their transition back to civilian life and providing them with a tight- knit sense of community.   His passion, leadership, and sense of purpose were evident to all who  knew him.   Following a lifetime of service, Sergeant Kaplan passed away in April  2019, not long after celebrating his 95th birthday. His legacy  continues, however, in the grateful community of those whose lives he  touched.   I am happy to know that for generations of veterans to come, this VA  facility will honor Sergeant Kaplan's memory.   H.R. 7925, as amended, has been endorsed by The American Legion, DAV,  and Veterans of Foreign Wars.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 1925  from The American Legion, VFW, and Disabled American Veterans, as well  as the California delegation.

TAL Department of California is       proud to support your legislation, designating the outpatient       clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Palm Desert,       California, as the, Sy Kaplan Veterans Center''.        By naming the Palm Desert outpatient clinic after United       States Army Technical Sergeant, Seymour ``Sy'' Kaplan, not       only memorializes his contributions and sacrifices made       fighting in North Africa, Italy and France during World War       II, but also underscores his significant contributions       towards Veterans Advocacy in the Palm Desert area. This       advocacy was instrumental in the opening of the very VA       clinic your legislation hopes to name after him.        Thank you again for your leadership and advocacy of all       veterans. TAL Department of California recognizes all the       work that went into this effort and wholeheartedly supports       this legislation.

Sergeant Kaplan's service to our country in WWII is       impressive. He not only gave his all during his service, but       he also continued that back at home in service to veterans       and with the same commitment. His legacy is worthy of and in       line with this Department's desires to pay honor to our       servicemen and women by naming California veteran facilities       after them.        On behalf of the 61,000+ combat veterans of this       Department, we thank you for recognizing our nation's heroes.            Sincerely,                                                    Dawn M.

Hon. Raul Ruiz M.D.        Dear Congressman Ruiz: I am writing this letter of       endorsement to rename the Desert Clinic the Seymour (Sy)       Kaplan Desert Clinic. This is an Honor he richly deserves.       Mr. Kaplan, a force to be reckoned with, was the catalyst in       the establishment of the clinic. His tireless commitment to       all veterans was inspiring. A highly decorated war hero, Mr.       Kaplan spent a lifetime giving to the veteran community, not       only in the desert community but the State of California.        I thank you in advance for all your consideration in this       matter.

Dear Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran: We write in       support of H.R. 7925, legislation to rename the Palm Desert       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic after       Sy Kaplan.        Sy Kaplan served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945 as a       combat engineer. He rose to the rank of Technical Sergeant       and earned three Battle Stars and two Purple Hearts. In April       1945 he was grievously wounded in an enemy mortar attack in       Czechoslovakia and returned to the U.S. a wounded warrior.

Additionally, he was instrumental in the opening       of the VA Clinic in Palm Desert which we wish to name in his       honor.

JOSEPH MAXWELL CLELAND ATLANTA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER.         (a) Designation.--The medical center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, shall       after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and       designated as the ``Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department       of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' or the ``Joseph Maxwell       Cleland Atlanta VA Medical Center''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in a law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed       to be a reference to the Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta       Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on S. 3369.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for S. 3369, a bill that will  appropriately rename the Atlanta VA Medical Center in Decatur, Georgia,  in honor of Joseph Maxwell Cleland, an Army veteran, an American  statesman, and a distinguished public servant for more than 50 years.   Senator Cleland, who died a year ago this month, long displayed a  commitment to assisting disabled American veterans, so it is fitting  that part of his enduring legacy includes the naming of this facility,  which provides care to so many Georgia men and women who raised their  hands and answered the call to serve.   I thank Senator Raphael Warnock for championing this legislation,  which unanimously passed the Senate this summer, and I also acknowledge  the work of my colleague Representative Nikema Williams for introducing  a House companion to the bill.   Senator Cleland was born in Atlanta in 1942 and raised a couple of  hours away in Lithonia, Georgia. He was an exemplary student at  Lithonia High School and went on to study American history at Stetson  University in central Florida and Emory University in Atlanta.   Senator Cleland received a military commission through Stetson's ROTC  program. He volunteered for service in the Vietnam war in 1967 and was  promoted to Army captain.   On April 8, 1968, with a month left on his tour, Senator Cleland and  other members of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Calvary Regiment were dropped  by helicopter on a hillside outside Khe Sanh to set up a radio relay  station. Senator Cleland reached down to pick up a grenade he thought  had fallen from his flak jacket when the grenade exploded, causing  several injuries to his lower body. Both of Senator Cleland's legs and  his right forearm were amputated, and the Senator, then just 25 years  old, used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.   For his meritorious service and gallantry in action, Senator Cleland  was awarded the Bronze and Silver Stars.   Upon his return to the U.S., Senator Cleland was elected to the  Georgia Senate, becoming the youngest member and only Vietnam veteran  in that body.   In 1976, he was appointed to the staff of the U.S. Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee, where he investigated hospitals in the Veterans  Administration healthcare system and their treatment of wounded  servicemembers returning from Vietnam.   The following year, at age 34, President Carter tapped Senator  Cleland to head the Veterans Administration,  [[Page H8458]]  making him the youngest administrator in VA history and the first  Vietnam veteran to serve in this role.   As VA administrator, Senator Cleland was instrumental in creating the  Vet Center program, which decades later still provides a wide range of  counseling services to veterans who experience trauma, loss, grief, and  pain as a result of their military service. In doing so, Senator  Cleland saved and improved the lives of an untold number of veterans.  He advanced the conversation around the unseen wounds of war and helped  reduce the stigma that all too often surrounds a veteran who seeks  needed mental health care.   Following 12 years of service as Georgia's Secretary of State,  Senator Cleland was elected to the United States Senate in 1996.   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Cleland  continued to be a forceful advocate for veterans and sought to improve  military recruitment and retention, pay, and compensation, and pension  and health benefits.   He played a critical role in the effort to allow former  servicemembers to pass unused GI Bill benefits on to their dependent  children, an initiative that has given generations of veteran families  the opportunity to receive an affordable education.   Following his electoral defeat in 2002, Senator Cleland was appointed  to the 9/11 Commission but resigned shortly thereafter and was critical  of the George W. Bush administration's lack of transparency regarding  key documents and government witnesses the Commission requested.   In 2009, President Obama selected Senator Cleland to lead the  American Battle Monuments Commission, an independent government agency  that manages 26 American cemeteries and 30 memorials, monuments, and  markers abroad.   For those who have not visited any of these sites, I highly recommend  that you do so.                                time  1515    This past Memorial Day, I led a congressional delegation to two ABMC  cemeteries: the North Africa American Cemetery in Tunisia and the  Cambridge American Cemetery in the United Kingdom. These sites serve as  a solemn reminder of those who made the ultimate sacrifice to our  Nation during the First and Second World Wars, and they truly uphold  the words of General John J. Pershing, Commander of the American  Expeditionary Forces in World War I and the first chairman of the ABMC  who promised that, through these monuments, ``time will not dim the  glory of their deeds.''   It is my hope that the same will be true in naming this hospital, one  of the largest in the VA healthcare system, in Senator Cleland's  memory.   S. 3369 has been strongly endorsed by The American Legion, Veterans  of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans, and I implore all of  my colleagues to pass this bill today without further delay.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Senator Warnock and Representative  Williams for proposing this legislation and for their tireless work on  behalf of our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop). Chairman Sanford Bishop is a very good friend who  serves as a subcommittee chair on the Appropriations Committee. He is a  cardinal and also a former member of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very heartfelt  remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I will just say  that I take note that Senator Cleland had much to do with the  establishment of vet centers. I know from the experience of my own  veterans how much vet centers make a difference in their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for S. 3369  from The  [[Page H8459]]  American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American  Veterans, as well as the Georgia delegation.                                                The American Legion,                                           Department of Georgia,                                      Stockbridge, GA, May 16, 2022.      Representative Nikema Williams,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Williams and Senator Warnock: The       American Legion Department of Georgia is in full support of       H.R. 6244 and S. 3369: the Max Cleland VA Medical Center Act.        We respectfully implore and sincerely request that the U.S.       Congress rename the Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs       Medical Center as: ``The Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta       Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.''        Senator Cleland's distinguished service and noble legacy       are still remembered by his fellow Georgians, the nation, and       the countless veterans whose lives were greatly improved as a       result of his commitment to better healthcare and veterans'       services. Renaming the Atlanta VA Medical Center is but a       fraction of the tremendous gratitude that our U.S. Congress       can do to honor a true champion of veteran affairs.        For God and Country. . .                                                    Mark Shreve,                                                    State Commander,      Department of Georgia.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                                     April 18, 2022.      Hon. Nikema Williams,      U.S. Representative (GA-05),      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Williams: On Behalf of the Veterans of       Foreign Wars Department of Georgia and as Commander of the       Department of Georgia (2021-2022), I am writing to support       the legislation as proposed by Representative Williams and       Senator Warnock (H.R. 6244/S.3369), that will rename the       Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, to the       Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs       Medical Center.                                                     Kevin Hammond,      Commander Department of Georgia.                                   ____                                                              DAV,                                                     April 13, 2022.      REF: Support of Renaming Atlanta VA Medical Center       Matt Alexis,      Legislative Assistant,      Rep. Nikema Williams (GA-05).        Georgia Delegation in the United States Congress: U.S.       Representative Nikema Williams and Senator Rev. Raphael       Warnock introduced (H.R. 6244/S. 3369) which will name the       Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in       Atlanta, Georgia, ``the Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta       department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.''        Disabled American Veterans Department of Georgia gives our       full support in naming the Atlanta VAMC for the late Senator       Joseph Maxwell Cleland.        Senator Cleland distinguished himself with numerous       meritorious accolades during his lifetime. Naming the Medical       center in his honor would be a tribute to his life's work for       veterans.        Thank you to his family and friends and for your service to       this country.            Sincerely,                                                        Sadie Hill,      Sr. Vice Commander.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                       Washington, DC, July 7, 2022.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, Committee on Veterans Affairs, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran: We are       writing to request your support to name the Atlanta       Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta,       Georgia, the Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department of       Veterans Affairs Medical Center.        Senator Max Cleland was a veteran who fought for veterans       and whose efforts indelibly changed how our nation cares for       veterans today. He volunteered for service in Vietnam in 1967       and suffered severe combat injuries in 1968, eventually       losing three of his limbs. He was awarded the Bronze Star and       Silver Star. In 1977, Senator Cleland was appointed by       fellow-Georgian President Jimmy Carter to be the youngest       ever Administrator of the Veterans Administration (VA).       Because of his efforts, the VA revamped its care of the       invisible wounds of veterans, recognized, and began to treat       post-traumatic stress disorder.        Senator Cleland was also a tireless champion of Georgia and       Georgians. Born in Atlanta and raised in Lithonia, he served       as a Georgia State Senator, Georgia Secretary of State, and       eventually U.S. Senator from Georgia. As a member of the       Armed Services Committee, he fought for Georgia's military       installations while also focused on the personnel needs of       the military. Senator Cleland played a critical role in the       expansion of GI Bill education benefits.        On November 9, 2021, at the age of 79, Senator Cleland       died, leaving behind a legacy of service, sacrifice, and joy.       He served Georgia, the nation, and, in particular, veterans       continuously during his 50 years of public service, improving       their lives in countless ways. We believe renaming the       Atlanta VA Medical Center for Senator Cleland is most       appropriate for a man who spent his live serving those who       walk its halls. We hope that the Senate Committee on Veteran       Affairs will give our request immediate consideration.            Sincerely,        Raphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, Nikema Williams, Hank Johnson,       Andrew S. Clyde, Lucy McBath, Austin Scott, David Scott,       Barry Loudermilk, Carolyn Bourdeaux, Sanford D. Bishop Jr.,       A. Drew Ferguson IV, Earl L. ``Buddy'' Carter, Rick W. Allen,       Majorie Taylor Greene, Jody Hice, Members of Congress.     So, Mr. Speaker, this is a fitting tribute. I ask all of  my colleagues to join me in passing S. 3369, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4359) to designate the regional office of the Department of  Veterans Affairs in metropolitan Atlanta as the ``Senator Johnny  Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office'', and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Johnny Isakson VA       Regional Office Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) John Hardy Isakson, known as ``Johnny'', was born       December 28, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Julia Isakson and       Edwin Andrew Isakson.

(13) During the 114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses, Johnny       Isakson served as Chairman  [[Page H8460]]       of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, a       position with which he tirelessly championed reform to       improve the benefits and quality of service for our nation's       military veterans.

SEC. 3. SENATOR JOHNNY ISAKSON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     ATLANTA REGIONAL OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs       Atlanta Regional Office in Georgia shall, after the date of       the enactment of this Act, be known and designated as the       ``Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs       Atlanta Regional Office'' or the ``Isakson VA Atlanta       Regional Office''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in a law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Regional Office referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed       to be a reference to the Senator Johnny Isakson Department of       Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 4359.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, S. 4359, which will  rename the VA regional office in metropolitan Atlanta the Senator  Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.   I knew Senator Isakson well from his years of service on the Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committee. Like many of my colleagues, my enduring  memory of Senator Isakson is that he was a reasonable man, a tireless  advocate for veterans, and was someone you could work with to find  common ground--something that is all too rare in today's political  environment.   I didn't always agree with Senator Isakson's politics, but I never  once questioned his commitment to the men and women who have served in  the U.S. military.   I worked closely with Senator Isakson on a number of significant  bills, including a wide-ranging VA reform bill--the Veterans Access,  Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014--that President Obama signed  into law during my first term in office.   The bill expanded survivor benefits and educational opportunities and  improved care for victims of sexual assault and veterans struggling  with traumatic brain injuries while making important strides toward  ensuring veterans' access to timely healthcare at VA medical centers.   Senator Isakson was heavily involved in other bipartisan initiatives  affecting our Nation's veterans, including a 2017 law intended to  improve processing of VA benefit appeals and a 2018 law giving VA the  authority to expand healthcare access to community providers.   These pieces of legislation will have a profound impact on veterans'  access to the benefits and services they rightfully earned for  generations to come, and we owe Senator Isakson a debt of gratitude for  his persistent efforts in seeing these bills through.   Senator Isakson was a veteran himself, having served as a young man  in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972. He ran his  family's real estate business for over two decades and ably represented  his constituents in the Georgia House of Representatives and the  Georgia Senate before serving in the U.S. House and Senate.   He has the distinction of being the longest-serving Republican  Senator in Georgia history, and, at a personal level, I cannot think of  a more suitable name for this VA facility--where so many civil servants  work to provide veterans the benefits they earned--than the Johnny  Isakson Regional Office.   S. 4359 was introduced by Senator Jon Ossoff, while the House  companion was led by Representative Sanford Bishop of Georgia's Second  Congressional District.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 4359  from The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled  American Veterans, as well as the Georgia delegation.                                               The American Legion,                                           Department of Georgia,                                                      June 14, 2022.      Hon.

Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affair,           Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Gentlemen of the U.S. Congress: The American       Legion Department of Georgia is in full support of S-4359:       the Senator Johnny Isakson VA Regional Act of 2022.        We respectfully implore and sincerely request that the U.S.       Congress favorably considers naming the regional office of       the Department of Veterans Affairs in metropolitan Atlanta as       the ``Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs       Atlanta Regional Office''.        Senator Isakson's distinguished himself as a tireless and       unrelenting advocate who championed reform to improve the       benefits and quality of service for our Nation's veterans. It       is our solid and steadfast position that this Act will be the       hallmark tribute to a fellow Georgian who labored to bring       about better and improved healthcare and quality veterans'       services. We are indebted to our veterans for their service       and sacrifice. Senator Isakson recognized the debt and       devoted his efforts as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs of the Senate ``to make right the master of might''.        Naming the Atlanta VA Regional Office in honor of Senator       Isakson is a step in the right direction for the sake of       veterans of the great State of Georgia and the veterans       across this great Nation.        For God and Country. . .                                                    Mark Shreve,                                   (For Z.C. Debro, Dept. Adjutant),      State Commander, Department of Georgia.                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                       Macon, Georgia, May 31, 2022.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Chairman Takano: On behalf of the Veterans of Foreign Wars       Department of Georgia and in my capacity as State Commander,       I am writing to support renaming the Atlanta VA Regional       Office to the ``Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans       Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.        As a member and former chair of the Senate Veterans'       Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson worked tirelessly to bring       oversight and accountability to the agency responsible for       providing care and support to our nation's veterans. A       veteran himself, Isakson was a member of the Senate VA       Committee since joining the Senate in 2005 and played a       crucial role in the massive VA reform bill, the Veterans'       Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.        Today, Georgia remains home to more than a dozen military       bases, as well as more than 750,000 veterans. In addition to       aiding veterans who served in years past, he has worked to       strengthen our Armed Forces and continues to show unwavering       commitment to the men and women serving our country today.       Isakson brought commonsense leadership to Congress through       bipartisan efforts to address federal spending, reduce the       debt, create jobs, and reform burdensome federal regulations.        If the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Georgia may       assist in any way to rename the Atlanta VA Regional Office to       the ``Senator Johnny Isakson Department of Veterans Affairs       Atlanta Regional Office,'' please do not hesitate to ask.            Respectfully,                                               Kevin F. Hammond,                                          VFW Department of Georgia,      State Commander.                                   ____                                       Disabled American Veterans,                                                       June 6, 2022.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman Takano       and Ranking Member Bost: The Disabled American Veterans,       Department of Georgia writes in support of legislation       sponsored by Senators Jon Ossoff, Roy Blunt, and Raphael       Warnock, renaming the Department of Veterans Affairs  [[Page H8461]]       Atlanta Regional Office, as the ``Senator Johnny Isakson       Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.''        Throughout his career, Senator Isakson was a passionate       advocate for veterans in Georgia and across the country.       Senator Isakson served in the Georgia Air National Guard from       1966 to 1972. Throughout his political career he found common       ground across the aisle in order to achieve progress, all the       while governing with compassion. As a longtime member of the       Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs he worked to serve       veterans and increase accountability at the Department of       Veterans Affairs. As Chairman of the committee, he championed       VA reforms that culminated in the Johnny Isakson and David P.       Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act       of 2020.        We believe that naming the VA Atlanta Regional Office after       Senator Isakson, a dedicated advocate and public servant,       will honor his legacy and inspire future generations of       Georgians.            Sincerely,                                                        Sadie Hill,                                                         Commander.                                   Congress of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2022.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, U.S. House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Ranking Member Moran, Chairman       Takano, and Ranking Member Bost: As members of the Georgia       congressional delegation, we write to request your support       for legislation to name the Department of Veterans Affairs       Atlanta Regional Office the, ``Senator Johnny Isakson       Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.''        Senator Johnny Isakson served veterans, the state of       Georgia, and the United States throughout his life. A native       of Atlanta and a graduate of the University of Georgia,       Senator Isakson served in the Georgia Air National Guard from       1966 to 1972. Following a successful business career, he       served in the Georgia General Assembly and Georgia State       Senate for nearly two decades, served as Chairman of the       State Board of Education, and was elected to the United       States House of Representatives.        In 2004, Senator Isakson was elected to the United States       Senate. During his fifteen years in the chamber, he earned a       reputation for courtesy, dignity, and kindness, building       relationships across the aisle for the good of the country.       Eventually, Senator Isakson rose to Chair the Senate       Committee on Veterans' Affairs, a role in which he championed       important reforms to improve the quality and accessibility of       services for our nation's military veterans.        We believe that Senator Isakson's service to the veterans       of Georgia warrants this tremendous recognition, and that       naming this facility is a fitting tribute to his legacy.       Accordingly, we respectfully request the Senate and House       Veterans' Affairs Committees' consideration and support of       this legislation.            Sincerely,        Jon Ossoff, Sanford Bishop, Austin Scott, Buddy Carter,       David Scott, Andrew Clyde, Raphael Warnock, Lucy McBath,       Barry Loudermilk, Hank Johnson, Nikema Williams, Carolyn       Bordeaux, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Rick Allen, Jody Hice, Drew       Ferguson, Members of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop) who serves as subcommittee chair on the  Appropriations Committee and also as a former member of the House of  Representatives House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 4359, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5721) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve  research conducted within the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5721         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H8462]]            SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5721, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5721, as amended, the VA  Infrastructure Powers Exceptional Research Act of 2021, or VIPER Act,  as amended, which I introduced with Ranking Member Bost.   This bipartisan bill was developed in consultation with scientific  groups and veteran service organizations. It gives VA the additional  authorities it needs to make its world-class research program even more  efficient and innovative as it works to improve the lives of the  veterans it serves.   It is no secret that VA research is a jewel in VA's crown, and we  need to ensure that VA can continue to be competitive in hiring the  finest scientists to understand, prevent, and treat health challenges  veterans face from the effects of military toxic exposures and chronic  pain to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.   VA has told us and our Senate colleagues that it urgently needs the  VIPER Act, especially to protect the nonprofit veterans research and  education foundations so critical to the VA research enterprise.   VIPER is also endorsed by major VSOs, including The American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed  Veterans of America, Minority Veterans of America, Modern Military  Association of America, and Wounded Warrior Project.   It has the strong endorsement of scientific organizations that  support the VA research program, including the American Association of  Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, America Foundation for Suicide  Prevention, American Heart Association, America Psychiatric  Association, American Physiological Association, American Thoracic  Society, Association of American Medical Colleges, Association of VA  Psychologist Leaders, Federation of American Societies for Experimental  Biology, National Association of Veterans' Research and Education  Foundations, Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs, and Veterans  Healthcare Policy Institute.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from four of these  organizations.                                       Friends of VA Medical Care                                            and Health Research,                                                   November 5, 2021.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chair, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: As members of       the Friends of VA Medical Care and Health Research (FOVA)       executive committee, we write to thank you for your       legislation, the VA Infrastructure Powers Exceptional       Research Act of 2021, or VIPER Act. The organizations       represented by the FOVA executive committee are pleased to       endorse this bill, which would provide added authority and       resources to improve the VA Medical and Prosthetic Research       program.        FOVA is a coalition founded over 30 years ago to ensure       that America's veterans receive high-quality health care       supported by veteran-centric research conducted through the       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical and Prosthetic       Research program. Today, FOVA is a diverse coalition       representing nearly 100 national academic, medical, and       scientific societies; health and patient advocacy groups; and       veteran-focused associations. FOVA works in concert with the       Independent Budget veterans service organizations.        We are pleased that Congress has worked over the last       several years in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to support       robust funding growth for VA research. Specifically, your       legislation would add stability and efficiency for the VA       research program by formally authorizing VA's Office of       Research and Development and excluding VA research from       Paperwork Reduction Act requirements, better aligning VA with       other federal research agencies. We also appreciate that the       VIPER Act would work to enhance the diversity of the VA       research workforce, increasing scientific opportunities and       leading to improved health care for veterans.        While the VIPER Act takes important steps to strengthen the       research program, additional infrastructure support for       information technology and physical laboratory improvements       continue to be necessary to ensure that VA researchers have       access to the cutting-edge technology that yields state-of-      the-art research and improved health outcomes. We understand       that you remain abreast of these issues, and we stand ready       to support any additional efforts you may undertake to       address these important research needs.        Thank you again for your efforts. We look forward to       working with you to continue this important work.            Sincerely,      The FOVA Executive Committee.                                   ____                                                      Association of                                         VA Psychologist Leaders,                                                  November 10, 2022.        The Association of VA Psychologist Leaders fully endorses       H.R. 5721: To amend title 38, United States Code, to improve       research conducted within the Department of Veterans Affairs,       and for other purposes. We believe this will bring needed       parity of private and public universities funding VA       Researchers. Many important discoveries in health  [[Page H8463]]       care originated from VA research. If VA researchers are       blocked from being compensated for their work, we will       deprive Veterans and the broader American population of new       advancements in healthcare. Further, limiting VA's research       enterprise will diminish the its attractiveness to       professional trainees and cause current staff to leave VA       service.        We appreciate Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost for       introducing this bill and we would like to offer our       endorsement and support.            Sincerely,                                               Mike Martin, PhD,                                           President, Association of      VA Psychologist Leaders.                                   ____                                             American Foundation for                                              Suicide Prevention,                                                  November 11, 2022.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: On behalf of       the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), I am       pleased to write in support of H.R. 5721, the VA       Infrastructure Powers Exceptional Research (VIPER) Act of       2021. As you know, this important legislation will provide       the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with new authorities       to facilitate research on Veterans' health outcomes, leading       to better care for our nation's Veterans and service members.        Suicide is an ongoing public health crisis in the United       States. The national suicide rate increased by 4% in 2021,       reversing progress made in 2019 and 2020. Since the year       2000, the national suicide rate has increased by 30%, and       suicide remains a leading cause of death in the United       States. This crisis is tragically prevalent among Veterans,       who face a significantly higher risk of suicide than their       civilian counterparts. In 2020, 6,146 Veterans died by       suicide, at a rate 57.3% higher than that of non-Veteran U.S.       adults.        The VIPER Act will allow the VA to grow its research       program, encourage more innovation and collaboration, and       support the recruitment and retention of data scientists and       researchers. By providing the VA with the research tools and       resources it needs, the VIPER Act will improve the lives of       Veterans and service members and help to prevent suicide       among these populations.        We thank you for your ongoing leadership in support of       Veterans and service members, and we urge the swift passage       of this legislation.            Sincerely,      Laurel Stine, J.D.,M.A.,        Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer, American       Foundation for Suicide Prevention.                                                September 20, 2022.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chair, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      Chair, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Takano, Ranking Member Bost, Chair Tester, and       Ranking Member Moran: Thank you for your continued support of       medical research addressing the health of America's veterans.       We write respectfully to urge Congress to enact as soon as       possible a bipartisan veterans bill that includes provisions       from HR 5721, the VIPER Act that will allow research       affiliations between nonprofit medical schools and Veterans'       Affairs (VA) medical centers to continue without disruption.       The VA recently issued guidance that prohibits VA employees       involved in VA research from receiving compensation from       outside sources, including a VA-affiliated Nonprofit       Education and Research Corporation or an affiliated nonprofit       medical school. This policy will be highly disruptive to       thousands of research projects focused on improving veterans'       health and led by VA scientists who hold joint appointments       with nonprofit medical schools. A limited exception to allow       outside compensation for VA researchers (enclosure) would       provide stability for these important projects.        Across the country, VA medical centers are affiliated with       nonprofit as well as public medical schools for the purpose       of improving the quality of veterans' health care, to support       medical education, and to foster medical research on       conditions affecting veterans. Projects conducted at VA       medical centers in partnership with medical schools are       advancing new therapies and treatments for a wide range of       health challenges, including cancer, diabetes, traumatic       brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic       pain. The importance of these affiliations was recently       highlighted in a May statement for the record to your       committees by the Association of American Medical Colleges,       including a recommendation of swift passage of the VIPER Act.        These very productive affiliations between VA medical       centers and medical schools are built around joint faculty       appointments, in which faculty based at the VA often derive       part of their salary from the academic institution, often       through research grants from the National Institutes of       Health or other sponsors. However, in January 2022, the VA       General Counsel issued guidance, based on advice from the       Department of Justice, stating that current federal law (18       USC 209) bars VA researchers from deriving any part of their       research compensation from non-federal sources. If the new       guidance were to take effect, VA-affiliated researchers       across the country would be required to forego external       sources of support (and thus take a cut in salary), curtail       externally-funded research (including federally-funded       projects), or attempt to relocate their clinical research       sites from the VA to facilities on medical school campuses       (which may not be possible in many cases due to space and       logistical constraints). This has the potential to interrupt       hundreds of millions of dollars invested in life-saving       biomedical research for America's veterans.        The VA is trying to avoid a disruption of the medical       research conducted at VA medical centers, but a full       resolution requires legislation. We ask that you and your       colleagues work quickly to pass a bipartisan veterans?       legislative package that includes the relevant provisions of       HR 5721 that will allow VA employees to receive outside       compensation related to their clinical and research       activities at VA medical centers. We are grateful for your       attention to this issue and for your support of university       research that benefits our veterans. We would be happy to       discuss this further at your convenience or answer any       questions.

Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill, urge our Senate colleagues to  pass it, and get it to the President by the end of the year to give VA  the authorities it needs to fix its research program issues now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5721, the VIPER  Act, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 5721, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7299) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to obtain  an independent cybersecurity assessment of information systems of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7299         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

INDEPENDENT CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT OF INFORMATION                     SYSTEMS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Independent Assessment Required.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall seek to enter into an agreement with a federally funded       research and development center to provide to the Secretary       an independent cybersecurity assessment of--        (A) five high-impact information systems of the Department       of Veterans Affairs; and        (B) the effectiveness of the information security program       and information security management system of the Department.        (2) Detailed analysis.--The independent cybersecurity       assessment provided under paragraph (1) shall include a       detailed analysis of the ability of the Department--        (A) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and       availability of the information, information systems, and       devices of the Department; and        (B) to protect against--        (i) advanced persistent cybersecurity threats;        (ii) ransomware;        (iii) denial of service attacks;        (iv) insider threats;        (v) threats from foreign actors, including state sponsored       criminals and other foreign based criminals;        (vi) phishing;        (vii) credential theft;        (viii) cybersecurity attacks that target the supply chain       of the Department;        (ix) threats due to remote access and telework activity;       and        (x) other cyber threats.        (3) Types of systems.--The independent cybersecurity       assessment provided under paragraph (1) shall cover on-      premises, remote, cloud-based, and mobile information systems       and devices used by, or in support of, Department activities.        (4) Shadow information technology.--The independent       cybersecurity assessment provided under paragraph (1) shall       include an evaluation of the use of information technology       systems, devices, and services by employees and contractors       of the Department who do so without the heads of the elements       of the Department that are responsible for information       technology at the Department knowing or approving of such       use.        (5) Methodology.--In conducting the cybersecurity       assessment to be provided under paragraph (1), the federally       funded research and development center shall take into       account industry best practices and the current state-of-the-      art in cybersecurity evaluation and review.        (b) Plan.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date on       which an independent assessment is provided to the Secretary       by a federally funded research and development center       pursuant to an agreement entered into under subsection (a),       the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a plan       to address the findings of the federally funded research and       development center set forth in such assessment.        (2) Elements.--The plan submitted under paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (A) Improvements to the security controls of the       information systems of the Department assessed under       subsection (a) to--        (i) achieve the goals specified in subparagraph (A) of       paragraph (2) of such subsection; and        (ii) protect against the threats specified in subparagraph       (B) of such paragraph.

(C) A cost estimate for implementing the plan.        (D) A timeline for implementing the plan.  [[Page H8465]]         (E) Such other elements as the Secretary considers       appropriate.        (c) Comptroller General of the United States Evaluation and       Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       submission of the plan under subsection (b)(1), the       Comptroller General of the United States shall--        (1) commence an evaluation and review of--        (A) the independent cybersecurity assessment provided under       subsection (a); and        (B) the response of the Department to such assessment; and        (2) provide to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a briefing on the       results of the evaluation and review, including any       recommendations made to the Secretary regarding the matters       covered by the briefing.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7299, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 7299, the Strengthening VA  Cybersecurity Act of 2022. This bill represents a bipartisan, bicameral  effort to oversee the Department of Veterans Affairs' cybersecurity  efforts.   This legislation requires independent assessment of the VA's  cybersecurity readiness by a federally funded research and development  center, or FFRDC.   This bill is necessary because of the poor performance of VA in  audits required by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act,  also known as FISMA, and independent audits from the VA OIG on  individual VA sites.   The bill also seeks to address the issue of ``shadow IT'' which is  has been a priority of the committee this Congress. If VA does not know  what is on its networks and can't identify assets being utilized  outside of the Office of Information Technology, then VA can't secure  it.   VA's repository of veterans' health information needs to be  protected. We owe it to veterans to address these challenges now so  that Congress and veterans can be assured that VA will secure their  personal information.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7299, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  7299, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7277) to improve the methods by which the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs identifies health care providers that are not eligible  to participate in the Veterans Community Care Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7277         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Oversight of       Veterans Community Care Providers Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. IDENTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT                     ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN VETERANS COMMUNITY                     CARE PROGRAM.         (a) Plan.--        (1) Requirement.--Beginning not later than 90 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs, acting through the Under Secretary for       Health, shall carry out a plan to improve the methods by       which the Secretary identifies health care providers that are       not eligible to participate in the Veterans Community Care       Program.        (2) Matters included.--The plan under paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (A) Modifying the standard operating procedures of the       Office of Community Care of the Veterans Health       Administration regarding the exclusion of health care       providers from participating in the Veterans Community Care       Program to require the automated continuous matching of       health care providers in the Provider Profile Management       System of the Veterans Health Administration, or such       successor system, with covered data systems using multiple       unique identifiers, including taxpayer identification number,       national provider identifier, Social Security number, and       date of birth.        (B) A fraud risk analysis conducted by the Office of       Community Care regarding the exclusion of health care       providers from participating in the Veterans Community Care       Program that includes--        (i) an assessment of the likelihood and impact of inherent       fraud risks relating to the self-certification of State       licenses and addresses provided by health care providers;        (ii) a determination of the fraud risk tolerance; and        (iii) an examination of the suitability of existing fraud       controls.        (C) Any other matters the Under Secretary determines will       improve the oversight of health care providers participating       in the Veterans Community Care Program.        (b) Certification.--Not later than 270 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall certify to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate that the Secretary has       implemented the plan under subsection (a).        (c) Reports.--        (1) Initial report.--Not later than one year after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to       the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a report that--        (A) describes the progress the Under Secretary has made in       carrying out the plan under subsection (a); and        (B) includes recommendations for legislative action to       further improve the methods by which the Secretary identifies       health care providers that are not eligible to participate in       the Veterans Community Care Program.        (2) Update.--Not later than two years after the date on       which the Secretary submits the report under paragraph (1),       the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate an       update to the report.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``covered data systems'' means the following:        (A) The List of Excluded Individuals/Entities of the Office       of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human       Services.        (B) The System for Award Management Exclusions list       described in part 9 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations,       and part 180 of title 2 of such Code, or successor       regulations.        (C) The monthly deactivation file of the National Plan and       Provider Enumeration System of the Centers for Medicare &       Medicaid Services.        (D) The National Practitioner Data Bank established       pursuant to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986       (42 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.).  [[Page H8466]]         (2) The term ``Veterans Community Care Program'' means the       program established under section 1703 of title 38, United       States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7277, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7277, the Improving Oversight  of Veterans Community Care Providers Act, as amended, a bill that will  take important steps toward ensuring that healthcare providers meet the  eligibility requirements and standards of VA's Community Care Program.   I thank Representative Chris Pappas, chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, for his  work on this bipartisan bill.   I was disturbed by a recent Government Accountability Office report  requested by Chairman Pappas and Ranking Member Tracey Mann, which  identified approximately 1,600 healthcare providers who were deceased,  ineligible to work with the Federal Government, or who had revoked or  suspended medical licenses, yet were still listed as active providers  in VA's Community Care networks.   While the number of ineligible providers was a small fraction of the  roughly 1.2 million active providers in VA's Community Care networks,  they still represented a potential threat to veteran health and safety,  and a risk for financial fraud.   Congressman Pappas' bill would require VA to implement GAO's  recommendations to ensure veterans and taxpayers are not put at risk.   The bill will modify standard operating procedures at the VA Health  Administration and require continuous matching of providers'  information against several data sources in order to verify  eligibility, such as the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities that  the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector  General maintains, the National Practitioner Data Bank, and the monthly  deactivation file of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   This will go a long way toward ensuring that physicians and other  providers in VA's Community Care networks meet the basic and necessary  standards, such as proper and current licensing requirements.   This bill has the support of the American Legion, Disabled American  Veterans, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The Congressional Budget  Office estimates that it will have no significant impact on direct  spending or deficits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend, who is the author of this  legislation and who serves as the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this important  piece of legislation, H.R. 7277, as amended, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2250) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  management of information technology projects and investments of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2250, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs Information  Technology Reform Act requires VA to report on the cost, schedule, and  performance information for major information technology projects. A  major information technology project is a project that exceeds $500  million in total life cycle costs.   H.R. 2250, as amended, also requires VA to ensure that each major IT  project is managed by an interdisciplinary team. The bill is necessary  due to the numerous issues that the VA has had with technology  modernization and management of its major IT programs. This bill  provides Congress with key information to conduct proper oversight over  those programs.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill. I urge all my  colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that I know this  Congress, the 117th Congress, is coming to a close and I may not see  you up on the rostrum and the dais again, I wanted to say mahalo for  your service in our military, mahalo for your service to the people of  Hawaii, mahalo for your service to the American people.   I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2250, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
