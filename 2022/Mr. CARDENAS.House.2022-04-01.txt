 Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Insulin Now Act is a just  act.   This personal affliction of diabetes affects millions of families  every day. The price of insulin is too much for hardworking American  families, and the Affordable Insulin Now Act is something that is going  to bring life to individuals and opportunity for families.   My father died from diabetes 10 days before our son Cristian was  born. I hoped and prayed that he would live long enough so I could  present him to his grandfather, but that didn't happen. That is what  this affliction does. It robs time. It robs the life out of people, and  that doesn't need to happen.   For $35 a month--no, not hundreds of dollars--this act will help  relieve families.   I thank Representatives Craig, Kildee, and McBath for introducing  this bill.
