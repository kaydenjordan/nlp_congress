 Madam Speaker, democracies die when one party seizes  control of the elections process, eliminates the safeguards that have  protected the integrity of the ballot, places restrictions on free  speech, and seizes the earnings of others to promote candidates they  may abhor. That is the bill before us today.   The most dangerous provision nationalizes the mass mailing of ballots  to voter rolls that contain untold numbers of people who have moved or  died. It allows ballot harvesters to knock on doors and collect these  ballots. There is no chain of custody from the time the ballot is  mailed until the time it is returned.   Ballots can be cast weeks before the election under the duress of  family, friends, or precinct workers. Even if it doesn't rob our  elections of their actual legitimacy, it certainly robs them of their  perceived legitimacy, destroying the trust that the loser of any  election must have to accept the winner was rightful. That is the  bitter legacy of the last election under these practices.   Why would anyone want to institutionalize them?
