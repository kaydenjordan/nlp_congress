 Madam President, Senator Lummis's amendment targets new  oil and gas leases that the administration instituted while the  Department of Interior reviews our Federal and oil gas leasing program.  I, too, am eager to see the results of that review and was hoping we  would have received it by now.   I will continue to be vocal on my advocacy for American energy  independence and addressing climate change through innovation, not  elimination. However, drilling continued on existing leases throughout  the time, and Secretary Haaland testified before the Energy Committee  that the Department is in compliance with the recent court order, which  still allows leasing.   I believe the administration has the responsibility to evaluate these  programs and to make sure that we are getting a reasonable return for  the taxpayers, while using our abundant resources in the most  responsible way. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to reject the  amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3104     Madam President, I rise also in support of my  colleague's amendment.   Climate change is a global issue. We need to deploy all the climate  solutions that we can if we are going to meet our global climate goals.  That includes coupling the use of our abundant resources with  technologies like CCUS that will ensure that we can use them in the  cleanest way possible. We need to continue to do more to bring down the  cost of these critical technologies and expedite the wide-scale  deployment both domestically and abroad, including in countries like  China and India, that are aggressively expanding their fossil fuel  fleets as we speak.   If the United States of America gets out of fossil fuels, I will  guarantee you there won't be another country to step up to the plate to  do the research and development it takes to combat climate change. So I  urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.   (Chorus of ``voice vote.'')                          Vote on Amendment No. 3284     Mr. President.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition.   This makes no sense whatsoever. First of all, our friends--no one  voted on that side for the ARP. Next of all, this was done to help  people with the programs that were going, who needed help. It was not  intended to use people's tax dollars to regive them to the States so  the States could look like they were reducing the taxes by not using  the money. That's ridiculous. We should not be supporting this  whatsoever. It makes no sense at all.    Mr. President, Senator Lee's amendment sets up a  deficit-neutral reserve fund to change the payment formula for the  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program.   While I share a desire to revisit the PILT formula and to ensure that  payments to counties are fair, I have concerns with this amendment.   The administration has testified that trying to incorporate a system  into the PILT formula that involves appraising every parcel of Federal  land and tracking every local tax rate would prove nearly impossible to  administer.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.  [[Page S6232]]                               Vote on AmendmentNo. 3141     Madam President, I have made it crystal clear that I do  not support the For the People Act.   Over the past few months, I have worked to eliminate the far-reaching  aspects of that bill and amend the legislation to make sure our  elections are fair, accessible, and secure.   In June, I voted to begin debate in the Senate on my amended voting  rights legislation, not For the People Act. Tonight, I am again voting  to move that process forward because I believe that we need to come  together to restore people's faith in the integrity of our elections.   But I do make it very clear that I will not support the For the  People Act. For example, I firmly believe that we need commonsense  voter ID requirements, just like we have in West Virginia, that  strengthen the security of our elections without making it harder for  Americans to vote.   I also firmly believe that we shouldn't politicize the Federal  Election Commission, prohibit any guardrails on vote by mail, or  prevent local election officials from doing basic maintenance of voter  rolls.   The compromise bill we voted on in June included all of these  important provisions, and I urge my colleagues, Democrats and  Republicans, to allow us to debate this critical issue and come up with  a bipartisan solution that protects every American's right to vote.
