 Mr. Speaker, this week the House considers the ``Wrong''  CHOICE Act, so I have one question for this body: Has this House  completely forgotten how much pain the housing crisis that triggered  the Great Recession has caused the American people?   Eleven million people lost their homes; 8 million Americans lost  their jobs; people lost their life savings--and that was not some sort  of an accident of history. It was the effect of bad policy that allowed  financial institutions to prey upon unwitting customers and take  everything that they have worked for. That is what precipitated this  crisis. It wasn't a storm. It was bad policy.   And so what do we have? A bill that will take us right back to where  we were, to the conditions that caused the financial crisis in the  first place, and take the cop off the beat, essentially eliminating the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect people.   We cannot do this. Let's reject this bill.                            ____________________
