 Will the gentleman yield?    Could the majority leader give us some idea so, when  Members leave, they will have some idea of next week's schedule?   I know we are going to discuss that tomorrow as well, but it might be  useful to do it tonight as well, just to give them an overview.    If the gentleman will continue to yield, I thank him for  giving us an update. I also thank him for the consideration of our  Members who live in the southeast and scheduling Harvey early and then  no votes subsequent to that because I have had a lot of my Members talk  to me about, as you point out, their desire to get home as quickly as  possible with their constituents and with their families.
