 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  bringing this forward.   The Marines United website was a disgusting breach of trust, and I  immediately called for the perpetrators to be prosecuted. I appreciate  General Neller coming to Congress earlier this year, taking ownership  of the problem, immediately establishing a task force, and conducting  multimedia and personal engagements across the Marine Corps.  [[Page H4480]]    He said he would deal with this immediately and decisively, and we  demand nothing less. I take him at his word, and he was clear in asking  to be held accountable.   While the Navy and Marine Corps have updated policies regarding  social media and established no-tolerance policies for nonconsensual  pornography, these still need to apply across all the services and must  be codified into law. For this reason, I support the PRIVATE Act, and I  hope that we continue to work together with my colleagues to ensure  that this bill becomes law.   Mr. Speaker, as the scandal unfolded, it became clear to me that,  even from initial recruitment, servicemembers must be held to the  highest ethical standard online, and prevented from joining the  military should their behavior fail to meet that standard.   Our children live their lives online, and the laws need to be updated  to reflect that. The issue of nonconsensual pornography, unfortunately,  is prevalent across our society. It has no place anywhere, but  especially not in our military ranks.
