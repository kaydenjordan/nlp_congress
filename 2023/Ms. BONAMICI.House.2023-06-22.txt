 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 461, a harmful  resolution that condemns public schools for showing humanity in helping  vulnerable people.   Listening to this debate, it sounds like my colleagues are interested  in working on some bipartisan migration reform. We would welcome that-- policies that would help our immigration  [[Page H3092]]  system run more smoothly and effectively--but that is not what we are  doing here today.   Throughout this Congress, I have heard my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle claim that American education is in crisis. Are there  needs in our public schools? Absolutely. We need more mental health  counselors, we need resources to address mislearning and policies to  address gun violence, but is that what the majority is focusing on? No.   When my Republican colleagues felt threatened by the accurate  teaching of history, they passed legislation that provides a blueprint  for book bans. When my Republican colleagues felt threatened by the  Biden administration's inclusive interpretation of Title IX, what did  they do? They passed legislation to ostracize trans students and allow  discrimination in sports. When my colleagues felt uncomfortable about  reducing the crushing debt burden faced by students who choose to go to  college, they passed legislation to wipe out relief and plunge more  borrowers into financial distress.   What is their focus today? Picking on desperate people who are  fleeing war, violence, and abject poverty in search of a better life  for themselves and their children.   Now, the Republicans are threatening Federal funding to schools. That  is funding that is intended to support all students. I won't support  the harmful scapegoating of migrants and repeated attacks on  marginalized communities, and I won't support actions that delegitimize  our public schools.   These are the only schools that have an obligation to serve all  students and families, regardless of race, ethnicity, disability  status, ability to pay, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,  or any other characteristic. Our public schools are for everyone.    What I will support and what I repeatedly expressed an eagerness and  enthusiasm to work on are substantive, positive evidence-based  solutions that make schools safer, improve opportunities for students  from all backgrounds, and enhance the quality and frequency of parents'  and families' involvement in their children's education.   Madam Speaker, I welcome those conversations. I am disappointed that  we keep finding ourselves engaged in culture wars with the majority  putting politics over people instead of passing policies that help  students, their families, and our communities.   At a time when we have an opportunity to demonstrate compassion and  empathy, this resolution takes us in the wrong direction. I strongly  urge all of my colleagues to reject this resolution. Let's put humanity  first. Let's focus on what really truly helps public education.                                General Leave
