 Mr. Speaker, I have attended more police officers'  funerals than I care to admit. Some I have eulogized. The services are  beautiful, but the loss is tremendous.   Officer Sicknick's murder hit us hard. It hit me hard for a lot of  reasons. But this death should be personal to every Member of Congress  because I believe this body failed our Capitol Police officers. We tell  everybody else that, if you see something, say something. Yet, while  Brian was being murdered and other officers were suffering great bodily  harm, a significant number of Members in this body said nothing and  continued to uphold the big lie. They followed the unlawful, inhumane,  and criminal orders of their Commander in Chief.   But Brian remembered his oath. And if we want to honor his life, then  all of us should follow his example. Many have given much, but Officer  Brian Sicknick gave all. He paid the ultimate sacrifice, and we are  forever grateful for a life well lived.                            ____________________
