 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington very  much for his leadership with the Western Caucus and for hosting this  Special Order tonight.   Madam Speaker, I rise today, with my colleagues from the Western  Caucus, to highlight progress made in the lesser prairie chicken  population recovery through voluntary conservation efforts in Kansas.   The lesser prairie chicken is a North American species native to the  grasslands and southern Great Plains across New Mexico, Colorado,  Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. These birds use the open areas of the  plains to perform their courtship dance and build their nests on the  ground, away from any roads or structures.                                time  2100    My district, the Big First of Kansas, is home to the most extensive  range and largest population of the lesser prairie-chicken.   Since the 1990s, there have been concerns regarding the lesser  prairie-chicken population size and habitat, and the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service has considered listing the bird under the Endangered  Species Act on multiple occasions.   The Fish and Wildlife Service cited habitat fragmentation as one of  the reasons for its population decline, as much of the area is used for  cropland, grazing, and oil and gas development. However, we have seen  perhaps the most significant population changes tied to the prolonged  periods of drought across the chicken's range.   At its lowest, the lesser prairie-chicken population fell to  approximately 15,400 birds during the worst phase of the 2013 drought.   As the population declined, stakeholders across the five states began  conversations and plans to address this issue and partnered with local  landowners and industry. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and  Tourism teamed up with farmers and ranchers, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken  Interstate Working Group, and other midwestern States throughout the  bird's range to initiate conservation plans.   In their work to help the lesser prairie-chicken, Kansans have  conserved more than 40,000 acres of habitat through the Conservation  Reserve Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and private  investments. Many of the voluntary conservation efforts have been  directly funded by farmers and ranchers, the energy sector, and other  landowners. As stakeholders make conservation changes, it is vital that  the practices are mutually beneficial to both the lesser prairie- chicken and agriculture and energy producers.   These voluntary efforts have yielded excellent results, with the  lesser prairie-chicken population up to more than 34,400 birds in 2020.  In Kansas, the population has been stable to increasing since 2013,  while the entire population has been increasing since 2016. The  population growth has occurred thanks to voluntary efforts, but also  because of increased rainfall, which has also benefited many of the  agricultural producers in the area.   And so it is especially alarming and disappointing to see the Fish  and Wildlife Service release a plan to list the lesser prairie-chicken  under the Endangered Species Act as threatened in the northern  population and endangered in the southern population.   The potential ESA listing flies in the face of years spent and  millions invested in voluntary conservation and goes against the clear  data that the population has increased under those efforts. As usual,  President Biden believes Federal overreach is the answer to a local and  State issue, and his administration lacks trust in private landowners  to take care of their own land.   I strongly and vehemently oppose the listing of the lesser prairie- chicken, and I will continue to push back on the  [[Page H2739]]  Biden administration's egregious overreach.
