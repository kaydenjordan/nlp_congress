 Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5376, the Inflation  Reduction Act. This is landmark legislation that is going to help  reduce costs for American families while finally aggressively tackling  the climate crisis.   Madam Speaker, we simply cannot wait any longer to confront the  climate crisis. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and  more extreme. There are record-high temperatures across the Nation this  summer. These extreme weather events cost families their loved ones,  their homes, and their livelihoods.   This bill is the single largest investment in climate action in  American history. We heard from the Ways and Means Committee about the  tax credits, the investment production tax credits for renewables, for  electric vehicles. I want to talk about the provisions from the Energy  and Commerce Committee.   The bill makes unparalleled investments in climate, clean energy, and  environmental justice so that we can slash climate pollution and meet  our aggressive climate goals.   I want to highlight some of the things: a methane emissions reduction  program, a greenhouse gas reduction fund to promote new green  technology, investing in manufacturing that is green, reducing  industrial emissions; a program for States and government entities to  reduce climate pollution, a program for clean heavy-duty vehicles for  trucks and school buses to make them less polluting, an appliance and  building efficiency rebate to try to deal with emissions from buildings  and appliances, an industrial emissions reduction program;  environmental and climate justice block grants, and also provisions to  deal with ports that are a major source of pollution.   All of these are designed, basically, to try to create clean jobs and  to reduce energy costs for the average family. We estimate it at about  $1,800 a year. It is estimated that this bill will actually reduce the  pollution of greenhouse gases into the climate by 40 percent, in terms  of what the U.S. has emitted since 2005.   It goes very far toward achieving our goals as a Nation, toward  reducing the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.                                time  1430    In addition to that, the Inflation Reduction Act is also one of the  most significant pieces of healthcare legislation moved through  Congress in over a decade. I want to stress this: It breaks Big  Pharma's monopoly on prescription drug prices.   The bill will lower prescription drug costs for seniors by finally  empowering Medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs. It  also caps the amount that seniors pay at $2,000 annually, caps the cost  of insulin at $35 a month, and penalizes companies that unfairly hike  prices by forcing them to pay a rebate to the Federal Government if  their prices rise more than inflation.   This legislation is necessary because, nearly 20 years ago,  Republicans prevented the Federal Government from negotiating prices  for seniors. So, today, we are finally leveling the playing field to  ensure seniors are no longer forced to choose between putting food on  their tables and their life savings.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   Finally, I want to say that this legislation will also dramatically  lower the cost of healthcare for millions of Americans by extending  enhanced Affordable Care Act marketplace premium subsidies.   These enhanced subsidies are making a real difference for families,  delivering an average savings of $2,400 a year for a family of four.  They are set to expire at the end of the year, but this bill extends  them through the end of 2025.   Madam Speaker, this legislation lays the foundation for a cleaner,  more prosperous future for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester), my neighbor from the State of  Delaware and a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Ruiz), a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Soto), another member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), who is the chair of our Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor), who chairs the Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Clarke), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a member from the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Kim).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity to thank my  committee staff who worked so hard on this legislation for so many  years. This day would not be possible if it wasn't for their dedication  and constant perseverance: Tiffany Guarascio, Waverly Gordon, Rick  Kessler, Una Lee, Jacquelyn Bolen, Saha Khaterzai, Rick Van Buren,  Tuley Wright, Caitlin Haberman, Adam Fischer, Anthony Gutierrez, Tyler  O'Connor, Medha Surampudy, Jacqueline Cohen, Dustin Maghamfar, Timia  Crisp, and Brendan Larkin.   Let me just say, Madam Speaker, I am still waiting for a couple more  speakers. I just want to say that I cannot emphasize enough the  significance of this legislation in terms of reducing costs for seniors  through negotiated prices for Medicare, extending the Affordable Care  Act, which has made so many people have health insurance who didn't  have it before, and also addressing climate change, which is really the  greatest crisis of our time. There is nothing that could be more  significant in this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I will speak briefly before I introduce our two leaders who have done  so much on the Democratic side to make this bill a possibility today.  The Republican leader said that we should listen to our constituents.  Well, we have.   Yesterday, I was at a senior center in Woodbridge, and a woman came  up to me and said: You know, Congressman Pallone, I spend $1,500 a  month on prescription drugs. And I was able to say to her: I am going  to be in Washington tomorrow. I am going to vote on a bill that is  going to cap your expenditures at $2,000 a year.   Then I had another woman in a telehealth meeting earlier in the week  who told me that she was so hot, because in New Jersey we have had the  worst drought and the highest temperatures that we know in years, and  she said: I have to go to a cooling center because of the heat, because  of my health and the impact on my health.                                time  1630    I was able to say to her: Look, it is going to take a while, but  tomorrow--this Friday--I am going to vote on a bill that is going to  address the climate change and the heating and the warming of this  planet.  [[Page H7695]]    Madam Speaker, I want to thank our two leaders for what they have  done to bring this about today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, to close the debate, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House,  who has done so much to bring this bill to final passage today.
