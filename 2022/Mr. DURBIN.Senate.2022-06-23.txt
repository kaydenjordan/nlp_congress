 Madam President, if you look at the marketing plan of Big  Tobacco in America over the last half-century, it is very obvious:  Tobacco companies sell an addictive product. There is a chemical  included in the tobacco--nicotine--which is highly addictive. To be  successful, they have to convince people to take up smoking, even  though it is dangerous to their health and is a product that is  difficult to quit. How do they achieve that goal? They prey on  children, and they always have. Kids start smoking at an early age, and  if the tobacco companies have their way, it leads to an addiction for a  lifetime--a compromise on a person's health and even their death.   Over the years, I have done battle with Big Tobacco. The first, I  guess, exchange was over banning smoking on airplanes. It seems so long  ago, but we were successful, and we really changed the national  conversation on tobacco. More and more people became sensitive to the  fact that tobacco companies were, in fact, exploiting our children,  addicting them to their product, and steps were taken at every level-- local, State, and Federal--to stop that from happening, and it worked.  The number of children in America who are addicted to tobacco-related  products began to decline precipitously.   Big Tobacco was in a panic. They were losing their market share. Kids  weren't taking up tobacco smoking the way they had in the past, and so  they devised and invented new products. The most obvious one, I want to  address this morning: e-cigarettes, vaping.   The nicotine inside these vaping devices is the same nicotine as in  the tobacco cigarette, and it is just as addictive. Where have these  companies directed their marketing? To children. Once again, to  children.   We believe that 2 million or more children in America are currently  using vaping products and e-cigarettes. Many of them believe that they  are harmless, that they cause no damage to you from a health viewpoint.  These children are wrong.   The Agency that is responsible for regulating this product--vaping  products, e-cigarettes--is the Food and Drug Administration. They have  written a sad and sorry record when it comes to regulation of this  deadly product.   Over the years, we have begged them, pleaded with them, argued with  them over why they didn't show more leadership in banning this product  from the shelves across America because so many children were becoming  addicted. It reached the point where a Federal court--after years of  delay by the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. District Court for  the District of Maryland ordered the Food and Drug Administration to  finally begin regulating these addictive, kid-friendly vaping products,  giving a deadline of September 9, 2021, to finalize review of e- cigarette applications.  [[Page S3104]]    You see, the law requires the company to prove that the product is  not dangerous to the public health before it can be marketed. The FDA  really dropped its guard and allowed them to sell the product without  that proof, and it took a Federal court setting a deadline to get the  FDA back into the business of regulating this deadly product that was  addicting millions of children across America.   I have had my ups and downs with the Food and Drug Administration  over this issue. I think they could have been much more aggressive.  They could have protected more children. But, unfortunately, they did  not. During the entire Trump administration, we backpedaled, came up  with excuses, did nothing, and so vaping products became more prolific  across America, and more children became addicted.   Now we have a new head of the FDA, Dr. Califf. We had our back-and- forth exchanges over this issue, and I made it very clear to him that  there was no possible explanation or justification for not regulating  this product when the lives and health of so many children were at  stake. As I said, we had our good days and bad days in that exchange.   I am happy to report that the Food and Drug Administration has  announced this morning a dramatic, historic step forward to protect the  children across America from e-cigarette and vaping products. They are  finally--finally, the FDA is starting actions to remove from the  shelves products produced by the JUUL company--J-U-U-L, JUUL company-- that, in fact, endanger our children. This is long overdue.   You won't be surprised to learn that Big Tobacco has a major  investment in these companies. They believe this is the future, their  new product that they can addict children with--the nicotine--and hook  them, perhaps for life, on their products.   The Food and Drug Administration has taken a bold step today. It is  going to be a battle royal in court--you can just bet on it--but  finally they have stood up and said they are ready and prepared for the  battle. I want to join them in that effort.    I also want to say that taking these products off the shelves across  America will invite the possibility of contraband or black market  sales. We are calling on all those entities which could supply those  black market products, including internet sources, to stand up for  children across America and join the FDA in stopping the sale of these  products.   We estimated that if the Food and Drug Administration did not take  action to do this today, did not initiate this effort to stop the sale  of this product, we know more children would be addicted. As many as  750,000 to a million children have started since the FDA defied a court  deadline in September. That just gives you an idea of the reach of this  product and how serious it is.   If you don't know the story behind e-cigarettes and vaping, ask a  high school student in America. If that doesn't work, ask their parents  when they discover that their kids are addicted to these products. They  are innocuous-looking little delivery systems that look like they  belong in a computer, while they end up damaging the health of children  and people across the United States.   When I spoke to Dr. Califf this morning and he told me about this  historic announcement by the Food and Drug Administration, he made it  clear that tobacco and smoking and nicotine products were a major  threat to the health of children across this country and to Americans.  Tobacco regulation, as he noted, is a major step forward in reducing  the number of cancer deaths in America and heart disease. It is still a  problem. It is still a challenge. And Big Tobacco and their new Big  Vaping allies are determined to once again get their hooks in our kids  at an early age.   I am heartened by this decision by the Food and Drug Administration.  They are in for a legal battle, for sure, but it is worth the effort.   In the end, make sure that you come down on the side of children when  we are talking about tobacco and nicotine. It is an issue that I have  been involved in for years. I see the Senator from Oregon on the floor,  and I know that he was involved in the House of Representatives and in  the Senate in the same battle. But our efforts against vaping and e- cigarettes are going to mean that children have a healthier life and  better future.   I commend the Food and Drug Administration for this decision removing  JUUL products from the shelves of America, and I hope we can do more.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we begin  the vote scheduled for 11 a.m. this morning.    Madam President, today, the Senate is considering  bipartisan legislation to help protect our kids and our communities  from the scourge of gun violence.   This is a critical issue. And it is one we have spent a lot of time  on in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair.   We have held nine hearings in our committee in the 117th Congress to  discuss ways to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic.   Four of those hearings were held in the Constitution Subcommittee,  which is chaired by Senator Blumenthal, and I want to commend him for  the subcommittee's focus on important issues like red flag laws, ghost  guns, safe storage, and gun violence by domestic abusers.   And we have held five hearings in the full Judiciary Committee, where  we have heard testimony from witnesses on how to reduce violence.   I am pleased that the bipartisan bill before us includes a number of  measures that witnesses before the Judiciary Committee urged the Senate  to adopt.   Last December, the Judiciary Committee held a field hearing in  Chicago to discuss the firearms trafficking that floods the city with  illicit guns.   We heard testimony from David Brown, superintendent of the Chicago  Police Department, who pointed out that 93 percent of murders in  Chicago last year were committed by guns.   Superintendent Brown testified that we need strong Federal laws to  crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases, which fuel Chicago's  gun violence. And the bill before us today provides those laws.   Straw purchases are not minor offenses. They have devastating  consequences. Superintendent Brown talked about Chicago Police Officer  Ella French, who was murdered last year with a straw purchased gun. I  will never forget the outpouring of grief I saw in the city after we  lost Officer French.   The bill before us would crack down on straw purchases that put guns  in the hands of criminals and prohibited people. The Senate first voted  on this issue in 2013 and fell short, so this step is long overdue.   We also held a hearing in March of last year where we heard testimony  from Dr. Selwyn Rogers. He is a trauma surgeon and public health expert  from the University of Chicago Medicine.   His emergency room is on the frontlines of the gun violence epidemic,  stitching up bullet wounds to save lives. He called upon Congress to do  more to help prevent gunshot victims from showing up in his hospital in  the first place.   He described the way that trauma and witnessing violence harms the  brain and development of a child, making it difficult to regulate  emotions, form healthy relationships, and resolve conflicts.   Dr. Rogers implored us to address these emotional scars of trauma  that fuel the cycle of violence. And so did Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the  president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who testified before  our committee last week.   The bill we are considering today does just that. It provides  billions of dollars in grants for school- and community-based mental  health programs.   It includes more than $28 million for a bipartisan program that I  passed into law in 2018 with Senator Capito, Republican of West  Virginia. This program would expand trauma-informed care for students  by training more school personnel and bringing in more mental health  professionals from the community.   The bill also provides $40 million to a program I have supported for  years, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, which is providing  specialized  [[Page S3142]]  care to thousands of children in Chicago.   And it will help expand mental health treatment for students by  enhancing the ability for schools to use Medicaid coverage for this  care.   Helping children cope with traumatic experiences is a vital strategy  to prevent and break the cycle of violence. The investments provided in  this bill will make a dramatic difference in this effort.   At another of our hearings, which focused on the problem of armed  carjackings, we heard testimony from Vaughn Bryant of the organization  Metropolitan Family Services in Chicago.   He testified about the importance of community violence intervention,  or CVI, programs to help steer those who are at risk of committing gun  violence onto a better path.   These CVI programs have shown real promise in Chicago, as another of  our hearing witnesses, Roseanna Ander of the University of Chicago,  testified. But the programs do not have adequate funding to meet the  need.   The bill before us would provide $250 million over 5 years in  Department of Justice grants for CVI programs. That is double the  current annual funding for these programs, and it will make a big  difference.   We also heard compelling testimony last week at our hearing about the  impact of gun violence on children. It is a grim reality that gunfire  is now the leading cause of death of American children and teens,  according to the Centers for Disease Control.   Every day, on average, we lose 12 kids in America to gun homicides,  suicides, and accidents. In the year 2020 alone, we lost 4,368 American  babies, children, and teens in firearm deaths--an increase of nearly 30  percent over the previous year.   At our hearing, we heard testimony from law enforcement and  pediatrician witnesses about how the Senate needs to act to protect our  kids. And we also heard moving testimony from 19-year-old Ernest  Willingham, who grew up on the West Side of Chicago as the youngest of  11 kids in his family.   He has an incredible story. He is the first in his family to attend  college and the first male in his family to graduate high school. He is  currently in college in Boston and is well on his way to a career in  the healthcare field. Ernest has been surrounded by gun violence his  whole life. His father has been shot. His brother has been shot twice.  His cousin has been shot. And a few years ago, his best friend was  killed by a stray bullet. Ernest talked about the anguish of seeing  loved ones around him get shot. And he described his constant fear that  he, himself, would be shot too.   At the hearing Ernest called for gun law reforms, but he also talked  about the importance of mental health. He urged us to make sure that  communities that are hard hit by gun violence have the counselors and  mental health professionals they need to help kids who are traumatized  by gun violence.   Ernest, help is on the way. This bill makes dramatic investments-- billions of dollars--in mental health treatment and care in schools and  in communities.   I was so impressed by this young man's testimony at our hearing and  the way he has benefited from ``a village'' of supporters--family,  friends, teachers, and mentors--to build the resilience to rise above  trauma in his life to pursue his dreams in the medical field.   For the sake of the kids we have lost to the gun violence, and for  the sake of kids like Ernest who shouldn't have to grow up surrounded  by this violence, we need to act. The bill before us, the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act, is a compromise. It doesn't accomplish  everything I want when it comes to gun violence, and it has provisions  I would like to change or could do without.   It won't end gun violence in America. But it takes important steps  toward making our Nation safer. It is a meaningful bipartisan package,  negotiated in good faith by Senators from across the political  spectrum.   I want to commend those Senators for their hard work, especially  Senators Murphy, Cornyn, Sinema, and Tillis.   We have heard so much in the Senate Judiciary Committee about the  need to do something to reduce gun violence and about commonsense  reforms and investments that would help. It heartens me that a number  of those reforms and investments are included in this package,  particularly when it comes to cracking down on straw purchases,  treating trauma, supporting community violence intervention programs,  and investing in mental health and counseling in schools and  communities.   This bill doesn't have everything I want. But it is a good,  meaningful bipartisan compromise, and I will support it. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.    Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of the  Pell Grant Program, a program that has been the bedrock of our Nation's  investment in higher education.   This bipartisan program has provided direct financial aid to low- income students since 1972, and there currently are 7 million students  receiving a Pell grant. In my home State of Illinois, more than 208,000  Pell grants totaling nearly $860 million were awarded in the 2020-2021  academic year. These Federal dollars help provide students and families  access to higher education, well-paying jobs, and economic mobility.  [[Page S3151]]    But Pell grants have failed to keep up with the times. When it was  created, the Pell grant covered more than 75 percent of the average  cost of attendance at a 4-year public college. Today, Pell grants cover  less than 30 percent of these expenses. This means that students are  forced to take on student loans, exacerbating the student loan debt  crisis. Fourty-five million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student loan  debt, which is second only to mortgages as the largest category of  consumer debt.   Doubling the Pell grant would be an investment in our Nation's future  and would help ensure students can access higher education. At the same  time, the for-profit college industry--an industry with a track record  of preying on low-income students--must continue to be held accountable  so students and taxpayers are not being ripped off. The for-profit  college industry enrolls only 8 percent of all postsecondary students  in America, but accounts for 30 percent of all Federal student loan  defaults. Too often, students and taxpayers are left holding the bag.   As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pell grants, I urge my  colleagues to support low-income students by increasing these grants to  cover a greater amount of college expenses and ensuring the most  vulnerable students are protected from fraudulent for-profit colleges.                            ____________________
