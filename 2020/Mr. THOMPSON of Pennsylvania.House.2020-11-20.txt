 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a founder  of the Service Organization Caucus to celebrate National Philanthropy  Day, an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the many acts of  kindness and service that individuals and organizations across this  Nation do each day.   Serving others has always been a passion of mine. From being a  volunteer firefighter to being involved in scouting, I have always  believed it is my duty to give back.   Service plays a key role in supporting and uplifting our communities.  The amazing service and philanthropic organizations across the Nation  that give countless hours serving others and doing their part deserve a  big thank you.   I am honored to co-chair the Service Organization Caucus with my  colleague and friend, Congressman Panetta of California.   I encourage everyone to do their part in honor of National  Philanthropy Day. To my colleagues, I invite you to join me on this  service caucus where we can work together from both sides of the aisle  to promote and to support our local volunteer service organizations.                            ____________________
