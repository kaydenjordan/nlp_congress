 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congresswoman  Frankel, for her efforts to recognize the hard work and dedication of  Benjamin Ferencz. It is quite fitting that Mr. Ferencz be awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal for his remarkable work prosecuting Nazis  during the Nuremburg trials at this particular time.   First, because at a time when immigrants are being villainized, Mr.  Ferencz is an example of an immigrant who fled to this country from the  persecution of Jews by the Nazis and made this country proud with his  military service and with his tireless advocacy for justice at the  Nuremburg trials.   Second, because at a time of rising anti-Semitism globally and in  this country, it is important to honor Mr. Ferencz who fought to hold  responsible those whose anti-Semitic actions resulted in an  unprecedented genocide: the murder of 6 million innocent Jews.   Third, because today we are witnessing another tyrant, Vladimir  Putin, who reminds us of the brutality, the unprovoked aggression, and  the unbridled cruelty of Adolf Hitler and his war machine.   We can only hope that when Mr. Putin's aggression against Ukraine and  the Ukrainian people is put to an end, we have honorable and highly- skilled people like Mr. Ferencz who will hold Putin and other war  criminals accountable in a court of law.  [[Page H4758]]    Finally, during this Jewish History Month, it is a privilege to  recognize a Jew who served his country and his people with distinction,  honor, and success. Mr. Ferencz was the embodiment of the Biblical  instruction: Justice, justice you shall pursue.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. Frankel, for her effort to  make sure this Gold Medal is awarded to such a deserving recipient.
