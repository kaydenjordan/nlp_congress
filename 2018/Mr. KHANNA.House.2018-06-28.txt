 Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify my vote earlier this  afternoon on H.R. 6157, the fiscal year 2019 (FY19) Department of  Defense Appropriations Act. I inadvertently voted ``aye'' on rollcall  vote 313 in the House today (Thursday, June 28th). I had every  intention of voting ``nay.''                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION    MR. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, due to obligations in my district, I  missed rollcall votes 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312 and  313 today.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 304,  ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 305, ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 306, ``NAY'' on  rollcall No. 307, ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 308, ``NAY'' on rollcall No.  309, ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 310, ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 311, ``NAY''  on rollcall No. 312, and ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 313.                            ____________________
