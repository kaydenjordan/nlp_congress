 Mr. Speaker, let me say that the problems that my  good friend just mentioned on the floor can be solved by real, sensible  gun safety legislation. Unfortunately, H.R. 38 is not that, and it is  not that because it has ignored the pleas of law enforcement, and it  has ignored the rational addition of amendments that would save lives.   H.R. 38 is dangerous, it is reckless, and it is secretly packaged as  a fix to gun violence, but, instead, it is laced with lethal elements  of catastrophic proportion.   Then, in the midnight hour, it matches the NICS Fix, dealing with the  background checks, with the concealed carry reciprocity. That is  patently unfair, Mr. Speaker.   Then it would not allow reasonable amendments, exposing victims of  domestic violence, an amendment that I had, it will expose them,  victims of domestic violence, to stalkers, and those who have been  involved in domestic violence to gun violence or death.   It will entice those who perpetrate hate crimes. It will add to the  current alarming death rate. Unfortunately, where we could have fixed  the NICS, it does not do that.   556 women have been murdered this year alone by intimate partners  with firearms. My amendment would have made this bill safer on the  concealed carry bill. Didn't want to have it. Fourteen other sensible  amendments were blocked.   4.5 million American women alive today have been threatened by  abusers.   Hate crimes, those worshippers in Charleston, South Carolina, were  killed by a person who came there with hate. My amendment dealing with  not allowing someone convicted of a hate crime--even though they say  that that is the Federal law, why not have it in this underlying bill  where so many people are killed?   Let me give you an example. Under the Brady Campaign, 114,994  Americans are killed by guns. They include those in Las Vegas; they  include those at the Pulse nightclub; in Charleston; those who marched  in Charlottesville, with all the violence that they had; and of course,  Sandy Hook. Seventeen thousand children are gunned down by guns.   The laws of different States, 12 States, have an open carry law with  no rules. That means that if you are in Washington, D.C., where heads  of state and other dignitaries come, then recklessly someone can come  on the streets.   Do we even listen to police officers? The Major Chiefs Association  has indicated that they are opposed to H.R. 38 because it will require  those making legitimate legal stops as law enforcement officers,  seeking to come home to their families, being subjected to individuals  whose documents they may not know are credible, or whether they are  fraudulent or whether, in fact, these individuals legitimately should  have a gun.   I can't understand why this is not understood. So let me just say  that it is usually understood that we respect the constitutionality of  States. This is a bad bill. It ignores sovereignty, and we should vote  it down because too many people are murdered by guns without safety  regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 38, the ``Concealed to  Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017''.   I oppose the bill for the following reasons:   H.R. 38 is dangerous, reckless and secretly packaged as a fix to gun  violence, but instead, is laced with lethal elements of catastrophic  proportion.   It will expose victims of domestic violence or stalking to gun  violence or death.   It will entice those who perpetrate hate crimes.   It will add to the current alarming death rate.   The majority has elected to combine this dangerous measure with a  more sensible and bipartisan measure, the Fix NICS Act, which we all  supported as a stand-alone bill at markup.   This trickery tactic is both disappointing and deadly, of which,  neither approach is welcome, for this reckless effort will negate any  protections offered by the Fix NICS Act.   My Amendments would have remedied these glaring defects in H.R. 38,  which is a recipe for disaster because it authorizes anyone who is  allowed by one state to carry a concealed handgun to do so in any other  state, even if other states have higher standards than the state where  permit was granted.   This bill would endanger many more lives when dealing with domestic  partners by exposing victims to gun violence.   Approximately, 556 women have been murdered this year alone by  intimate partners with firearms, as statistics show that guns are the  weapon of choice for domestic violence homicides.   My domestic violence amendment is an important public safety measure.  Had it been made in order, it would have provided that States not be  required to allow an individual to carry where such person is convicted  of an offense of domestic violence or stalking as defined under the  law.   Despite this sensible measure, my amendments along with 14 other  germane democratic amendments were all blocked by the majority.   A 2016 meta-analysis found that approximately 4.5 million American  women alive today have been threatened by abusers with firearms; of  those, one million had either been shot or shot at by their abusers.   Stalking is also a strong indicator of lethality, with one study of  female murder victims in ten cities finding that 76% of women who were  murdered by an intimate partner were stalked the previous year.   My second amendment would have prohibited any person convicted of a  hate crime, as defined under section 249 of title 18 United States  Code, or any substantially similar offense under the law of any State,  from carrying under this bill.   We all remember the vicious church shooting in Charleston, South  Carolina where a white supremacist opened fire in a historic black  church, killing nine people, including a pastor, during a prayer  meeting.    Again, recently, in Charlottesville, VA, white nationalists invoked  violence during a march by plowing a car into a group of anti- protesters, killing 32 year old Heather Heyer of Charlottesville.   This event prompted Attorney General Sessions to call the fatal  attack ``domestic terrorism'' and said you can be sure we will charge  and advance the investigation toward the most serious of charges that  can be brought.   Imagine if this killer from Ohio was allowed to cross state lines  freely at that time under this bill with a gun; the additional loss of  life on that day could have been catastrophic.   New analysis of National Crime Victimization Survey data by the  Center for American Progress reveals that between 2010 and 2014,  roughly 43,000 hate crimes were committed in the United States that  involved the use or threat of a gun.   Under federal law and the law in most states, individuals who have  been convicted of hate crimes remain free to buy and possess guns. And  now, under this bill, they can take their guns with them to inflict  mayhem beyond their home states.   Hate-motivated individuals such as violent extremists and hate  criminals often use guns as a tool to terrorize, threaten and  intimidate members of historically vulnerable or marginalized  communities. My amendment therefore, was a sensible and practical  measure.   Mass shootings and carnage-filled classrooms, churches, workplace,  concerts and clubs should not be the new normal because Congress can  and should do better.   Every day on average, 315 people are shot, of which 93 die from gun  violence, daily. And of the 315 shot, 46 are children and teens between  the age of 0-19 and at least 7 of our children die daily from gun  violence.  [[Page H9691]]    Every year on average, 114,994 people are shot, of which 33,880  people die from gun violence and of those shot, 17,012 of those victims  are children and teens. Therefore, we lose at least 2,647 of our  children a year to senseless gun violence.   These numbers are alarming and we should be devoting our efforts to  saving lives, not opening up the flood gate to more carnage by snuffing  innocent lives in passing H.R. 38.   This bill will amplify tragedies such as Sandy Hook Elementary,  Charleston, SC, Florida's Pulse night club, San Bernardino, Las Vegas  bump stocks killings, Texas recent church massacre, and the countless  lives lost on our streets across this country daily.   Although the NRA argues that the United States is a dangerous place  and that owning and carrying a gun is the only way to protect oneself  and one's family, there are over 30,000 dead.   Removing safeguards intended to protect the public against potential  harm or deadly force by private individuals jeopardizes universally  recognized human rights--including the right to life.   H.R. 38 prohibits Congress' ability to address gun violence in a  constructive and realistic manner? Adding more guns to our streets and  loosening existing laws is extremely dangerous and counterproductive to  ensuring public safety.   Disguising the danger in this bill, by wrapping it in the cloth of  H.R. 4477, a more sensible measure, does not negate the toxicity level  of H.R. 38.   In response to the TX recent church shooting, my amendment  strengthened H.R. 4477 by requiring DoD to conduct a more comprehensive  review of the procedures used by each branch of the Armed Forces to  ensure that the Department is in substantial compliance with the DoD  instruction 5505.11 entitled, ``Fingerprint Card and Final Disposition  Report Submission Requirements'', dated December 1, 1998. But again,  these amendments were blocked.   Unlike H.R. 4477, the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan measure and good  first step, which aims to improve key elements in the submission of  information by federal and state agencies to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and which I supported, H.R. 38  as is and combined is lethal.   For the reasons stated above, I oppose this Rule and the underlying  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  to me.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article by Mark Kelly  entitled ``Good Guys With Guns Can Be Dangerous, Too. Don't Gut Conceal  Carry Laws. Why is Congress about to Vote to Loosen Gun Laws Again;'' a  letter from Major Cities Chiefs Association opposing H.R. 38; a letter  from the chief of police from the City of Houston; and, finally, a  report from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic  Violence.   [[Page H9692]]        `Good Guys With Guns' Can Be Dangerous, Too. Don't Gut Concealed Carry                                    Laws           why is congress about to vote to loosen gun laws again?                              (By Mark Kelly)         That day in Tucson, amid a gun tragedy, one of the heroes       almost got shot.        It was Saturday, Jan. 8, 2011, and a mentally ill young man       who'd gotten his hand on a gun opened fire on my wife, then-      Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), and her constituents at an       event in a Safeway parking lot. He shot my wife in the head       at close range, injured 12 others and took the lives of six       people. One victim was a 9-year-old girl.        After Gabby's would-be assassin dropped the full magazine       as he sought to reload his gun and continue his rampage,       people tackled him, kicked his gun away, subdued him as they       waited for law enforcement to arrive and brought an end to       the chaos. They were heroes.        The chaos nearly continued, though. Because the man who       murdered those innocent people wasn't the only one there with       a loaded, concealed gun.        Joe Zamudio was shopping at a drugstore nearby when he       heard the shots. Allowed to carry a concealed weapon under       Arizona law, Zamudio recognized the sound of gunfire and       rushed to the scene with his gun in his jacket pocket, his       hand on his weapon and ready to fire. But then Zamudio--a       good guy trying to do the right thing--almost shot another       good guy.        As he rounded the corner, he saw a man holding a gun.       Zamudio confronted him: ``Drop it, drop it!'' he yelled.        But that man with a gun was a good guy, too. He was one of       the heroes who had wrestled the shooter to the ground. And he       was moments away from being shot for the wrong reason.        To his credit, Zamudio held his fire--just barely. As he       recounted to reporters later, ``It was a matter of seconds. .       . . I was really lucky. . . . I've never been in the military       or had any professional training. I just reacted.''        The situation that played out in the Safeway parking lot       that day shows the potential for tragedy and bloodshed when       untrained people carrying loaded guns react to a crisis. Even       with the best intentions, an armed person without the       extensive firearms training that is required to respond under       pressure in a crisis will risk making the situation worse,       not better.        But this week, as we approach the seventh anniversary of       the tragedy in Tucson and the fifth anniversary of the       tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School--and after two of the       five deadliest mass shootings in modern history happened in       the last two months--Congress is working hard to pass one of       the big-ticket items on the National Rifle Association's       wishlist, a bill that weakens our gun laws and poses serious       threats to public safety.        The House of Representatives is on the verge of voting to       allow people permitted to carry concealed weapons to carry       them into any other state regardless of what that state's law       on such guns is. That would make it harder for law       enforcement to do their job and allow all permit holders,       even if they don't have a single shred of training, to carry       loaded, hidden guns on every street in our country.        Right now, each state has the right to determine the extent       to which it will recognize the concealed carry laws of other       states. Some states have strong laws, preventing dangerous       people like domestic abusers and convicted stalkers from       obtaining concealed carry permits and requiring training and       a thorough evaluation as part of the process. In other       states, concealed carry laws have much lower standards. The       12 states with the weakest laws, permitless carry states, do       not even require a permit. That means a resident of those       states may carry loaded, concealed guns in public spaces       without ever having passed a background check.        The bill before Congress would allow people who have a       permit issued by any state--including permitless carry       states--to carry loaded, concealed handguns in any other       state that allows concealed carry, even though they might not       meet local public safety standards. This would mean an 18-      year-old high school student from West Virginia could legally       carry a concealed firearm in New York City, where residents       must be 21 to even own a handgun.        And what would it mean for law enforcement? Nothing good.       The bill would impose a threat of personal litigation on all       law enforcement officers by allowing anyone whose ability to       carry a concealed gun is mistakenly questioned by law       enforcement to personally sue the officer. This bill would       also effectively require them to be an expert on nationwide       gun laws as they work to determine if it's legal for someone       from out of state to be carrying a gun in whatever state they       might be visiting. Just as concerning, it will mean that more       law enforcement officers will have to confront more people       with guns. And think back to the tragedy in Tucson: When law       enforcement officers arrive at a crime scene where multiple       people are holding guns, how do they even know who the good       guy is?        We need politicians to show courage and listen to the       American people, who want stronger laws to make them safer,       not giveaways to gun lobbyists that threaten the safety of       our communities. And that's exactly what this irresponsible       bill would do.        As members of Congress consider this bill, they have to ask       themselves if they want to be remembered as voting to help       the Washington gun lobby instead of supporting law       enforcement and public safety. And they should know that       their constituents are watching their decision closely.                                   ____                                  Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                   November 2, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,       Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs,       representing the Nation's largest metropolitan law       enforcement agencies in the country, we are writing to voice       our strong opposition to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act       of 2017, HR 38. Because we are responsible for public safety       in jurisdictions across the Nation, we recognize that this       legislation would be an enormous mistake.        This measure is both impractical and contrary to the rights       of States. Moreover, it raises Constitutional questions about       the authority of Congress to direct State officers.        Concealed weapon permit laws have been tailored to the       needs of regions and local communities over a period of many       years. An attempt by Congress to preempt these State laws       forces States to accept the lowest minimum standard for       concealed carry across the Nation, and creates a       contradiction between the standards required for State       residents and State visitors.        The thousands of local permit formats would make       enforcement impossible, because police officers would not be       able to determine the validity of a permit issued in another       State or locality. It would be impossible for law enforcement       to distinguish true permit carriers from criminals and       illegal guns.        We are confident that members of Congress will respect the       Constitutional sovereignty of the States and will not act       with disregard for the many reasonable and prudent laws       already in place across the Nation.            Sincerely,      J. Thomas Manger,        Chief of Police, Montgomery County Police Department,       President.                                   ____                                                    City of Houston,                                       Houston Police Department,                                     Houston, TX, November 29, 2017.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman,      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee of the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: As the       Chief of Police in Houston, I see first-hand the bloodshed       and death toll from gun violence. Recent horrible events in       Texas and Nevada serve as grim reminders that we have not       done enough to prevent gun violence in America. While I am       sorry I cannot attend your planned hearing, I serve as the       First Vice President of Major Cities Chiefs and ask that you       also enter this letter into the record.        The mass shooting in Texas is an ugly and tragic example of       the need to strengthen our system of background checks.       That's why I am supporting the measure introduced by Senator       Cornyn and I urge the Committee to move his bill forward. The       proposed legislation seeks to make current law work better by       strengthening procedures. But we should not stop there as       much more can be done to prevent the public from gun       violence. This measure alone does not go far enough to stop       what recently happened in Texas and the many, many senseless       mass shootings that preceded our own tragedy.        Universal Background Check: The mass shooting in Texas       represents a renewed call for the Universal Background Check       that Congress has failed to adopt in the past. Much has been       said about how the Texas gunman would have been precluded       from the store purchase if the background system had worked       correctly. But what would have stopped him from buying the       same weapons at the next gun show? It's a disservice to the       public to conduct background checks only in some cases, but       not for all of them.        ``Bump Stocks'': Another common-sense measure is a ban on       ``bump stocks'' and similar accessories that replicate fully       automatic weapons fire. Such features result in a number of       shots fired that causes the carnage we witnessed in Las       Vegas. Like other law enforcement officials, I have studied       the Las Vegas slaughter and concluded that there is no       reasonable sporting or hunting purpose served by deadly       devices that simulate military weapons capabilities. I was       seated next to the ATF Director at a recent meeting of Major       Cities Chiefs when he advised the Chiefs that new legislation       will be required.        Concealed Weapons: Each State has carefully crafted its own       laws relating to concealed weapons. While Congress has       heretofore respected the Constitutional sovereignty of the       States, there is legislation now pending that would undermine       the authority of State laws relating to carrying of weapons.       We strongly urge Congress to reject the misguided and       impractical proposal for reciprocity. As police officers       could not be expected to recognize legitimate or forged       permits from thousands of jurisdictions, it would be       impossible to determine which persons are authorized to carry       a concealed weapon.        Silencers: Legislation to deregulate silencers is ill-      advised because it would further threaten public safety.       These devices were  [[Page H9693]]       invented for killing and stealth. Once widespread, hunters       would be unable to hear nearby gunfire and thus be       endangered. Gunshot detection systems in urban areas would be       thwarted. Worst of all, the proposed legislation would permit       criminals to purchase and possess silencers without any       screening requirements. There is simply no legitimate       justification for a measure that would further endanger the       public.        Our Duty to Protect: Like those of us who wear a badge,       members of Congress share our solemn duty to protect the       public. The recent tragedies in Texas and Nevada should be       recognized by Congress as cries for help from past and future       innocent victims of gun violence. Chiefs of Police and       Sheriffs join these victims in asking you to act now to       prevent more death and bloodshed. We turn to you for courage       and leadership to consider multiple steps and measures to       curb the ongoing threat of gun violence in America.            Sincerely,                                                       Art Acevedo,      Chief of Police.                                   ____                                          National Task Force to End                                      Sexual & Domestic Violence,                                                   December 1, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: As we       enter the winter holiday season, we grieve for the       approximately 556 women who will not celebrate with their       families--the 556 women who have been murdered this year by       intimate partners with firearms. As a country, we can and       must do more to prevent the daily mass shootings that plague       our nation, most of which are related to family violence.        Accordingly, we, the member organizations of the National       Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF),       comprising national organizations working to end gender-based       violence and representing hundreds of member programs and       hundreds of thousands of advocates and survivors, write to       you today to oppose the package containing both the Concealed       Carry Reciprocity (CCR) Act of 2017, H.R. 38, and the Fix       NICS Act of 2017, H.R.4434.        While the Fix NICS Act of 2017, H.R.4434, will protect       victims of domestic violence by ensuring domestic violence       records are properly and expeditiously submitted to the       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the       Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, H.R. 38, undermines the       safety of victims of domestic violence, dating violence and       stalking by destabilizing protections for victims of abuse       and allowing domestic violence offenders to follow their       victims across state lines with loaded, concealed firearms.       This combined measure is incredibly dangerous and will negate       any protections offered by the Fix NICS Act.        Firearms are regularly used as tools of power and control.       A 2016 meta-analysis of existing literature found that       approximately 4.5 million American women alive today have       been threatened by abusers with firearms; of those, one       million had either been shot or shot at by their abusers.       Guns are also the weapon of choice for domestic violence       homicides. An abuser's mere access to a firearm increases the       risk of intimate partner homicide of women by five times.       Stalking is also a strong indicator of lethality, with one       study of female murder victims in ten cities finding that 76%       of women who were murdered by an intimate partner were       stalked the previous year. Lawmakers have enacted strong,       commonsense protections to prevent domestic violence       homicides in states and localities across the nation and such       protections must not be undermined by federally mandating       concealed carry reciprocity.        States and Reciprocity Agreements: Currently, each state       determines who can legally carry concealed, loaded firearms       in public. Many states have enacted strong laws to protect       victims and survivors from gun-enabled abuse beyond the vital       but limited protection federal law provides. States enter       into reciprocity agreements at their own discretion. The       proposal before the Committee would take away this local       control by requiring every state to recognize every other       state's concealed weapons permits, thereby undermining       states' authority to make their own decisions as to what       measures will provide the best protection for their citizens.        Victim Relocation: Often, victims of domestic violence,       dating violence and stalking relocate across state lines to       escape their abusers and seek refuge in states with stronger       firearms protections. H.R. 38 would require states with       strong protections for victims of abuse to accept the permits       of states with weaker protections and allow domestic violence       offenders to travel across state lines with loaded, concealed       firearms. Domestic violence offenders could shop around for       ``out of state'' permits, which are granted by ten states to       non-residents, even if they do not meet the requirements to       obtain a permit in their home state. Even if domestic abusers       are prohibited from possessing firearms from their state of       residence, they could easily obtain ``out of state'' permits       and cross state lines to threaten, harass and harm their       victims with firearms.        Law Enforcement and Background Checks: The CCR Act assumes       that law enforcement need only look at an individual's out-      of-state concealed carry license to verify their eligibility       to carry a firearm. Twelve states no longer require permits       to carry loaded, concealed firearms; individuals from those       states would not be able to produce a state-issued photo ID       license to prove their eligibility to carry a concealed       firearm, as required by the bills. The bill also assumes that       federal firearms prohibitors apply to all persons asserting       the right to concealed carry reciprocity. However, many       states do not run background checks when issuing concealed       permits, so law enforcement in the travel state is unable to       ascertain whether a federal or state prohibitor impairs the       traveler's concealed carry permit or firearm possession. Even       when a background check is required before a permit is       issued, prohibited abusers often erroneously pass background       checks, because the federal background check databases are       missing most records relating to federal and many states'       domestic violence prohibitors.        The Fix NICS Act of 2017 (H.R.4434): This bipartisan,       bicameral bill reauthorizes NCHIP, requires all federal       agencies and states to design implementation plans to       increase submission of records into NICS, holds states and       federal agencies responsible if they do not meet the       benchmarks established in their implementation plans, and       creates a Domestic Abuse and Violence Prevention Initiative       to focus state efforts specifically on domestic violence       records. This bill is supported not only by the domestic       violence community but also such disparate entities as the       NRA, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and a number of       gun violence prevention organizations.        Although gaps in reporting of records span a range of       firearms prohibitors, the gap in reporting of domestic       violence records is particularly notable. Approximately       700,000 protective orders reside in state databases that are       not in any federal database, and countless more protective       orders are issued at the local level but never entered into       state databases. Similarly, there are significant gaps in the       number of misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and the       records submitted to NICS. Poor record keeping often leads to       domestic abusers erroneously passing background checks or to       `default proceed', in which a background check cannot be       completed within seventy-two hours, and a sale is allowed to       proceed before the FBI has made a determination about the       potential buyer's ability to legally purchase or possess       firearms. In 2013 and 2014, a plurality (approximately 40%)       of cases referred by the FBI to the ATF for firearms       retrieval after a default proceed were related to a domestic       violence prohibitor. An unknown number of prohibited abusers       wrongly passed background checks altogether.        Simply put, we cannot support any bill that puts the lives       of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and       stalking at risk. Any bill that includes the Concealed Carry       Reciprocity Act, H.R.38, imperils the lives of victims,       survivors, their children, their families, their friends and       their communities. We continue to support The Fix NICS Act of       2017, H.R.4434, as a standalone bill because it saves lives.       On behalf of victims of domestic violence, dating violence       and stalking, we urge you to reconsider combining these       bills. These two bills cannot be supported as a package and       the CCR Act threatens to erase any progress that could be       made by the Fix NICS Act.        Sincerely,      The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.
