 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment  offered by gentleman from Tennessee. Like Dr. Roe, I, too, have been an  OB-GYN.   The standard of care is defined by local physicians. Let me say that  again. The standard of care should be defined by local physicians, and  how medicine is practiced may vary from location to location. No matter  what, all physicians, especially in rural settings, don't have access  to all the luxuries in tertiary centers. Demanding that experts  representing either side of a dispute practice medicine in the State of  jurisdiction is just common sense.
