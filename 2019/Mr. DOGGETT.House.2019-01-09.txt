 Madam Speaker, Trump and his apologists are so very good  at breaking things. It is just fixing them they can't seem to find an  answer to.   This underlying lawsuit is little more than a conspiracy between a  criminally-indicted Texas Republican attorney general and the Trump  administration that couldn't find its voice when it was time to defend  protections for preexisting conditions for so many American families.   There is no doubt there is collusion. There is Republican collusion  right here. It is collusion to strip away lifesaving protection from so  many Americans.   Intervening in this lawsuit is an important step in protecting  families from the uncertainties of fine-print denials, excessive  premiums, inadequate coverage, and just basic access to affordable  healthcare.   We must intervene because of a preexisting condition--and it is a  rather unusual one. It is called amnesia. These Republicans have  political amnesia. They cannot remember before the Affordable Care Act  how many families got a diagnosis of bankruptcy at the same time they  got a diagnosis  [[Page H341]]  of a severe disease or experienced an accident.   They had over 60 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they  never could come up with a plan to present to this House to replace the  Affordable Care Act because, for all of its shortcomings, it is the  best answer right now to the needs of the American people.
