 Mr. Speaker, I ask so-called fiscal conservatives: Why add  to the deficit $3 trillion?   I guess it is consistency. If you dig a hole, dig it deeper.   Oh, it is for workers.   Workers? One-half of the top percent get 50 percent of the benefit.  It won't pass the Senate.   So why do it?   They thought it would be politically helpful. Now it is turning out  it won't be. It is going to be immigration. This is a desperate move.  It is desperately wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge we vote ``no.''
