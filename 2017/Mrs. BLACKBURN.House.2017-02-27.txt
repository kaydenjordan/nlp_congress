 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  for yielding the time.   I do encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   Recently, National Geographic ranked this as the third best Civil War  site to visit--the third best--and there is a reason for that. It is  because of the dedication of the National Park Service personnel that  are there at the Shiloh battlefield and the local volunteers from  Tennessee and Mississippi that work to preserve and to enhance.    Mrs. Torres was so right when she talked about the relevancy of the  site and the opportunity for introspection and remembrance and the  importance of preservation and the lessons that can be learned as  individuals go and visit this park. It is significant, and in our Civil  War history it is significant that we preserve this and work with the  National Park Service.   The Battle of Shiloh was fought on April 6 and 7 in 1862. It was the  bloodiest battle of the Civil War up to that point: 23,000 Americans  died. General Grant's Union Army was victorious. The Confederate forces  withdrew to Corinth, and the outcome of the battle eventually led to  the fall of Vicksburg in July of 1863. This permanently divided the  Confederacy and crippled the Southern war effort.   As we look at this legislation that goes around this battlefield, it  does preserve the historical legacy of Tennessee, of Shiloh, and of our  Nation. It gives the Park Service the authority that they would like to  preserve more than 2,100 additional acres of the historic Shiloh  National Military Park.   As the gentleman from California said, Fallen Timbers, Davis Bridge,  and Russell House are all included in this, as well as Parker's  Crossroads Battlefield, which would be named an affiliated area.   As we look at visitors to our Nation's park, the Shiloh National  Military Park welcomes more than 500,000 visitors each and every year.   I thank my colleagues for the time and the support.
