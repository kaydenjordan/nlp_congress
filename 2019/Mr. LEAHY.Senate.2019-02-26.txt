 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, what is the legislative situation?    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.    Mr. President, President Trump declared a national  emergency 2 weeks ago. He did this in order to build a pet project of  his. In the process, he said it was his intent to siphon billions of  dollars that Congress had appropriated to help our men and women in  uniform. Now, I am not sure what lawyers he consulted, but those  lawyers seem to have overlooked our Nation's founding document--the  U.S. Constitution.   I know the President likes to communicate in 280 characters or less,  so I will point him to a 77-character phrase he may want to review:  ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of  Appropriations made by Law.''   That is a short sentence, but our Founders knew what it meant. They  enshrined it in article I, section 9 of the Constitution, and they  established that Congress--and Congress alone--possesses the power of  the purse. That Congress has exclusive power over our government's  spending priorities is one of the most critical checks and balances in  our constitutional system. The President can propose funding for  whatever project he wants. He has the absolute right to propose  funding, but it is the job of Congress to decide where to invest the  American people's hard-earned tax dollars.   Let's review the facts. For over 2 years, the President has  repeatedly tried and has repeatedly failed to convince Congress that  building his southern border wall is a good idea. He has failed to get  a deal with Mexico despite giving his word and promising his supporters  more than 200 times that Mexico would pay for it. He promised that  Mexico would pay for it while knowing, of course, that Mexico would not  pay a cent for it. Then he failed to get a deal with his own party even  during the 2 years when the Republicans controlled the Presidency, the  U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. He also failed to  get a deal after he forced the country into a 35-day government  shutdown over the issue--a shutdown, incidentally, that cost our  country at least $11 billion, to say nothing of the number of people  whose lives were so disrupted that many either lost their apartments,  were unable to pay their mortgages, were unable to pay their bills, or  were unable to pay for the medical care they needed.   Yet, in the face of all of these failings, he has decided to go it  alone. He has decided to stretch his powers--beyond all recognition-- under the National Emergencies Act. There is no rational basis to  justify the use of this authority. So we should look at what a  bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats wrote--a group of 58  former senior national security officials who had to help secure our  country under both Republican and Democratic Presidents.   They wrote: ``There is no factual basis for the declaration of a  national emergency'' on the southwest border.   I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Declaration of Former United  States Government Officials be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Joint Declaration of Former United States Government Officials         We, the undersigned, declare as follows:  [[Page S1453]]             1.

On February 15, 2019, the President declared a       ``national emergency'' for the purpose of diverting       appropriated funds from previously designated uses to build a       wall along the southern border. We are aware of no emergency       that remotely justifies such a step. The President's actions       are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public       record, including the administration's own data and       estimates. We have lived and worked through national       emergencies, and we support the President's power to mobilize       the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national       emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the       evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles       the President to tap into funds appropriated for other       purposes to build a wall at the southern border. To our       knowledge, the President's assertion of a national emergency       here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to address a       situation:        (1) that has been enduring, rather than one that has arisen       suddenly;        (2) that in fact has improved over time rather than       deteriorated;        (3) by reprogramming billions of dollars in funds in the       face of clear congressional intent to the contrary; and        (4) with assertions that are rebutted not just by the       public record, but by his agencies' own official data,       documents, and statements.        3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. At       the outset, there is no evidence of a sudden or emergency       increase in the number of people seeking to cross the       southern border. According to the administration's own data,       the numbers of apprehensions and undetected illegal border       crossings at the southern border are near forty-year lows.       Although there was a modest increase in apprehensions in       2018, that figure is in keeping with the number of       apprehensions only two years earlier, and the overall trend       indicates a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years in       particular. The administration also estimates that       ``undetected unlawful entries'' at the southern border ``fell       from approximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000'' between fiscal       years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years for which data are       available. The United States currently hosts what is       estimated to be the smallest number of undocumented       immigrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent years, the       majority of currently undocumented immigrants entered the       United States legally, but overstayed their visas, a problem       that will not be addressed by the declaration of an emergency       along the southern border.        4. There is no documented terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border. There is no reason to       believe that there is a terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border that could justify the       President's proclamation.        a. This administration's own most recent Country Report on       Terrorism, released only five months ago, found that ``there       was no credible evidence indicating that international       terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked       with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into       the United States.'' Since 1975, there has been only one       reported incident in which immigrants who had crossed the       southern border illegally attempted to commit a terrorist       act. That incident occurred more than twelve years ago, and       involved three brothers from Macedonia who had been brought       into the United States as children more than twenty years       earlier.        b. Although the White House has claimed, as an argument       favoring a wall at the southern border, that almost 4,000       known or suspected terrorists were intercepted at the       southern border in a single year, this assertion has since       been widely and consistently repudiated, including by this       administration's own Department of Homeland Security. The       overwhelming majority of individuals on terrorism watchlists       who were intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol were       attempting to travel to the United States by air; of the       individuals on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered       while entering the United States during fiscal year 2017,       only 13 percent traveled by land. And for those who have       attempted to enter by land, only a small fraction do so at       the southern border. Between October 2017 and March 2018,       forty-one foreign immigrants on the terrorist watchlist were       intercepted at the northern border. Only six such immigrants       were intercepted at the southern border.''        5. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the       southern border. Nor can the administration justify its       actions on the grounds that the incidence of violent crime on       the southern border constitutes a national emergency. Factual       evidence consistently shows that unauthorized immigrants have       no special proclivity to engage in criminal or violent       behavior. According to a Cato Institute analysis of       criminological data, undocumented immigrants are 44 percent       less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than are native-      born citizens. And in Texas, undocumented immigrants were       found to have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent below       that of native-born Americans; the conviction rates of       unauthorized immigrants for violent crimes such as homicide       and sex offenses were also below those of native-born       Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of violent crime in the       United States have declined significantly over the past 25       years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And violent       crime rates in the country's 30 largest cities have decreased       on average by 2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further undermining       any suggestion that recent crime trends currently warrant the       declaration of a national emergency.        6. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can       be addressed by a wall at the southern border. The       administration has claimed that the presence of human and       drug trafficking at the border justifies its emergency       declaration. But there is no evidence of any such sudden       crisis at the southern border that necessitates a       reprogramming of appropriations to build a border wall.        a. The overwhelming majority of opioids that enter the       United States across a land border are carried through legal       ports of entry in personal or commercial vehicles, not       smuggled through unauthorized border crossings. A border wall       would not stop these drugs from entering the United States.       Nor would a wall stop drugs from entering via other routes,       including smuggling tunnels, which circumvent such physical       barriers as fences and walls, and international mail (which       is how high-purity fentanyl, for example, is usually shipped       from China directly to the United States).        b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the southern border are       not the principal source of human trafficking victims. About       two-thirds of human trafficking victims served by nonprofit       organizations that receive funding from the relevant       Department of Justice office are U.S. citizens, and even       among non-citizens, most trafficking victims usually arrive       in the country on valid visas. None of these instances of       trafficking could be addressed by a border wall. And the       three states with the highest per capita trafficking       reporting rates are not even located along the southern       border.        7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian       concerns that do exist at the southern border. There are real       humanitarian concerns at the border, but they largely result       from the current administration's own deliberate policies       towards migrants. For example, the administration has used a       ``metering'' policy to turn away families fleeing extreme       violence and persecution in their home countries, forcing       them to wait indefinitely at the border to present their       asylum cases, and has adopted a number of other punitive       steps to restrict those seeking asylum at the southern       border. These actions have forced asylum-seekers to live on       the streets or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with       abysmal living conditions, and limited access to basic       sanitation has caused outbreaks of disease and death. This       state of affairs is a consequence of choices this       administration has made, and erecting a wall will do nothing       to ease the suffering of these people.        8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ``national emergency''       will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy       interests. In the face of a nonexistent threat, redirecting       funds for the construction of a wall along the southern       border will undermine national security by needlessly pulling       resources from Department of Defense programs that are       responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and       running effectively.        a. Repurposing funds from the defense construction budget       will drain money from critical defense infrastructure       projects, possibly including improvement of military       hospitals, construction of roads, and renovation of on-base       housing. And the proclamation will likely continue to divert       those armed forces already deployed at the southern border       from their usual training activities or missions, affecting       troop readiness.        b. In addition, the administration's unilateral,       provocative actions are heightening tensions with our       neighbors to the south, at a moment when we need their help       to address a range of Western Hemisphere concerns. These       actions are placing friendly governments to the south under       impossible pressures and driving partners away. They have       especially strained our diplomatic relationship with Mexico,       a relationship that is vital to regional efforts ranging from       critical intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to       cooperative efforts to address the growing tensions with       Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation could well lead to       the  [[Page S1455]]       degradation of the natural environment in a manner that could       only contribute to long-term socioeconomic and security       challenges.        c. Finally, by declaring a national emergency for domestic       political reasons with no compelling reason or justification       from his senior intelligence and law enforcement officials,       the President has further eroded his credibility with foreign       leaders, both friend and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis       erupt, this lack of credibility will materially weaken this       administration's ability to marshal allies to support the       United States, and will embolden adversaries to oppose us.        9. The situation at the border does not require the use of       the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the       use of the armed forces. We understand that the       administration is also claiming that the situation at the       southern border ``requires use of the armed forces,'' and       that a wall is ``necessary to support such use'' of the armed       forces. These claims are implausible.        a. Historically, our country has deployed National Guard       troops at the border solely to assist the Border Patrol when       there was an extremely high number of apprehensions, together       with a particularly low number of Border Patrol agents. But       currently, even with retention and recruitment challenges,       the Border Patrol is at historically high staffing and       funding levels, and apprehensions--measured in both absolute       and per-agent terms--are near historic lows.        b. Furthermore, the composition of southern border       crossings has shifted such that families and unaccompanied       minors now account for the majority of immigrants seeking       entry at the southern border; these individuals do not       present a threat that would need to be countered with       military force.        c. Just last month, when asked what the military is doing       at the border that couldn't be done by the Department of       Homeland Security if it had the funding for it, a top-level       defense official responded, ``[n] one of the capabilities       that we are providing [at the southern border] are combat       capabilities. It's not a war zone along the border.''       Finally, it is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall       across the southern border are somehow necessary to support       the use of armed forces. We are aware of no military- or       security-related rationale that could remotely justify such       an endeavor.        10. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations       process with a declaration of a national emergency at the       southern border. We do not deny that our nation faces real       immigration and national security challenges. But as the       foregoing demonstrates, these challenges demand a thoughtful,       evidence-based strategy, not a manufactured crisis that rests       on falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing before the       Senate Intelligence Committee on January 29, 2019, less than       one month before the Presidential Proclamation, the Directors       of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified about numerous       serious current threats to U.S. national security, but none       of the officials identified a security crisis at the U.S.-      Mexico border. In a briefing before the House Armed Services       Committee the next day, Pentagon officials acknowledged that       the 2018 National Defense Strategy does not identify the       southern border as a security threat. Leading legislators       with access to classified information the President's own       statements have strongly suggested, if not confirmed, that       there is no evidence supporting the administration's claims       of an emergency. And it is reported that the President made       the decision to circumvent the appropriations process and       reprogram money without the Acting Secretary of Defense       having even started to consider where the funds might come       from, suggesting an absence of consultation and internal       deliberations that in our experience are necessary and       expected before taking a decision of this magnitude.        11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our professional       opinion, there is no factual basis for the declaration of a       national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the       appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars       in funding to construct a wall at the southern border, as       directed by the Presidential Proclamation of February 15,       2019.

Mr. President, the reality, of course, is that  apprehensions at the southwest border have dropped 75 percent since  2000. The reality is that many of the southern border communities have  violent crime rates that are lower than our national average. The  reality is that the vast majority of the drugs that are apprehended at  the border are seized at the ports of entry, and a wall would do  nothing to stop this. The President is either out of touch with  reality, willfully ignoring it, or not even reading the material he  gets from his administration.   Presidents do have emergency powers, but they should be invoked only  in true times of crises. It is an abuse of power to invoke these  authorities simply as a political step to energize a President's base.  It is an abuse of power to invoke these authorities to fulfill a  cynical campaign promise he never should have made. The President knew  he would never keep his word or the promise he had made that Mexico  would pay for this border wall.   When Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to convey  these powers to the President, it assumed whoever sat in the Oval  Office would have enough respect for the office and the power being  conveyed not to abuse it. President Trump has failed that test. Since  1976, Presidents of the United States--Republicans and Democrats  alike--have upheld and passed the test. President Trump has failed the  test. Look what he wants to do. The President wants to raid money that  is meant for military housing and military base improvements to pay for  his wall. This is at a time when studies are coming out that show how  our men and women in the military are being housed in inferior or  dangerous conditions. Sometimes the buildings have mold and decay, and  it affects their health. The buildings are rat invested and roach  infested, but the President wants to take the money away from them to  build a wall that we do not need. The President has repeatedly decried  the amount of drugs coming across our border. But now he wants to raid  money that Congress has appropriated for proven drug programs and  counter-drug programs to pay for his wall.    Let me repeat that. In order to build a wall that would do very  little to stop drugs from coming across our border, President Trump  wants to take money away from law enforcement programs that actually  prevent drugs from coming across our border or from programs that  enhance military readiness. I wish I were making this up. It sounds  like something you hear on a comedy program, but it is not comedy, it  is reality, and I have to ask, what is going on?   In the days and weeks ahead, the President's emergency declaration-- which amounts to an end run around both the Constitution and Congress-- is going to be challenged, and it should be. Over the past 2 years, we  have seen the erosion of our institutional checks and balances in the  face of creeping authoritarianism. The time has come for Congress and  members of the President's own party to take a stand. Are we a  democracy, or are we an authoritarian government? It is a pretty basic  question.   I have been here with every President since President Gerald Ford.  They upheld the Constitution, Republicans and Democrats, and they  believed in the separation of power. All of them did. We simply cannot  afford to now remain silent in the face of such an unprecedented  violation of the separation of powers.   It is interesting. As I sit here, I remember some of my Republican  friends--and they are my friends--when President Obama was President.  They shouted from every rooftop about the lurches of an imperial  Presidency. In every Executive order, they saw a threat to Congress's  power. In every speech, they surmised the machinations of a lawless  strong man--a man Donald Trump claimed wasn't born in the United  States. Now, when they are faced with a President who is literally  using his Executive powers to fund what Congress specifically would  not, my Republican friends should echo the same concerns.   I am glad that some in the Republican Party have begun expressing  their reservations about President Trump's national emergency  declaration. Certainly a number of Republicans who serve in national  security positions who signed on to the material  [[Page S1456]]  I have put in the Record did. But fleeting comments to reporters in the  hallway are meaningless unless they are willing to follow up their  words with their votes.   Today, the House will vote to disapprove the President's declaration.  I believe that joint resolution of disapproval will pass the House. In  short order, the Senate will have to vote on it. That is going to be  the true test. That will be the metric history uses to determine  whether Republicans are willing to put our country, our Constitution,  and Congress itself over party.   While the President's emergency declaration stumbles its way through  the courts, I hope my Republican friends take a moment to take stock of  where we are. President Trump will be just a blip in our Nation's  history. But for the sake of appeasing a man who hundreds of times made  a foolish campaign promise, never grounded in reality, will they  forever change the course of the separation of powers in our country?  For the sake of appeasing a President who detests any limits or checks  on his authority, will they forever diminish the role of Congress as a  coequal branch of government? We are the longest surviving democracy on  Earth today because there are checks and balances.   I am reminded of words of caution written by George Washington, our  Founding Father and our Nation's first President, in his Farewell  Address. The words are as true today, and we read this Farewell Address  every year on the floor of the Senate. Here is what President  Washington wrote over 223 years ago:         It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a       free Country should inspire caution in those entrusted with       its administration, to confine themselves within their       respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise       of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another. The       spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all       the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form       of government, a real despotism. . . . If in the opinion of       the People, the distribution or modification of the       Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be       corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution       designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for       though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good,       it is the customary weapon by which free governments are       destroyed.    That is what George Washington said. He warned us against despots.  Remember, this was a man who could have remained President for life,  and he voluntarily stepped down after a second term. He was a man who  did that because he wanted democracy to thrive.   He spoke of the three coequal branches of government--the executive,  the legislative, and the judiciary--and he was reminding us that if you  let one encroach upon the other, you start down the path of despotism.  We don't need that in this country, especially in this age. We don't.   We know what despots are like. We see them around the world. We see  them in South America today, in one country in particular. We see them  in North Korea, where the despot had his uncle executed, his own  brother murdered, and thousands of people are imprisoned, starved, and  dying. A despot who continues to build nuclear weapons to keep himself  in power even as his people die of starvation. In a democracy, that  doesn't happen. We have checks and balances for a reason.   I am going to vote aye on this joint resolution of disapproval. I  urge all Senators to do the same. Have checks and balances.   I remind the President to treat emergency declarations the same way  they have been treated since 1976, the way--certainly in my  experience--Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton, and  Obama did. That preserved democracy. Was it frustrating to each of them  at times? Of course it was. I remember long discussions with President  Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President George H. W. Bush,  President George W. Bush, President Clinton, and President Obama. They  would say: We want to do this. A number of us had to say: You don't  have the authority to do that. And they realized that.   It is not the person who holds the office. It is not the Presiding  Officer. It is not me. It is not the other 98 Members of this body. It  is not the President of the United States. It is not the Members of the  House. It is not the members of the courts. What rules this country is  our Constitution. We are a democracy. We must keep it as a democracy.  Look what happens in those countries where they ignore democracy and  have despots. In Venezuela, people are going without food and medicine.  In the Philippines, where there is a despot, there have been murders of  people who are just under suspicion, encouraged by him. We have seen  the deaths of thousands of people in North Korea because of a despot  who does not care and has no sense of morality.   America is so much better. Follow our Constitution. Obey our  Constitution. Realize there are checks and balances. Have both  Republicans and Democrats stand up and join. Remember what George  Washington said. It was good advice back then; it is good advice today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
