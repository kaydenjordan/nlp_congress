 Mr. Speaker, last year, on my birthday, I was really  excited to see that I had a kayak expedition on my calendar. I love  getting outdoors and especially on the open water, but because I  represent a district that has some of the oldest infrastructure in the  country, it turned out that my kayak tour was an inspection of combined  stormwater and sewer outlets on the Schuylkill River.   That is why I am more excited today to highlight that $2.4 billion  from the bipartisan infrastructure law is being invested in communities  nationwide to support necessary upgrades to our infrastructure to  increase access to clean water.   I am thrilled to see yet another wave of clean water infrastructure  funding, including $92 million for Pennsylvania, being invested in the  health and safety of our families. Nearly half that funding is  available as grants and forgivable loans to ensure that our most  underserved communities can access the investments.   As I noted, some of our greatest infrastructure and environmental  challenges facing southeastern Pennsylvania involve the need to address  critical water, wastewater, and stormwater projects.   This new funding will protect the health of Pennsylvania's children  and families.                            ____________________
