 Mr. Speaker, I am standing beside this  picture of Jackie Walorski, and anybody that ever knew Jackie knew this  is the way she always looked. This bill today that we are talking about  reveals who she really was and still is.   She was born on August 17, 1963, and she passed on August 3, 2022--59  years on Earth, 59 years of a servant's life.   Jackie Walorski never did anything for herself, to advance herself.  Her main concerns were the mothers that she worried about and the  children that she worried about because she knew that was America's  greatest asset.   She knew that everything she did in her life was not about her but  about others. She brought such a new concept to the floor, the people's  House, to not only transform it in legislation but to change people's  hearts.   She would never talk about herself as a Representative or a  Congresswoman.  [[Page H8719]]  She was always here for others, not for herself.   When we look at legislation, from time to time, we start to think  about what it is that we are really doing. What are we asking our  taxpayers to invest in? If it is not our future, then why are we here?   The most important asset for Jackie Walorski was expectant mothers,  infants, and childcare. She was truly unusual, but in her 59 years, she  did so much to help so many.                                time  0945    I think for us to be here today on the people's House, on the floor,  and to be able to share who she is--I said August 3 she passed. The  only difference is Jackie is not here in person, but she is looking  down from her spot in heaven and smiling the way she is smiling in this  picture because that is the essence of who Jackie Walorski was. We all  loved her, we all miss her, and we know we will never replace her, but  we sure thank God for giving her to us for 59 years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Drs. Wenstrup and Davis for bringing this  forward, and I cannot believe in anything other than a complete ``yes''  from every single Member of the House on this bill.
