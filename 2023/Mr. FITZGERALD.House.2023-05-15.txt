 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3089) to amend title 18, United States Code, to modify  delayed notice requirements, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3089         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NDO Fairness Act''.       SEC. 2. PRECLUSION OF NOTICE.         Section 2705(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:        ``(b) Preclusion of Notice.--        ``(1) Application.--        ``(A) In general.--A governmental entity that is seeking a       warrant, order, or subpoena under section 2703, when it is       not required to notify the customer or subscriber, or to the       extent that it may delay such notice pursuant to subsection       (a), may apply to a court for an order, subject to paragraph       (6), directing a provider of electronic communications       service or remote computing service to which a warrant,       order, or subpoena under section 2703 is directed not to       notify any other person of the existence of the warrant,       order, or subpoena.        ``(B) Length.--An order granted under subparagraph (A)       shall be in effect for a period of not more than 90 days.        ``(C) Other requirements.--        ``(i) In general.--A application for an order under       subparagraph (A) shall state, to the best of the applicant's       knowledge, whether the named customer or subscriber whose       information is sought by the warrant, order, or subpoena       under section 2703--         ``(I) is aware of the warrant, order, subpoena, or       underlying investigation; and        ``(II) is suspected of involvement in the commission of the       crime under investigation.         ``(ii) Orders.--An order granted under this paragraph may       not direct, or otherwise require, a provider of electronic       communications service or remote computing service to provide       notification of the expiration of order to the court or       government entity that sought the order.        ``(2) Determination.--        ``(A) In general.--The court may not grant a request for an       order made under paragraph (1), or an extension of such order       requested by the governmental entity pursuant to paragraph       (3), unless--        ``(i) the court issues a written determination, based on       specific and articulable facts, and including written       findings of fact and conclusions of law, that it is likely       that not granting the request will result in--         ``(I) endangering the life or physical safety of an       individual;        ``(II) flight from prosecution;        ``(III) destruction of or tampering with evidence;        ``(IV) intimidation of potential witnesses; or        ``(V) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or       unduly delaying a trial; and         ``(ii) the order is narrowly tailored and there is no less       restrictive alternative, including notification to an       individual or organization within or providing legal       representation to the named customer or subscriber, that is       not likely to result in an adverse result as described in       clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph (A); and        ``(iii) the court has reviewed the individual warrant,       order, or subpoena under section 2703 to which the order       issued under this paragraph applies.        ``(B) Nature of the offense.--The court may consider the       nature of the offense in issuing a determination under       subparagraph (A).        ``(3) Extension.--A governmental entity may request one or       more extensions of an order granted under paragraph (2) of       not more than 90 days for each such extension.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING DELAYED NOTICE.         Section 2705 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Annual Report.--On an annual basis, the Attorney       General shall provide to the Committee on the Judiciary of       the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary       of the Senate, and the Director of the Administrative Office       of the United States Courts, which the Director shall publish       on the website of the Administrative Office of the United       States Courts, in a manner consistent with protection of       national security, a report setting forth with respect to the       preceding calendar year, for each Federal judicial district--        ``(1) the number of named customers or subscribers with       respect to whom, in that  [[Page H2322]]       calendar year, a warrant, subpoena, or court order was issued       pursuant to section 2703;        ``(2) the aggregate number of applications requesting delay       of notification pursuant to subsection (a)(1), preclusion of       notice pursuant to subsection (b)(1), and extensions pursuant       to subsection (b)(3);        ``(3) the aggregate number of orders under this section       either granting, extending, or denying a request for delay of       notification or preclusion of notice;        ``(4) the aggregate number of orders under this section       affecting a member of the news media, including any conduct       related to activities protected under the First Amendment;       and        ``(5) the aggregate number of arrests, trials, and       convictions, resulting from investigations in which orders       under this section were obtained, including the offenses for       which individuals were arrested, tried, or convicted.      The Attorney General shall include in the report under this       subsection a description of the process and the information       used to determine the numbers for each of paragraphs (1)       through (5).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3089, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, H.R. 3089,  the NDO Fairness Act. This bill makes much-needed changes to the way  law enforcement obtains and utilizes nondisclosure orders, also known  as secrecy orders.   Before modern advancements in cloud computing, when a law enforcement  officer wanted to search someone's office, they would be required to  obtain a search warrant based on probable cause, as we are all well  aware of. When the officer executed the search, they would notify the  individual, who would then have an opportunity to challenge the search  in court. However, the era of cloud computing has ushered in a new  method of storing sensitive information, whereby, as we know,  individuals are replacing file cabinets with digital file folders.   Unbeknownst to them, by surrendering this physical office in favor of  a digital office, individuals are also surrendering their expectation  of privacy. That is because a provision within the Electronic  Communications Privacy Act allows law enforcement to access an  individual's data by subpoenaing the third-party service provider, such  as Microsoft, Google, or Apple, rather than the individual.   The law enforcement officer then imposes a secrecy order on the  company, preventing them from notifying the individual of the search.  The secrecy order is often boilerplate in nature and without a time  limit, leading to abuse and overuse.   According to Microsoft, between January to June 2022, Federal  authorities requested U.S. citizen data from more than 5,500 accounts,  an average of 15 requests per day. Over the same time period, Google  received more than 21,000 subpoenas for nearly 50,000 accounts. Apple,  whose public data is only available through calendar year 2021,  received more than 6,600 requests between July and December of that  year.   In nearly all the cases, a secrecy order was imposed on the company  to prevent the disclosure of the search. The NDO Fairness Act would  stop this abuse, which has allowed the circumvention of Fourth  Amendment protections in favor of simple convenience.   This legislation ends indefinite secrecy orders, instead requiring  the court to certify that disclosing the search is likely to jeopardize  an investigation, result in the destruction of evidence, or endanger  the life of an individual.   This legislation also imposes a 90-day limit on secrecy orders, with  an extension available if and only if the need for secrecy is justified  based on the facts and approval by a judge.   Finally, this legislation gives the individual subject to searches a  chance to be heard and a chance to request a copy of the information  that was disclosed.   Today's legislation, while not a major overhaul of ECPA, provides us  with an opportunity to address the threat to our constitutional  freedoms. These changes, I believe, will bring searches of the cloud  more closely in line with Fourth Amendment searches.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Nadler), the  ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, for co-leading this  bill, and I thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman Jordan, for  his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my strong support for this  bipartisan bill, H.R. 3089, which will provide much-needed safeguards  on the secrecy order process.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all my colleagues will support this bill, I  urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 363) expressing support for recognizing  ``National Police Week,'' as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 363         Whereas Federal, State, local, and Tribal police officers,       sheriffs, and other law enforcement officers across the       United States serve with valor, dignity, and integrity;        Whereas law enforcement officers are charged with--        (1) pursuing justice for all individuals; and        (2) performing the duties of a law enforcement officer with       fidelity to the constitutional and civil rights of the public       the officers serve;        Whereas law enforcement officers swear an oath to uphold       the public trust even though, through the performance of the       duties of a law enforcement officer, the officers may become       targets for senseless acts of violence;        Whereas, in 1962, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy signed       Public Law 87-726 (36 U.S.C. 136) (referred to in this       preamble as the ``Joint Resolution''), which authorizes the       President to proclaim May 15 of every year as ``Peace       Officers Memorial Day'' in honor of the Federal, State, and       local officers who have been killed, disabled, or otherwise       injured in the line of duty;        Whereas the Joint Resolution also authorizes the President       to designate the week in which Peace Officers Memorial Day       falls as ``National Police Week'';        Whereas the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial,       dedicated on October 15, 1991, is the national monument to       honor those law enforcement officers who have died in the       line of duty; and        Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 2023, honors the 556       law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty,       including 224 officers killed in 2022, as well as 332       officers killed in previous years whose stories were       recovered during 2022, including--        (1) Michael Lynn Gillis;        (2) Bradley S.H.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 363, as amended, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate National Police Week. In doing  so, we honor those officers who were killed in the line of duty.   The measure before us, H. Res. 363, recognizes countless law  enforcement officers who serve their communities with valor, dignity,  and integrity. It also explains the history behind Peace Officers  Memorial Day and National Police Week. It also lists the 556 law  enforcement officers killed in the line of duty or whose stories were  recovered during 2022.   Mr. Speaker, I will take this opportunity to individually memorialize  the Wisconsin police officers killed in the line of duty in 2023:  Officer Peter Jerving, age 37, of the Milwaukee Police Department, died  in the line of duty on February 7; Officer Emily Breidenbach, age 32,  of the Chetek Police Department, died in the line of duty on April 8;  Officer Hunter Scheel, age 23, of the Cameron Police Department, died  in the line of duty on April 8; and Deputy Kaitie Leising, age 29, of  the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office, died in the line of duty just on  May 6.   These four brave individuals, and the 556 who went before them in  2022, represent the best of Wisconsin and this country, and we are  grateful for their service and their heroic effort in a time of crisis.   National Police Week is a solemn reminder of the actions our law  enforcement officers take each day to keep our communities safe.   I myself am the proud son of a law enforcement officer, as well as  the proud father to a former law enforcement officer. I have seen their  sacrifice firsthand: the long hours, the nights away from family, and  the missed holidays. They do it over and over again without complaint  because it is the job and because it keeps our community safe.   In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of ambush- style and targeted attacks on law enforcement officers. These senseless  acts of violence are reprehensible, and they must stop.   Today, I hope that the House speaks with one voice in support of law  enforcement and to the families of the officers who have fallen.   I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest) for introducing  this important resolution of which I am a proud cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this resolution to  honor our fallen law enforcement officers and celebrate those still  wearing the uniform.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest), who is the sponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the Speaker that I have no  further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, reiterate my strong  support for this bipartisan resolution celebrating National Police Week  and law enforcement officers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
