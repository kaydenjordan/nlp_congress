 Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that I have sat here and  listened to some of the 1 minutes from my friends across the aisle, and  they are talking about the need for COVID relief.   Apparently, to get COVID relief, you have got to have cannabis. You  have got to have pot. That is the Democrats' version of COVID relief  this week.   But they don't feel like they all need to be here to deal with this  issue, so they are going to mail it in. They are going to phone in  their votes, and, quite frankly, in a most disturbing and  unconstitutional manner.   Mr. Speaker, we can be here; they should be here. If this meant  everything that they say it does, they would show up. They would show  up and vote.   We could have had committee hearings, for Pete's sakes. We could have  committee hearings where we could discuss and debate. We would have  floor debates with open rules. And you know what? People would show up.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
