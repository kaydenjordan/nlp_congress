The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3759.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3759.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3759, the Recognize, Assist, Include,  Support, and Engage Family Caregivers Act of 2017, otherwise known as  the RAISE Family Caregivers Act.   Mr. Speaker, not all Americans have the luxury of complete  independence. They may struggle to dress themselves, manage their  retirement, or take their medications adequately. When we think of  these instances, we may think mostly of seniors, but that is not always  the case. Veterans, Americans  [[Page H10150]]  with physical and mental disabilities, wounded warriors, and even  children with medical conditions rely on a family caregiver to help  them live their daily lives.   Though they may have physical or functional limitations or an illness  or chronic health condition that impedes their ability to fully care  for themselves, many are able to remain safe and comfortable in their  homes due to the important role of the family caregiver.   Nationwide, there are roughly 40 million family caregivers who  provide physical and emotional care for parents, spouses, children, and  other loved ones in need of assistance. These caregivers are unsung  heroes who devote both their time and resources to the day-to-day  activities that are necessary to provide a disabled loved one with  care.   These activities may be to drive their loved ones to doctor  appointments, provide them with meals, assist in the management of  their finances, and administer at-home nursing and care so that their  loved ones may continue to live at home.   Taking on the role of a family caregiver is a deeply personal  decision, characterized by selflessness and compassion for a relative  in need. It is estimated that, on average, the Nation's caregivers  dedicate about 18 hours each week to carrying out their caregiver  tasks, while almost a third provide over 60 hours a week of care. These  activities provide an annual economic value of $470 billion each year.   About 60 percent of caregivers have full- or part-time jobs in  addition to their caregiving roles, leaving them to juggle their  caregiving obligations with their work hours and their personal and  family time.   The RAISE Family Caregivers Act will direct the Secretary of Health  and Human Services to develop a Family Caregiving Advisory Council to  make recommendations regarding best practices on recognizing and  supporting family caregivers. The council will include members from the  public and private sectors, family caregivers, elderly Americans and  people living with disabilities, State and local officials, and  healthcare providers. The Secretary will then publish the council's  findings so that the family caregivers may be equipped with the  information that they need to be successful in their roles.   The council will provide information about streamlining Federal and  State activities to maximize efficiency, and it will preserve the  integrity of family rights and person-centered care. This is an  opportunity to help improve the quality of life of millions of  Americans who both provide and receive familial care.   One important provision of the RAISE Family Caregivers Act ensures  that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from  mandating best practices or expanding the Federal authority in any way.   Additionally, the bill does not authorize any additional funds for  the formation of the council and, after 3 years, the council and its  related activities will sunset.   The RAISE Family Caregivers Act is an important step we can take to  recognize the essential role of family caregivers and share important  information so that they can better care for others. This legislation  fulfills a bipartisan recommendation of the Federal Commission on Long- Term Care. The Senate passed this bill earlier this year by unanimous  consent, and the House of Representatives now has the opportunity to  have this bill signed into law.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation so that  family caregivers are recognized for the important role they play in  our communities.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Harper).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Harper).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Harper).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress in April, I served as the  Kansas State treasurer. In that role, I had the opportunity to  implement the ABLE Act, which was legislation that was passed here in  the last few years.   Talking with a lot of parents, as they were abled and concerned about  how do they care for their disabled children, led to the creation of  the ABLE Act. During that process, we also talked with a lot of other  caregivers who cared for maybe senior citizens, maybe adult children  who were in their home, and wanted to make sure that that burden that  they faced in providing that family care was ameliorated and supported  in any way that it could be.   The RAISE Family Caregivers Act will help recognize the essential  role of family caregivers and share important information so that they  may better care for others.   This legislation fulfills a bipartisanship recommendation from the  Commission on Long-Term Care, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of H.R. 3759.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3759, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  [[Page H10152]]  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 95) expressing support  for the use of public-private partnerships to bring computer science  education to more K-12 classrooms, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 95         Whereas 9 in 10 parents want their child to study computer       science, but only 40 percent of schools teach computer       programming;        Whereas low-income students and students from small towns       and rural communities are less likely to attend a school that       offers computer science programming;        Whereas computing makes up two-thirds of all projected new       jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics       fields;        Whereas there are over 500,000 open computing jobs       nationwide and such job openings are projected to grow at       twice the rate of all other jobs;        Whereas significant workforce shortages in computing       fields, particularly in cybersecurity, can pose significant       threats to our national security; and        Whereas computing occupations are among the highest paying       jobs for new graduates: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That the Congress expresses support for the use       of public-private partnerships to bring computer science       education to more K-12 classrooms throughout the country.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 95.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 95.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 95, expressing  support for the use of public-private partnerships to bring computer  science education to more K-12 classrooms.   Mr. Speaker, science, technology, engineering, and math education,  known collectively as STEM education, all play a critical role in how  we educate and prepare the next generation of America's workforce.   Many of our Nation's most successful business leaders and  entrepreneurs place an emphasis on modern coding and computer skills.  These skills are a result of a STEM education.   As an engineer who worked for many years in the private sector, I  would like to emphasize the need for more of our students to be  equipped with backgrounds in STEM.   The American economy and workforce have undergone a rapid  transformation, thanks to the rise of technology, and its role in  America's future is only going to increase.   As advancement continues, it is critical that the country's students  are equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to compete at the  global level. These skills can be gained through the expansion of K-12  STEM education.   America has long been a pioneer of innovation in medicine, energy,  agriculture, and other new technologies. We take pride in our ability  to cultivate, innovate, and change the world for the better as new  trends in every corner of the economy require a workforce equipped to  meet those demands. However, if we do not adequately prepare our future  scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists, other  countries will outpace us. We cannot allow this.   Of all the projected new jobs in science, technology, engineering,  and mathematic fields, computing is estimated to make up two-thirds of  those positions. At the present, there are over 500,000 unfilled  computing jobs nationwide, and those numbers are projected to grow at  twice the rate of other jobs.   In my district in Kansas, we need students to learn STEM in order to  fill new jobs in advanced manufacturing.   When Congress passed landmark legislation earlier this year to  strengthen career and technical education, or CTE, it sent a clear  message to students and employers that Members of the House of  Representatives recognize the growing skills gap in this country, and  we are committed to improving alignment with in-demand jobs so that the  6 million job openings nationwide may be filled with students equipped  with the necessary tools to make our workforce even stronger.   Congress has once again had the opportunity to help close the skills  gap by launching more American students into fulfilling STEM careers.  These careers are not only in high demand, but they are also high  skilled and among the highest paying jobs for new graduates.   Students who enter this field are not only helping to close the  skills gap in our country, but they are setting themselves up for a  lifetime of meaningful work and personal fulfillment. In fact, 9 in 10  parents want their children to study computer science, but less than  half--only 40 percent--of schools teach the subject. Low-income  students and students hailing from small towns and rural communities  are especially at a disadvantage. Their schools are much less likely to  offer computer science courses than schools in urban areas and those  that serve middle class students.   A ZIP Code and economic data does not determine whether a child will  need to excel in computer science, and it should not determine whether  that child receives computer science education. We need coders and  computer scientists from a wealth of backgrounds to build the most  capable and robust workforce in the world.   Encouraging public-private partnerships to bring computer science  education to more K-12 classrooms nationwide is a commonsense solution  to develop STEM education around the country.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this resolution to  encourage efforts to provide more students access to these important  skills so that they are prepared to join our Nation's workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee, we try to endeavor to look at how do we prepare students and  young adults for their career and look at ways to prepare them not just  from starting with an engineering degree or a technical degree at  college, but actually making sure that in their K-12 education they are  better prepared as well.   As an engineer, I saw this firsthand how my education through high  school and into college helped prepare me for the career that I had in  the private sector before I went into the public service role. We see  this continuously with the importance of having a trained workforce  ready to work in our industries.   In my district, Wichita is known as the Air Capital of the World, and  the one thing that I hear over and over again from aerospace companies  is there is a shortage of trained, skilled workforce ready to work.   STEM education plays such a critical role in terms of how we educate  and prepare the next generation of America's workforce, and so we need  to encourage public and private partnerships in order to increase  computer science education in K-12 classrooms. It is just a commonsense  solution to try to increase STEM education in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H. Con. Res.  95, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House suspend  the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 95, as  amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was  agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
