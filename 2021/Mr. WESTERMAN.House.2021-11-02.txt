 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dick  Antoine, a wonderful man and beloved local radio personality in my  hometown of Hot Springs.   Dick served in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam war, and in  2018, he retired from his daily talk radio program, ``Talk of the  Town,'' where he informed and entertained his faithful listeners for 31  years.   Dick is not only known for his insightful interviews and witty  commentary but also his leadership. A few of his many projects included  the Veterans Memorial of Garland County,  [[Page H6079]]  fundraising for the Fallen Hero Memorial, and emceeing Hot Springs'  annual Christmas parade for over 25 years and the Veterans Day parade  for 17 years.   Families will cherish the memories of Dick's special characterization  of Santa Claus, the World's Tallest Leprechaun, and Oktoberfest  ambassador in a chicken costume.   Dick's legacy will live on in the memories of Hot Springs residents,  and his presence will be sorely missed. My condolences go to Dick's  family and many friends as we grieve his passing and celebrate his  life.                             Honoring Jim Guldin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of a  fellow Arkansan and Yale forester, Dr. James Guldin, or Jim as his  friends call him.   Jim taught at Arkansas' only forestry school, the University of  Arkansas at Monticello, for 10 years before joining the United States  Forest Service research division, where he made great contributions to  our knowledge of forest ecology and management through his applied  research and publications over a career that spanned nearly three  decades.   Jim worked tirelessly to restore native southern pine ecosystems,  illustrating how science-based thinning and prescribed burning are  common sense, and to highlight effective tools for a healthy forest  providing cleaner air and water as well as abundant wildlife habitat.   I truly believe Dr. Jim Guldin is the world's most knowledgeable  person when it comes to shortleaf pine and that his work will live long  past the lifespan of a human generation in the forests that benefited  from his labor of love.   I have been blessed to know some amazing conservationists in my life,  and Jim Guldin is one of them. I wish him a happy retirement and many  days ahead catching smallmouth bass in clear mountain streams and  spending time where all fosterers are most at home: in the woods.                            ____________________
