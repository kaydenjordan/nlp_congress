 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3542) to impose sanctions against Hamas  for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by  reason of the use of civilians as human shields, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3542         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hamas Human Shields       Prevention Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The international law of armed conflict prohibits,       during any armed conflict, the exploitation of the presence       of civilians, or movement of civilians, in an effort to       impede attack on or otherwise shield lawful targets from       attack.        (2) Violation of this obligation is commonly referred to as       using persons as ``human shields'', the unlawful exploitation       of civilian persons or property in an attempt to impede       attack on or otherwise shield lawful targets from attack.        (3) The international law of armed conflict also prohibits       exposing prisoners of war, other detainees, or the wounded       and sick to unnecessary risks resulting from the conduct of       hostilities, which clearly includes a prohibition against       using such personnel in an effort to impede attack on or       otherwise shield lawful targets from attack.        (4) Under the international law of armed conflict, the use       of human shields is a critical consideration when assessing       whether infliction of civilian harm by a party to the       conflict was in fact unreasonable under the circumstances.        (5) Throughout the violent takeover of Gaza by Hamas in       2007, the organization engaged in summary executions and       torture, and put the lives of civilians at constant risk.        (6) Since that 2007 takeover of Gaza, Hamas forces have       repeatedly fired rockets into Israel in an indiscriminate       manner, routinely striking civilian population areas that       cannot plausibly be considered lawful military targets.        (7) Hamas attacks are routinely launched from firing       positions in areas of dense civilian population, often in or       near schools, mosques, or hospitals, with no plausible       justification based on military necessity.        (8) Unlawful Hamas tactics also include routinely forcing       Palestinian civilians to gather on the roofs of their homes       to act as human shields.        (9) Because these Hamas tactics cannot be justified by       military necessity, they indicate an effort to endanger both       Israeli and Palestinian civilians.        (10) The Israel Defense Force, in response to such serious       violations by Hamas, has vigorously taken all feasible       precautions to  [[Page H1084]]       minimize civilian casualties and protect civilian objects, in       accordance with the international laws of armed conflict.       Such tactics have included providing warnings to civilians       when feasible.        (11) Since 2010, Hamas has enlisted children to work as       laborers in the tunnel networks between Gaza and Egypt.        (12) On June 9, 2017, the United Nations Relief and Works       Agency announced it had discovered Hamas tunnels under two of       its schools in the Gaza Strip, adding it was ``unacceptable       that students and staff are placed at risk in such a way''.        (13) Hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist       organization by the Secretary of State on October 8, 1997.        (14) In addition to Hamas, other armed groups, such as       Hezbollah, the Islamic State, al-Qa'ida, and al-Shabaab,       typically use civilians as human shields.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It shall be the policy of the United States to--        (1) officially and publicly condemn Hamas for violating the       international law of armed conflict by exploiting civilians,       civilian property, and other specially protected personnel       and facilities, in an effort to shield military targets from       lawful attack; and        (2) take effective action against those knowingly engaging       in, supporting, facilitating, or enabling such undisputed       violations of international law through the use of human       shields.       SEC. 4. UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.         The President should direct the United States Permanent       Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,       and influence of the United States at the United Nations       Security Council to secure support for a resolution that       would--        (1) impose multilateral sanctions against Hamas for the use       of human shields;        (2) require member nations to take specific steps to       prevent the use of human shields and impose consequences on       those who use human shields;        (3) require the United Nations to track and report the use       of human shields in any conflict monitored by an organization       or agency of the United Nations; and        (4) specify steps to prevent, and consequences for, the use       of United Nations employees as human shields or the use of       United Nations facilities or infrastructure to enable the use       of civilians as human shields.       SEC. 5. SANCTIONS ON FOREIGN PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR GROSS                     VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN                     RIGHTS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative  [[Page H1085]]  days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous  material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the coauthor of this legislation and a  good friend, Congressman Seth Moulton from Massachusetts, a valued Iraq  veteran; as well as the original cosponsors, Congresswoman Ileana Ros- Lehtinen and Congressman Ted Deutch. I also appreciate Chairman Ed  Royce and the House Foreign Affairs Committee for allowing it to  proceed to a floor vote.   H.R. 3542, the Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act, will sanction  Hamas for violating human rights standards by using civilians as human  shields.   For far too long, Hamas has taken shelter and launched offenses  against Israel from civilian areas, including schools, hospitals, and  mosques. Their cowardly actions knowingly and carelessly put innocent  lives at risk and are a gross violation of human rights and  international law.   Last June, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA,  discovered Hamas tunnels under two of its schools in Gaza,  demonstrating how they knowingly integrate terrorist operations with  children in civilian areas.   Sadly, the Iranians and Hamas are willing to fight to the last  Palestinian man, woman, and child in their quest to annihilate the  people of Israel. Yet neither Hamas nor Iran have been properly held  accountable by responsible nations for their crimes against humanity.  Unfortunately, the prior U.S. administration never raised this as a  serious issue with the Iranians. The cowardly Iranians and Hamas  sacrifice innocent Palestinians for their self-destructive ideology.   The world must face the threat of Hamas as it continues to perpetrate  atrocities against civilians by using them as human shields. This  legislation imposes direct sanctions against any Hamas terrorist who is  responsible for using human shields.   This bill, Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act, encourages the U.S.  Permanent Representative to the United Nations to secure a U.N.  Security Council multilateral resolution imposing sanctions against  Hamas for the use of human shields. It would also sanction foreign  governments and individuals who provide material and financial support  to Hamas, which would cut off the resources that allow Hamas to  terrorize civilians.   I appreciate that Ambassador Nikki Haley has been outspoken against  the murderous terrorists in the global war on terrorism. I believe this  legislation will promote working to ensure that lives of innocent  civilians of the citizens of Gaza are spared by proactively imposing  strong sanctions against Hamas and their murderous actions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 3542, the       ``Hamas Human Shields Prevention Act.'' As a result of your       having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 3542 that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3542 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 3542 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 3542, the Hamas Human Shields       Prevention Act, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3542 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who  chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North  Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First, I would like to thank Congressman Sherman for his leadership  in this bipartisan legislation, which will make a difference on behalf  of the people of Gaza and on behalf of the people of Israel.   The terrorists of Hamas hide behind school children, hospital  patients, and other vulnerable civilians. This cowardly use of human  shields is a grave  [[Page H1087]]  human rights abuse that must be stopped, which sacrifices the lives of  innocent Palestinians.   I again want to thank the bipartisan sponsors of the Hamas Human  Shields Prevention Act, which deserves our unanimous support, and, in  particular, I point out the cosponsorship by the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 129) calling on the  Department of Defense, other elements of the Federal Government, and  foreign governments to intensify efforts to investigate, recover, and  identify all missing and unaccounted-for personnel of the United  States, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 129         Whereas according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency       of the Department of Defense, more than 82,000 United States       personnel are still unaccounted-for from past wars and       conflicts around the world;        Whereas, though recognizing that an estimated 48,000 of       these personnel were presumed lost at sea and are unlikely to       be recovered, tens of thousands of families and friends have       waited decades for the accounting of their loved ones and       comrades in arms;        Whereas the families of these brave Americans deserve our       Nation's best efforts to achieve the fullest possible       accounting for their missing loved ones;        Whereas the National League of POW/MIA Families, and their       iconic POW/MIA flag, pioneered the Vietnam War accounting       effort since 1970 and has been joined in this humanitarian       quest for answers by Korean War, Cold War, and World War II       families, fully supported by the American Legion, the       Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans,       Jewish War Veterans, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America,       Special Forces Association, Special Operations Association,       Rolling Thunder, and other more recently formed groups, and       tens of thousands of families and veterans are yearning and       advocating for answers concerning the fates of their loved       ones and comrades in arms;        Whereas the mission of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting       Agency of the Department of Defense is to provide the fullest       possible accounting for missing members of the Armed Forces       of the United States, designated civilians of the Department,       and other designated personnel; and        Whereas the recovery and investigation teams of the       Department of Defense deploy to countries around the world to       account as fully as possible for these unaccounted-for United       States personnel: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls upon the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and       other elements of the Department of Defense, other       appropriate elements of the Federal Government, and all       foreign governments to resolutely continue efforts to       investigate, recover, identify, and account as fully as       possible for all United States personnel designated as       unaccounted-for from past wars and conflicts around the       world; and        (2) calls upon all foreign governments with information on       United States personnel designated as unaccounted-for from       past wars and conflicts, or with such personnel within their       territories, to cooperate fully with the Government of the       United States to provide the fullest possible accounting for       those American lives.     I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 129, which recommits us to the  sacred task of accounting fully for our troops who are still missing  and unaccounted for in past wars and conflicts.   From World War II onward, more than 82,000 U.S. personnel have not  come home and are not accounted for. That means that for tens of  thousands of American families, friends, and comrades in arms, the pain  of uncertainty continues to this very day.   This resolution also calls upon foreign nations to fully cooperate  and to provide the Defense POW-MIA Accounting Agency with all  information on our missing personnel that those countries may have. It  is especially appropriate that we are considering this resolution this  week, which marks the 45th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, which  secured the return of more than 550 American prisoners of war from  Vietnam.   This group that left Hanoi on February 12, 1973, included an American  fighter pilot whose F-4 had been shot down over North Vietnam in 1966.  When he ejected from his plane, he had suffered a broken arm, a broken  back, and a dislocated shoulder, but that was only the start of his  ordeal.   This pilot spent nearly 7 years as a prisoner of war, enduring  torture, abuse, and an incomprehensible 3 years in solitary  confinement. For 18 months, he shared a cell with Senator John McCain  at the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton.''   For his service and heroism, he was awarded two Silver Stars, two  Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, one Bronze Star with  Valor, two Purple Hearts, and numerous other deserved awards.   After that pilot returned home, he stated: ``The freedoms that most  Americans take for granted are, in fact, real and must be preserved. I  have returned to a great nation, and our sacrifices have been well  worth the effort. I pledge to continue to serve and fight to protect  the freedoms and ideals that the United States stands for.''   Well, we know that that pilot did continue to serve, not only in the  military. He is a former combat warrior and prisoner of war, an  American hero, and a Member of Congress. His name is Sam Johnson, and  we are honored by his presence in the Chamber today.   I want to thank Congressman Johnson for introducing this resolution.  But even more, we all, every American, want to thank him for his life  of valor and service.  [[Page H1088]]    H. Res. 129 is an opportunity to renew our pledge to our men and  women in uniform and to the families of those who have gone missing in  service to our country. We will leave no one behind, and we will not  forget your solemn sacrifices laid upon the altar of freedom. I urge  support for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                  Washington, DC, February 12, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       129, a resolution ``Calling on the Department of Defense,       other appropriate elements of the Federal Government, and       foreign governments to resolutely continue efforts to       investigate, recover, and identify all United States       personnel designated as unaccounted for from past wars and       conflicts around the world.'' There are certain provisions in       the resolution which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on Armed Services.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important       legislation, I am willing to waive this committee's further       consideration of H. Res. 129. I do so with the understanding       that by waiving consideration of the resolution, the       Committee on Armed Services does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the legislation which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, February 12, 2018.        Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of House Resolution 129, which concerns       efforts to investigate, recover, and identify all missing and       unaccounted-for personnel of the United States, so that the       resolution may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. The       suspension text of the resolution incorporates edits worked       out with assistance from your committee.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future.        I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 129 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the author  of this measure, a former fighter pilot and prisoner of war, and a true  American hero.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations; and a longstanding leader on behalf of  veterans' issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   As I close, I want to commend the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency,  which continues the noble work of accounting for our missing troops and  personnel day in and day out around the world.   I also want to express gratitude to those groups that continue to  keep the home fires burning bright for the many families still awaiting  concrete information on their loved ones. These include:   The National League of POW/MIA Families;   The American Legion;   The Veterans of Foreign Wars;   The Disabled American Veterans;   The Jewish War Veterans;   AMVETS;   Vietnam Veterans of America;   The Special Forces Association;   The Special Operations Association; and   Rolling Thunder.   Finally, I, again, thank Congressman Sam Johnson for introducing this  resolution and for exemplifying the ideals of service, sacrifice, and  honor. He was recognized by his communist suppressors as one of the  most stubborn prisoners, a true tribute of his courage.   All Members of Congress, of both parties, cherish the service of  Congressman Sam Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H. Res. 129, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
