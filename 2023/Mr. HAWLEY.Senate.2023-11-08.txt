 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on October 7, Hamas terrorists crossed  the border of Israel and committed atrocities, the full extent of which  we are only just now coming to understand.   Thousands of innocent Israelis have lost their lives. Israeli babies  were beheaded--literally beheaded--put into ovens, according to news  reports. Innocent civilians were shot in their homes when they answered  their front doors. Soldiers who were asleep in their beds were  executed. And the terrorist attacks have continued.   Amazingly, in the United States--even as this terrible attack was  unfolding in Israel--in the United States, hundreds and thousands of  students and others took to America's campuses to express solidarity,  not with innocent Israelis who had lost their lives but with Hamas, and  to voice support for the genocidal campaign that Hamas has sought to  carry out and continues to advance and advocate even as we stand here  today.   Take a look at just some of the things that have been said by  students on America's college campuses. Students at Harvard University  said they held the Israeli regime ``entirely responsible''--entirely  responsible--``for all the unfolding violence.'' You had students at  the University of North Carolina who said they believed it was their  ``moral obligation to be in solidarity with the dispossessed, no matter  the pathway to liberation they choose to take. This includes  violence.''   Oh, and Hamas is violent. There is no doubt we have seen  extraordinary violence, unbelievable violence, in the most brutal  attack on Israel and the Jewish people in 50 years.   Students at New York University School of Law wrote that they  expressed first and foremost their unwavering and absolute solidarity  with Palestinians and their resistance against oppression toward  liberation and self-determination. ``Israel,'' they said, ``bears full  responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.''   I could go on. And I am happy to say that this body has unanimously  condemned these statements--this progenocidal rhetoric--by students in  this country.   I wish that it had stopped at rhetoric, but it hasn't. We have seen  the assaults  [[Page S5419]]  on Jewish students right on our campuses. We have seen Jews barricaded  in university libraries, unable to leave, as pro-Hamas demonstrators  shout and scream outside calling for the destruction of Israel. We have  seen Jewish students physically assaulted--if you don't believe me,  just go look on the internet--physically assaulted on American campuses  by pro-Hamas demonstrators.   We have even seen it in high schools, where students are chanting:         From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free.    What does that mean? It is a call for the destruction of the State of  Israel. It is a call for the execution of Jews in the Middle East, in  this country, everywhere. That is the Hamas agenda.   And so many Americans, including me, have been absolutely stunned to  see so many students and others echoing these claims. And it has raised  the question: Where is this coming from? Where are these students and  young people--teenagers--where are they hearing this? Where are they  seeing it? Where are they being fed this propaganda? Because  propaganda, it is.   At least one of the answers is, they are finding it on TikTok. Yes,  TikTok, that Chinese-based, Chinese-owned social media app that is a  back door for the Chinese Communist Party to track the movements, the  key strokes, the whereabouts, the information of every American who has  the app on their phone.   What we know now is that for many, many younger Americans--the so- called Generation Z; those in their teens and early twenties--so many  of them--74 percent of them, in fact--use TikTok as a search engine.  And, in fact, a majority of them prefer TikTok to Google as a principle  search engine. So where are Americans and Generation Z increasingly  getting their news? What are they using to search for information? They  are using TikTok. They are getting their news from TikTok.   At the same time, this same cohort of young Americans, more than 50  percent of them--this is young Americans between the ages of 18 and  24--more than 50 percent of them say they believe Hamas's murder of  civilians was justified. Let me repeat that. More than 50 percent of  young Americans--Gen Z, between the ages of 18 and 24--believe Hamas's  murder of civilians was justified.   These are the same people who are going on TikTok to get their news,  to get their information, to be influenced. And they certainly are  being influenced. Media reports have analyzed the prevalence of anti- Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-Hamas content on TikTok. It is really quite  astounding.   Just take a look at the trending hashtags: ``Stand with Palestine,''  285 million views, impressions, according to the news site Axios and  their recent analysis. By contrast, ``Stand With Israel'' has far, far  less--64 million. This doesn't actually begin to tell the story because  the truth is, there are other hashtags, other pro-Hamas, pro- Palestinian sources of information where the views are even larger.  Take, for instance ``Free Palestine.'' That has received actually 917  million views, far outpacing even ``Stand with Palestine'' and  dramatically outpacing the content that is actually supportive of the  State of Israel.   Here is my point. TikTok has become a haven for anti-Semitic content,  a haven for propaganda for genocide. Of course, TikTok denies this, as  they deny any responsibility for anything they actually do.   They have tried to say, in fact, these numbers are skewed. But you  can't change the facts. You can't deny the reality that their site is  absolutely awash with this content. And we know that part of the  problem, the danger of TikTok, is it gives the Chinese Communist Party  enormous influence--enormous influence--to shape the news, the content  of the information of the folks who look at it.   They have done this before. Back in 2019, the Chinese Communist Party  used TikTok to suppress content that criticized the Chinese Government  over their oppression and enslavement of the Uighurs in that country.  They have a pattern of using this application to try and shape the  narrative in the way they want it shaped. How they are shaping it now  is pumping out the most virulent, toxic pro-Hamas propaganda.   Madam President, the time has come to take another look at TikTok. I  will say this: As virulent and offensive as this content is, that is  not a reason to ban them. The real reason to ban TikTok is that it is a  spy app for the Chinese Communist government. Let's just look at what  we have learned since I was last on this floor trying to pass  legislation that would hold TikTok accountable and ban it from American  phones.    On the 24th of this year, the New York Times reported that driver's  licenses, addresses and photos--just to be clear, Americans' driver's  licenses, addresses, and photos--were accessed by TikTok engineers  based in China. What is extraordinary about this is TikTok has told us  over and over and over again that this was impossible. They have come  to this Congress, they testified before us and said this never happens.  American data is absolutely sequestered. You can't access it in China.  It is completely safe.   Yet we learned this year what, really, we already knew: That simply  is not true. Let's not forget, the law of China--the People's Republic  of China, a dictatorship--their law requires all major corporations,  including, especially, data corporations, to make information available  upon request to the Chinese Communist Party. That means your data. That  means our personal information.   On May 30, Forbes magazine reported that TikTok creators'--that means  American users'--financial information, Social Security numbers were,  in fact, being stored in China. We had also been told this wasn't true.  We have been told by TikTok: No, no, no, Americans' data is always  stored in America. It can't be accessed anywhere but in America. There  is a firewall between America and China.   Not true. Not true.   Americans don't realize that their data is being tracked. They are  just on there to make their videos and put out their content. And what  is happening? The Chinese Government is able to access it. Their  personal information is being stored, not in this country, but in  China, with full availability to the Chinese Communist Party.   On November 1, just a few days ago, Forbes further reported that a  platform storing TikTok corporate secrets was inspected by the Chinese  Government. Of course, it was. Chinese law requires it. It requires  TikTok and its parent company ByteDance to make available all of this  information to the Chinese Government.   We have confronted dangers like this before from China. Huawei is a  prime example. Huawei, another Chinese-based corporation also subject  to the laws of China requiring the sharing of personal information and  data. And what did we do? We stood up a sanctions regime that  sanctioned Huawei and prevented its use here in the United States. And  we went further than that. We actually went to our allies and partners  and said that we would not cooperate with them and offer them security  assistance. We are talking about other countries right now. We would  not cooperate with them or offer security assistance unless they took  Huawei out of their 5G networks.   We should do the same with TikTok. We should protect the people of  this Nation. We should be honest with them about what TikTok actually  does. And we should protect them from the relentless spying and  surveillance by a foreign government.   I want to be clear. I don't like a lot of what American Big Tech  does. I doubt you will find a harsher critic of Big Tech than I am in  this Chamber. But there is a big difference between an American company  looking at Americans' data--accessing Americans' data--and a foreign  government tracking Americans, building dossiers on Americans, and  using it as a back door into the life of every American citizen who has  that app on his or her phone.   It is time to put an end to this. We have already voted to do it. We  voted to strip TikTok off of every government device just 10 months  ago. States are doing it all across the country. It is time we took the  step to protect the American people, to protect the integrity of  Americans' personal information and their personal privacy.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of  [[Page S5420]]  S. 85 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further  ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, let's just be clear about one thing. The  Chinese Communist Government is not covered by the U.S. Bill of Rights.   The Chinese Communist Government does not have free speech rights,  and we are not talking about free speech. We are not talking about  speech at all. The sanctions that I am proposing have nothing to do  with speech; they have everything to do with spying, for the same  reasons that we have banned Huawei in this country.   If the Senator would like to have a debate about whether or not  Huawei and its affiliates ought to be banned, whether it ought to be a  sanctions regime for those that engage in espionage, I welcome it. That  is the same debate we are having here.   I just say this. If all of those teenagers and other creators from  around the world who are putting all of the pro-genocidal Hamas content  onto TikTok want to go do it on other platforms, be my guest. I will be  right here to criticize them and call them out for their moral  atrocities wherever they do it.   But the reason to ban TikTok in this country is that it is a spying  apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party. The facts simply cannot be  disputed. ByteDance is subject to the laws of China, which make  American data available to, accessible to, upon request for Chinese  corporations and the Chinese Government.  [[Page S5421]]    I just lament that we cannot seem to move forward with a step that we  have already taken with regard to Huawei, with sensible protection of  Americans' privacy and their personal data.   But let me just close with this. With regard to the speech itself,  while the content of the speech on TikTok is no reason to ban them, I  just want to say, since we are here in this moment of great dispute,  apparently, in some quarters of this country over whether it is right  or wrong to call for the genocide of Jewish people, I want to say,  clearly, it is wrong. And I want to say to those creators who are  pumping out this content on TikTok: You may have a First Amendment  right to do so, but you don't really have moral standing.   We need to be clear. There is a right. There is a wrong. There is  good. There is evil. And calling for the genocide of Jewish people,  whether it is in the Middle East, the State of Israel, or in this  country is wrong. Whether you do it on TikTok or Meta or YouTube or  just on the streets and plazas of your college campus, it is wrong.   And at this time, above all times, I think, we need to stand and make  that clear.   I yield the floor.
