 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senator Ernst, and Senator Crapo.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Lankford and  the other Senators is for the counsel for the President:         House managers have described any delay in military aid and       State Department funds to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to       believe there was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the       President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were  [[Page S701]]       obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 2018, 67% of the       funds were obligated in September and in 2017, 73% of the       funds were obligated in September. In the State Department,       the funds were obligated September 30 in 2019, but they were       obligated September 28 in 2018. Each year, the vast majority       of the funds were obligated in the final month or days of the       fiscal year. Was there a national security risk to Ukraine or       the United States from the funds going out at the end of       September in the 2 previous years? Did it weaken our       relationship with Ukraine because the vast majority of our       aid was released in September each of the last 3 years?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  that question. And the short, straightforward answer is there was no  jeopardy to the national security interest of the United States from  the timing of the release of this money. As the question indicated, the  vast bulk of the funds in each of the prior 2 fiscal years were also  obligated in September. So the fact that the funds were released here  on September 11 and obligated by the end of the fiscal year was  consistent with the timing in past years.   There was--and it is also the case that at the end of every fiscal  year, there is some funding in this Ukrainian military assistance that  doesn't actually make it out the door. It isn't obligated by the end of  the fiscal year. We heard the House managers point to the fact that  Congress had to put something in the continuing resolution, a special  provision, to get $35 million of the aid extended so it can be used in  the next fiscal year. My understanding is that every fiscal year there  is some amount of money. It is not always that same amount, but there  is some amount of money that that has to be done for every year because  it doesn't get out the door by the end of the year.   Now, it is not just from the raw data that we can see that the funds  went out roughly the same timing toward the end of the year that,  therefore, it doesn't suggest any great risk to Ukraine or risk to the  national security of the United States. We know that from testimony as  well.   Ambassador Volker testified that the brief pause on the aid was not  significant, and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs,  David Hale, explained that this is future assistance, and I mentioned  this the other day. It is not like this money is being spent month by  month to supply current needs in Ukraine. It is 5-year money. Once it  is obligated, it can go to U.S. firms for providing materiel to the  Ukrainians, and it doesn't get spent down finally and materiel shipped  to Ukraine for a long time. So a delay of 48 or 55 days--depending on  how you count it--and the money being released before the end of the  fiscal year ends up having no real effect. It is not current money. It  is supplying immediate needs.    Despite what we have heard about the idea that on the frontlines in  the Donbas, Ukrainian soldiers are being put at risk, that is just not  accurate.   And we know that also from Oleg Shevchuk, the Ukrainian Deputy  Minister of Defense, who gave an interview to the New York Times and  explained that the hold came and went so quickly that he didn't even  notice any change.   And, remember, the Ukrainians didn't even know. President Zelensky  and his advisers--Yermak and others--have made it abundantly clear.  There was another interview just the other day with Danylyuk, who--I  might get his title wrong. I think he was the Foreign Minister at the  time. But there was an interview just the other day that was published.  And he explained, again, that they didn't know the aid had been held up  until the POLITICO article on August 28. And then he said there was a  panic in Kyiv because they were just trying to figure out what to do.  Well, within 2 weeks, it had been released.   And so we have also heard the idea that, well, it was just the fact  of the delay that gave the Russians a signal, and it gave the  Ukrainians a signal, and that was what the damage to the national  security was. But the whole point is, leaders of the Government in  Ukraine didn't know. It wasn't made public. So they weren't being given  a signal by that, and the Russians weren't being given a signal by  that. So that theory for damage to the national security also doesn't  work.   There was a pause temporarily so that there could be some assessment  to address concerns the President had raised. The money was released by  the end of the fiscal year. There was no damage to the national  security either in terms of materiel not being available to the  Ukrainians or in terms of any signal sent to any foreign power. The  money got out the door roughly the same time as in prior years. A  little bit more left over at the end that had to be fixed, but there is  some left over at the end every year that has to be fixed with a rider  on the next appropriations bill or continuing resolution. So no damage  whatsoever to the national security of the United States.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Hawaii.
