 Mr. Speaker, this week the President broke his promise  to America's seniors that he would not cut Medicare or Social Security  benefits.   After Republicans in Congress passed a massive tax giveaway for  corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent, the President now wants to  balance the budget on the backs of our seniors and students.   This budget cuts $2 trillion from Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security over the next 10 years, programs that our seniors have paid  into for decades.   As students face a $1 trillion student loan debt crisis, Trump's  budget pushes affordable college further out of reach by cutting $207  billion from student loan programs.   Thankfully, Americans voted overwhelmingly last election to place a  check on this President by sending a new Democratic majority to  Congress, and they can rest assured knowing that we will not consider  the President's cruel budget cuts in this House.                            ____________________
