 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 6 months ago, the Washington Post  published an extremely disturbing report.   According to the report, a man in his mid-20s was stopped near the  house of a Supreme Court Justice carrying a weapon and burglary tools.  He reportedly told police he intended to murder the Justice.  Reportedly, he indicated he was angry at the decision he thinks the  Court may reach in an upcoming case in light of the unconscionable leak  from a few weeks back.   So this is where we are. This is where we are. If these reports are  correct, it was an assassination attempt against a sitting Justice, or  something close to it.   This is exactly--exactly--the kind of event that many feared that the  terrible breach of the Court's rules and norms could fuel. This is  exactly the kind of event that many worried the unhinged, reckless,  apocalyptic rhetoric from prominent figures toward the Court going back  many months and especially in recent weeks could make more likely.   This is exactly--exactly--why the Senate passed legislation very  shortly after the leak to enhance the police protection for Justices  and their families. This is commonsense, noncontroversial legislation  that passed in this Chamber--in this Chamber--unanimously.   But House Democrats have spent weeks blocking--blocking the measure  that passed here unanimously related to security for Supreme Court  Justices. The House's Democrats have refused to take it up.   Now, look, that needs to change, and it needs to change right now.  Right now. House Democrats must pass this bill and they need to do it  today. No more fiddling around with this. They need to pass it today.  They need to stop their multiweek blockade against the Supreme Court  security bill and pass it before the sun sets today.   I will have more to say on this subject as the facts continue to  unfold.
