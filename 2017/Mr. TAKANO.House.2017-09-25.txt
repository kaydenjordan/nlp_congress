 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3819, which  reauthorizes several essential veterans' programs that support the men  and women who have served our Nation. These programs include assistance  and support services for caregivers who so often make profound  sacrifices to support their loved ones, grants to our vital veterans  service organizations so they can continue providing transportation for  rural veterans to help connect them with the services they need, and  programs to reintegrate homeless veterans which offer opportunities for  meaningful employment and address the complex challenges they face.   This bill reauthorizes specialized counseling for women veterans.  This is particularly important in light of the stunning VA report  released this month which showed that female veterans are six times  more likely to die by suicide than any other women.   These programs are fundamental to the well-being of our veterans and  their families, and they are a reflection of our gratitude to those who  serve.   In addition, this legislation makes important technical changes that  will allow us to follow through on the promises of the new GI Bill,  which we passed unanimously earlier this year. Specifically, H.R. 3819  allows us to correct the perverse incentives that discourage veterans  from attending local community colleges and universities, which is a  provision I worked on with my Republican colleague, Congressman Paul  Cook.   It also allows for the restoration of benefits for veterans left  stranded by the abrupt closure of for-profit colleges, which I  championed with Republican Luke Messer.   After the closures of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, student  veterans in my district and across the country were left with  nontransferable credits, depleted benefits, and none of the job  opportunities that they were promised. By restoring their tuition and  housing benefits, we are restoring a measure of justice for these  veterans and restoring their opportunity to get the education they  deserve and earned.   Taken together, the reauthorization of vital programs and the  technical fixes included in this bill should earn the support of every  Member.   I want to thank Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and my colleagues  on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for ensuring that veterans can  continue to rely on these critical programs, and I am once again  grateful for the bipartisanship that has defined our work on behalf of  America's veterans.   In closing, I want to note that yesterday was Gold Star Mothers and  Families Day, and while today we are taking action to support our  veterans, we must also remember the men and women who never made it  home.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support  this must-pass legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise to remind my colleagues that we  have just 4 days to authorize mandatory funding for our Nation's  Community Health Centers.   If Congress fails to act before September 30, the Community Health  Center program will suffer a 70 percent cut to its funding. Our  constituents and our economy will suffer the consequences.   Without this funding, an estimated 2,800 health center facilities  will be forced to close, 51,000 medical professionals will lose their  jobs, and 9 million patients will lose access to the care they rely on.   The critical role Community Health Centers have in serving patients  is beyond dispute, and it should be beyond partisanship.   While our Senate colleagues are scrambling to meet a self-imposed  deadline, they are ignoring real deadlines that we must meet. We must  fund these health centers this week, or we will be responsible for the  economic and human cost of our inaction.                            ____________________
