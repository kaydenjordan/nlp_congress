 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, May 18, our  Nation celebrates Armed Forces Day.   Recognized the third Saturday in May since President Truman, Armed  Forces Day is a time for us to pay special tribute to the brave men and  women serving in all areas of the military.   It is also a time to educate the public on the impacts that our  servicemembers have on communities across the country.   As the proud father of a soldier, I am endlessly grateful for the  selfless actions of our servicemembers and their devotion to country.   Our servicemen and -women serve throughout the world as a beacon of  light, carrying with them our values of liberty and justice. This  service is often done on foreign lands and away from family and  friends, but their willingness to defeat any threat that seeks to harm  American values and interests never wavers.   Madam Speaker, with this day, we hope to show our appreciation so  those honored are aware of how much we think of them and their  sacrifices.                            ____________________
