 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senators Toomey, Cornyn, Crapo, Ernst, and Moran.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Portman and the other Senators is for the  counsel for the President:         I have been surprised to hear the House managers repeatedly       invoke constitutional law Professor Jonathan Turley to       support their position, including playing a part of a video       of him. Isn't it true that Professor Turley opposed this       impeachment in the House and has also said that abuse of       power is exceedingly difficult to prove alone without an       accompanying criminal allegation, abuse of power has never       been the sole basis for a presidential impeachment and was       not proven in this case?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   And that is exactly correct. Professor Turley was very critical of  the entire process in the House and of the charges that the House-- House Democrats were considering here, both the abuse of power charge  and the obstruction charge. He explained that this was a rushed  process; they did not adequately pursue an investigation; that, as the  Senators point out in the question, abuse of power is an exceedingly  difficult theory to use to impeach a President, and it has never been  used without alleging violations of the law. I think that in the  discussions we have had over the past week and a half, we have pointed  that out multiple times.   Every Presidential impeachment in our history, including even the  Nixon impeachment proceedings, which didn't actually lead to  impeachment, have used charges that include specific violations of the  law and the criminal law.   Andrew Johnson was charged mostly in counts that involved violation  of the Tenure of Office Act, which Congress had specifically made  punishable by fine and imprisonment and even wrote into the statute  that violation would constitute either a high crime or a high  misdemeanor--one of those terms--to make it clear that it was going to  be used to trigger an impeachment.   In the proceedings in the Nixon impeachment inquiry, each of the  Articles of Impeachment there--except for the obstruction of Congress  charge is sort of treated separately on the obstruction theory-- included specific violations of law. There were specific violations  alleged in the second Article of Impeachment, which is often sort of  referred to loosely as the abuse of power article. It wasn't actually  entitled ``abuse of power.'' It didn't charge abuse of power. The  specifications there were violations of the law--violating the  constitutional rights of the citizens, violating the laws governing  executive branch agencies, unlawful electronic surveillance, using the  CIA and others. Specific violations of law.   Clearly, in the Clinton impeachment, President Clinton was impeached  for perjury and obstruction of justice. Those are crimes.   While Professor Turley does not take the view that a crime is  necessarily required, he pointed out here that there was not nearly a  sufficient basis and not nearly a sufficient record compiled in the  House of Representatives to justify an abuse of power charge.   He also was very critical of the obstruction of Congress theory, and  he pointed out that it would be an abuse of power by Congress under  these circumstances where Congress has simply demanded information,  gotten a refusal from the executive branch based on constitutionally  based prerogatives of the executive or refusal to provide that  information, then to simply go straight to impeachment without going  through the accommodations process, without considering contempt,  without going to the courts. That is Professor Turley's view on how  incrementally the House of Representatives would have to proceed if  they were going to try to reach ultimately some theory of obstruction  of Congress.   So to cite Professor Turley, it is true, in his academic writing and  in his testimony, he did not adopt the view that you must have a crime  and only a crime as the charge for an Article of Impeachment. He still  thought that neither of the Articles of Impeachment here could be  justified or sufficient or could be used to impeach the President--both  the abuse of power article and the obstruction article. So taking  snippets out of what he said really does an injustice to the totality  of his testimony, because the totality of his testimony was entirely  against what the House ended up doing.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Ohio.
