 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  scourge of fentanyl and opioids that have made their way into New  York's Hudson Valley, a region I proudly represent.   It is critical that we all work together to find solutions to the  devastating impacts these illegal substances can have.   I am fully committed to doing everything I can to stop the inflow of  fentanyl at our southern border and points of entry and hold the  cartels and those trafficking fentanyl-laced drugs accountable.   I am also dedicated to doing everything I can to assist organizations  that play a critical role in the treatment, recovery, and education of  those in the Hudson Valley struggling with substance use disorders,  which is why I am supporting H.R. 467, the HALT Fentanyl Act.   This bill will categorize fentanyl as a schedule I drug as it has no  currently accepted medical value and a high potential for abuse.  Additionally, this bill establishes a new alternative registration  process for schedule I research.   As someone who has seen firsthand the incredible positive impacts  that recovery can have on families, I am in this fight for the long  haul and know the importance of it.   Mr. Speaker, together, we can make a real impact, and I encourage my  colleagues to pass H.R. 467.                            ____________________
