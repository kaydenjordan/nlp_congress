 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor as we celebrate  today, in Wyoming, the 150th anniversary of Wyoming's women's right to  vote--150 years. Before we even became a State, women were voting in  Wyoming. Today, at our State capital building in Cheyenne, there is a  huge celebration of people from around the  [[Page S6913]]  State and around the country celebrating this historic day.   Many people watching today may not know the history of what happened  150 years ago. Yesterday afternoon, Senator Enzi spoke on the Senate  floor and outlined some of that history. I am so proud of my home  State's amazing record in advancing this entire issue and concern and  allowance of women's voting.   Women in Wyoming were the first in the Nation to use the right to  vote. That is a fact. Wyoming women have been voting for 150 years. On  December 10, 1869, Wyoming took a giant leap forward for women's  equality. We are called the Equality State. This is a lot of the reason  why.   Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, in a ceremony this morning at our State  capital in Cheyenne, is proclaiming today Wyoming Women's Suffrage Day.  Wyoming is the first place in the country to pass a law securing  women's right to vote, as well as the right not just to vote but to  hold public office.   The people of Wyoming spoke loud and clear 150 years ago today. We  stood with women 50 years ahead of the rest of the Nation. Wyoming was  a territory back then. Our State had not yet joined the Union. That  didn't happen until 1890. Still, that is when we earned the proud name  of the Equality State.   Wyoming earned far more than the name. By leading the fight for  women's rights, Wyoming has forever earned a hallowed place in the  books of history. Nobody embodies that legacy more than Wyoming's  Louisa Ann Swain. On September 6, 1870, Louisa Swain of Laramie, WY,  became the first woman in the United States to vote in the general  election. By casting her historic ballot, she claimed a great victory  for women everywhere.   It is a tremendous heritage that we celebrate today. Wyoming truly is  the Nation's trailblazer for women's equality. In fact, ``Equal  Rights'' is our State motto.   On November 19, the Senate unanimously passed the Wyoming Women's  Suffrage Day resolution. Senator Enzi and I cosponsored the resolution  to commemorate today's 150th anniversary. Now the entire Nation can  join in celebrating Wyoming's groundbreaking law.   Then, 20 years after the law's passage, Wyoming refused to enter the  Union as a State unless we had equal voting rights, men and women.  There was a big fight about it in Wyoming and in the Nation's Capital.  When standing on principle became a major sticking point, Wyoming stuck  to its guns on women's equality and actually ended up delaying becoming  a State over this very issue.   On March 26 of 1890, Wyoming statehood legislation narrowly passed  the U.S. House of Representatives. The measure passed the Senate a few  months later, but part of the debate on the floor of the House of  Representatives had to do with Wyoming women actually voting in our  then territory and now State.   President Benjamin Harrison signed Wyoming's statehood into law on  July 10, 1890, upholding women's rights. Wyoming was technically the  44th State to enter the Union, but Wyoming really is the first State  when it comes to women's equality. Wyoming put women first even before  statehood.   Back home, 2019 is the ``Year of Wyoming Women.'' Our State is paying  tribute to our strong women leaders. We had the great honor of electing  the first woman Governor, Wyoming's 14th Governor, Nellie Tayloe Ross.  Wyoming boasts many more female firsts. These include the first woman  to serve on a jury and the first female justice of the peace, Esther  Hobart Morris. Wyoming also claims the first all-female city  government. These pioneering women leaders were elected in 1920 in  Jackson, WY. The Jackson press dubbed them ``the petticoat  government.'' So we celebrate 150 years of equal rights in Wyoming and  100 years for women nationwide.   In 1919, Congress passed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,  granting women's suffrage. This hard-fought legislative victory would  ensure women's full participation in our democracy.   To mark this 100th anniversary, President Trump recently signed into  law the Women's Suffrage Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I had the  privilege of cosponsoring this legislation that was introduced by  Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee. The bill passed unanimously in  the Senate. I made sure that Wyoming's Esther Hobart Morris was among  the suffragettes honored in this legislation.   All Americans owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Nation's  extraordinary women leaders of the past, the present, and today as we  pause to remember where it all started 150 years ago in the  trailblazing State of Wyoming, the Equality State.    Madam President, together with Senator Carper, I rise  today to recognize Carolyn Edwards for her distinguished career and  significant accomplishments at the Federal Highway Administration,  FHWA.   After 46 years of exceptional Federal service, Carolyn is retiring  from FHWA on January 3, 2020. She is a dedicated public servant  recognized as an unparalleled national expert on Federal Highway  Programs and the highway trust fund. Through her technical assistance  to Congress and her policy advice to departmental and agency officials,  Carolyn has provided an invaluable contribution to the programs that  support our Nation's roads and bridges. She has helped to shape not  only these critical highway programs, but also, as colleague and  mentor, she has shaped and guided a generation of highway policy  experts. Her work will have a lasting legacy for many years to come.   Carolyn's entire 46-year Federal career has been with the U.S.  Department of Transportation, USDOT--44 of these with FHWA. To put  Carolyn's remarkable public service longevity in perspective, FHWA was  formed in 1966, only 7 years prior to her arrival. She joined FHWA in  1973 as an economist. Over the ensuing four and a half decades, she has  served in a range of high-level analytical and leadership positions,  including positions in FHWA's Office of Highway Policy Information and  Office of Legislative Affairs and Policy Communications. She also  worked in the Office of the Secretary's Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Budget and Programs with a portfolio that covered FHWA  programs.   Carolyn is currently a member of FHWA's Legislative Analysis Team,  where she serves as the authoritative expert on a wide range of  highway-related topics, including Federal highway legislation, the  highway trust fund, and the operations of the Federal-aid highway  program. Throughout her successful and impressive career, she has been  a ``go-to reference'' on these topics for both agency and departmental  leaders and staff.   Among her many exemplary accomplishments, Carolyn has been in the  development and implementation of every Federal surface transportation  bill since the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--TEA-21-- was enacted in 1998. Additionally, she has also been a recipient of  several prestigious honors and awards. Carolyn has been recognized with  a Secretary's Team Award, two Secretarial Awards for Partnering for  Excellence, and multiple FHWA Superior Achievement Awards, FHWA's  highest honor award.   Carolyn exemplifies the highest standards of public service and  embodies FHWA's spirit of professionalism and customer service. Over  the years, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, along  with other congressional committees, Members of Congress, and their  staff have relied on Carolyn's legislative and highway policy  expertise, quick turnaround technical assistance responses, and wealth  of information. Carolyn's colleagues at USDOT and FHWA have depended on  her tireless efforts, her endless wealth of knowledge and willingness  to share and transfer it. They will miss her indomitable spirit and her  purple sweaters, purple pens, and love for everything purple to  brighten their days.   Carolyn has helped shape highway policy discussions and implement new  programs. Her contributions will continue to make a difference on  USDOT, FHWA, and the surface transportation community. Her retirement  from the Federal Government is a celebration of her dedication to the  American people.   It is a great honor to recognize this exceptional public servant.  Senator Carper joins me in extending our appreciation and well wishes  to Carolyn on her retirement.                            ____________________
