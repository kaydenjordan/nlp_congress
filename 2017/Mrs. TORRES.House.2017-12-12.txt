 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 336,  which reaffirms our strong commitment to the United States-Mexico  partnership.   Mexico is our neighbor and one of our most important strategic  allies. Under NAFTA and the Merida Initiative, our countries have  expanded our economic and security cooperation in ways that involve  almost every aspect of our lives. Our work with Mexico goes beyond the  Federal Government. It is in our State and local governments. It is in  our businesses and in our churches.   H. Res. 336 holds up the idea that working with Mexico has been good  for our security and our economy. No one is saying that our  relationship is perfect. We still have real security problems to  address, especially the smuggling of guns, drugs, and money across our  borders, and we need to do more--a lot more--to lift up those  communities that have not benefited from NAFTA; but, on the whole, we  are better off when we work together.    Working together is what makes it possible to have those tough  conversations about those issues where we disagree, so we shouldn't  even need to pass a resolution like this. It should be assumed. It  should be common sense. But the rhetoric across this administration has  made it necessary for Congress to speak out in defense of our neighbor  and our ally, and we are here today speaking out.   I thank Representative Engel and Representative McCaul for their  leadership, and I thank Chairman Royce for his ongoing work in bringing  this resolution forward and ongoing work in the committee to ensure  that we work on a bipartisan level.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
