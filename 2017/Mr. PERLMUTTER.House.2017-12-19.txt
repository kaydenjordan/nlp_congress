 Mr. Speaker, recently there has been a real flurry by  the Republicans here in Congress to disparage and call names to the FBI  and to the Justice Department, but it is right after Michael Flynn pled  guilty, right after George Papadopoulos pled guilty in the  investigation into Russia and potential collusion with the  administration.   Now my question is: What are you afraid of? Why are you getting in  such a big rush to complain about these folks now? What are you hiding?  What is it that is bothering you? Let the detectives do their work to  figure out what happened between Russia and this administration.   I mean, it is like we have been asking for the President's tax  returns for ages. What is he hiding? We won't even know how much money  he gets to save under this terrible tax bill that was passed today by  the Republican Congress.   So I just want to know: Why are you so worried? What are you afraid  of? What are you hiding?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Garamendi, for  allowing me the opportunity to speak about this.   You have FDR on the poster. He also said December 7 was a day that  would live in infamy. This is a day that will live in infamy because of  the tax bill that was passed today.   I don't like to speak in this hyperbolic way, but what was passed by  the Republican House, and soon by the Republican Senate, is something  none of us has ever seen before.   Let's just do some easy math so that people understand how  unbelievable the numbers are on this.   Let's take Speaker Ryan's numbers. He said an average family of four  making some $60,000 are going to save about $1,183. Okay. Of the four,  that is about $275 per person. That is nice. I like it.   What he doesn't tell you, and what the Republicans refuse to talk  about, is how much money is put on the credit card of the Nation for  the current generation and future generations to have to pay. At best,  it is $1.5 trillion.   That is a number that none of us can really understand how big it is.  But let's say there are 300 million Americans. Divide 300 million into  $1.5 trillion and that is $5,000. Let's do the math. You get to save  $270, but you put $5,000 on the credit card.   Wait a second. That doesn't sound quite right. Where does that $4,730  go?   Well, it goes straight up to the wealthiest among us.   So all of us, as a country, as a nation, and as a people, have the  obligation to pay this back.   And who gets it?   Just a very slim few. We get $270, but we have $5,000 on a credit  card.   Mr. DeFazio talked about some of the opportunity costs that are lost  from this $1.5 trillion. If the $1.5 trillion were out there to benefit  all of us and just put in infrastructure, we would basically fix every  road, every water work, every electric grid issue that we have; we  would put broadband across the country, and all of us would benefit and  make this country competitive for the next 50 years.   Instead, we say: We don't need that money. Let's just give it back to  the wealthiest people in America.  [[Page H10236]]    Wrong. Terrible.   I serve on the Science Committee. We did some numbers in the Science  Committee.   The entire budget for solar energy for our laboratories, in any given  year, is about $207 million. We were having this testimony and the  Republicans were picking on the managers of the solar budget line and  said: You have really got to shrink this. This is costing too much  money.   Well, do you know how many times 207 million goes into $1.5 trillion?  Do you know how many years worth of budgets that is?   It is 7,480 years worth of solar energy budgets.   I have really been working on getting our astronauts to Mars. We have  been advised that that is going to cost about $200 billion over the  course of the next 16 years, to 2033, which is when the orbits of Mars  and the Earth come close together and saves us a lot of space time,  travel time, and is safer for our astronauts.   We could send our astronauts to Mars and back and start from scratch  eight times for this tax cut that is going to be received by the rich.    It is not right. It is not American. It is the opposite of what FDR  said when he said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add  more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide  enough for those who have too little.''   There has been some talk about how real estate developers and others  are really going to benefit by this tax cut that nobody has seen until  the last day or two. This is a giant piece of legislation.   One of the things the Democrats have asked for for a year now is that  we want to see the President's tax returns. He has refused to disclose  his tax returns. So we know he was a real estate developer, we know he  is a very wealthy guy, and we know he is going to benefit in a large  way--or, he might say in a huge way--by this tax cut. But we don't know  how much it is going to be because he will never disclose his tax  returns.   The ink is just barely dry as to how this is all going to work out.  What has transpired today is really a shame. I really am disappointed  in my Republican colleagues in how this matter has been rushed through.
