 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of our  colleague, Congressman John Lewis.   Growing up and learning about Mr. Lewis' contributions to our  country, I never thought I would one day have the honor of serving  alongside him in Congress or the honor of calling him my friend.   I will always remember the time I think several of us had the  opportunity to watch the movie ``Selma'' with him. It was amazing to  watch everything I had learned about in history class with someone who  had experienced it. After the movie, as we were all kind of feeling  empty in our stomachs and just the feeling from seeing the movie, I  walked up to Mr. Lewis, and I asked him: What is it like to have your  life portrayed upon the screen such as that?   If you remember, the actor resembled him when he was younger. Mr.  Lewis looked at me and he said: All I was thinking is that I had a lot  of hair back then.   That was Mr. Lewis for you, a giant in our history, but unfailingly  humble and kind. I am grateful I had the opportunity to know him, and I  will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
