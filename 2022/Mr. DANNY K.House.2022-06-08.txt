 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 7910, Protecting Our Kids Act.  [[Page H5387]]    You know, I am so tired of hearing about Chicago and other big  cities. Local governments do what they can, do what they will. But this  is not a local issue. This is a national issue. It is a national  problem and it requires a national solution.   And so I urge all of my colleagues, no matter where you are from,  make sure that you vote to protect our kids. And the only way to do  that is get rid of these assault weapons and seriously reduce the  number of guns in our society.
