 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  work of agents with the Savannah Police Department.   In 2016, gangs that were regularly trafficking drugs and guns in the  Cann Park neighborhood just south of Savannah's downtown were  identified by the Savannah Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives as part of a 6-month undercover  investigation.   In this joint operation, local law enforcement arrested 24 gang  members, confiscating their drugs and firearms. Since the police  apprehended these individuals, crime has sharply decreased in Cann  Park--a 40 percent drop in violent crimes and a 75 percent drop in  aggravated assaults with guns.   Members of the operation team, ATF's Special Agent Lee Hoover, SPD's  Sergeant Samuel Hunt, III, and Detective Michael Dobson, have been  invited to Washington, D.C., to receive the TOP COPS award. This award  pays tribute to the bravery that our law enforcement officers exhibit  every day risking their lives to improve the quality of life for our  citizens.   I am glad to see these officers getting the recognition that they so  richly deserve.                            ____________________
