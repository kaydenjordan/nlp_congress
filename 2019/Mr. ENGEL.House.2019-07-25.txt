SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF DEPARTMENT OF                     STATE'S WORK.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) United States global engagement is key to a stable and       prosperous world;        (2) United States leadership is indispensable in light of       the many complex and interconnected threats facing the United       States and the world;        (3) diplomacy and development are critical tools of       national power, and full deployment of these tools is vital       to United States national security;        (4) challenges such as the global refugee and migration       crises, terrorism, historic famine and food insecurity, and       fragile or repressive societies cannot be addressed without       sustained and robust United States diplomatic and development       leadership;        (5) the United States Government must use all of the       instruments of national security and foreign policy at its       disposal to protect United States citizens, promote United       States interests and values, and support global stability and       prosperity;        (6) United States security and prosperity depend on having       partners and allies that share our interests and values, and       these partnerships are nurtured and our shared interests and       values are promoted through United States diplomatic       engagement, security cooperation, economic statecraft, and       assistance that helps further economic development, good       governance, including the rule of law and democratic       institutions, and the development of shared responses to       natural and humanitarian disasters;        (7) as the United States Government agencies primarily       charged with conducting diplomacy and development, the       Department and the United States Agency for International       Development (USAID) require sustained and robust funding to       carry out this important work, which is essential to our       ability to project United States leadership and values and to       advance the United States interests around the world;        (8) the work of the Department and USAID makes the United       States and the world safer and more prosperous by alleviating       global poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other       infectious diseases, strengthening alliances, expanding       educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting good       governance and democracy, supporting anti-corruption efforts,       driving economic development and trade, preventing armed       conflicts and humanitarian crises, and creating American jobs       and export opportunities;        (9) the Department and USAID are vital national security       agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United       States power and leadership worldwide, and without which       Americans would be less safe, our economic power would be       diminished, and global stability and prosperity would suffer;        (10) investing in diplomacy and development before       conflicts break out saves American lives while also being       cost-effective; and        (11) the contributions of personnel working at the       Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow       the United States to maintain its leadership around the       world.

STANDARD DESIGN IN CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department's Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO)       or successor office should give appropriate consideration to       standardization in construction, in which each new United       States embassy and consulate starts with a standard design       and keeps customization to a minimum.        (b) Consultation.--The Secretary shall carry out any new       United States embassy compound or new consulate compound       project that utilizes a non-standard design, including those       projects that are in the design or pre-design phase as of the       date of the enactment of this Act, only in consultation with       the appropriate congressional committees. The Secretary shall       provide the appropriate congressional committees, for each       such project, the following documentation:        (1) A comparison of the estimated full lifecycle costs of       the project to the estimated full lifecycle costs of such       project if it were to use a standard design.        (2) A comparison of the estimated completion date of such       project to the estimated completion date of such project if       it were to use a standard design.        (3) A comparison of the security of the completed project       to the security of such completed project if it were to use a       standard design.        (4) A justification for the Secretary's selection of a non-      standard design over a standard design for such project.        (5) A written explanation if any of the documentation       necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as       the case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4)       cannot be provided.        (c) Sunset.--The consultation requirement under subsection       (b) shall expire on the date that is four years after the       date of the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 203.

TITLE X--BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 1001. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3352.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me first of all thank our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Mr. McCaul of Texas, for working with me closely to bring  this bipartisan piece of legislation forward.   Mr. Speaker, one of our top priorities on the Foreign Affairs  Committee is making sure that diplomacy is a pillar of American foreign  policy. Diplomacy is the tool, Mr. Speaker, that we use around the  world to defuse crises, to prevent conflicts, and to help build peace,  stability, and prosperity. We use diplomacy, along with development, to  strengthen friendships and to bridge divides.   We invest in these efforts because they help us project our values  around the world, support democracy, human rights, and our country's  spirit of compassion and generosity. We invest in diplomacy and  development because they enhance our security.   Countries in regions that are more stable and governments that are  more transparent and accountable mean that we have better partners on  the world stage; they mean fewer places where conflict may erupt or  extremism may take root.   The violence we can forestall through diplomacy means one less place  where we may need to put American servicemembers in harm's way. So you  would think, Mr. Speaker, with all the tremendous dividends we see from  diplomacy and development, that the Congress would make sure that our  agencies and our personnel responsible for this work always have the  support and resources they need and that we are working constantly to  provide the tools needed to meet 21st century global challenges. That  is why it is so amazing, Mr. Speaker, that the last time a State  Department authorization was signed into law was the year 2002.   Just think of all the issues we are grappling with around the world  that we could not have envisioned 17 years ago. We are asking the State  Department to counter terrorist propaganda on social media. But the  last time Congress gave the State Department its legislative due was 2  years before Facebook was invented, right around the time the first  smartphones were coming on the market.   Let me be clear. Our diplomats have done a great job dealing with the  challenges America faces, and our inability to get a State Department  authorization signed into law is not for lack of trying. The Foreign  Affairs Committee and the House have passed a number of bills that just  did not make it across the finish line.   With the bill we are considering today, I hope we are starting a new  trend. It contains a wealth of good provisions. I view it as an  important start in breathing new life into the comprehensive, regular  authorizing work Congress should do to support America's diplomacy and  development efforts.   It will help the Department recruit and retain a diverse workforce so  that our diplomats--our face to the world--look like the country they  are representing.   It will enhance our Embassy and information security to keep these  dedicated public servants safe. It authorizes absolutely essential  investments in Embassy security, construction, and maintenance.   It will help to streamline the Department's management structure,  strip out duplication, and cut away the deadwood from outdated reports.  This will make sure the agency is flexible and nimble in a rapidly  changing world.   It will focus on smart planning and rigorous evaluation so we know we  are being effective in our diplomatic efforts.   Beyond what is in the bill, Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud of  what this bill stands for. I have tremendous respect for our colleagues  on the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence. I salute their work in regularly passing authorizing  legislation for the agencies they oversee.   If we are serious about diplomacy and development as critical parts  of our foreign policy and essential to our national security, then  there is absolutely no reason that a State Department authorization  bill should not be part of Congress' regular work.                                time  1545    Our committee has shown again and again that we can work together in  a bipartisan way to advance our country's security. We pass a lot of  legislation, often small fixes around the edges to get at a particular  challenge.   With an authorization bill, we are sending a stronger message to our  diplomats: As you carry out your critical and often dangerous work, we  are going to have your backs.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are advancing this bill today, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul)  for his kind words and his hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger), a valued member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  purposes of closing.   Mr. Speaker, once again, let me thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), my friend and partner, for his partnership.   This legislation really does represent the product of close  bipartisan work on this committee since the start of this Congress. So  I wish to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and other members  of the committee, both Democrats and Republicans.   And, again, I hope with this bill's passage today, the House is  turning over a new leaf. Mr. Speaker, I am committed to making sure  authorizing legislation for the State Department is something we do  regularly and is something that this body considers as a must pass.   I am proud of our work on this bill. I want to thank my staff. I want  to thank the staff on the minority side, as well. I am very proud of  all of us working together as a team.   I urge all Members to support this, and, again, I thank the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. McCaul).   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600
