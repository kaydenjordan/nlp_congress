 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the majority  leader, Mr. McCarthy, for his leadership in shepherding the largest  spending-cut package through the House on behalf of President Trump.                                time  1445    This is a remarkable package.   Getting back to the topic at hand, this is about taking back money,  or rescinding money, that will not be spent, $15 billion of unnecessary  spending. This is an important step to getting our fiscal house in  order.   Now, I note that every dollar in this package either can't or won't  be spent at all. Regardless of what you might hear from the other side  of the aisle, this is money that just will not be spent for the  purposes for which it was originally budgeted.   Now, when I think about where we are today and I think about this  package and I hear the arguments that just preceded mine, I don't  understand why they wouldn't support saving some additional money and  putting a downpayment here on our deficit.   For example, this bill cuts $4.3 billion from the Advanced Technology  Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which has only made five loans-- that is five--since 2007 and has been untouched since 2011. That is 7  years ago. It is a dormant fund with $4 billion in it, but the other  side rejects taking that back and using it elsewhere.   This is just good government; rescinding these funds is good  government. And it is a signal to the American people that President  Trump and congressional Republicans are serious about getting our house  in order and protecting our kids and our grandkids from this  unsustainable and out-of-control national debt.   To that point, another step we are taking with the President's  example in leadership here today is a fund we have created in the  Financial Services bill, in which I chair. It is a fund for America's  kids and grandkids, and we are putting additional savings in it. We  have put $585 million into this fund. It is a 2\1/2\ percent cut from  our spending level.   We are sending a signal to the American people that just because we  can spend it doesn't mean we have to spend it. So, today, here, with  this $15 billion and what we are doing here in the next couple of  weeks, I look forward to getting my bill across as well and continuing  on the progress we have here today.
