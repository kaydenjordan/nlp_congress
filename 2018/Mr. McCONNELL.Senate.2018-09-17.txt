 Mr. President, since the Senate last convened,  Hurricane Florence made landfall on our Nation's eastern seaboard.  According to the latest estimates, this terrible storm has already  claimed more than 20 lives in North Carolina, South Carolina, and  Florida. With more than 1 million Americans subjected to mandatory  evacuations, many families have been displaced, and the storm surge and  historic rainfall have brought communities to their knees with  crippling flooding.   The Senate stands with all of those affected, and we stand ready to  ensure that communities in the storm's path have the resources they  need to recover and rebuild, once the time comes. For now, we stand in  solidarity with the Americans who are battling this storm and with  first responders, who bravely risk their own safety to care for their  communities.                    Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act    Mr. President, on another matter, today, the Senate will take two  important actions to help vulnerable Americans. First, we will pass the  Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, spearheaded by Senator Collins.   This legislation would ban so-called pharmacy gag clauses, which  prohibit pharmacists from sharing drug pricing information that would  save consumers money. In circumstances when the out-of-pocket retail  cost of a medication is actually cheaper than the price through  insurance, it will allow customers with access to the information they  need to choose the more affordable route.   After that, we will vote on major, landmark legislation to address  the  [[Page S6165]]  opioid crisis that continues to weigh on our country. My fellow  Kentuckians and I are all too aware of how drug abuse and addiction  attack families and communities. Overdoses killed 1,500 Kentuckians  last year alone. That is more than four fatalities per day. Nationwide,  it is more than 115 fatalities per day.   The effects of this emergency compound themselves. The crisis can eat  away at family ties, at community institutions, at economic  opportunities--precisely the things that are necessary to lift  Americans out of addiction and into recovery.   On the one hand, research suggests that opioid use rose the most in  the very communities where employment fell the most. On the other hand,  experts blame opioids themselves for a major share of falling workforce  participation, to the tune of roughly 1 million missing workers.   A comprehensive crisis demands a comprehensive solution. That is  exactly what this landmark legislation is. It combines work from 5  committees and input from 70 Senators.   First, this legislation will help cut off the opioid crisis at its  roots. It will stop more drugs at the border, improve interstate  monitoring, and encourage reform of prescription dosing. It will  encourage recovery through more resources for State and local  responders, better access to care for patients, and more support for  the families and caregivers of those affected. This legislation looks  to the future by surrounding long-term medical research and economic  solutions to get our county past this vicious cycle.   I am pleased that two of my provisions are included--the CAREER Act,  which expands grants and targets funding for transitional housing and  job opportunities to help recovering individuals find their footing and  stay sober, and my Protecting Moms and Infants Act, which will refine  our Federal efforts to combat the effects of opioids on expecting  mothers and their unborn children.   The situation facing Americans and communities is urgent. With this  landmark legislation, the Senate has risen to the moment. It is no  wonder that experts and advocates representing 200 organizations on the  frontlines of the opioid crisis have publicly called on the Senate to  act. That is exactly what we will do when we pass this landmark  legislation later today.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, on a final matter, it has been 70 days since the  President nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the current vacancy  on the Supreme Court. For more than 2 months, the Senate has pored over  Judge Kavanaugh's professional record.   We have reviewed the 300-plus opinions he has authored while serving  on the DC Circuit, more pages of documents than have ever been produced  for a Supreme Court nomination--more than for the past five nominations  combined--and testimony from prominent legal scholars and top  litigators who have praised the nominee's intellect and his exemplary  performance on the Federal bench.   We have also considered a wealth of evidence that pertains to Judge  Kavanaugh's character and his personal integrity. We have heard  testimony or received open letters from literally hundreds of men and  women who know Brett Kavanaugh, who have worked alongside him, who have  clerked for him as a judge, or who have known him and his family  personally over the years. This is what the Senate has considered for  the past 70 days. In the Senate and around the country, almost everyone  who went into this process with an open mind and who was prepared to  give Judge Kavanaugh a fair hearing has come away impressed.   But now an accusation of 36-year-old misconduct, dating back to high  school, has been brought forward at the last minute, in an irregular  manner. It is an accusation that Judge Kavanaugh has completely and  unequivocally denied. This is what he said:         This is a completely false allegation. I have never done       anything like what the accuser describes--to her or to       anyone.    It is an accusation that the ranking member on the committee of  jurisdiction has known about for at least 6 weeks--known about for 6  weeks--yet chose to keep secret until the 11th hour. Neither she nor  any of her Democratic colleagues chose to raise this allegation during  the committee staff's bipartisan background calls with the nominee.   They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in the 65  meetings--65 meetings--that Judge Kavanaugh held with Senators before  his confirmation hearings, including his private meeting with the  ranking member. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in  4 days of exhaustive public hearings while Judge Kavanaugh testified  under oath, even though they chose to raise myriad other matters at the  hearing, including sometimes bizarre innuendo. They did not raise it in  the closed session, the proper forum where such an allegation could  have been addressed with discretion and sensitivity. They did not raise  it in the thousand-plus followup questions Senators sent to Judge  Kavanaugh in writing.   At the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after  Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason  the nomination should be delayed, now they choose to introduce this  allegation--not through the standard bipartisan process, not by  advising the Judiciary Committee colleagues and committee staff through  proper channels but by leaking it to the press, because the chain of  custody of this letter runs through the Democratic side of the  Judiciary Committee. That is the chain of custody.   I can't explain the situation any better than the senior Senator from  Maine put it yesterday evening when she said this:         If they believed [Judge Kavanaugh's accuser], why didn't       they surface this information earlier so that he could be       questioned about it? And if they didn't believe her and chose       to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th       hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them       the way it was handled.    As the senior Senator from Texas said earlier today, ``that Democrats  have so egregiously mishandled this up until now, is no excuse for us  to do the same.'' Just because the Democrats have egregiously  mishandled this, said Senator Cornyn, is no excuse for us to do the  same thing.   I am glad that Chairman Grassley is following standard practice and  regular order. As he has stated, he plans to pursue this matter by the  book, with bipartisan interviews of both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.  I have great confidence in Chairman Grassley and his ability to proceed  through this process.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 6157.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  the conference report.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 630, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume  consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 6157; finally,  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order following the remarks of Senator Murray and Senator  Rounds.
