 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my strong  support of this amendment to end the proliferation of private prisons  in our Federal justice system.   Following this administration's reversing President Obama's ban on  the use of private prisons for Federal prisoners, the for-profit prison  industry has not only been rejuvenated, but it is expanding.   Our criminal justice system's only purpose should be to reeducate and  rehabilitate individuals who have made mistakes and are serving their  sentence. No one should profit from our prison system.   That is what I plan to reintroduce the End For-Profit Prisons Act-- legislation that will require the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals  Service to end its contracts with for-profit confinement facilities and  make critical changes to the reentry process for individuals who have  been released from Federal prisons.   Mr. Chairman, I call for the immediate passage of this amendment.
