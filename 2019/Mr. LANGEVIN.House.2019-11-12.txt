 Mr. Speaker, in schools across my home State of Rhode  Island and across the country, career counselors provide students with  the guidance they need to navigate their academic and career pathways.  It is therefore critical that these counselors have up-to-date  information about all the options available to their students,  including career and technical education, or CTE.  [[Page H8776]]    When counselors ensure students are aware of high-quality CTE  programs and local workforce trends, they can make informed choices  about their futures, whether that means pursuing a bachelor's degree or  an apprenticeship. That is why, during National Career Development  Week, I am proud to introduce the Counseling for Career Choice Act with  my good friend and CTE Caucus co-chair, ``GT'' Thompson.   Our bipartisan bill would encourage States to develop career  counseling frameworks with the input of educators, businesses, and  other community leaders to provide counselors with the resources and  training to best support their students. That will ultimately help lead  to them reaching their career goals in life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor our legislation.                            ____________________
