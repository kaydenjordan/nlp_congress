 Madam President, ever since Democrats passed the  Affordable Care Act, expanding health coverage and access to tens of  millions of Americans, we have had to fight tooth and nail to preserve  the law from partisan Republican attacks.   For more than a decade, the assault on our healthcare law was  relentless from Republicans in Congress, from the executive branch  itself and from Republican attorneys general in the courts. In a  landmark vote, we in the Senate prevented the Republicans from  repealing the ACA in 2017.   Each time, in each arena, the Affordable Care Act has prevailed, and  once again today, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-to-2 ruling, upheld  the Affordable Care Act in the face of another legal challenge. So let  me say definitively: The Affordable Care Act has won. The Supreme Court  has just ruled. The ACA is here to stay.   And now we are going to try to make it bigger and better--establish  once and for all affordable healthcare as a basic right of every  American citizen.   What a day.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another issue, infrastructure,  despite a consensus in Washington that America needs more investment in  our infrastructure, it has been decades since Congress passed a stand- alone bill to address the issue. This Congress is working hard to  remedy that fact.   As I have repeated, discussions about infrastructure are moving  forward along two tracks. One is bipartisan, and the second deals with  components of the American jobs and families plan, which we will  consider even if it lacks bipartisan support--though, I would note that  a recent poll showed that President Biden's infrastructure and family  plan is broadly popular. Nearly 70 percent of Americans support  President Biden's infrastructure plan. More than 60 percent support  additional support for American families.   Now, despite some overdramatized punditry, the truth is both tracks  are moving forward very well, and both tracks need each other. So we  want to work with our Republican colleagues on infrastructure where we  have common ground, and Democrats believe we have other priorities that  the Senate must consider above and beyond a bipartisan infrastructure  bill, not the least of which is addressing the urgent challenge of  climate change.   Yesterday, I convened all 11 Members of the Senate Budget Committee  to discuss the reconciliation track. And today, I will convene the  group of Democrats negotiating with Republicans to discuss the  bipartisan track. We set up the two tracks about a month ago. Each is  proceeding along, and the two tracks are parallel, working in concert,  progressing well.                            ____________________     Madam President, on voting rights, now we are here on  the precipice of a momentous debate here in the Senate. Last night, I  began the  [[Page S4600]]  process to consider voting rights legislation here on the floor of the  Senate next week. The process I used will allow the Senate to consider  S. 1 or compromise legislation that is currently being discussed. In  either case, our goal remains crystal clear: protect the right to vote,  strengthen our democracy, and put a stop to the tide of voter  suppression flooding across our country. We will not consider  legislation that does not achieve those objectives. The issue is too  important.   Republican State legislatures are conducting the most sweeping attack  on the right to vote since the beginning of Jim Crow. What is their  stated reason for vicious assaults on voting rights? They say it is  election integrity   But listen to these policies and tell me if you think they are about  election integrity:   Reducing polling hours and polling places. What does that have to do  with election integrity?   Mandating that every precinct, no matter how large or how small, have  the same number of ballot drop boxes. What does that have to do with  election integrity?   It is saying urban areas should have less ability to vote than rural  areas.   No after-hours voting, no 24-hours voting, no drive-through voting.   Requiring absentee ballots to be approved by a notary public.   Making it a crime to give food and water to voters waiting in long  lines at the polls.   Allowing a judge or panel of judges to overturn an election.   Allowing a partisan State election board to replace a duly elected  county election board if they are ``underperforming.''   Removing student IDs from the list of valid forms of ID.   Moving the hours of Sunday voting into the evening--which,  coincidentally, makes it harder for Black churches to sponsor voter  drives after services.   Are any of these policies--I would ask a single Republican on this  Senate floor to get up and say any of these policies are dealing with  election integrity.   We know what they are doing. They are making it harder for people to  vote. And if this so-called voter fraud--election fraud--which we have  seen none of in 2020, if they cared about that across the board, why  did they aim almost all of their proposals at people of color, at poor  people, at young people, at urban people?   We know why. This is not about voter fraud. It is about suppressing  the vote, particularly of Democratic-leaning voters. It is despicable.  It is anti-democratic. It is what they do in dictatorships--manipulate  the vote, instead of counting it accurately.   Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Florida, Alabama, Utah, Arizona, Nebraska,  Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas--this is where some of these  policies that I just mentioned are now law. They would also be in  effect in Texas had Democratic lawmakers not walked out of the chamber  in protest. Since the beginning of the year, 14 States have enacted 22  laws--22 laws--to make it harder to vote.   Now, I know what the Republicans are saying. They are saying: Oh,  well, we are making it easier to vote but harder to cheat.   But when you look at what they are actually doing, it is perfectly  clear that Republicans across the country are making it harder to vote  and making it easier to steal an election. They are targeting all the  ways that poorer, younger, non-White and typically Democratic voters  access the ballot, and they are giving new tools to partisan election  boards and unelected judges to interfere with the results of a  democratic election--interfere with the results of a democratic  election. Does that sound like a democracy? No, it sounds like an  autocracy, a dictatorship.   When you lose an election, you are supposed try to win over more  voters, not try to stop the other side from voting. These laws are un- American, autocratic, and against the very, very grain of our grand  democracy, which, for immediate partisan advantage, our Republican  friends are trying to undermine.   So the Senate is going to debate what to do about these laws at the  Federal level next week. In an ideal world, this debate would be  bipartisan. Voting rights shouldn't be a Democratic issue or a  Republican issue, and in the early days of the second-half of the last  century, that is just what it was--bipartisan. But, unfortunately, now  it has become totally partisan.   Donald Trump and his Big Lie have enveloped the Republican Party, and  they run away from truth and honesty and fairness to just appease  someone with authoritarian instincts, Donald J. Trump.   And for all the shame that Republican State legislators have brought  upon themselves, Washington Republicans have not covered themselves in  glory either. Here in Washington, Republicans have failed to forcefully  and repeatedly stand up to the Big Lie that the last election was  stolen from Donald Trump. That same Big Lie is fueling these voter  suppression laws from one end of the country to the other. House  Republicans are comparing January 6 to a tourist visit.   I was within 20 feet of these awful insurrectionists. They were not  tourists. They were brandishing sticks and guns and this and that.   House Republicans also fired Congresswoman Cheney. For what? Telling  the truth that Joe Biden is President.   Just yesterday, 21 House Republicans voted against awarding the  Congressional Gold Medal to the police officers who withstood the  attack on the 6th. Are Republicans becoming antipolice? Some of the  same Republicans who falsely accuse Democrats of wanting to defund the  police are actively refusing to defend the police.   I wish I could say the Senate was totally different than the House-- the Republican House--but here we have a Senate Republican saying that  it really wasn't a violent insurrection. We have Senate Republicans  refusing to include any mention of the causes for January 6 in  committee reports, and the Republican minority mounted a partisan  filibuster against an independent, bipartisan Commission.   That is what is happening in the present-day Republican Party: a  hornet's nest of conspiracy theories and voter suppression in the  States and a Washington Republican establishment that is too afraid of  Donald Trump to stand up for our democracy with conviction.   So look, we Democrats wish the voting bill would be bipartisan. By  all rights, it should be. But the actions in State legislatures like  Georgia, Iowa, and Florida were totally partisan. None of these voter  suppression laws were passed with bipartisan support--not  one. Washington Republicans seem dead set against all remedies, whether  it is S. 1, some modified version, or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,  which Senator McConnell has recently opposed. So the idea that we can  have some kind of bipartisan solution to this partisan attack on  democracy befuddles me. Regrettably, the Democratic Party is the only  party standing up for democracy right now.    Next week, the Senate will have this debate. Democrats will bring  forward legislation to protect voting rights and safeguard our  democracy, and we are going to see where everyone stands--everyone.   I yield the floor.
