 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  and the underlying bill.   No one--and I mean no one--should be forced to stay in an abusive  relationship because they fear deportation. Under current law, if a  woman travels to the United States of America with someone on a  temporary visa and that relationship turns abusive, they are trapped.   My amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act would  create a pilot program for victims of domestic abuse to apply for  independent immigration status. It is that simple, and it is that  important.
