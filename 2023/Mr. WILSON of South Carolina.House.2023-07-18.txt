 Mr. Speaker, the irresponsible Biden  open border crisis has turned every State into a border State, and  every house is at risk of intrusion.   The failure to lawfully secure the border by Biden and liberal  Democrats encourages surges in illegal alien crossings, exposing  families to terrorists, human trafficking, and dangerous drugs.   The incredibly successful movie ``Sound of Freedom'' is exposing  human trafficking of children in America.   Since Biden took office, over 5.2 million illegal aliens have crossed  the southern border, and 1.5 million aliens have evaded apprehension.   As an overflow factor, illegal aliens are now being housed in  schools. Schools should be focused on helping students recover from  devastating COVID-era learning loss.   House Republicans are committed to securing the border and to  providing for rule of law. One effort is the Schools Not Shelters Act,  which prohibits the use of schools to provide shelter for illegal  aliens.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders  admitting terrorists.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of  the House of July 13, 2023, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res.  74) relating to a national emergency declared by the President on May  16, 2012, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution. This Yemen  national emergency is the basis for sanctions against Iran-backed  Houthi leaders, who have spent the past decade waging a deadly,  murderous, and destructive civil war in Yemen.   The extremists sanctioned under this emergency have destabilized the  Middle East and threaten the security of tens of thousands of Americans  who reside or work in or near Yemen, throughout the Persian Gulf, and  our great ally Saudi Arabia. If we overturn this national emergency,  those sanctions will automatically and immediately disappear.  [[Page H3665]]    The Iranian-backed Houthis sanctioned under this emergency proudly  chant the slogan, ``Death to America. Death to Israel.'' They recruit  and indoctrinate thousands of Yemeni youths into their extremist  ideology through schools and summer camps, all while committing  murderous human rights abuses every day.   The Houthis are a key part of Iran's strategy to undermine the  stability of the United States and its partners. Thanks to years of  support from Iran, the Houthis now have advanced indigenous lethal  weapons capabilities while continuing to receive shipments of weapons  from the Iranian regime, which threaten Americans in the Middle East  and global commerce in the Red Sea.   Sanctions issued pursuant to this authority have blocked critical  financial support from reaching these dangerous Iranian proxies. If we  remove these sanctions, the Houthis will have more funds to develop  weapons and threaten American citizens and international shipping  interests.   Terminating this national emergency would lift sanctions on the  Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, who oversees their campaign of  terror. Al-Houthi is also responsible for the ongoing detention of  former U.S. Embassy staff and the active occupation of the U.S. Embassy  compound in Yemen. What message are we sending to our enemies around  the world by arbitrarily terminating sanctions on this dangerous  extremist?   This radical group should not gain access to more cash to help fund  its war machine. Being weak and lifting sanctions on Iran and its  proxies is not an option.   President Donald Trump agreed. His administration stood strong  against Iran and renewed this Yemen national emergency on four separate  occasions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand against Iran and oppose  this reckless resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I thank Ranking Member Dean Phillips for his bipartisan cooperation  as we work together to strengthen our country and actually work  together with all Members of Congress.   The Yemen national emergency is the basis for sanctioning some of the  Iranian regime's worst henchmen in Yemen. These terrorists are  responsible for staging direct attacks on Americans and direct attacks  on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia and on our Middle Eastern allies,  diverting critical aid away from the Yemenis who desperately need it.   I have had the opportunity firsthand to see destroyed Iranian drones  that had been used to kill Americans and Saudi Arabians. Clearly, they  were marked very helpfully in English, ``Made in Iran.'' There is no  question what was going on.   War criminal Putin is using these same drones to murder civilians  across Ukraine as war criminal Putin and the regime in Tehran as  dictators with rule of gun attack democracies with rule of law  worldwide.   Again, this national emergency gives no authority to the President to  pursue anything outside of economic sanctions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of  the House of July 13, 2023, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res.  71) relating to a national emergency declared by the President on May  22, 2003, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to the resolution. The Iraq national emergency  we are discussing today is the basis for sanctions against Iranian and  Iran-backed terrorists who killed Americans and partner forces in Iraq,  as well as supporters of al-Qaida. If we overturn this national  emergency, these sanctions will automatically and immediately  disappear.   This is especially and personally important to me. I am really  grateful because my oldest son, Alan, served as field artillery in the  Army in Iraq, and my second oldest son, Addison, was a Navy doctor  serving in Iraq. They worked for the liberation of the people of Iraq.   Between 2003 and 2011, Iran-backed militias killed over 600 American  soldiers serving in Iraq. Since 2018, sanctions issued pursuant to this  authority have blocked over $80 million from reaching more than 200  dangerous entities and individuals, including Iran-backed militias,  their affiliates, and their supporters.   If we remove these sanctions, that money will help arm the very same  people responsible for murdering our troops. Our wounded and fallen  soldiers deserve better. Our Gold Star families deserve better. They  deserve thoughtful policies that carefully respond to dangerous threats  and yield accountability. They do not deserve arbitrary decisions to  recklessly overturn sanctions authorities.   As we stand here today, Americans in the region are still on the  front lines of Iran's dangerous and murderous aggression. Iran-backed  militias are responsible for dozens of attacks against U.S. forces in  the region in the past few years.  [[Page H3667]]    Examples of individuals who would have sanctions on them removed if  this resolution passed are Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani and Abu Dura, IRGC- backed militia leaders who have launched attacks on the United States  and British forces in Iraq. It would also remove sanctions on Misha'an  al-Juburi, a Syrian who, according to the Department of Treasury,  worked with al-Qaida in Iraq's jihadist umbrella organization, the  Mujahidin Shura Council, to fund Sunni extremist operations to kill  Americans.   Terrorist supporters should not have access to the U.S. financial  system, and Americans should not be able to do business with these  people who plan to kill Americans.   There is a dangerous message being sent to our enemies if we  terminate sanctions programs while those under sanctions openly attack  Americans.   President Donald Trump agreed. His administration stood against  Iranian-backed terrorists threatening Americans and renewed the Iraq  national emergency on four separate occasions.   I urge the Biden administration to engage with Congress in a more  open and forthcoming dialogue about its use of these emergency economic  powers, and I urge my colleagues to stand up with our troops, with  military families, and with Gold Star families to oppose this reckless  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time and the right to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Again, I am grateful for the bipartisan effort with Ranking Member  Dean Phillips of Minnesota.   The immediate lifting of sanctions on terrorists who actively  threaten  [[Page H3668]]  America is unconscionable. These national emergency economic  authorities are scoped solely to economic sanctions authorities and are  effective in preventing terrorists from accessing the financial  networks they need to carry out atrocities against Americans and our  allies.   American veterans of service in Iraq should be appreciated for their  success in liberating the people of Iraq from a murderous dictator who  was appropriately executed. This is a message toward criminal Putin  that his invasion of Ukraine, totally unprovoked, will result in  justice for his conduct of mass murder.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of  the House of July 17, 2023, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res.  79) relating to a national emergency declared by the President on May  11, 2004, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the measure  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. The Syria  National Emergency is the basis for sanctions against the regime of the  murderous dictator Assad and his comrades.   For over a decade, the Assad regime, war criminal Putin, and the  terrorist regime in Tehran have committed brutal atrocities against the  people of Syria. The civilian mass murder in Aleppo should never be  forgotten, which was facilitated by war criminal Putin.   In the last 5 years, sanctions issued pursuant to this authority have  prevented over $100 million from reaching more than 100 dangerous  entities and individuals affiliated with the Assad regime and its  backers, including ISIS middlemen.   This murderous regime has supported international terrorism,  committed innumerable atrocities against civilians, assisted with the  manufacture of ballistic missiles, and developed weapons of mass  destruction.   Let me be clear: Some of the people sanctioned under this national  emergency quite literally developed chemical weapons, and we know when  President Donald Trump determined that chemical weapons were used, he  immediately responded with a direct attack on the Assad regime.   If we overturn this national emergency, those sanctions will  automatically and immediately disappear. The criminals behind Assad's  weapons of mass destruction program should not be able to access credit  cards to do business with Americans.   These sanctions are more than just an essential tool in countering  the war criminal Bashar Al Assad. As previously mentioned, most of the  proceeds from violations of the sanctions, including these sanctions on  Syria, go directly to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism  fund, which benefits American victims of terrorism, including our  Nation's 9/11 families.   In addition, this resolution would terminate sanctions on people like  George Haswani, who the U.S. Treasury has named, and I quote: ``A  Syrian businessman who serves as a middleman for oil purchases by the  Syrian regime from ISIL.''   It would also lift sanctions on a number of Assad officials who  support Hezbollah terrorists who threaten daily the people of Israel  from Lebanon.   Today, Assad is not only a war criminal, but also the head of a  narco-state. His regime spreads both the malign influence of his  Iranian puppet masters and the scourge of drugs throughout the region.   The Assad regime is a critical player in the growth of regional and  global trade of the narcotic Captagon. Removing these sanctions would  be a gift to Assad, Putin, and the Iranian regime, as the civilized  world confronts the unprovoked attacks on democracies which have rule  of law being attacked by the dictators with rule of gun.   Terminating this national emergency would immediately terminate  sanctions on hundreds of Assad cronies and financiers, developers of  Syria's chemical weapons, terrorist-supporting middlemen who threaten  America and Israel, and drug traffickers involved in the Captagon  trade.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Assad regime, its  dictatorship, and support the people of Syria to oppose this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time for closing.   The bipartisan opposition to this resolution is significant. Lifting  the national emergency of economic authorities with regard to Syria  would immediately line the pockets of chemical weapons manufacturers,  terrorists, and drug traffickers who have committed horrific crimes  against humanity.   We must work together to oppose the Hezbollah murderers who attack  Israel from Lebanon. These economic sanctions keep terrorists from  using the financial networks of the free world to enrich themselves and  plan attacks against America and our allies.   Democracies must stand together to respond to the dictators' rule of  gun opposing democracies' rule of law. The world is in a competition we  did not choose. Democracies are under attack by dictators such as war  criminal Putin, the Chinese Communist Party, and the regime in Tehran.   Ronald Reagan was absolutely correct, and that is we must have peace  through strength.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
