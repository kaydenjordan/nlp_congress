 Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an epidemic that  is sweeping our Nation. From big cities to small towns, communities  across our country have been ravaged by drug addiction and the multiple  problems caused by it. Opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999 and  were responsible for over 33,000 deaths in 2015 alone.   We have all seen the dangers posed by the overprescription of highly  addictive prescription opioids. According to the CDC, addiction to  prescription opioid painkillers is the primary gateway to heroin abuse.  In fact, Michael Botticelli, President Obama's drug czar, testified in  my committee last year that people who are addicted and abuse  prescription opioids are 40 times more likely to abuse heroin.   Almost all of the heroin sold on the streets of the United States  today enters the country illegally from Mexico. It is trafficked by  drug cartels into our communities through our porous southwest border.   It is a problem that continues to grow. Even as heroin has increased,  it has remained available and affordable because increased production  in Mexico has ensured a reliable supply of low-cost heroin. As long as  there is a demand, the enormous profit potential of the drug trade will  ensure that there is a sufficient supply. A kilogram of heroin can be  produced in Mexico for around $5,000. It can be sold to dealers for as  much as $80,000--a 1,500 percent profit.   At another committee hearing, we learned that heroin has  significantly dropped in price. In 1981, the nationwide average price  was $3,260 per gram of pure heroin. Today, it is between $100 and $150  per gram. That translates into as little as $10 for one hit, making  heroin a very affordable and very destructive addiction. While prices  have dropped, the potency has increased. Heroin sold in Wisconsin has  increased from 5 percent purity in the 1980s to somewhere between 20  percent and 80 percent purity today.   As awful as that reality is, imported heroin is only one front in our  fight against opioids. Another equally dangerous front is synthetic or  man-made opioids--particularly fentanyl and its analogs--which are now  commonly mixed into the heroin sold in our communities. Since fentanyl  is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than  morphine, it only takes a minuscule amount of fentanyl--just 2  milligrams, less than one one-thousandth of the weight of a penny--to  be potentially lethal.   Even more alarming, we are now beginning to see carfentanil, often  used to sedate elephants, also being blended into heroin and fentanyl  on the streets. Carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and  10,000 times more potent than morphine. A dose of carfentanil the size  of a grain of salt can lead to a deadly overdose.  [[Page S4000]]    Just as we are seeing an increase in drugs coming across our  southwest border, man-made opioids are on the rise as well. The profit  potential of fentanyl is even more staggering than heroin's. According  to an article in the Wall Street Journal, 25 grams of fentanyl costs  approximately $810 to produce and has a market value of $800,000.   In 2013, 3,097 people died from overdoses involving synthetic  opioids. Just 1 year later, we lost 5,544 people to that same drug--a  79-percent increase in just 1 year. My home State of Wisconsin has been  particularly hard hit by the introduction of fentanyl and its analogs.   In April, 2016, I met Lauri Badura. Lauri is from Oconomowoc, WI, a  suburb in Milwaukee. She lost her son Archie to a heroin overdose.   Here is a picture of Archie. He doesn't exactly look like a heroin  addict, does he? Archie was just 19 years old when he died. He began  using marijuana during his freshman year in high school and discovered  opioids the summer after his high school graduation. After overdosing  multiple times and trying to quit, Archie had stayed sober for 77 days  before he relapsed again and finally overdosed on May 15, 2014.   In Archie's memory, Lauri started a foundation called Saving Others  For Archie, or SOFA. Her organization raises awareness throughout  Wisconsin of the dangers of drug abuse. It offers support for families  battling addiction. Lauri is constantly being contacted by and  providing comfort to other parents coping with similar tragedies.   Lauri's story is moving, and I applaud her for being such a strong  advocate for those struggling with addiction. Unfortunately, her  tragedy is not unique. The scourge of addiction and overdose deaths has  devastated thousands of families, including my own.   In January, 2016, I lost a nephew to a fentanyl overdose. The  legislation I am introducing this afternoon is in memory of my nephew,  of Archie, and of all of the families in Wisconsin and throughout  America who have lost loved ones in this epidemic.   Today I am proud to introduce the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl  Analogues Act, or SOFA Act. Sharing an acronym with Lauri Badura's  organization, the SOFA Act will give law enforcement a set of enhanced  tools to combat the opioid epidemic by closing a loophole that criminal  drug manufacturers are exploiting.   Fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid--the result of complex  chemistry that brings together multiple building blocks. Criminal  chemists need change only one small piece of the chemical bond to be  one step ahead of the law. The fentanyl analogs on the street today  serve no known medical purpose and are contributing to the alarming  overdose rates throughout the country. My legislation would classify  these analogs under schedule I and give the DEA tools to quickly  schedule additional fentanyl analogs as they are identified in our  communities.   This body took a step forward last Congress when we passed the CARA  legislation to improve addiction treatment programs throughout the  United States. We can now take another important step forward by  providing law enforcement with the tools it needs to get these  dangerous synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and carfentanil, off the  streets.   In addition to Lauri Badura, I also want to thank Dr. Tim Westlake  for working with me to craft this legislation. Tim has testified at a  committee field hearing in Pewaukee, and he participated in an opioid  roundtable in Milwaukee I convened in September. His leadership in  Wisconsin and on this issue has been invaluable.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation and  additional opportunities to combat this serious problem that has  plagued our Nation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 1560. A bill to ensure the integrity of border and immigration  enforcement efforts by requiring U.S. Customs and Border Protection and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to administer law enforcement  polygraph examinations to all applicants for law enforcement positions  and to require post-hire polygraph examinations for law enforcement  personnel as part of periodic reinvestigations; to the Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
