 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to honor two of Alabama's great  citizens. The State misses greatly the late Senator Howell Heflin, who  was a Member of this body for 18 years, and my friend and campaign  manager, Giles Perkins, who was a lawyer in Birmingham, AL. These two  men spent their lives working to improve our great State, and both  shaped the future of Alabama in his own way. Following these remarks,  we are going to be honoring both of these men in a reception to be held  in my office.   I last spoke on the floor of my friend and former campaign manager,  Giles Perkins, following his death last December. Giles was an  accomplished attorney, community leader, brilliant political adviser,  and strategist. Although a native of Texas, he moved to Alabama  following his marriage to his true love, Hillery Head, and he quickly  came to understand how Alabama's complicated and sometimes dark history  shaped our State. He had the vision of a brighter future if all  Alabamians could have just simply worked together to create one Alabama  for everyone.  [[Page S4687]]    Whether in politics, his legal practice, or with regard to his  remarkable community projects--most notably Railroad Park, which helped  to transform the city of Birmingham--for anyone who crossed paths with  Giles, one saw in him his passion for making Alabama and the entire  South better places for us all.   Giles' last political effort was my 2017 Senate campaign. As campaign  chair, he was nothing short of extraordinary. He challenged me  constantly--so much so that I began calling him Yoda. I still often  refer to him as Yoda. His ability to see the bigger picture and his  ``tough love'' approach with me made me a much better candidate, a  better person, and certainly a better U.S. Senator. I will always  cherish his friendship.   Howell Heflin was, to say the least, a lion of the U.S. Senate and a  political mentor of mine. A military hero who hailed from Tuscumbia,  AL, Judge Howell Heflin was sometimes described as the ``conscience of  the Senate'' as he was widely known for his unshakable integrity.  Because of that, he was the chair of the Ethics Committee, I think, for  12 years running--something that, in his final remarks, he described as  anything but enjoyable, but he was a man of unshakable integrity. He  was part of the ``greatest generation.'' He became a marine at the age  of 21, and he served the Nation during World War II. He was awarded the  Silver Star for valor in combat, and he received two Purple Hearts for  his actions.   Even by Members of this body, Howell Heflin was always affectionately  referred to as ``Judge.'' If you read back over the day he announced  his retirement, which was on March 29, 1995, all of his colleagues  referred to him as ``Judge'' because of his extraordinary career. As a  one-term chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he modernized  Alabama's court system and won numerous awards for it as well as for  himself personally. He was a known national figure because of his work  on the courts. Later, while in this body, he helped to streamline the  Federal courts in order to help move the civil courts and the criminal  justice system. He always believed that justice delayed was justice  denied.   He was elected to the Senate in 1978. I was then in my third year of  law school. During the summer of 1978, I opted to work full time on his  campaign rather than to clerk for a law firm. This was in part because  I believed that his election, following a 20-year or more domination of  Alabama politics by George Wallace, would be one of the most  significant elections in Alabama's history--a turning point for a State  whose reputation had sorely suffered throughout the civil rights  movement. It turned out I was absolutely right. Howell Heflin's  election ushered in a time in Alabama during which politicians in our  State began to look beyond the dog whistle politics of race and to do  their best to represent all of the citizens of Alabama.   He was a champion of the rural farmer, NASA, and businesses  throughout Alabama. He was also a champion of the small business  leader, teachers, members of the union, and African-American citizens  in Alabama, who were still feeling the effects of discrimination and  restricted voting rights.   By today's standards, Howell Heflin would certainly be considered  pretty conservative with his positions that many, including myself,  would probably not agree with. Yet, in his heart, Howell Heflin  believed in the Constitution of the United States, and he strived to  ensure that we lived up to the creed that all people are created equal.  During his floor speech in which he announced his retirement, he said,  ``Not until we become genuinely one nation under God, indivisible, with  liberty and justice for all can this country realize its potential for  true greatness.''   He worked as a Senator to secure the extension of the Voting Rights  Act, which is something we are still arguing about today--23 years  after he left the Senate. He appointed the first two African Americans  to the Federal bench in Alabama. Sadly, even though the number of  Federal judges in Alabama's three Federal districts have grown  significantly in number, there are still only two active Federal judges  in Alabama who are African American. He supported historically black  colleges and universities, and he ensured the passage of the civil  rights restoration bill. He helped to pass the fair housing bill and  helped to establish a national holiday that honors the late Martin  Luther King, Jr.   Howell Heflin's commitment to racial justice and his sensitivity to  issues of race led him in 1993 to give a remarkable floor speech that  opposed an insignia patent bill that contained an image of a  Confederate battle flag. This was over 20 years before the tragedy in  Charleston, SC, when battle flags across the country came down. It was  20 years or so before that when he opposed an amendment that would have  contained an image of the Confederate battle flag. It was truly a  remarkable speech, and I referenced it just recently in a speech I gave  here on the Equality Act. It was considered by many--his friends, his  family, his staff, and all who knew him, especially those in this  body--to be his finest hour. It was his finest hour because it was one  of those rare occasions on the floor of the Senate during which an  impassioned speech by one Senator swayed a vote.   There was an amendment and a motion to table on that bill--a motion  that had not succeeded. Howell Heflin then took to the floor so as to  sway Senators to reconsider. Then, overwhelmingly, by a vote of over 75  to 20-something, the motion was tabled, and the bill died, as it should  have.   That led Carol Moseley-Braun--the first African-American female  Senator in history--to state the following:         His integrity, his intelligence, his commitment and faith       in the Constitution of these United States, faith in what the       American dream has always stood for and can be in the future,       has led Judge Heflin in a direction that I think is without       peer and without parallel in this body. He has been a force       for good. He has been a force for right.    There are very few people who have known Howell Heflin and there are  very few people in Alabama who remember him who would say otherwise.   He was a force for good, and he was a force for right.   I am so proud that my first job after law school was working with him  as staff counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was just an  amazing experience for a kid who had never been to Washington, DC,  before taking the job.   It is now my privilege to hold the seat that Judge Heflin had for 18  years. It is my honor. The fact that I walked off this floor with him  as a staffer in 1980 and walked back on in 2018 in his seat has been  one of the greatest honors of my life.   In gratitude for that opportunity the Judge gave me, I have  established a fellowship in my office for a recent law school  graduate--just like me in 1979--and I look forward to welcoming the  first Howell Heflin fellow to my team later this month.   Howell Heflin was sworn into the Senate in 1979, 40 years ago this  past January. And it was about 40 years ago this time of year that I  joined his staff--fresh out of law school, fresh off of taking the bar  exam. He was certainly my mentor and role model in many ways, and each  day that I am in the Senate, I strive to continue his legacy--not that  I always vote as Howell Heflin would, although, frankly, knowing him as  I did, I am absolutely convinced that he would have moderated many of  his positions with changing times. He was that kind of leader. But I am  certainly guided by the principles of public service to his  constituents that he described in his retirement announcement, in which  he said:         I have endeavored to represent Alabama in a studied,       impartial, and fair-minded manner. My record certainly       indicates at least an independent streak. I hope Alabamians       know that my decisions were based on what I thought was in       the best interest of my State and Nation. While some may       argue or disagree with my decisions, I was convinced that I       was right. And I believe most Alabamians felt that nothing       more could be expected of me.    I agree with him 100 percent.   Ironically, Judge Heflin passed away 10 years to the day from the day  he gave that speech on March 29. I miss him. Alabama misses him. And I  can assure my colleagues who didn't know him, the U.S. Senate misses  him as well.   The threads that tie Judge Heflin and Giles Perkins together in  history are their deeply rooted integrity and their dedication to  leaving the State of Alabama better than they found it. Their memories  inspire me every day.  [[Page S4688]]    Today, following these remarks, I am dedicating the conference rooms  in my Senate office to these two men who, through leadership and  commitment, made a positive difference in the history of the State of  Alabama, as well as in my life.   I am so happy that I am going to be joined by Judge Heflin's son Tom  and his wife Cornelia, as well as numerous former Heflin staffers,  including his longtime chief of staff, Mike House, who is the one who  made that fateful call to me that summer as I was studying for the bar  exam to offer me the job here on the Hill.   Also with us will be Drew Perkins and his wife Nelly. Drew is the  brother of Giles. They will be here with us as we celebrate both Judge  Heflin and Giles Perkins.   I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that in the corner of the  Giles Perkins Conference Room will be the large Yoda doll that will be  kept in his honor.   As for me, I will strive to continue the work that they began, to  fulfill their vision, and to honor their memories as long as I have the  privilege of serving here in the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.
