 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  USMCA, and I want to congratulate my friends, Mr. Brady from Texas and  Mr. Neal, for their leadership in the House Ways and Means Committee.  It is a great victory for their hard work and perseverance.   As a member of the USMCA Republican House Whip Team, I was proud to  advocate on behalf of this much-needed update to NAFTA.   Twenty-seven years ago, I worked for President Bush 41 and worked on  supporting his goal of North America becoming the world's premier  economic market. How pleased he would be to be here today and see this  bipartisan support to update the North American trade market for a new  generation.   Impressive, indeed. We will take converts to free trade every day,  even if some of them are overnight converts.   The Senate must act expeditiously now to convert this dream to a  reality and benefit the 100,000 Arkansans who live and die by trade  with Canada and Mexico.   Congratulations to President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer on this  historic victory, and Happy New Year to the economic region in North  America.    Mr. Speaker, Turkey's leader has threatened to  shut down Incirlik Air Base in retaliation for possible U.S. sanctions  related to the Syrian border incursion and the House's acknowledgment  of the Armenian genocide a century ago.   What a sad day for the Atlantic Alliance that has shouldered so many  burdens and shared so much loss in blood and treasure.   Since the end of World War II, America has backed Turkey and her  independence and freedom from Soviet domination, culminating with  Turkey joining the Alliance in 1952.   I am an original cosponsor of Representative Kinzinger's United  States-Turkey Relations Review Act. This bill would require us to  carefully assess the options for relocating American personnel and  assets from Incirlik Air Base.   Given Turkey's purchase of the Russian air defense system, the  incursion in northeast Syria, and now threatening to close Incirlik,  Turkey is not acting like a true and reliable partner. Turkish Prime  Minister Erdogan's provocative behavior merits the U.S. and other NATO  allies to consider our options in the region.                            ____________________
