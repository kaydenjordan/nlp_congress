 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the MORE  legislation both for what it does and what it does not do.   For starters, the bill authorizes the collection of detailed  demographic information on marijuana-sector employees, including their  race and ethnicity, for a massive, publicly accessible government  database. This is another attempt by Democrats to promote their  destructive identity politics agenda and lay the groundwork for a rigid  quota system that picks winners and losers based on skin color.   The database will also put more sensitive personal data at risk and  open the door to mischief by Federal bureaucrats who have repeatedly  weaponized access to Americans' private information to promote a  partisan political agenda. Hello IRS.   I am also disappointed that the majority refused to allow votes on  two commonsense amendments I proposed. The first would have required  child-resistant packaging and a Surgeon General's warning label  detailing the dangers these products pose to pregnant women and their  unborn babies. Investigative reports have revealed multiple instances  of pot shop clerks recommending marijuana to expectant mothers as safe,  despite well-documented risks. Few, if any, of these retail clerks have  any medical training and should stick to dispensing pot, not prenatal  advice.   The second would have banned the use of ingredients or flavor  additives in marijuana-infused products such as fruit, chocolate,  vanilla, or candy. For years, we have been told by many on the other  side that such flavors appeal to children and should be banned from  tobacco products. If this standard is good enough for JUUL and Puff  Bar, shouldn't it also apply to Cheech and Chong?   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will make an already complicated  situation worse. I ask for a ``no'' vote on the rule and a ``no'' vote  on the bill.
