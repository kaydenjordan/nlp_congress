 I send a letter to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senators Blackburn, Hyde-Smith, Cotton, Hawley, Barrasso, Perdue,  Fischer, and Cornyn.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Loeffler and Senators Blackburn, Hyde- Smith, Cotton, Hawley, Barrasso, Perdue, Fischer, and Cornyn is for  counsel for the President:         As a fact witness who was coordinating with the       whistleblower, did Manager Schiff's handling of the       impeachment inquiry create material due process issues for       the President to have a fair trial?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   And I believe the short answer is yes, it did create a material due  process issue. And as I explained the other day in a portion of my  argument, there were three major due process violations: the lack of an  authorization, so that the whole proceeding started in an illegitimate  and constitutionally invalid manner; second, the lack of basic due  process protections related to fundamental rights to present evidence,  cross-examine witnesses, present witnesses; and the final one is that  Manager Schiff or his staff had some role in consulting with the  whistleblower that remains secret to this day. And all attempts to find  out about that, to ask questions about that were shut down. Manager  Schiff said today that he had no contact with the whistleblower, that  it was only his staff. But the extent to which there was some  consultation there hasn't actually been probed by any question.   All the questions that Republican Members of the House tried to ask  about that were shut down. And any questions as a result of questions  into determining who the whistleblower was and what his motivations and  bias were also shut down.   The inspector general for the intelligence community noted--we heard  that earlier this evening--in his letter to the Acting Director of the  DNI that the whistleblower had the indicia of political bias because  the whistleblower had connections with a Presidential candidate of  another party.   But the testimony from the inspector general of the intelligence  community remains secret. It was in executive session. It hasn't been  forwarded from HPSCI to the House Judiciary Committee and, therefore,  is not part of the Record here. There hasn't been any ability to probe  into the relationships between the whistleblower and others who are  materially relevant to the issues in this inquiry.   If the whistleblower, as is alleged in some public reports, actually  did work for then-Vice President Biden on Ukraine issues, exactly what  was his role? What was his involvement when issues were raised? We know  from testimony the questions were raised about the potential conflict  of interest that the Vice President then had when his son was sitting  on the board of Burisma. Was the alleged whistleblower involved in any  of that and in making decisions to not do anything related to that? Did  he have some reason to want to put the deep six on any question raising  any issue about what went on with the Bidens and Burisma and firing  Shokin and withholding $1 billion in loan guarantees and in forcing a  very explicit quid pro quo: You won't get this $1 billion until you  fire him.   We don't know. And because Manager Schiff was guiding this whole  process, because he was the chairman in charge of directing the inquiry  and directing it away from any of those questions, that creates a real  due process defect in the record that has been presented here.   So yes, that is a major problem and major defect in the way the House  proceedings occurred that infects this record. It means that it is not  a record that could be relied upon to reach any conclusion other than  an acquittal for the President.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Michigan.
