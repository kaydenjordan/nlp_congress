 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  critical issues facing my fellow farmers.   The world is on fire under President Biden and his America last  agenda. We are seeing skyrocketing costs of critical inputs, such as  fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer has doubled in price.   Our fuel prices have reached record highs, and President Biden's  solution is to beg our enemies in Iran and Venezuela for more oil.   The supply chain crisis was never addressed, and farmers are  struggling to find parts to repair equipment. Family farms are  suffering, and every American is about to see a drastic increase in the  price of food.   I am afraid for regular Americans. This yearlong experiment of woke  government has been a disaster.   My constituents in the 15th District miss President Trump and an  agenda that put America first.                            ____________________
