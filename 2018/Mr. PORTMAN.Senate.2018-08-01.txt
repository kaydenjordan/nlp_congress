 Mr. President, today I want to talk about an issue that  has gotten a lot of attention recently, and that is our U.S. trade  policy. It is an important topic that affects every one of us. It  affects our economy, it affects jobs, and it certainly affects our  foreign policy.   I have followed it pretty closely over the years. I was a trade  lawyer when I first started practicing law. I was U.S. Trade  Representative, or USTR, under the George W. Bush administration, and  now I am a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has  jurisdiction over these trade issues.   Most importantly, of course, I am a Senator from Ohio, which is a  State that has a big manufacturing sector, a big agriculture sector,  and a State where a lot of jobs depend on having a good trade policy.  In fact, in Ohio, about 25 percent of our State's factory workers are  export workers. In other words, they make products that get exported.  Today in Ohio, about one of every three acres that are planted gets  exported--soybeans, corn, and wheat. These are good jobs too. Trade  jobs, on average, pay about 16 percent more than other jobs and provide  better benefits. So it is very important to our economy in Ohio to have  these export jobs.   In America, we are about 5 percent of the world's population. Yet we  have about 25 percent of the world's economy. So it is very important  for us to have access to the 95 percent of consumers who live outside  of our borders. We want to sell them more. We want to open up markets  for our farmers, our workers, and our service providers.   While promoting exports, we also need to ensure that we protect  American jobs from unfair trade, from imports that would unfairly  undercut our farmers, our workers, and our service providers. Simply  put, what we want is a level playing field where it is fair and where  we have reciprocal treatment between countries.    If we have a level playing field, by the way, I believe American  workers will be just fine. Our workers and businesses can compete and  can win if we have a truly level playing field.   We want a balanced approach. We want to open up new markets for U.S.  products, while being tougher on trade enforcement, so we can compete.   With my colleagues over the past couple of years, I coauthored a  number of laws in this area. One is actually called the Level the  Playing Field Act. It does just that. The other is called the ENFORCE  Act. These are bipartisan laws that are helping to crack down on unfair  trade that hurts U.S. jobs.   The Level the Playing Field Act helps on the front-end by making it  easier for workers and businesses to win cases when foreign companies  send us products that are unfairly traded because they are sold below  their cost or dumped or because they are subsidized illegally. This  makes it easier to put anti-dumping or countervailing duties, also  known as tariffs, on those unfairly traded products. That is a good  idea. By the way, it is sanctioned by the international trade enforcer  called the World Trade Organization. This law has worked over the last  couple of years to raise tariffs on those unfair imports.   The second law, which is called the ENFORCE Act, helps on the back- end by ensuring that once workers win trade enforcement cases, the new  duties on foreign imports are actually enforced. It is designed to keep  countries from circumventing new tariffs by selling the product to a  third country, a third party that then sells it to the United States to  get around our tariffs. We don't want people to evade our tariffs, and  that is the purpose of the ENFORCE Act. It needs a little work,  honestly, on its implementation. We need to strengthen it.   Together, the Level the Playing Field Act and the ENFORCE Act are  working.   Since I came to the Senate in 2011, I have been involved in nearly 40  trade cases where American workers and producers were seeking relief  from unfair foreign competition. I am proud to have received the  American Iron and Steel Institute's Congressional Steel Champion Award  in 2015 for my ongoing work to allow steelworkers to compete on a level  playing field.   In 2016, the Level the Playing Field Act was used to secure three big  wins against China and several more against other countries in the  sector of steel, particularly rolled steel--hot-rolled steel, cold- rolled steel, and corrosion-resistant steel. This is the kind of steel  that is used to make cars and trucks and other things. Those products  from China--rolled steel--now face tariffs of up to 265 percent thanks  to our legislation and thanks to bringing these cases and winning them.   This is how trade enforcement should work. It shouldn't just be about  saying that we are going to raise tariffs just because we can because  then other countries will do the same thing to us--raising tariffs,  which are like taxes, and risking a trade war with escalating tariffs  that would make everyone worse off. Enforcement actions should be  focused on those countries that are engaging in unfair trade practices  and violating our trade laws or the commitments that are required under  the World Trade Organization.   We want a level playing field and reciprocity so we can open up more  markets for our workers, and we want other countries to send us  products that are fairly traded. It is pretty simple.   We need to be careful about taking action that increases barriers to  trade. If we impose higher tariffs without justification, we invite  retaliation and higher tariffs on our exports. My concern is that we  are beginning to do just that, and it threatens the impressive economic  gains we have seen this year.   Since the tax cuts and tax reform were enacted and since important  new  [[Page S5566]]  regulatory relief has been implemented by the Trump administration, we  have seen the economy grow. After a couple of decades of stagnant  growth and flat wages, our economy is actually increasing, wages are  starting to increase, and American workers and businesses are  benefiting.   Just last week, the Commerce Department released the economic numbers  for the past 3 months, and our economy grew by 4.1 percent in the  second quarter of this year. Pro-growth Federal policies have resulted  in this kind of a strong and growing economy that is creating more jobs  and higher wages. We want to continue building on that momentum that we  already started this year with these good fiscal policies.   I am concerned that some of our decisions on trade policy provide a  real headwind to that growing economy. That is why, when I see the  Commerce Department putting tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, I  become concerned. According to one estimate, a 25-percent tariff on  autos and auto parts could cost 624,000 American jobs.   Right now, the administration is doing a lot on the trade front. They  have a lot of balls in the air. As far as our trade policy is  concerned, I think it is causing a lot of uncertainty out there in the  economy.   First, the administration is still renegotiating the North American  Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada, which are, by  the way, our biggest trading partners in Ohio--Canada is No. 1, and  Mexico is No. 2.   I support updating NAFTA. I think that is a good idea. I support what  USTR Robert Lighthizer is trying to do. But after 15 months of talks  and uncertainty, I am concerned. We need to see some light at the end  of the tunnel. I hope we will soon, particularly as it relates to  Mexico.   Second, the United States is raising tariffs on Chinese imports using  section 301 of our trade law after conducting a thorough investigation  demonstrating the number of anti-competitive ways--from administrative  approval processes, to joint venture requirements, to outright cyber  theft--that China uses to effectively steal American intellectual  property.   Third, the administration is using a national security waiver to our  trade rules--called section 232--to raise tariffs as a matter of  national security on steel and aluminum imports from all but four  countries. That means those tariffs are being imposed on a number of  our strong allies. Because of that and the retaliation it has invited,  this section 232 has been the focus of a lot of attention recently.   I agree with President Trump that we need to crack down on countries  that cheat on trade--like China--and we need to make sure we do it in a  smart and targeted way. China does steal our intellectual property, and  they have been doing that for years. China tilts the playing field  against American firms, innovators, and workers and gets the technology  they need to leapfrog the competition. I support action against this  kind of unfair Chinese trade and investment practice, and I was glad to  hear that serious talks with China might start soon.    As we go into these talks, we need to be clear about our objectives  and clear about what we are looking for as Americans. Is it just trying  to address the trade deficit and have them try to buy more of our  exports, like soybeans or LNG--liquefied natural gas--or is it asking  China to make some changes structurally so that we can have a more fair  trading relationship as two mature trading partners? We also need to be  sure, as we make clear our objectives, that we don't continue to raise  tariffs without having these negotiations and direct talks.   My biggest concern is the administration's broad use of a powerful  national security tool known as section 232. Section 232 comes from a  trade act that was passed back in 1962 that was intended to be used  purely for national security purposes. Thus, it has been invoked only  rarely, only a few times, the last being in 1986, 32 years ago. Section  232 is really an exception to our trade laws because you neither have  to show injury to a domestic industry nor any surge or unfair trade  with regard to the targeted imports, as you would under these other  trade laws. In other words, under the other laws, you have to show that  there is material injury to a domestic company or that there is a surge  coming in of imports or often that there actually is unfair trade, like  the dumping we talked about earlier--selling below cost or subsidizing  illegally. You don't have to show that under section 232.   One reason it has hardly ever been used is precisely because it  doesn't require any negative impact or unfair influence or unfair  trade. This means that when we use this tool, if it is not used for  national security reasons, other countries are likely to respond in  kind, simply putting tariffs on our exports for no reason. That is  exactly what is happening.   Using section 232, we put a 25-percent tariff on steel and 10 percent  on aluminum imports from nearly every country in the world across the  board, most of which are our allies. The only exemptions are Argentina,  Brazil, Australia, and South Korea. We negotiated quotas with them. For  all the other countries in the world, we have these tariffs in place,  including our close ally Canada, for example. They are a stalwart ally.  They have had troops in Iraq with us. They had troops in Afghanistan  with us. They are a good neighbor. They are Ohio's biggest trading  partner and No. 1 export destination for the workers and farmers I  represent. As a country, we actually send more steel to them than they  send to us. Remember, this is about steel and aluminum national  security tariffs. We actually export more steel to them than they send  to us, but they are targeted by this section 232 as a national security  threat for steel.   They have responded, as you would expect, with tariffs of their own  on our exports--all kinds of exports across the board. According to one  publication, Business Insider, Ohio is their No. 1 targeted State. That  is the State I represent. They slapped tariffs on Ohio workers and  farmers of more than $1.7 billion.   Now let's back up for a second and talk about steel and aluminum. Is  there an issue with unfair imports? Yes, there is, I think,  particularly with regard to steel. We have a global glut of steel, and  China is the reason.   About 15 years ago, China had about 15 percent of the global  production of steel. Today, they have about 50 percent of the global  production of steel, and they don't need it, so they are subsidizing  it, and they are sending it out below its cost, which, again, is called  dumping. That is why we have been using our other trade laws to go  after these unfair exports, and we need to do more of that to stop the  transshipments, where they send the product to another country and then  process it and then send it to us.   For certain countries and certain products, I believe there is a  national security issue with steel. An example of that is electrical  steel--something that is critical to our electric grid. Electrical  steel is something we absolutely need. Yet there is only one U.S.  manufacturer left of electrical steel. Imports have increased in the  last year alone by about 100 percent. This is an example of how I  believe section 232 could be used in a very targeted way that relates  directly to our national security.   Again, we have other trade enforcement tools at our disposal,  including the Level the Playing Field Act we talked about and the  ENFORCE Act. We went after countries that subsidize or dump their  products. These are more precise tools to hold our trading partners  accountable that should be strengthened and used before section 232,  where appropriate.   Misusing the 232 statute and its national security rationale not only  leads to other countries increasing tariffs on all our exports to them,  but it also risks the World Trade Organization stepping in and our  actually losing what I think is an important national security tool. In  other words, by misusing this, my fear is that we will be taken to the  WTO by other countries. It has already happened. They have filed cases  again us. The WTO could indeed rule--which they never have before--that  we cannot use 232 in the way we have and take away that tool. That  would be a big problem because I think it is a tool we should have in  our toolbox.   I believe we run an even greater risk of losing this tool when the  administration suggests that imports of cars  [[Page S5567]]  threaten our national security. That is the most recent case that is  now working through the system. I want to see more cars made in  America, but tariffs like the Commerce Department is suggesting would  make it even more expensive to make a car here. We are told by the auto  industry--and the big 3 automakers oppose this 232 on automobiles--we  are told it would increase the cost of a car by about $2,000.   That is why I believe we have to reform the section 232 statute and  ensure that any 232 actions are based on a legitimate national security  justification and that Congress has a larger role to play in its  oversight. A few hours ago, my colleagues, Senators Doug Jones and Joni  Ernst, and I introduced bipartisan legislation that would help do just  that. Our bipartisan bill, called the Trade Security Act, will reform  section 232 to better align the statute with its original intent.   First, it ensures that proper experts in government determine at the  outset whether there is a national security threat. Our bill requires  the Department of Defense, not the Secretary of Commerce, to assess the  potential threat posed by imports of certain products to justify the  national security basis for new tariffs under section 232. If the  Department of Defense says a threat is found, the Department of Defense  would send its report to the President. The President would then direct  the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with Congress, the Secretary  of Defense, and USTR, to develop recommendations for how to respond to  the threat. After receiving the remedy recommendations from the  Secretary of Commerce, the President would then decide whether to take  action.   So it creates a two-step process. The first step is determining  whether there is a national security threat, done by the appropriate  office and the appropriate experts in the Federal Government, and then  the second step would be the Commerce Department coming up with the  remedy, as opposed to now, where the Commerce Department makes that  national security recommendation.   The bill will also expand the role of Congress by giving Congress the  opportunity to disapprove of 232 action by passing a joint resolution.  Currently, Congress can disapprove of section 232 actions through a  joint resolution but only when it results in something covering oil or  petroleum products. So it is interesting--under the current 232  statute, the disapproval process works but only as to oil or other  petroleum products.   Our bill, the Trade Security Act, which we introduced today, would  expand that process to include all products. By the way, the oil and  petroleum production exception is a vestige from the last time section  232 was used, about 40 years ago, because it was used with regard to  oil from Libya and from Iran.   Misusing our trade tools not only hurts our exporters, workers, and  farmers, but also our consumers. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this legislation to increase congressional oversight on one  of our most important national security tools. When he signed the Trade  Expansion Act of 1962 into law, which included section 232, President  Kennedy said:         This act recognizes, fully and completely, that we cannot       protect our economy by stagnating behind tariff walls, but       that the best protection possible is a mutual lowering of       tariff barriers among friendly nations so that all may       benefit from a free flow of goods. Increased economic       activity resulting from increased trade will provide more job       opportunities for our workers.    So that was the context within which section 232 was passed--in other  words, saying we don't want to put up more barriers. We want trade to  be fair and reciprocal. Neither the President nor the Congress intended  that section 232 would be used to put up more barriers. The Senate  Finance Committee chairman in the Congress who passed this legislation  said that in order for section 232 to apply, ``the products must be  involved in our national security.''   Whether it is the President or whether it is the Congress, the intent  was clearly to tie this closely to national security.   Let's restore this powerful and important tool to Congress' original  intentions when it crafted the law and ensure that section 232 is used  appropriately for national security purposes.   This legislation will help to guide our trade policy and ensure that  we keep national security and trade issues separate. The strength of  America's economy comes from hard-working and innovative Americans in  our shops, plants, and farms across this country that send products  around the globe. We want more of that. They deserve a level playing  field and the chance to compete.   Let's be sure our trade policy gives them that and not escalating  tariffs for their exports and higher costs for their families. Let's  find that right balance, including restoring an important national  security tool by not misusing it.   I urge my colleagues to join us in support of the Trade Security Act  to help do just that.   I yield back my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
