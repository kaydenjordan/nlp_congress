 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, our Armed Forces have been asked to work  miracles over the last 18 months, and they have performed. During a  global pandemic, in the face of natural disasters, facing dangerous  missions, our men and women in uniform have risen dutifully, faithfully  to the challenge. Many of our servicemembers have contracted--and then  recovered from--COVID-19 over the last 18 months. Now these same heroes  are being placed in a corner by this administration.   President Biden's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for the Armed Forces  does not grant our soldiers, sailors, and marines the respect they  deserve, and it could pose a challenge to recruitment and even to  military readiness.   This mandate, tied with President Biden's more sweeping general  vaccine mandate, has put millions of Americans in difficult positions.  In most cases, these are just everyday Americans. They are mothers and  fathers, husbands and wives just trying to put food on the table during  what has, for many, been a difficult time.   These still unwritten but very much efficacious mandates are forcing  millions of our fellow citizens into a sort of second-class,  unemployable status, placing countless of our neighbors on the economic  and social fringes of our society.   I have heard from almost 300 Utahans in recent days who were worried  about losing their jobs due to the mandates. Some of these individuals  are heroic members of our military. These servicemembers were rightly  praised for serving during a pandemic and for dangerous missions, but  now are being forced out, possibly with limited or no retirement  benefits because of the President's mandate.   Let me just share with you a few of their stories. One soldier who  reached out to me recently has served for 10 years in the military. He  never received a single reprimand, whether written or verbal. He  honorably and proudly served his Nation. He has been informed, despite  his years of successful Active-Duty service, that he will not receive  an honorable discharge if he doesn't comply with the vaccine  requirement. Accordingly, he asked to resign from the military. His  commanders made clear that he would be barred from resignation. Then he  sought a personal religious exemption. He was summarily told that his  exemption request would be denied.    Of his situation, he said:         To be backed into a corner with two very bad options is       both disheartening and sad, especially with what I have       sacrificed and what my family has sacrificed on behalf of the       military.    Another soldier told me his story. He has been in the Army for 18  years. All along, he was planning on retiring upon reaching two decades  of service. He is about 18 months shy of reaching that point--just 18  months from that retirement point that he has been working toward for  nearly two decades. Now, because of the vaccine mandate, he is at risk  of losing his benefits and not receiving an honorable discharge.   Regarding his situation, he said:         This will cause a substantial loss in pay and quality of       life for myself and a large number of others I know.    A third soldier reached out to my office in a similar retirement  situation. This soldier has children who experienced complications with  receiving the vaccine. The soldier also has a child with significant  learning disabilities, whom he is worried about providing for.   He said:         This really could be a life-changing event for my family,       and I feel strongly enough about it that I will risk all my       benefits not to take [the vaccine]. I just wish I had a       choice.    Now, these stories just barely scratch the surface of the hundreds of  stories that I have heard from people across my State, including many  who are servicemembers. These people, like millions of other Americans,  deserve a better option. They have earned that. That is why, today, I  am asking that the Senate pass my Respecting our Servicemembers Act.  This bill would simply prohibit the Secretary of Defense from requiring  COVID-19 vaccination for our military. I am grateful to my colleagues  Senators Braun and Tuberville for joining me as cosponsors.   This is now the seventh time I have come to the Senate floor, asking  that the Federal Government take a more temperate, reasoned approach.  As I have said each time before, I am not anti-vaccine. In fact, I  believe the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is a miracle. I have  been vaccinated, and I have encouraged every member of my family to be  vaccinated, and they have done so. I think the vaccine is a good thing.  These mandates are simply the wrong way of getting it done.   Look, when we look at the employer vaccine mandate generally, the  President doesn't have the authority. In fact, the Federal Government  doesn't have that authority. This is not a power that belongs to the  Federal Government to begin with. You know, even if it did, we haven't  authorized the President to do this unilaterally. Even if we had or  even if we were now considering a measure that would give him that  authority, it is worth noting here that there are so many other better,  more reasoned ways to encourage vaccination.   That is why I am here today, and that is why I will be back for as  long as it takes to address these mandates, which are causing pain and  suffering to hard-working moms and dads who don't want to have to be  making a gut-wrenching choice between, on the one hand, receiving  medical treatment that they don't want, whether for religious reasons  or a health-related reason related to what their doctors have advised  them or some other compelling personal reason or otherwise--they  shouldn't have to choose between receiving medical treatment they don't  want and forfeiting their ability to put bread on the table for their  children. It is un-American, it is unfair, and it is immoral.   So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on Armed Services be discharged from further  consideration of S. 2842 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
