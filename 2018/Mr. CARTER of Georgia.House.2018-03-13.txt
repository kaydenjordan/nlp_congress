 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Right to Try Act because this legislation will improve access to  potentially lifesaving treatments for patients with terminal diseases  or conditions.   Currently, patients can only receive drugs that are undergoing FDA  review through clinical trials, through compassionate use, or expanding  access. They access these unapproved treatments exclusively through the  FDA but not through the drug sponsor. This critical legislation would  establish informed consent for patients to access unapproved drugs that  could save their lives.   This bill still guards patients from manufacturers misbranding or  mislabeling drugs and specifies that any unapproved drug used in the  alternative pathway must have an active application and is not the  subject of a clinical hold.   I thank my good friend Chairman Burgess and the rest of my colleagues  on the committee for moving this legislation forward and working with  the administration and stakeholders on all sides of these issues. This  is a great step forward towards ensuring our patients get to take  advantage of the incredible pharmaceutical therapies that our  manufacturers are known for.   I applaud the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work in moving  this legislation forward, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
