 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4028,  the Information and Communication Technology Strategy Act.   Currently, far too many U.S.-based information and communications  vendors rely on technology from foreign sources. The Information and  Communication Technology Strategy Act will require the Department of  Commerce to assess the dependence of information and communications  vendors on foreign technologies and create a whole-of-government  strategy that will bolster the economic competitiveness of U.S.  information and communications vendors and reduce their reliance on  foreign resources.   With all the supply chain disruptions we have seen this past year, it  is important to know how our domestic production of this crucial  equipment can be strengthened in the future.   If passed, this piece of legislation brings us one step closer to  making sure our Nation's information technology supply chains are  secure and free from dependence on foreign countries, such as China.    We need to continue to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the  whole-of-government strategy that is created through this legislation  is properly implemented. I look forward to working with my colleagues  in the Senate to ensure this legislation becomes law.   I thank all of my friends across the aisle for helping us get to this  point, and I look forward to getting this bill across the finish line.
