For many parents, this  is a day filled with tears of joy as they send their child off into the  world alone for the first time. For others, it is a day of worry and  fear. Parents wonder if their child will be able to find their  classrooms or if they will make friends. Some even worry if their  child's school could be the scene of the senseless violence that occurs  all too often in this country. But for the parents of a child with  severe allergies, there is another serious fear: the threat of  anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis causes blood pressure to plummet, airways to  constrict and close, and the heart to beat erratically and stop. It can  turn deadly, quickly. Even a trace amount of an allergen can be enough  to trigger anaphylaxis.   Only one drug can halt and reverse the progression of anaphylaxis:  epinephrine. But as miraculous as the drug is, it can't help if it is  not on hand when the unthinkable happens. That is why, in 2013, I  introduced the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act to make  schools safer for children with food allergies. At the time, schools  often did not stock epinephrine, or ``EpiPens,'' as it is often called.  This left children with food allergies vulnerable at school, especially  those who may not have known they are allergic. Sometimes, children  forget their EpiPens at home; others don't have EpiPens to begin with.   My 2013 bill encouraged more schools to keep epinephrine on hand by  providing them with federal grants. It received bipartisan support, and  it was signed into law by President Obama. Over the last 10 years, it  has saved lives, and it has given parents and students alike greater  peace of mind that their school will be prepared to respond to a life- threatening emergency. But, I have thought since then: What more can we  do to prevent allergic reactions from occurring in the first place?   I hear from parents across my State of Illinois who are concerned  about sending their children with food allergies to school. Tamara  Hubbard from Lake Zurich, IL, is one of those parents. She is the  mother of a teenage son who has food allergies. Ms. Hubbard also  happens to be a therapist whose practice includes working with children  who have food allergies and their families. She wrote to me and told me  that: ``It takes a daily dose of blind faith mixed with hope'' to send  a child with food allergies to school. For a child with a peanut or  sesame allergy, she said, going to school can be a lot like entering  the lion's den. These and other common food allergens are often  contained in school meals and in the snacks and lunches of other  children. You have to be careful.   Ms. Hubbard said that the families she counsels are often left  wondering, ``Does our school staff understand allergen labeling? Are  they aware of cross-contamination best practices and how to make safe  ingredient substitutions for lunches?'' And what if they are not aware?  That last one is a hard question to contemplate because we know the  worst can--and does--happen.   Last May, Tom Shaw, a father in Papillon, NE, just outside of Omaha,  dropped his 14-year-old son, Jagger, off at school, gave him a hug and  told him to have a good day--just as he had done every school day. But  this was not a normal day. You see, like 1 in 50 American children,  Jagger was allergic to peanuts. But at snack time, he was given a  granola bar that had peanuts in it. Almost immediately, Jagger's heart  started racing, and his throat began to swell. He went to the school  nurse's office, where he was injected with an EpiPen. But his condition  continued to worsen quickly. By the time Jagger was rushed to the  hospital, his heart had stopped beating. He had to be resuscitated and  put on a ventilator. He suffered serious damage to his heart and brain.  Two days after eating that granola bar, Jagger died. Last month, a 10- year-old girl in Amarillo, TX, Emerson Kate Cole, also died after she  went into anaphylaxis at school.   Nearly 1 million children nationwide have had an allergic reaction at  school. And 25 percent of these reactions occur among children who have  undiagnosed food allergies. We can and must do more to prevent children  with allergies, diagnosed and undiagnosed, from experiencing  potentially deadly reactions to food allergens in schools. That is why,  2 weeks ago, Senator Duckworth and I introduced the Protecting Children  with Food Allergies Act. Our bill would require cafeteria workers and  other school nutrition workers to receive training in how to identify,  prevent, and respond to food-related allergic reactions. That is it. It  is a simple fix that would make our schools safer for children with  food allergies so that they can focus on learning, not on whether or  not they might have an allergic reaction at lunchtime. These cooks,  servers, and other cafeteria workers already undergo other sorts of  trainings, such as to prevent the spread of foodborne pathogens. We  think they also should know the basics on food allergy safety, too. The  Protecting Children with Food Allergies Act would move us in that  direction.   We hope our colleagues will join us and support this bill with a  strong bipartisan vote, just as we did in 2013.  [[Page S289]]  Our kids are depending on us. Let's pass this bill and send it to the  President's desk as soon as possible. When it comes to food allergies  and potentially deadly anaphylaxis, every minute counts.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

(2) Treatment of certain breaks in presence.--        (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B)       and (C), an alien shall be considered to have failed to       maintain continuous physical presence in the United States       under subsection (b)(1)(A) if the alien has departed from the       United States for any period exceeding 90 days or for any       periods, in the aggregate, exceeding 180 days.        (B) Extensions for extenuating circumstances.--The       Secretary may extend the time periods described in       subparagraph (A) for an alien who demonstrates that the       failure to timely return to the United States was due to       extenuating circumstances beyond the alien's control,       including the serious illness of the alien, or death or       serious illness of a parent, grandparent, sibling, or child       of the alien.        (C) Travel authorized by the secretary.--Any period of       travel outside of the United States by an alien that was       authorized by the Secretary may not be counted toward any       period of departure from the United States under subparagraph       (A).        (d) Limitation on Removal of Certain Aliens.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary or the Attorney General may       not remove an alien who appears prima facie eligible for       relief under this section.        (2) Aliens subject to removal.--The Secretary shall provide       a reasonable opportunity to apply for relief under this       section to any alien who requests such an opportunity or who       appears prima facie eligible for relief under this section if       the alien is in removal proceedings, is the subject of a       final removal order, or is the subject of a voluntary       departure order.        (3) Certain aliens enrolled in elementary or secondary       school.--        (A) Stay of removal.--The Attorney General shall stay the       removal proceedings of an alien who--        (i) meets all the requirements under subparagraphs (A),       (B), and (C) of subsection (b)(1), subject to paragraphs (2)       and (3) of such subsection;        (ii) is at least 5 years of age; and        (iii) is enrolled in an elementary school, a secondary       school, or an early childhood education program.        (B) Commencement of removal proceedings.--The Secretary may       not commence removal proceedings for an alien described in       subparagraph (A).        (C) Employment.--An alien whose removal is stayed pursuant       to subparagraph (A) or who may not be placed in removal       proceedings pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall, upon       application to the Secretary, be granted an employment       authorization document.        (D) Lift of stay.--The Secretary or Attorney General may       not lift the stay granted to an alien under subparagraph (A)       unless the alien ceases to meet the requirements under such       subparagraph.        (e) Exemption From Numerical Limitations.--Nothing in this       section or in any other law may be construed to apply a       numerical limitation on the number of aliens who may be       granted permanent resident status on a conditional basis       under this Act.
