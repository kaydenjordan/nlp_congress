 Mr. Speaker, I want to share my letter to  Congressman John Robert Lewis.         Dear John, I hope you knew how incredibly honored I was to       call you colleague and to serve with you. It was such a great       privilege to watch you in action and listen to your stories.        When we planned the sit-in, being a part of the Fab 5 made       me so proud. It took a while to get the bill out of the       House, but we finally did it. I promise you, when I encounter       a situation that is just not right, I will stand up, speak       out, and get in the way.        I plan to carry a piece of you with me forever. I know I       will be a better person for it.        I hope you, C.T. Vivian, Martin, Rosa, Edgar, Robert       Kennedy, and others are having a fabulous reunion.        Rest in power, my friend, until we meet again.        Love, Robin.
