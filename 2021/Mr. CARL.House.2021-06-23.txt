 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gimenez for overseeing this and  calling us together.   Mr. Speaker, let's not forget what we have gone through in the last  year and a half.   In the last year and a half, personally, I have seen a campaign that  we have had to run while talking through doors. We had campaigns that  were virtually unheard of in the past.   Those of us that did win, when we came to Washington, we were all  treated equally, but we were treated like a disease. We were locked  down in a hotel; our food was slipped to us through a plastic cover, in  a paper bag; and that is the way we lived for a week through  orientation.                                time  1900    I am not blaming anyone. We had no idea what was going on. We all  lived in fear. We all worried about this. But we are Americans and we  are tough. We are tough. So we have made it. We have made it so far.   The changes we have seen, the birthdays that we have missed, the  parents that we have seen that have passed away without us being there  with them, I mean, we have all lived through this. We have got to reach  across the aisle, and we have got to get America answers, answers to  where this pandemic actually started. I encourage everyone to do that.   Millions have lost jobs and necessary incomes while countless others  lost loved ones to the virus. Meanwhile, the American public is  constantly being misled over the origins of the spread of this COVID- 19.   First, we need to declassify all information related to the origins  of COVID-19. Then we need to prohibit the National Institutes of Health  from giving funds to irresponsible foreign governments, like China.  And, finally, we need to investigate the Chinese Communist Party's role  in the origin and the spread of this virus.   The evidence is clear that the Chinese Communist Party intentionally  hid information and lied about the truth about this virus. It is time  for answers, and it is time for us to hold them accountable for the  spread of this horrific pandemic. The American people and the whole  world deserves to know the truth.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop, hesitate,  and let's work together on this. Let's join together and find out the  truth and prevent something like this from happening again. It is very  important to this country and this Nation.
