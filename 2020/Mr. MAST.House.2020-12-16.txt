 Madam Speaker, Harmony Allen is a veteran who was raped by  her Air Force instructor while serving our country.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate justice for Harmony Allen.   Now, for two decades, Harmony has been fighting for justice. Despite  being convicted in 2017, her rapist was set free on a misconstrued  technicality after the Nation's highest military court disregarded  Congress' intent and incorrectly applied a 5-year statute of  limitations on Harmony's case.   To fix this loophole, I introduced Harmony's Law to ensure that  convicted rapists are held accountable. I also worked with the  Solicitor General in the Supreme Court to hear Harmony's case and  overturn this massive miscarriage of justice.   Madam Speaker, last week, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in  Harmony Allen's favor. The Court's 8-0 decision is a monumental one,  and it serves a justice to Harmony that was long overdue. It also  prevents the potential early release of hundreds of convicted rapists,  making this a victory for all victims of military sexual assault.                            ____________________
