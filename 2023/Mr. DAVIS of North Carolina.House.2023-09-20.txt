 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to speak on  behalf of the many residents of eastern North Carolina who have  expressed their deep concerns to me about a government shutdown.   I have listened, and many are tired of the division and chaos.  Families across eastern North Carolina and America deserve better than  uncertainty and anxiety. Let us work together to prevent a government  shutdown.   To the people of North Carolina's First Congressional District, know  that I remain committed to doing everything to avoid a shutdown.                            ____________________
