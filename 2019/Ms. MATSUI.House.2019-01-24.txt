 Madam Speaker, across this country and in my hometown of  Sacramento, President Trump is inflicting unnecessary harm to our  Federal workers, our economy, and the health and safety of the American  people.   I have heard from my constituents across my district that this  shutdown is disrupting their lives. Many Federal workers are  frustrated. They just want to return to work. Yet, now they can't work,  or they are working without pay. They can't pay their bills. The  consequences of this shutdown affect us all.   I have heard from a U.S. Coast Guard veteran who answered the call to  serve his country for over 20 years and retired with honors. Now,  because of the shutdown, his pension isn't being processed. He is  worried about his bills, and is heartbroken that this country he served  for so many years is not honoring its promise to take care of him in  return.   Another person who is a TSA agent working without pay at Sacramento's  airport said it is hard to concentrate at work when she is thinking  about the bills stacking up. She is able to pay for January's rent with  savings, but if this shutdown continues through February, she will not  have enough money for rent, leaving her to choose between being evicted  or moving out on her own and becoming homeless.   Our Federal workers deserve an employer that honors its promises and  provides for its workforce. It is time for President Trump and Majority  Leader McConnell to fully fund the government and put an end to the  pain and suffering of the American people.                            ____________________
