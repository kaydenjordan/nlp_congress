 Madam Speaker, this week, we had a hero lie in honor in  the dome of the United States Capitol.   United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick gave his life to  protect the U.S. Capitol, one of our greatest symbols of democracy. I  had the opportunity to pay my respects to Officer Sicknick in the  Capitol rotunda, which is safe and secure because of his sacrifice and  also the bravery of his fellow Capitol Police officers and other law  enforcement.   I am devastated by the loss of Officer Sicknick, and I want to  provide my deepest condolences to Officer Sicknick's family and fellow  officers.   I want each and every Capitol Police officer to know that I am  grateful and appreciative of their work here that they do each and  every day to protect democracy and all who work here, and they protect  all of our constituents who visit.                            ____________________
