 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the United States  Merchant Marine Academy, located in Kings Point in my congressional  district, for 75 years of dedicated service to our country.   ``Acta non verba,'' the school's motto, means ``deeds, not words,''  something we all need to strive for. The midshipmen and graduates of  the Academy have exemplified the school's motto by faithfully serving  the United States in times of war and peace, and for that we are all  eternally grateful.   Since its founding in 1943, the United States Merchant Marine Academy  has developed a rich history of military and maritime service. It is  the only service academy whose students engage in combat during times  of war. In fact, 142 of its students gave their lives on behalf of our  country during World War II.   In 1974, the United States Merchant Marine Academy became the first  service academy to admit women.   After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, staff and midshipmen evacuated  civilians from lower Manhattan and transported first responders and  supplies to Ground Zero.   Midshipmen are the backbone of our Nation's maritime industry, and  they serve as members of the Armed Services as well.   As a member of the Board of Visitors, I am proud of the United States  Merchant Marine Academy, their rich history, and the sacrifices its  students and graduates have made for our great Nation.                            ____________________
