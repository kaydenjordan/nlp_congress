 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support the  nomination of Mayor Marty Walsh to serve as Secretary of Labor.   Across the country, working families are really desperate for help.  Even before this pandemic, the deck was stacked against workers and  especially against women, workers of color, and workers with  disabilities, thanks to an unlivable Federal minimum wage and  subminimum wage for tipped workers and workers with disabilities that  do leave millions of workers struggling to make ends meet; a pay gap  that makes getting by even harder for women, in particular, women of  color; a lack of a national paid family, sick, and medical leave policy  and quality, affordable childcare for working families; a failure to  protect workers from pandemics and workplace accidents and harassment  and discrimination and more; and a wave of job loss and economic  uncertainty that is upending the lives of workers and retirees across  our country.   This pandemic has laid bare the painful fact that while our economy  might work for the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals, it  isn't working for working families. And all of these challenges--unsafe  workplaces, lost jobs, low wages--are even worse for people of color  due to longstanding inequities that are rooted in systemic racism and  are widening due to this pandemic.   Our country cannot fully recover from this crisis unless we begin to  change that by rebuilding a stronger, fairer economy. And that starts  by making sure we have a Secretary of Labor who will actually champion  workers and working families.   As a union leader, a State representative, and as a mayor, Mayor  Marty Walsh has done just that. He has a clear track record as a  collaborative leader who worked across coalitions with labor groups and  the business community to build up Boston's middle class. Under his  leadership, 135,000 new jobs have been created in Boston.  [[Page S1633]]    He fought for a $15 minimum wage and paid leave policies to help  ensure women, workers of color, and workers with disabilities can  succeed in the workforce and get the pay they deserve.   During this pandemic, Mayor Walsh has continued to show a deep  commitment to his frontline workers who have kept this country running  by providing funding for emergency childcare and other resources his  essential workers needed to weather the pandemic.   And he would bring an important perspective as the first union leader  to head the Department in decades.   His unwavering commitment to put workers first was plain to see  during our confirmation hearing. In his testimony Mayor Walsh spoke  powerfully about the importance of protecting frontline workers who do  so much to keep our communities and our country running and rooting out  the inequities that have done so much damage to communities of color.  Mayor Walsh made clear he will work with Congress to help ensure every  worker has a fair, livable wage; a safe workplace; paid family, sick,  and medical leave; access to quality, affordable childcare; a secure  retirement; and the right to join a union and collectively organize.   I was impressed by his answers during our hearing, and I wasn't the  only one. Mayor Walsh's nomination passed out of our HELP Committee  with strong bipartisan support in an 18-to-4 vote, and I hope he will  now be confirmed with similar, overwhelming, bipartisan support because  even before this pandemic and even before President Trump's 4-year  crusade against workers, we had a long road ahead to build a truly  fair, inclusive economy that works for working families. But, now, not  only is the road longer, the clock is ticking.   Workers who are the backbone of our economy have been pushed to the  brink. They need us to confirm Mayor Marty Walsh so we have a Secretary  of Labor who will take quick action to address the urgent challenges we  face and be a valuable partner in helping our economy come back  stronger and fairer for all workers.   While we made important progress in the American Rescue Plan to  extend unemployment benefits and provide much needed tax relief for  those benefits, provide direct payments for families, and protect the  pensions millions of workers and retirees depend on and while President  Biden is taking important steps to reverse Trump-era rules that  undermined workers' rights, this road to recovery is long, and there  are still many steps we need to take, including raising the Federal  minimum wage to one fair wage of $15 an hour, passing the PRO Act into  law to strengthen workers' right to join a union, and passing the BE  HEARD in the Workplace Act to protect people from harassment, assault,  and discrimination.   We have a lot to do and no time to waste. I urge all of my colleagues  to prove to families back home they understand we need a Secretary of  Labor we can trust to stand up for workers and not huge corporations. I  urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Mayor Walsh.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
