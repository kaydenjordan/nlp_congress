 Mr. President, I want to address an extremely unusual  request that our Democratic colleagues have made with respect to the  Judiciary Committee.   Our dear friend Senator Feinstein is a titanic figure and a  stateswoman. Elaine and I have been honored to count the Senator and  her late husband Dick as close, personal friends for many, many years.  We miss our colleague. We wish her the very best for a speedy recovery  and a smooth return.   In the meantime, our colleague's temporary absence has really not  ground the Judiciary Committee to a halt. So far this Congress, the  committee has reported out 40 judicial nominees--listen to this--more  than half of them--more than half of them--on a bipartisan basis.   Let me say that again. More than two dozen judicial nominees have  been reported out this Congress on bipartisan votes.   There are more than a dozen article III judges already waiting on the  Executive Calendar, and a whole bunch of the nominees currently in  committee are likely to receive bipartisan support as well. So the  administration does not face any obstacle to moving nominees who are  remotely qualified for the job. People who are mainstream and qualified  have a path forward.   Yet some of the same far-left voices who have attacked Senator  Feinstein in the past are now suggesting that the Senate move her off  the Judiciary Committee indefinitely--indefinitely. The stated reason,  the supposed emergency, is that Senate Democrats are unable to push  through the small fraction of their nominees who are so extreme--so  extreme--and so unqualified that they cannot win a single Republican  vote in Committee.   Let me say that again. The far left wants the full Senate to move a  Senator off a committee so they can ram through a small sliver of their  nominees who are especially extreme or especially unqualified.   There are four main nominees whom our Democratic colleagues are  currently unable to move. One of them threatened an underage abuse  victim while representing her prep school. One of them didn't know what  article II of the Constitution says. One of them didn't know what a  Brady motion is. The fourth one argued that the sex offender registry-- listen to this--does not help keep children safe. Those are the four  they are having a hard time moving. They are not on track to get  bipartisan support.   It is purely the Democrats' political choice to hold relatively more  reasonable nominees hostage so the unqualified ones can move in a pack.  So even though they could move a number of less controversial nominees  right now--right now--they want to sideline Senator Feinstein so they  can ram through the worst four as well.   I understand our Judiciary Committee colleagues report they cannot  find a single past example where their committee let a Member be  temporarily replaced in this fashion that some Democrats are  advocating.   So let's be clear. Senate Republicans will not take part in  sidelining a temporarily absent colleague off a committee just so  Democrats can force through their very worst nominees.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize a beloved  family business, native to Kentucky, that celebrates its 150th  anniversary this year. Reid's Orchard started in a similar fashion to  most entrepreneurial success stories in this country: an immigrant who  journeyed to America in search of a better life for himself and his  family. Allan Reid left his little village in Scotland in 1873, setting  up shop in New York City with his two brothers in the tobacco industry.  Allan started out bookkeeping, but the young and ambitious Scot quickly  realized that it wasn't bookkeeping or tobacco that interested him, it  was  [[Page S1205]]  peaches, which he found wildly outpaced the quality of fruit available  back in Europe.   Allan soon left New York City to set up a peach and apple orchard in  Daviess County, KY--where the business is still run today. His orchard  quickly became a well-run enterprise and a leader in agricultural  production and technology. In admirable fashion, Allan gave back to his  community in more ways than just his delicious fruit. This peach  pioneer would go on to serve two terms as a Kentucky State  Representative and play an instrumental role in the construction and  expansion of roads throughout this region of the Commonwealth. Allan's  sons, Robert Reid, Jr., and John, would later join the family business  with this same sense of community until Allan's great-grandson, Billy,  would enter the business and form Reid's Orchard, as it is known today.   Since taking the helm, Billy has brought the orchard to new heights,  expanding his family's business into a successful year-round operation,  a popular community-gathering point, and a local staple of Owensboro.  Today, Reid's Orchard caters to Kentuckians across the Commonwealth,  offering a wide array of delicious produce and seasonal favorites that  include apples, cider, strawberries, flowers, pies, pumpkins, and my  personal favorite, peaches. My staff will tell you, amusingly, that  peach-picking season is a highly anticipated event for me. Every  August, I look forward to sampling Billy's peaches.   To the delight of many, the orchard's success has allowed the family  to expand beyond its farm business. Each year, the orchard puts on an  annual summer festival, hosting some of country music's biggest names-- an impressive feat for a family-run business in Western Kentucky and a  further testament to Reid's widespread popularity. For 37 years  straight, the orchard would also host its popular Apple Festival. In  fact, this festival is so popular locally that the Owensboro community  plans to carry on the tradition each fall.   When it is not hosting popular community events, Reid's Orchard  regularly welcomes families who have traveled far and wide to pick  produce in the orchard, learn about farm life, and let their kids roam  free across its 250 acres.   Billy's impressive stewardship of the family business and commitment  to his local community have earned him the admiration of Owensboro  locals, as well as Kentuckians across the Commonwealth. I am proud to  call Billy a long-time friend, a friendship that extends beyond his  delicious peach deliveries and spans over 20 years.   From Allan Reid's early love for peaches to Billy's thoughtful  expansion of his great-grandfather's legacy, the story of Reid's  Orchard has been defined by hard work and ingenuity. It is an American  story, a story that renews our gratitude for this Nation, its  opportunity, and its promise.   On behalf of the Senate, I would like to recognize the Reid family  for their countless contributions to the Bluegrass, and congratulate  Reid's Orchard for 150 years in operation of the American Dream.                            ____________________
