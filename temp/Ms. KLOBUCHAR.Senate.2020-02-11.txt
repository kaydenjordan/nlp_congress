 Madam President, it has been 1190 days since  Russia attacked us in 2016, and we have yet to pass comprehensive  election security reform. The next major elections are just 266 days  away and primaries are already underway. We must take action now to  secure our elections from foreign threats. I applaud my Democratic  colleagues for coming to the floor today to urge the Senate to take  action.   Our intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that elections  remain a target for foreign adversaries and that our election systems  remain vulnerable. According to a recent joint statement from our  military and intelligence agencies, the administration warned that  ``Russia, China, Iran and other foreign malicious actors will seek to  interfere in the voting process or influence voter perceptions.'' Our  adversaries are emboldened, and we must do more to safeguard our  elections.   I have been coming to the floor for years now fighting to get  comprehensive election security legislation passed because election  security is national security. While we have made progress and secured  nearly $1 billion in election security grants for States, we have been  blocked from passing meaningful legislation that would ensure our  election systems are resilient in the face of attacks, legislation that  calls for paper ballots and reliable postelection audits--basic  requirements that would dramatically improve election security. Despite  my bipartisan work with Senator Lankford on such legislation, we have  been repeatedly blocked from bringing it to the floor.   There are other commonsense bipartisan election security bills that  have been blocked from the floor. Late last year, I pushed the Senate  to take action on the Honest Ads Act, my bipartisan legislation with  Senator Graham that would increase transparency and accountability for  political ads sold online. The goal is simple: bring our laws into the  21st century to ensure that voters know who is paying to influence our  political system. That is a goal every elected official should be  fighting for, but I was again blocked from offering the legislation on  the Senate floor.   We have a common set of facts about how our elections were attacked;  now we must act with a common purpose to ensure it never happens again.  This is about our democracy, not about partisanship. The freedom to  choose our leaders and know with full confidence that those leaders  were chosen in free and fair elections is something Americans have  fought and died for since our country was founded. We need to be a  united front in fighting against those who interfere with our political  system, and we must do everything in our power to protect our  elections.                            ____________________
