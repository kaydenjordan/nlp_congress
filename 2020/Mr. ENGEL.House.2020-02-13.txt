 Madam Speaker, as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, I rise to draw attention to the tragedy unfolding in Idlib,  Syria.   The regime backed by Iran and Russia continues to target civilians.  They target hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Just drop  bombs. They are levelling whole neighborhoods, which is indicative that  the regime does not want people to return to their homes. They are  killing innocent men, women, and children for no reason.   Over half a million people have been displaced in the last 2 months.  There must be a humanitarian response from the world, and it must start  here in the United States. There must be accountability, and we must  show the Syrian people that we have not forgotten them. How can we  stand idly by and allow this to continue to happen?   I call on the President and all Members of both houses to have a  forceful response to the regime in Syria to say that we will not  tolerate the targeting of civilians, the wholesale killing of children  and women and all civilians. We need to stand on the side of justice,  and we must show the Syrian people that we have not forgotten them.                            ____________________
