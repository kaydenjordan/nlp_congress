 Mr. Speaker, on this day 63 years ago, four courageous  North Carolina A&T students, Franklin McCain, Jibreel Khazan, Joseph  McNeil, and David Richmond, staged a sit-in at the Whites-only lunch  counter  [[Page H589]]  of the Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North Carolina, after  they were refused service.   They came to be known as the Greensboro Four. In the days to come,  their peaceful protest grew as they were joined by students from  Bennett College and Dudley High School.   Their courageous actions inspired over 700,000 people across the  Nation to participate in sit-ins, sparking a revolution that moved our  Nation forward in the fight for civil rights.   Today, as we celebrate the first day of Black History Month, we  remember their legacy, which is honored at the International Civil  Rights Center and Museum that is in that very Woolworth's building in  Greensboro.   I am proud to co-lead a resolution with Congresswoman Adams to  encourage States to include the Greensboro sit-ins in school  curriculums.                            ____________________
