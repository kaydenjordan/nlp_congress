 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to stand here today and  congratulate Major General Jon Jensen of the Minnesota National Guard  on his recent nomination to become the next Director of the Army  National Guard.   Major General Jensen is a proven leader with an extraordinary record  of  [[Page H2520]]  service to the great State of Minnesota and our Nation.   Currently, Major General Jensen serves as the adjutant general of the  Minnesota National Guard, meaning that he is the highest ranking  guardsman in our State. Major General Jensen has also held numerous  other leadership positions during his 37 years with the National Guard.   Throughout his entire career, Major General Jensen has served with  the highest level of dedication. His service has earned him the respect  of the public; countless government officials; and, most importantly,  his fellow guardsmen.   On behalf of the entire State of Minnesota, I thank Major General Jon  Jensen for his service and congratulate him on this well-deserved  nomination.   Major General Jensen's rich experience makes him the perfect fit for  the position, and I look forward to seeing him confirmed by the United  States Senate soon.                            ____________________
