 Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I  rise on behalf of the Delaware delegation to honor the exemplary  service of Bernard Brady, secretary of the senate for the State of  Delaware.   A native of Wilmington and a graduate of Trinity College, University  of Dublin, Bernard began his career with the Delaware Senate in January  of 1979. After nearly 40 years of public service, he has made the  difficult decision to retire. Bernard serves as the chief  administrative officer of the Senate, which is a position elected by  the members. For four decades, Bernard has been the cornerstone of the  Delaware Senate, involved in matters relating to budget, legislation,  and overall operations. His office maintains records of official Senate  transactions, handles the introduction and flow of legislation, sends  and receives legislative messages and executive communications,  compiles and posts agendas, records committee reports, rollcalls, and  the legislative journal. This is no small task for one person. Many  nights while serving as Delaware's Governor, I  [[Page S4399]]  recall leaving legislative hall and noticing that Bernard's car was  still parked in its regular spot and his office light would still be  on. It was not unusual for him to work well into the night to ensure  that all of that day's loose ends had been tied up and that the stage  was set for a smooth transition to the next legislative day.   During my 8 years as Governor, my staff and I were fortunate to work  with Bernard on many occasions, often seeking out his guidance and  wisdom regarding legislative issues or gubernatorial appointments.  Bernard readily made himself available to our team, generously offering  us the benefit of his historical knowledge.   Bernard is so ingrained in the daily workings of the Senate that most  people in legislative hall cannot imagine the senate chamber without  him. Bernard is invaluable for his insight and expertise on the  Delaware Legislature, but talk to anyone, and they will tell you that  Bernard is beloved because he has the patience of a saint and the heart  of a true servant, respected by Democrats and Republicans alike.   Today, we join Bernard's siblings, Geraldine, Mary Lou, Chip, Gerald,  and Philip, along with his many colleagues and friends, in honoring  Bernard for his dedication to the Delaware State Senate and the people  of Delaware. On behalf of Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa  Blunt Rochester, I wholeheartedly thank Bernard for his four decades of  service to Delaware. His model leadership and dedication to the order  and rules in the senate chamber are second to none. We offer our  sincere congratulations on a job well done and wish him many happy,  healthy, and successful years to come.                            ____________________
