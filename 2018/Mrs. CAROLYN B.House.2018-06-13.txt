 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his leadership, and for organizing this  and for reminding us of the leadership that the Republican Party took  under President Reagan for comprehensive immigration reform, which we  have all been calling for for years.  [[Page H5145]]    Today, I rise because I believe our country is in a moment of crisis.  This administration is turning its back on our ideals, our values, and  our history as a safe harbor and beacon of light for the world's  oppressed and threatened peoples.   President Trump's heartless policy of ripping apart families who are  coming to the United States seeking freedom from fear, from violence,  is cruel, inhumane, and blatantly un-American.   These families have traveled hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to  keep their children safe and away from the harm that awaits them at  home. No one takes that journey lightly. No one leaves behind the only  home they have known, their friends, their extended family, if they  have any other choice.   Yet, instead of accepting these refugees with compassion, this  administration is persecuting and prosecuting those fleeing danger,  taking babies from their mothers' and fathers' arms, causing great  trauma.   There is absolutely no justification for this policy. It is cruelty  for cruelty's sake. This is not who we are as a Nation.   It is why I have joined Ranking Member Cummings to demand an  Oversight and Government Reform hearing on this reckless policy, and  why I have signed on to a resolution condemning this horrific behavior  as the child abuse that it is, and why I am joining the Women's Caucus  next week at a shadow hearing, because we have requested a hearing from  the Republican majority, and they have not granted it, so we are having  our own hearing to explore this issue more.   The administration needs to immediately change course, and every  Member of Congress must hold it accountable for doing so.   These children, these families, and this country deserve so much  better.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my good friend, Representative Correa, for  hosting this Special Order, for his leadership, and for allowing me to  participate in this Special Order this evening.                                time  1800     MALONEY of New York:        H.R. 6098.
