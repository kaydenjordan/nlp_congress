 Mr. President, today, I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Dr. Doug Reisig of Missoula County as Montanan of the Month  for his distinguished career as an educator and for his devotion to  Montana students, Montana parents, and the community.   Doug was born and raised in Montana. He earned his master's degree  from the University of Montana and his Ph.D. from Montana State. Back  home in Montana, Cat-Griz bipartisanship is what Doug has in his  background. You see, Doug taught at Billings West High School before  accepting a job at the St. Ignatius School District. It was in St.  Ignatius that he met his lovely wife Mary Jo. Doug and Mary Jo have  been married for almost 43 years and have raised two wonderful  daughters, Megan and Callie. They are now the proud grandparents of  four grandsons.   Doug has been a teacher, building administrator, and superintendent  for 46 years, serving as superintendent at Hellgate Elementary for the  past 34 years. Prior to his retirement, he received the G.V. Erickson  Award from the School Administrators of Montana for his contribution to  education in our great State.   Since Doug took over as superintendent, the school has seen a 33- percent increase in enrollment. He also oversaw the construction of the  new middle school, and during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,  under Doug's leadership, Hellgate Elementary was a leader in delivering  meals to children in need and even went the extra mile by selflessly  donating his increase in salary to the Family Resource Fund. With  Doug's direction and precautions in place, both Hellgate Elementary and  Middle School were in session 5 days a week during the 2020 and 2021  school years.   It is my honor to recognize Dr. Doug Reisig for serving the State of  Montana as an educator and for his dedication to ensuring that Montana  students have a very bright future ahead.   Congratulations on your retirement, Doug. You truly make Montana  proud.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Cheryl Heser of Rosebud County for her passion for  education and her dedication to preserving American history as a living  history presenter for Montanans across the Treasure State.   Cheryl has served her community as an educator for many years  teaching high school English, Spanish, and journalism, and she managed  a K-12 school library. She is also a published author and served as the  director of the Rosebud County Library in Forsyth, MT, for 17 years.  Cheryl earned statewide recognition for her esteemed radio program and  was named the 2014 Librarian of the Year by the Montana Library  Association.

Cheryl travels to Montana communities to utilize her knack  for storytelling and skilled research to educate Montanans of all ages  and preserve American history by portraying the lives of historical  figures like Dolly Madison and Annie Oakley.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Cheryl Heser for her passion for  education and her work to preserve American history.
