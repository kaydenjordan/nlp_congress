 Madam Speaker, I stand to refute with a spirit of  joy this morning one of my friends on the other side who called this  day a ``black day.''   I wonder what that interpretation means, but I see a sense of great  future for America. And I wonder how many of the 3- and 4-year-olds in  the future will wind up in the Office of the President of the United  States because we in America and we as Democrats gave them an early  head start.   If any of my colleagues have ever visited childcare and pre-K and  seen the brightness of our children, they know that what Democrats are  doing today creates not a blackness but a brightness.   Today is going to be a bright day in America as Democrats govern and  lead and make a difference in this Nation and in this world. I am glad  to stand with the American people and families as we create for them a  very bright day.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  strong support of the rule governing debate, as well as the underlying  bill, which is the Build Back Better Act (RCP 117-18, H.R. 5376 ),  legislation making visionary and transformative investments to change  for the better the health, well-being, and financial security of  America's workers and families.   Madam Speaker, the federal budget is an expression of the nation's  values and the investments made to Build America Back Better are a  clear declaration of congressional Democrats' commitment to ensuring  that our government, our economy, and our systems work For The People.   Madam Speaker, these long-overdue investments in America's future  will be felt in every corner of the country and across every sector of  American life, building on the success of the American Rescue Plan,  accommodating historic infrastructure investments in the legislative  pipeline, and addressing longstanding deficits in our communities by  ending an era of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our  current crises a stronger, more equitable nation.   The Build Back Better Act makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Act is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: No American making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Act will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth.   During general debate, I will discuss in greater detail all of the  salutary aspects of the Build Back Better Act, but today I will confine  my remarks to discuss how the legislation holds substantial benefits  for my home state of Texas.   The Build Back Better Act will bring down costs that have held back  families in Texas for decades by cutting taxes and making child care,  home care, education, health care, and housing more affordable.   These investments will provide new learning opportunities for  children, help parents and especially working parents make ends meet,  and position the economy for stronger growth for years to come.   The Build Back Better Act will create good-paying jobs for residents  of Texas, combating climate change, giving our kids cleaner air and  water, and making America the leader in global innovation and 21st  century manufacturing.   Specifically, Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act delivers the  largest investment  [[Page H6229]]  in child care and early education in history by providing access to  affordable child care.   Child care is a major strain for families in Texas, where the average  annual cost of a child care center for a toddler is $9,428, meaning  that a Texas family with two young children would on average spend 21  percent of their income on child care for one year.   The lack of affordable options also makes it difficult for parents,  and especially mothers, to remain in their jobs, contributing to the  26.1 percent gender gap in workforce participation between mothers and  fathers in Texas.   The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas to provide access to  child care for 2,011,503 young children (ages 0-5) per year from  families earning under 2.5 times the Texas median income (about  $205,204 for a family of 4), and ensure these families pay no more than  7 percent of their income on high-quality child care.   The Build Back Better Act will provide universal, high-quality, free  preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old in America.   In contrast, today, only 24 percent of the 775,102 3- and 4-year-olds  in Texas have access to publicly-funded preschool, and it costs about  $8,600 per year for those who cannot access a publicly-funded program.   The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas to expand access to free,  high-quality preschool to more than 588,286 additional 3- and 4-year- olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who  are already enrolled.   Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting  of their choice--from public schools to child care providers to Head  Start--leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents  to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Texas's  future economic competitiveness.   The Build Back Better Act cuts taxes and reduces some of the largest  expenses for workers and families, like education, health care, and  housing.   Madam Speaker, the average cost of a 2-year degree in Texas is $2,885  per year, and $11,096 per year for a 4-year degree, straining many  student budgets.   To help unlock the opportunities of an education beyond high school,  the Build Back Better Act will increase maximum Pell Grant awards by  $550 for students at public and private non-profit institutions,  supporting the 486,377 students in Texas who rely on Pell grants.   The Build Back Better Act will also invest in Texas's 112 minority- serving institutions and the students they serve, including  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges  and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs).   Madam Speaker, of the world's biggest economies, the United States is  second to last in investing in workforce development, and funding for  federal job training programs has dropped by almost half since 2001.   The Build Back Better Act invests in training programs that will  prepare Texas's workers for high-quality jobs in fast-growing sectors  like public health, child care, manufacturing, IT, and clean energy.  Fifty-nine public community colleges in Texas will have the opportunity  to benefit from grants to develop and deliver innovative training  programs and expand proven ones.   Madam Speaker, 18 percent of children in Texas live in food insecure  households, harming their long-term health and ability to succeed in  school.   The Build Back Better Act will ensure that the nutritional needs of  Texas's children are met by expanding access to free school meals to an  additional 1,642,000 students during the school year and providing  3,631,226 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.   When it comes to housing costs, more than 1.7 million renters in  Texas are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30 percent of  their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many  families.   The Build Back Better Act expands rental assistance for Texas  renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing  through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million  affordable housing units nationwide.   The Build Back Better Act addresses the capital needs of the entire  public housing stock in America, and it includes one of the largest  investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first- generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.   Madam Speaker, access to affordable quality health care should be a  right, not a privilege, and residents of Texas facing illness should  never have to worry about how they are going to pay for treatment.   The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap to  help millions of Americans gain health insurance, extend through 2025  the American Rescue Plan's health insurance premium reductions for  those who buy coverage on their own, and help older Americans access  affordable hearing care by expanding Medicare.   In Texas, that means 1,554,000 uninsured people will gain coverage,  including the 771,000 who fell into the Medicaid coverage gap, and  1,066,400 will on average save hundreds of dollars per year.   In addition, the Build Back Better Act will support maternal health  and invest in national preparedness for future pandemics.   Finally, the Build Back Better Act will expand access to home- and  community-based care to more of Texas's senior citizens and disabled  citizens and improve the quality and wages of caregiving jobs.   Prior to the pandemic, 15 percent of children under the age of 18 in  Texas lived in poverty.   The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur  economic growth in Texas by reducing taxes on the middle class and  those striving to break into it.   Specifically, the Build Back Better Act extends Child Tax Credit  (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child  ages 6 to 17, which will continue the largest one-year reduction in  child poverty in history.   And critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for  the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue  to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run.   The Build Back Better Act will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500  in tax cuts for more than 1.5 million low-wage workers in Texas by  extending the American Rescue Plan's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  expansion.   From 2010 to 2020, Texas experienced 67 extreme weather events,  costing up to $200 billion in damages.   The Build Back Better Act will set the United States on course to  meet its climate targets--a 50-52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions below 2005 levels by 2030--in a way that creates good-paying  union jobs, grows domestic industries, and advances environmental  justice.   The Build Back Better Act represents the largest ever single  investment in a clean energy economy--across buildings, transportation,  industry, electricity, agriculture, and climate smart practices in our  lands and waters.   And the Build Back Better Act will create a new Civilian Climate  Corps that will enlist a diverse generation of Texans in conserving our  public lands, bolstering community resilience, and addressing the  changing climate, all while putting good-paying union jobs within  reach.   In clean energy and in other sectors, the Build Back Better Act will  also strengthen domestic manufacturing and supply chains for critical  goods, benefiting American businesses, workers, consumers, and  communities.   To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, we have before us a once  in a century opportunity to make gigantic progress in making ours a  more perfect union, and to do it in a single bound with enactment of  the Build Back Better Act, the most transformative legislation passed  by this Congress since the Great Society and the New Deal.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting for the rule  and voting to pass H.R. 5376, the transformative, life-changing Build  Back Better Act.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 774         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3.

Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5854.                                 H.R. 5854         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
