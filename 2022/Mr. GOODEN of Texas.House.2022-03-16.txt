 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous  question so we can immediately consider legislation to force President  Biden to restore our energy independence.   The United States was the largest producer of oil and gas in the  world under President Trump. In less than a year, President Biden has  destroyed our energy sector, created the highest gas prices in American  history, and crippled our economy in the process.   There is no logic to this administration's refusal to unleash our  full energy potential. It is time to ask if this administration is  holding the reins of power, or if radical environmentalist groups are  calling the shots at the White House.   For 2 years, I have been demanding an investigation into foreign  funding of these environmental organizations. Vladimir Putin has a long  history of spreading misinformation and using activist groups to deter  domestic energy production. In just 10 years, the European Union went  from producing more natural gas than Russia to relying on them for 40  percent of their natural gas consumption. Russian dark money is to  blame, and we have to prevent the same thing from happening here at  home.   Russia will use every tool at their disposal to undermine our  national security. And by listening to these radical groups, the Biden  administration has allowed them to succeed.   Madam Speaker, we are relying on foreign adversaries and  authoritarian regimes when we have the resources here at home to bring  down gas prices and help our allies in Europe. Instead of calling  Venezuela and Iran, the President should be calling Texas.
