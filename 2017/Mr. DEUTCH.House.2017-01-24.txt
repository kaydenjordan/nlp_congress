 Madam Speaker, it doesn't take a law degree. It doesn't  take imagination. All it takes is common sense to see that President  Trump's ownership and his family's operation of hotels and golf courses  and rental properties is ripe for corruption.   President Trump's failure to completely divest his ownership interest  not only violates tradition followed by every other modern President,  it is unconstitutional. The Constitution prohibits any U.S. official-- including President Trump--from taking payments from foreign  governments.   His ongoing involvement in The Trump Organization will let foreign  governments funnel payments to his businesses. Foreign operatives will  try to curry favor with the administration with no accountability to  the American people.   When he took the oath of office last week, President Trump swore to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Sadly, his refusal to cut his business ties has broken that vow in  these very first days of his administration.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on Saturday, I proudly stood shoulder to  shoulder with thousands of strong women and their allies in south  Florida. It was one of hundreds of demonstrations across the country  and the globe, millions of people in the streets sending a loud message  that rang out all across the world.   But the GOP majority has chosen to ignore the calls for women to be  able to control their own bodies and their own health care. This bill  says to American women: your bodies, Washington's rules.   The majority uses talking points about getting Washington out of  health care when they are fighting to kick 32 million people off their  insurance, but when it comes to women's bodies, House Republicans are  happy to step between a woman and her doctor.   As a man, I have never had to drive across State lines to find a  doctor. I have never had my doctor silenced about a medical procedure.  As a man, I have never had to endure an invasive and unnecessary  procedure to satisfy someone else's twisted political desires. These  experiences are all too common for women in America today.   While I and my male colleagues in Congress get to have an open and  honest relationship with our doctors, this bill will deepen the ugly  fight against women's control of their own bodies. Reproductive rights  are women's rights and must be respected. Show that respect by voting  ``no'' on H.R. 7.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the fad,  apparently, this week, is the idea of alternative facts. In other  words, if politicians don't like the facts that they have been given or  the reality of the situation, then what we should do is we should just  come up with new facts; and apparently, the facts in this bill are  that, apparently, the other side is worried about taxpayer funding for  abortions.   As we have said repeatedly, we don't like this on this side of the  aisle, but right now, because of the annual Hyde amendment, there is no  taxpayer funding for abortion. We aim to change that because it is  probably the most regressive legislation that we have for women's  health.                                time  1530    It says that rich women can get the full range of healthcare services  they need, including abortion; but poor women, the women least equipped  to be able to raise unwanted children, and certainly not with help from  this Congress, are the ones who cannot get those services that they  needed.   So I just want to say one more time because I keep hearing the  alternative facts over and over, there are right now no taxpayer  funding for abortions, something that we need to fix. But this bill  takes us the opposite direction. What this bill does is it codifies the  Hyde amendment in statute once and for all, and that would bar low- income women from receiving these much-needed services. It codifies the  D.C. abortion ban, which would rob the D.C. City Council of giving the  healthcare services D.C. women need, even with D.C. tax revenues. It  codifies the Helms amendment, which is the same thing as the Hyde  amendment for international programs. And perhaps the biggest ban here  is it restricts people's ability to buy insurance policies on the  healthcare exchanges with their own money that will cover abortion.   I heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle over and  over again that there are a thousand policies. The lady from South  Dakota said that government dollars were supporting abortive  procedures. That is just simply not the case. There is no Federal money  in the exchanges paying for abortive procedures.   What this bill does is it greatly expands restrictions on women's  ability with their own money to buy insurance policies with legal  healthcare coverage that they feel that they need. And it says that if  you get a subsidy, then you can't get a policy with your own money.  That is a vast expansion, and it is well beyond the pale.   It is also, by the way, beyond what the American public says. Because  the American public, by 86 percent, says that if you are poor, then  politicians should not put their personal views on you and you should  be able to get the healthcare coverage that you need. We saw this with  the millions of American women and men in Washington and around the  country who marched this last weekend. But we see it in the polling.  People say, if you are poor, you should be able to get the healthcare  coverage you need, not what some politician in Washington tells you.   I have an idea. Every year, around the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and  the time that the protestors come to Washington, I don't think that we  should debate this futile exercise year after year. I think we should  come together across the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, to figure  out how we can prevent unwanted pregnancies.   I am getting ready to introduce a bill. I would urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle, including the Republican side, to cosponsor  this bill. This bill will expand contraception and family planning  services and long-range contraception for all American women so that we  can prevent unwanted pregnancies.   In Colorado, we have a program that is called LARC. And what it is is  a program where the State helps teen and young women get long-acting  contraception so they can prevent unwanted pregnancies. And here is  what happened in Colorado when we enacted this very robust and helpful  program. According to the data from the Colorado Department of Public  Health and Environment, both the birth rate and abortion rate for women  ages 15 to 19 fell 48 percent from 2009 to 2014 because of long-acting  contraception, and the same was true for women of the next age group  up.   We can do this. We can do this together. Let's start talking about a  way to improve women's health instead of to restrict their choices.  Vote ``no'' on this ill-conceived bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, I will vote No on Roll  Call No. 65, on H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.   Today, just two days after the 44th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade  Supreme Court ruling that protects the rights of women to control their  own bodies, House Republicans have once again taken up a vote attacking  the constitutionally-protected reproductive rights of women all across  the nation.   As if this past weekend's Women's March on Washington (which was far  more attended than President Trump's own inauguration) didn't signal  anything to our elected leaders, President Trump took the GOP's war on  women's rights and health a step further by signing an executive order  reinstating the `global gag rule' and blocking foreign aid for  international non-governmental organizations that provide basic  reproductive health services globally. This decision not only increases  abortion rates, it will cause more maternal complications, injuries,  and unintended pregnancies and provide less information on HIV/AIDS  prevention and treatment programs worldwide.   Republicans continue their shameful, radical assault on women's  reproductive health with today's vote on H.R. 7, a discriminatory bill  that among other things would prohibit the use of federal funds to pay  for any abortion services. Despite the fact that current law already  requires that federal funds not be spent on abortions, this bill would  prohibit individuals and small businesses from claiming tax credits for  any private insurance plans obtained through the ACA Marketplace that  include abortion coverage. Families buying their insurance in the  Marketplace would also be ineligible to receive a premium tax credits  if they enrolled in a health plan that covers abortion, likely  resulting in no abortion coverage policies being offered in the  Marketplaces. Furthermore, it undermines the District of Columbia's  home rule, which allows D.C. to use its own Medicaid funds to offer  abortion services. This is despite the fact that 17 states, including  California, are currently allowed to do so.   Women should be able to make their own decisions about reproductive  health care with dignity and respect, without the interference of  politicians or their employers. We should not be in the business of  telling women what they can and cannot do with their own bodies.  Today's vote is just another step forward in the  [[Page H645]]  Republican party's plan to Make America Sick Again and take away the  comprehensive care women deserve.   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  rule. This is about a woman's fundamental right to make her own family  planning decisions. The courts have spoken: Roe v. Wade is settled law,  and a majority of Americans support it. But the Majority would rather  roll back the clock by decades, forcing women back into a reality when  women could not make their own health care decisions, by restricting  insurance coverage. Enough is enough.   We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family,  every American to make their own family planning decisions, and to have  access to a full range of healthcare services.   What we are facing now is not just an attack on the right to  abortion. It is not just an attack on women's health. It is an assault  on the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans. On Saturday,  millions of people across the country marched in support of an agenda  that puts women's health decisions in the hands of women and their  families--and that ensures safe and affordable access to women's  healthcare. This bill flies in the face of the mandate demonstrated  this weekend, and I oppose it.
