 Mr. Speaker, I stand before you this morning to address the  strife I injected into the already-contentious Congress.   I have worked with many Members in this Chamber over the past four  terms, Members on both sides of the aisle,--and each of you know that I  am a man of my word. So let me take a moment to address this body.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to apologize for the abrupt manner of the  conversation I had with my colleague from New York. It is true that we  disagree on policies and visions for America, but that does not mean we  should be disrespectful.   Having been married for 45 years, with two daughters, I am very  cognizant of my language. The offensive name-calling words attributed  to me by the press were never spoken to my colleagues, and if they were  construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding.   As my colleagues know, I am passionate about those affected by  poverty. My wife, Carolyn, and I started out together at the age of 19  with nothing. We did odd jobs, and we were on food stamps. I know the  face of poverty, and for a time, it was mine. That is why I know people  in this country can still, with all its faults, rise up and succeed and  not be encouraged to break the law.   I will commit to each of you that I will conduct myself from a place  of passion and understanding that policy and political disagreement be  vigorously debated with the knowledge that we approach the problems  facing our Nation with the betterment of the country in mind and the  people we serve.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God,  my family, and my country.                            ____________________
