 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support tonight's vote, a vote on the  Bipartisan Budget Act.   There are three aspects of this bill, a bill that will avoid default  and a bill that protects Social Security and Medicare that I hope my  colleagues and fellow citizens take into account. One, we can't keep  doing this. The brinkmanship around this question of default and paying  our bills has to end. It is a terrible process.   Folks have been calling our offices. They are worried about their  Social Security checks. They are worried about their healthcare. They  are worried about whether or not the economy will crash. We cannot keep  normalizing this behavior.   Two, the bill does represent the fact that Congress is divided. The  President negotiated with Speaker McCarthy, and even though a majority  of Americans want Congress to balance this budget by fixing the tax  code, the majority has said----    Mr. Speaker, the majority has said that is off the  table. What I needed to see from this bill was that no veterans would  lose their benefits and folks would continue to receive Social Security  checks and no child would lose access to food through the SNAP program.   This bill does that, so I am voting ``yes.'' We need more bipartisan,  pragmatic leaders to stand up and pass this bill tonight and to  continue to work on behalf of the American people.
