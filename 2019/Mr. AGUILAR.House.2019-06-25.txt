 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.   With the approach of the 2020 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau needs a  strong infusion of resources to ensure a thorough and accurate count.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, my colleague knows that  the funding level provided for the Census Bureau in this bill is more  in line with recent revised budget costs and estimates. This bill also  supports critical funding of the Bureau as it embarks on the most  technologically advanced Census in its history, including $1 billion in  infrastructure that includes IT funding to enhance the Bureau's  cybersecurity efforts and protect respondents' personal data and  information submitted to the Bureau. Every dollar can be tied to an  original plan, a cost estimate, or a recommendation submitted by the  department.   There appears to be a growing attack on the Census out of fear of a  demographically changing country and a concerning effort by the other  side to skew the results in their favor.   We need every dollar in this Census because the administration is  fear-mongering, because they are trying to force an undercount with the  inclusion of the citizenship question, and, in reality, we are  recommending a funding level consistent with what they indicated they  need for a fair and accurate count.   Any proposal to decrease this amount increases the risk of  undercounts of minority and hard-to-count communities, including rural  parts of this country that lack broadband services.                                time  1430    Such an undercount would cause these areas to lose out on political  representation and Federal funding.   Reduced funding for the Census also increases the risk of cyber  intrusions and the release of protected personal data.   This bill already provides a strong increase for immigration judges,  as the gentleman mentioned, consistent with the administration's  request, an increase of over $110 million over the fiscal year 2019  level that provides for an additional 100 judge teams, which my  colleague acknowledged in his remarks.   I am not aware of a Census slush fund, but I am aware that these are  vital resources that will help count our communities, help ensure that  this is done fairly, and help ensure that hard-to-count communities are  counted.   The Justice Department is not able to hire any faster than that, as  the gentleman acknowledged.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this motion. I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
