 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I want to commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) and  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos) for coming together to work  in a bipartisan manner to address a problem that affects not just  Illinois, but affects, I think, all 50 States. It is an issue where we  have watched FEMA, in many cases, make decisions that appear to be  arbitrary in terms of declaring a disaster in some areas, not in  others.   What this legislation does, very simply, is it requires that FEMA  take into consideration the true localized impacts of a disaster. And  in line with what the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) noted  earlier, we did an amendment in the committee that also looked at, or  required, FEMA to consider multiple impacts in an area.   I am from south Louisiana. In the last several months, we have had  police shootings, we have had one of the most costly floods in U.S.  history, we have had tornadoes, and we have had another flood in north  Louisiana. In fact, there were two floods, as I recall. One of them was  a 500-year flood, and the second was a 1,000-year flood. It makes me  question how old I am sometimes.   But what this does is it requires that FEMA look at localized  impacts, and that they take into consideration the cumulative impacts  of various disasters and incidents in an area. FEMA is not there and  the Federal Government is not there to take care of every problem and  every disaster that States and municipalities have.   But in many cases that we have seen historically, they have missed  opportunities. I think we have seen incredible burdens borne by local  governments, and they have had disasters that far exceeded their  capabilities.   I want to, again, commend the gentleman and gentlewoman from Illinois  for offering this commonsense legislation, and I urge all Members to  support the bill.  [[Page H3022]]         Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  subcommittee chairman and ranking member for their assistance, and I  also want to thank our lead cosponsor, Mr. Sires of New Jersey.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is an unfortunate situation, that  Congress actually has to step in. I want to give you a little bit of  background.   In August of last year, we had once again what was known as the  fourth most costly flood disaster in U.S. history. We had areas of  south Louisiana that actually experienced over 32 inches of rain within  about a 36-hour period. By comparison, the average American, as I  recall, receives somewhere between 26 and 28 inches of rain in a year,  and we received that in approximately 36 hours--an extraordinary  rainfall event.   As you can imagine, in a 1,000-year flood event, you had thousands  and thousands of people that were flooded, people living well outside  of the floodplain. So, yes, there were thousands of people that were  seeking assistance, trying to do everything from buy clothes to buy  food, essential needs.   We assisted thousands of constituents trying to get information and  answers from FEMA, but the way that  [[Page H3023]]  the process worked is that you had to call an 800 number. If someone  answered, they would log on a computer system and update the  constituent on what their status is: if they received the application,  if additional information was needed, if they were approved or denied.   I, myself, on many occasions called the 800 number just to see how  long it would take to get through. In some cases no one would answer.  In other cases, the questions couldn't be answered.   It is a very simple situation here, Mr. Speaker. This bill simply  requires that FEMA establish an online database that citizens of this  country can access directly. I can go right now and I can look at hotel  reservations; I can look at airline reservations, train reservations.  You can do virtually anything online. You can pay your utility bills.  You can call an Uber. But with FEMA, they had thousands of employees  that were there to answer phones to simply log on to the system.   There is no need for that step to be there. It is more efficient to  get people direct access. I would rather see those FEMA employees  helping us recover.   So I will say it again. I am disappointed that this takes an act of  Congress. This is common sense, and you are seeing this type of  innovation and utilization of technology happen all across the  marketplace. Unfortunately, Congress has to intervene here, albeit in a  bipartisan way, to make sure that Americans are getting the service  that they deserve and to make sure that our taxpayer dollars are being  used in an efficient way.   Once again, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Barletta,  Ranking Member Johnson, and I want to especially thank the lead  cosponsor on this legislation, Mr. Sires of New Jersey, who I know has  gone through extraordinary challenges in New Jersey with the 2012  Hurricane Sandy impacts on his State.
