 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there is a lot of work to get done in  this Chamber today and for the rest of the week, and Democrats are  committed to working with the other side in good faith to get them  done.   First, we need to fund the government before the December 3 deadline.  On that front, negotiations continue on a bipartisan, bicameral basis,  and we are making good progress toward passing a funding measure.   When a CR reaches the Senate, Democrats are going to support it and  work to pass it as quickly as possible.   Our Republican colleagues, meanwhile, can either work with us to move  the process quickly through the Chamber or they can engage in  obstructive tactics that will make a government shutdown almost a  certainty.   Sadly, this second option seems to be the path that a few on the  other side are choosing, and I hope they see the light quickly and not  cause a needless Republican government shutdown.   If every Member of this Chamber used the threat of a shutdown to  secure concessions on their own interests, that would lead to chaos for  the millions and millions of Americans who rely on a functioning  government.   So I urge those Republicans who are thinking of poisoning this entire  process for their own items to take a step back. There are other arenas  and opportunities to have a debate. In the meantime, we have a  responsibility--a responsibility--to fund the government  [[Page S8840]]  so it can fulfill its basic duties to serve the American people.   And we have a responsibility to support our troops, support their  families, and keep Americans safe by passing our annual Defense bill.  On that front, we also need bipartisan cooperation.                                  H.R. 4350    Last night, both parties ran a hotline in order to reach consent on  holding floor votes on 21 amendments to the NDAA. This is even more  amendments than Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe offered a few  weeks ago.   To put this proposal in historical context: In the first year under  President Trump, the Senate held votes on 22 amendments on all  legislation.   Not only that, our latest vote includes votes on the items Senator  McConnell said just yesterday were ``the only reason that [Republicans]  pushed the pause button on this bill.''   Well, it is time for Republicans to hit the play button. Democrats  have been exceedingly reasonable by offering robust amendments with  ample input from the other side of the aisle.   Again, let me repeat, we have more amendments on the floor that we  have offered on this NDAA bill than the total amount of amendments for  4 years under Leader McConnell on the NDAA bill--more here now.   People say we are moving too quickly. You know what we did on those  bills? We sat on the floor for days without doing anything. We sat on  the floor the last few weeks getting nominations through, even as  difficult as some others are making it. So to sit on the floor and do  nothing and then only do three amendments over 2 weeks didn't make  sense.   Here we have 19 amendments--21 amendments that we are willing to do-- again, to repeat, more than all the total amendments on the four NDAA  bills that passed in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, when McConnell was  leader and Donald Trump was President.   So let us get to the voting today. Let the Republicans hit the play  button. Democrats have been exceedingly reasonable by offering robust  process with ample input from the other side. Democrats want to get  this done. I know many on the other side want to get this done as well.  That is good, and we will keep working until we have a deal to move  forward.                            Nomination of Dale Ho    Mr. President, now on Dale Ho, earlier today, I had the honor to come  before the Senate Judiciary Committee to introduce a remarkable  candidate to sit on the Federal bench: Dale Ho, who I proudly  recommended to President Biden as a nominee to the district court of  the Southern District of New York.   Mr. Ho is a graduate of Princeton, Yale Law School, and clerked for  two judges, including in the same district court for which he has now  been nominated. But it is his experience at the NAACP Legal Defense  Fund and at the ACLU, where he currently serves as Director of Voting  Rights, where Mr. Ho has set himself apart as one of the best election  and voting rights lawyers in America.   He has argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In one, he  challenged the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the population  count used to apportion the House of Representatives. In the other,  which made the front pages of most newspapers in America, he  successfully challenged the inclusion of a citizenship question on the  2020 census.   And beyond his cases before the Supreme Court, he also led the  successful challenge of a Kansas law requiring people to show a birth  certificate or passport when registering to vote.   As voting rights come under assault across the country, it is only  fitting that we elevate one of the country's top voting rights experts  to sit on the bench to safeguard our democracy and preserve our most  fundamental right as U.S. citizens.   Voting rights is in jeopardy. There could be no finer person on the  bench than Dale Ho, one of the great experts in America at both  understanding and litigating voting rights for the people. If  confirmed, I have no doubt he will make an excellent Federal judge, and  I am proud to support his nomination.                    White House Menorah Lighting Ceremony    Mr. President, now on a different matter, this evening, it will be my  honor to join the President, Vice President, First Lady, and especially  our Second Gentleman for the annual White House menorah lighting  ceremony.   This year, Hanukkah comes at a poignant moment not just for our  country but for myself as well. I will be proud to participate at the  White House as the first Jewish majority leader in history. I will join  bearing in mind the passing of my wonderful father. And across America,  we observe Hanukkah after a year and a half marked by both loss and  then renewal.   This season is a reminder that, in the face of awful adversity, we  cannot lose faith in God's providence. In the face of darkness,  Hanukkah teaches that, rather than curse the darkness, we must light a  candle.   In the story of Hanukkah, the Maccabees triumphed after facing  enormous adversity. This year, we take heart from the lesson of that  story. We, too, shall triumph over the challenges our country faces  today.   So as we observe the fourth night of Hanukkah, I want to wish my  colleagues and the American people a happy Hanukkah, and I look forward  to joining the White House for tonight's candle-lighting event.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, so let me inform the Members and the  public as to what has happened here, which is just a sad, tragic, and  almost absurd point.   Now, last week, we in the majority offered to have an open process,  and we agreed to 18 amendments--more amendments than has been done on  the Defense Act under 4 years of Leader McConnell's leadership. They  objected--seven Members objected.   So when we came back this week, we worked all week to try and come to  an agreement. Now we were up to 25 amendments. And the leader, Mr.  Inhofe, and Senator Reed, who has done a great job, came to an  agreement to go forward, which we thought we might do. But one Senator,  the Senator from Florida, stood in the way of us moving forward.   The Senate rules--some may call them absurd by now--allow any one  Senator to block us from moving forward. And the Senator from Florida  insisted on his amendment.   The irony, the sort of absurdity, and the sadness of this is, if his  amendment were on the bill, it would automatically kill the bill  because it would be what is called blue slipped in the House, which  means any bill that produces revenue must start in the House, and the  House will kill a bill that has an amendment that contains it.   So Senator Rubio prevented these 30 amendments from being voted on,  the Senate from moving forward on the Armed Services bill, because he  insisted that we add his amendment, which was a killer amendment, which  would kill the bill altogether.  [[Page S8859]]    Can you get more absurd than this?   It makes no sense--no sense whatsoever.   I would ask Marco Rubio to sleep on this overnight, Senator Rubio.   His bill, which already passed the Senate separately, will not  accomplish what he wants because it will just blow up the entire bill-- the entire Defense Authorization Act.   But, instead, he came to the floor and objected when both Democratic  and Republican leaders said we want to move forward, and so we can't  move forward. This will be the first time that an NDAA bill has not  moved forward, and it all falls on the shoulders of one Senator, Marco  Rubio.   Now, I would hope my Republican colleagues who are listening to this,  who have things in the bill they want, would go to Senator Rubio and  ask him to back off so tomorrow morning we might get started. But the  odds of that are slim. The odds of that are slim.   I must say, Leader McConnell, Senator Inhofe, the ranking member, as  well as Jack Reed, and myself have worked hard together to accommodate  Senators whenever we can, and that is why we had a list of 25  amendments. That is why we were prepared to sit here in 15-minute  intervals and churn through those amendments.   But the Rubio amendment is a poison pill in the sense that it blows  up the whole bill. Any one Member of the House can say, ``I object to  the bill,'' and, of course, one would, and that would be it.   So how does it help move forward on the NDAA bill? How does it even  help Senator Rubio's goals with the Uighurs by insisting on preventing  anything from moving forward unless his proposal gets in the bill,  which would destroy the bill?   That is the absurd place we are in tonight. It is regrettable. It is  sad. It undoes the work of so many Senators on both sides of the aisle,  and it speaks to the need to restore the Senate and change these rules.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Madam President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, December 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4350, the  National Defense Authorization Act.    For the information of all Senators, we expect a  rollcall vote at approximately 12 noon tomorrow on the confirmation of  the Nelson nomination.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:46 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, December 2, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
