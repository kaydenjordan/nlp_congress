 Mr. Speaker, last Friday marked the 47th Annual March  for Life, and for the first time in history, the march was attended by  a sitting President.   Since 2017, the Trump administration has established more conscience  protections than ever before, but there is still more work to  accomplish.   For example, the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, which simply  requires healthcare professionals to provide medical care to babies  born alive during an attempted abortion, has support from nearly 200  bipartisan cosponsors. Yet, despite numerous calls requesting to bring  this legislation to the floor, my colleagues and I have been rejected  time after time. It is a sad reality that we have to ask our Democratic  colleagues to help us end infanticide, but it is a fight we will  continue until innocent lives are protected.   Fighting for life also means fighting for individuals who are victims  of sexual abuse, rape, incest, and human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, that  is why I introduced legislation to codify the new Title X abuse  reporting rules, to ensure these victims are protected.   I hope to see these commonsense ideas signed into law and the lives  of the unborn protected.                            ____________________
