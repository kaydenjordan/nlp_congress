 Madam Speaker, today I want to show my appreciation for  the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post of Bridgeton in south Jersey. This  community provides a space for veterans to come together and connect  with others, and these are other folks who understand the hardships and  the rewards of serving our Nation.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars meet monthly to share their experiences  and bond with one another in Bridgeton. They also organize special  services for holidays, like Memorial Day and Veterans Day, so the  members can commemorate these days together.   In addition, the VFW reaches out to the greater Bridgeton community  by hosting barbecues, community dinners, and other festivals to connect  with their neighbors and sometimes raise funds for important charitable  causes.   I would like to thank the brave veterans of the Bridgeton VFW. Their  service to our Nation is tremendous. I am overjoyed that this community  has given them a safe place to remember their service together.   Madam Speaker, they are our best; they are our shining stars; and  they are our heroes.   May God bless them.                            ____________________
