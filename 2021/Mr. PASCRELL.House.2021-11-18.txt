 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman on his  efforts in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, last November the American people put Democrats in  charge to raise this Nation from its knees, to improve the lives of  working men and women, to confront powerful interests, and to rebuild  for the next century. New Jersey taxpayers sent us to provide real  relief from the odious SALT cap.   Don't pick out two or three districts in the country. Look at the  whole situation, and then decide about this low-hanging fruit that you  took to pay for your disaster in 2017.   This legislation is a blueprint for America to build back better.   And what was your answer?   We got back the next week to vote on the other bill, and you voted to  adjourn. You want to go home. You don't want to vote on any of those  things. You did it. Facts matter. Dispute it.   Only one party is making raising children affordable.   Only one party is creating a green future that aids unions and  supports domestic manufacturing.   Only one party will close the tax gap and provide tax fairness for  working Americans.   The American people elected Democrats to act with urgency for the  present and the future, Mr. Speaker.
