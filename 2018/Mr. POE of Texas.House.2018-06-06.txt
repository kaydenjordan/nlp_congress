 Mr. Speaker, in the cold, damp, dark rain of  morning, thousands of young American soldiers sailed across the  treacherous English Channel. The day was June 6, 1944; their  destination, Normandy, France; the mission, not conquest, but  liberation of Europe.   Operation Overlord, or D-Day, called for a massive ally invasion of  the continent during World War II. Securing the brutal Omaha and Utah  beachheads inch by bloody inch, our boys finally declared victory,  forcing Hitler to begin his long retreat into oblivion.   That victory did not come without cost, however. Today, 9,387 white  crosses and Stars of David overlook the silent beaches of Normandy,  marking  [[Page H4784]]  the final resting place of America's war dead.   The soldiers buried there were part of the Greatest Generation, young  men from every State and territory in the United States.   We remember them, our warriors, those that were killed, those that  returned, and those that returned with the wounds of war, because, Mr.  Speaker, the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
