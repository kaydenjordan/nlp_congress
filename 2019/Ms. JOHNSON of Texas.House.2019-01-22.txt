 Mr. Speaker, many of the members who serve in  this chamber, myself included, value the important relationship the  United States shares with Taiwan. To this end, The House of  Representatives unanimously passed legislation in the 115th Congress  similar to the bill that is being debated today. Both bills direct the  Secretary of State to develop a strategy to assist Taiwan in regaining  observer status at the World Health Organization.   As a cosponsor of H.R. 3320 in the 115th Congress, I commend the  gentleman from the great state of Florida for bringing this bill to the  floor early in this Congress. Taiwan has been a model member of the  global health community, having served as an observer in the World  Health Assembly from 2009 until 2016. Taiwan has also contributed in  enhancing regional and global disease prevention networks, along with  working with other countries to ensure the World Health Organization's  vision of health being a fundamental human right is successfully met.   While some outside actors try to prevent Taiwan from contributing to  the global health community as an observer at the World Health  Organization, it is important for all of us to realize that the best  way to address the challenges of today and tomorrow with regards to  global health is to work together, rather than exclude parties due to  geopolitics. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  353.
