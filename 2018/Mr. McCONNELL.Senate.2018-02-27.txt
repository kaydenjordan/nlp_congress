 Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm  another fine candidate to serve on the Federal bench.   Yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance the nomination of Judge  Elizabeth Branch for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge  Branch has sat on the Georgia Court of Appeals since 2012. This follows  a fine career that spanned both private practice and public service.   Judge Branch has previously answered the call to serve at the  Department of Homeland Security, where she worked as associate general  counsel, and then at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  Her record and qualifications are well known.   Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination  favorably by an overwhelming vote. Confirming this worthy nominee will  be a further credit to the outstanding work of Chairman Grassley and  the members of the committee.   I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm  Elizabeth Branch today. Let's continue to fulfill our constitutional  responsibility and confirm the President's outstanding judicial  nominees.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand appointments were made  during the adjournment of the Senate. I ask they be stated for the  Record.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 415, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 416, submitted  earlier today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 35, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.  [[Page S1255]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postcloture time on  the Vought nomination expire at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow, February 28, and  the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination with no intervening  action or debate; finally, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12:45 p.m.,  Wednesday, February 28; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask  that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the Vought nomination; finally, that all  time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks  count postcloture on the Vought nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:26 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 12:45 p.m.                            ____________________
