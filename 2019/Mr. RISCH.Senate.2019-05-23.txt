POLICY JUSTIFICATION                    Canada--MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes         The Government of Canada has requested to buy four hundred       twenty-five (425) MK 54 lightweight torpedo conversion kits.       Also included are torpedo containers, Recoverable Exercise       Torpedoes (REXTORP) with containers, Fleet Exercise Section       (FES) and fuel tanks, air launch accessories for fixed wing,       torpedo spare parts, training, publications, support and test       equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support services, and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $387 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the military capability of Canada, a NATO ally       that is an important force for ensuring political stability       and economic progress and a  [[Page S3096]]       contributor to military, peacekeeping and humanitarian       operations around the world.        Canada intends to upgrade its current inventory of MK 46       torpedoes to the MK 54 with the purchase of these kits. The       MK 54 torpedo is designed to be easily upgraded from the       existing MK 46 torpedo. Canada plans to utilize MK 54       Lightweight Torpedoes on its Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax       class ships, the Royal Canadian Air Force's CP-140 Aurora       Aircraft, and the CH-148 Maritime Helicopters. Canada will       have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor for the MK 54 Torpedo is Raytheon       Integrated Defense Systems, Portsmouth, Rhode Island. The       Government of Canada is expected to negotiate an offset       agreement with Raytheon, in accordance with Canada's       Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy, before       signing the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA).        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Canada. However, it is anticipated that       engineering and technical support services provided by the       U.S. Government may be required on an interim basis for       training and technical assistance.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-32       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional torpedo that can be       launched from surface ships, and rotary and fixed wing       aircraft. The MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo. The       upgrade to the MK 54 entails replacement of the torpedo's       sonar and guidance and control systems with modern       technology. The new guidance and control system uses a       mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom-built       electronics. The warhead, fuel tank and propulsion system       from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 configuration       with minor modifications. There is no sensitive technology in       the MK 54 or its support and test equipment. The assembled MK       54 torpedo and several of its individual components are       classified CONFIDENTIAL. The MK 54 operational software is       classified as SECRET. Canada has not requested nor will it be       provided with the source code for the MK 54 operational       software.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Canada can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       supports the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives as outlined in the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Canada.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
