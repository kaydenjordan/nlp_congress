 Mr. President, about a year ago, the American people  voted for fundamental change in this country, and, last week,  Republicans in the Senate continued to deliver. We passed a plan to  give Americans substantial tax relief. This legislation is exactly what  people were asking for last November, and it is exactly what this  country needs now.   Because of this Republican plan, people will be able to keep a lot  more of their hard-earned money. They are going to find that their  taxes will be simpler and fairer. They are going to see our economy  getting stronger and healthier. That is good news for our country, and  it is, certainly, good news for the American people. This legislation  was an important promise that Republicans made, and it is a promise  that Republicans have kept. It is just the latest Republican  accomplishment that is helping Americans.   Another thing that the Republicans are providing is tremendous relief  from Washington regulations. I think that a lot of people lost track of  exactly how much damage the Democrats and the Obama administration did  to the American economy. The Obama administration added 285 major  regulations during the course of the previous administration. Every one  of them imposed a burden on Americans. The total cost of these rules  was $122 billion per year. That was both the direct cost  [[Page S7868]]  in terms of money and also counting the time needed to fill out the  paperwork that was created by these excessive rules. Twenty-one of  these rules were actually finalized after the 2016 Presidential  election. That is after the American people spoke and said that they  wanted change. Yet President Obama went straight on with piling more  regulations onto the backs of the American people.   One of the first things that Republicans in Congress did this year  was to start striking down unnecessary, burdensome, costly regulations  from the Obama years. Republicans wiped 15 of these major rules off the  books. Major rules are rules that cost over $100 million in terms of  the compliance cost, the actual cost, and the time cost. That is going  to save Americans as much as $36 billion over time.   One of these rules was an important part of President Obama's war on  coal. It was called the stream buffer rule. It was designed to shut  down a lot of the coal mining that is going on in this country. It  would have destroyed up to a third of the coal mining jobs in America.  So we passed a congressional resolution that protected coal mining jobs  and protected American energy independence. We struck down 14  regulations like this one in the first few months of this year.   In October, Republicans blocked a 15th rule. This was the new  regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The rule was  written during the Obama administration, and Obama appointees at the  agency finalized it last summer. This is the agency that has been in  the news recently because it has been so out of control. Republicans in  Congress had to step in and get rid of an unnecessary rule that was  really, in my opinion, just a payoff by the Democrats to trial lawyers.   Republicans have saved Americans $36 billion by getting rid of rules  and regulations. Democrats, on the other hand, have cost the American  people $122 billion a year in costs due to rules and regulations.   Republicans in the Senate also took a major step in this tax relief  legislation by repealing the ObamaCare insurance mandate. This takes  ObamaCare from being a mandatory program to being a voluntary program.  It is going to save a lot of Americans a lot of money. In 2015, there  were over 6.7 million Americans who paid this tax. The average tax  penalty for the American people this past year was $700. It is a big  deal to give American families relief from that tax burden. It is also  a big part of rolling back this idea that Washington knows best what  works all across the country. The ObamaCare insurance mandate is more  than a tax, and the damage it does is more than just the paperwork and  money that people have to pay. It is an outrageous and unfair  requirement that people have to buy something that isn't right for them  and their family but the government says they have to buy it. When  Republicans struck down this mandate, we gave people back the freedom  they had to decide for themselves and to make their own choices.    The Republicans in Congress have been very busy saving Americans from  the burdens and injustices of these Obama regulations. I can state that  we have a very strong ally in the Trump administration, because  President Trump has been the deregulator in chief. Since his very first  day in office, he has been rolling back the regulations that have  constrained people over the previous 8 years. He froze action on nearly  2,000 Obama administration rules that hadn't taken effect yet. He wrote  a new rule for his administration--when one new rule comes in, two go  out. In other words, for every significant new regulation, his  administration would offset it by getting rid of two other rules. That  is how to make a difference in Washington. That is how the President  was able to remove 860 ineffective, duplicative, and obsolete  regulations in just his first 6 months in office. That is a very big  difference from what the Democrats in Washington did, and we have  already started seeing the results.   The American economy has created 2 million jobs since President Trump  was elected a little over 1 year ago. Our economy grew at a rate of 3.3  percent last quarter. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent.  Last Friday, the Washington Post had two items on one page. The first  stated that consumer spending had increased in October and incomes  grew. The article said: ``The October rise indicates that consumer  spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, began the  fourth quarter with healthy momentum.''   The second article, appearing on the same day in Washington Post,  Friday, noted that weekly applications for unemployment aid fell for  the week. It said that when the number of unemployment applications are  low like this, it is a sign that hiring is healthy. It is a sign that  employers are confident enough to keep workers on the payroll.   During the Obama years, Washington Democrats piled all of these  regulations onto the economy. Because of them, economists said they had  expected future growth to be around 1.8 percent. President Trump and  the Republicans in Congress are cutting the regulations, and the  economy is growing at 3 percent. That is the kind of change that is  possible under Republican pro-growth policies.   That is why we are confident that we are on the right track. It is  why we are confident that the economy is going to continue to  accelerate under the tax relief we passed this past week. It is why we  are confident that America will continue to thrive when we give people  relief from the Washington regulations and start to unwind the redtape.  That is what the American people voted for a little over a year ago.  That is what Republicans are delivering in Congress and in the White  House.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Rubio and Booker be recognized to make motions to instruct and that  their motions be the only motions in order remaining; further, that  there be up to 10 minutes of debate on the motions concurrently, and  upon the use or yielding back of time on the motions, all remaining  time on the House message be expired, and the Senate vote on  [[Page S7880]]  the Rubio and Booker motions to instruct in the order listed with no  intervening action or debate.
