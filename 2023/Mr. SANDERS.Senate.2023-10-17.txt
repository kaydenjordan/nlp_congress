 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record at the appropriate place the commitment letters for the  Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023 and the Animal Generic Drug  User Fee Amendments of 2023.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      Animal Drug User Fee Act Reauthorization Performance Goals and                 Procedures Fiscal Years 2024 Through 2028         The goals and procedures of the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA or the Agency) as agreed to under the       ``Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023'' are summarized as       follows:                                I. Definitions         1. For the application/submission goals below, the term       ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the issuance of a       complete action letter after the complete review of an animal       drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or       investigational new animal drug (INAD) submission which       either (1) approves or conditionally approves an animal drug       application or approves a supplemental application or       notifies a sponsor that an INAD submission is complete or (2)       sets forth in detail the specific deficiencies in such animal       drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or       INAD submission and, where appropriate, the actions necessary       to place such an application, supplemental application, or       submission in condition for approval.        Within 30 days of receipt, FDA shall refuse to file an       animal drug application, supplemental new animal drug       application, or their reactivation, which is determined to be       insufficient on its face or otherwise of unacceptable quality       for review upon initial inspection as per 21 CFR 514.110.       Thus, the Agency will refuse to file an application       containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws in the       development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of the       entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it       cannot reasonably be reviewed.        Within 60 days of receipt, FDA will refuse to review an       INAD submission which is determined to be insufficient on its       face or otherwise of unacceptable quality upon initial       inspection using criteria and procedures similar to those       found in 21 CFR 514.110.        A decision to refuse to file an application or to refuse to       review a submission as described above will result in the       application or submission not being entered into the cohort       upon which the relevant user fee goal is based. The Agency       will keep a record of the numbers and types of such refusals       and include them in its annual performance report.        2. A minor amendment is understood to mean information       requested by FDA during the review of the application or       investigational submission. FDA may request minor amendments       to animal drug applications, supplemental new animal drug       applications, and INAD submissions during its review of the       application or submission. At its discretion, the Agency may       extend an internal due date (but not a user fee goal) to       allow for the complete review of an application or submission       for which a minor amendment is requested. If a pending       application is amended with significant changes, the amended       application may be considered resubmitted, thereby       effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received the       amendment. The same policy applies for INAD submissions.        3. The term ``submission date'' or the date of receipt       means the date the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)       Electronic Submission System (ESS) receives an application or       submission. Upon receipt of an application or submission, the       CVM ESS creates an electronic receipt that contains the date       of receipt and is sent to the submitter.        4. The term ``labeling supplement'' is understood to mean       certain applications as described in 21 CFR 514.8(c)(2)(i)(A)       and (D) that require approval of a supplemental application       prior to distribution of the drug made using the change.        5. The term ``presubmission conference'' is understood to       mean one or more conferences between a potential applicant       and FDA as described in 21 CFR 514.5 to reach a binding       agreement establishing a submission or investigational       requirement.        6. The term ``dosage characterization'' is understood to       mean a justification of the dosage (dose or dose range,       dosing frequency, and the dosing duration) and a       characterization of the critical aspects of the dose-response       relationship related to each intended use and associated       conditions of use.                       II. Application/Submission Goals         All applications and submissions under the Federal Food,       Drug, and Cosmetic Act sections 512(b) and 571 must be       created using the CVM eSubmitter tool and submitted to the       Agency through CVM's ESS.        The submissions in this section are sentinel submissions.       CVM's performance toward meeting the associated goals will be       included in the performance reports required by section       740A(a) of the FD&C Act.        Work Queue Review Procedures: The Agency will review all       submissions in accordance with procedures for working within       a queue. An application/submission that is not reviewed       within the applicable Application/Submission Goal timeframe       will be reviewed with the highest possible priority among       those pending.      1. Original New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs),           Applications for Conditional Approval (CNADAs), and           Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of original NADAs and CNADAs       within 180 days after the submission date.        An application is incomplete if it would require additional       data or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the application.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of reactivated       applications:        i. Within 180 days after the reactivated application       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are substantial;        ii. Within 135 days after the reactivated application       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and the       application reactivation must be submitted no more than 120       days after the Agency's dated incomplete letter to qualify       for the shorter review time; and        iii. Within 180 days after the reactivated application       submission date if the reactivation is submitted after 120       days of the Agency's dated incomplete letter or new       substantial information is provided in the reactivated       application.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       reactivation timeframe of 135 days, where possible. The       Agency will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the reactivation. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to reactivation of the application. The shorter review       time of 135 days for reactivated applications for which the       deficiencies are determined not to be substantial is not       intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency       review of an application.      2. Administrative NADAs and CNADAs        Review and act on 90 percent of administrative NADAs and       CNADAs [(C)NADAs filed after all scientific decisions already       have been made as part of the investigational new animal drug       process] within 60 days after the filing date.      3. Non-manufacturing Supplemental NADAs        Review and act on 90 percent of non-manufacturing       supplemental NADAs (i.e., supplemental NADAs for which safety       or effectiveness data are required) within 180 days after the       submission date.        A supplemental NADA is incomplete if it would require       additional data or information to enable the Agency to       complete a comprehensive review of the supplement and reach a       decision on the issue(s) presented in the supplement.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of reactivated       supplements:        i. Within 180 days after the reactivated supplemental NADA       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are substantial;        ii. Within 135 days after the reactivated supplemental NADA       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and the       reactivation to the supplemental application must be       submitted no more than 120 days after the Agency's dated       incomplete letter to qualify for the shorter review time; and        iii. Within 180 days after the reactivated supplemental       NADA submission date if the reactivation to the supplemental       application is submitted after 120 days of the Agency's dated       incomplete letter or new substantial information is provided       in the reactivated supplement.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       reactivation timeframe of 135 days, where possible. The       Agency will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the reactivation. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to the reactivation of the supplement. The shorter       review time of 135 days for reactivated supplements for which       the deficiencies are determined not to be substantial is not       intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency       review of a supplemental application.      4. Prior Approval Manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug           Applications and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of Prior Approval       manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications within       120 days after the submission date. A Prior Approval       manufacturing supplemental application includes: one or more       major manufacturing changes as described in 21 CFR       514.8(b)(2)(ii) and in accordance with Guidance for Industry       83 (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an       Approved NADA or ANADA); and, changes submitted as       ``Supplement-  [[Page S5039]]       Changes Being Effected in 30 Days'' that require prior       approval according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). If a Prior       Approval supplement does not clearly identify any major       manufacturing changes, the Prior Approval supplement will be       designated by the Agency as a ``Supplement-Changes Being       Effected'' with a 180 days review goal (see ``Supplement-      Changes Being Effected Manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug       Applications and Reactivations'' below).        A submission is incomplete if it requires additional data       or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the submission and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies are not substantial for       manufacturing supplements requiring prior approval, the       Agency will allow the manufacturing supplements to be       resubmitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30       Days'' as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) and the drug made       with the change can be distributed 30 days after the       resubmission according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 180 days after the       resubmission date of a complete submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies remain substantial or new       substantial information is provided, prior-approval is       required according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 120 days after the       resubmission date of a complete submission.      1. Supplements--Changes Being Effected Manufacturing           Supplemental Animal Drug Applications and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of ``Supplement- Changes Being       Effected'' manufacturing supplemental applications and       reactivations submitted according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(vi)       and in accordance with Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or       ANADA), including manufacturing changes not requiring prior       approval according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) within 180 days       after the submission date.      2. Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) Study Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of INAD study submissions       within 180 days after the submission date.        An INAD study submission is incomplete if it would require       additional data or information to enable the Agency to       complete a comprehensive review of the submission and reach a       decision on the issue(s) presented in the submission.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of       resubmissions:        i. Within 180 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are substantial;        ii. Within 60 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and the       resubmission must be submitted no more than 120 days after       the Agency's dated incomplete letter to qualify for the       shorter review time; and        iii. Within 180 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the resubmission is submitted after 120       days of the Agency's dated incomplete letter or new       substantial information is provided in the resubmission.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       resubmission timeframe of 60 days, where possible. The Agency       will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate timeframe       for review of the resubmission. Sponsors wishing to discuss       the selected timeframe should contact the Agency prior to       resubmitting the application. The shorter review time of 60       days for resubmissions for which the deficiencies are       determined not to be substantial is not intended to prevent       the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a       submission.        Review and act on 90 percent of microbial food safety       hazard characterization submissions within 100 days after the       submission date.      7. INAD Study Protocols without Data Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of INAD submissions consisting       of protocols without data, that the Agency and the sponsor       consider to be an essential part of the basis for making the       decision to approve or not approve an animal drug       application, within 50 days after the submission date.        An INAD protocol without data submission is incomplete if       it would require additional information to enable the Agency       to complete a comprehensive review of the protocol and reach       a decision on the issue(s) presented in the protocol.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of resubmitted       INAD protocol without data submissions:        i. Within 50 days after the resubmission date if the Agency       determines and notifies the sponsor that the deficiencies are       substantial;        ii. Within 20 days after the resubmitted INAD protocol       without data submission date if the Agency determines and       notifies the sponsor that the deficiencies are not       substantial; and the resubmission must be submitted no more       than 120 days after the Agency's dated non-concurrence letter       to qualify for the shorter review time; and        iii. Within 50 days after the resubmission date if the       resubmission is submitted after 120 days of the Agency's       dated non-concurrence letter or new substantial information       is provided in the resubmission.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       resubmission timeframe of 20 days, where possible. The Agency       will state in the non-concurrence letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the resubmission. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to resubmission of the protocol without data. The       shorter review time of 20 days for resubmitted INAD protocol       without data submissions for which the deficiencies are       determined not to be substantial is not intended to prevent       the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a       submission.        Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for       review. However, for each protocol voluntarily submitted       prior to the commencement of the study that the Agency and       the sponsor consider to be an essential part of the basis for       making the decision to approve or not approve an animal drug       application or supplemental animal drug application, the       Agency will issue a complete action letter providing comments       resulting from a complete review of the protocol. The       complete action letter will be as detailed as possible       considering the quality and level of detail of the protocol       submission; will include a succinct assessment of the       protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees,       disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a       decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and data       analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of the study.        If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable,       this represents an agreement that the data generated by the       protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness       decision regarding the subject animal drug. The fundamental       agreement is that having agreed to the design, execution, or       analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under this process,       the Agency will not later alter its perspectives on the       issues of design, execution, or analyses unless the Agency by       written order determines that a substantiated scientific       requirement essential to the assessment of the study appeared       after the Agency's protocol assessment, or public or animal       health concerns unrecognized at the time of protocol       assessment under this process are evident.        The Agency will permit comparability protocols as described       in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) to be submitted as protocols without       substantial data in an INAD file. The Agency will review and       act on 90 percent of INAD submissions consisting of protocols       without substantial data within 50 days after the submission       date of the protocol. For potentially more complex       comparability protocols, for example sterile process       validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have       Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy.      8. Qualifying Labeling Supplements        Review and act on 90 percent of qualifying labeling       supplements as described in 21 CFR 514.8(c)(2)(i)(A) and (D)       within 60 days after the submission date. Qualifying labeling       supplements are defined as those for which the sponsor       provides and certifies a complete list of labeling changes       made in the application and that CVM can determine upon       initial review do not decrease the safety of drug use.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-      qualifying labeling supplements within 180 days after the       submission date.      9. Presubmission Conferences        Conduct 90% of qualifying presubmission conferences within       a 60-day timeframe, regardless of forum, when all of the       following conditions are met:        i) All background materials, including presentations, have       been submitted, and        ii) A complete agenda has been agreed upon by the Agency       and the sponsor.        If a sponsor requests a date beyond the 60-day timeframe       for their scheduling purposes or is unable to meet with the       FDA on Agency-available dates within the 60-day timeframe,       the submission will be excluded from the presubmission       conference cohort.      10. Categorical Exclusions        Review and act on 90 percent of resubmissions of a       previously completed Environmental Impact technical section       within 60 days after the resubmission date where:        i. A Categorical Exclusion was issued;        ii. All other technical sections have been submitted; and        iii. Information contained in the other technical sections       reveals a change in the conditions of use of the drug that       may affect the previous determination of categorical       exclusion.      11. Tissue Residue Methods        Commence 90% of tissue residue method demonstrations within       120 days of completion of the ``3-hour meeting'' process or       equivalent process milestone where there is a single       laboratory validation tissue residue method demonstration.      12. Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) Combination Medicated           Feeds Applications        Review and act on 90 percent of qualifying ADAA Combination       Medicated Feeds Applications within 60 days after the       submission date. An ADAA combination application will qualify       for the 60-day review timeframe only if the following       criteria are met:        i. The regulatory requirements for an ADAA combination       application have been met as outlined in 21 CFR       514.4(c)(2)(ii)  [[Page S5040]]         ii. The submission meets all of the eligibility criteria       found in section II of P&P 1243.5730, ``Review of 60-Day       Original Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996 (ADAA) Feed Use       Combination New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs).''        Review and act on 90 percent of ADAA combination       applications within 100 days for those applications initially       accepted for the 60-day timeframe but subsequently determined       to need minor amendments.        If any of the above conditions cannot be met, the ADAA       combination application will be given a 180-day review       timeframe and placed in the original NADA application cohort.                      III. ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE GOALS         Submissions in this section are not sentinel submissions       unless they appear in section II, above.      A. Foreign inspections                    1. Pre-Approval Foreign Inspections         a. The Agency and regulated industry are committed to       improving the review and business processes that will       facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-      approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and       predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily       submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of       foreign manufacturing facilities that are specified in an       animal drug application, supplemental animal drug       application, or investigational animal drug submission and       may be subject to foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year;       and 2) a notification 30 days prior to submitting an animal       drug application, a supplemental animal drug application, or       INAD submission that informs the Agency that the application/      submission includes a foreign manufacturing facility. Should       any changes to the annual list occur after its submission to       the Agency, the sponsor may provide the updated information       to the Agency.        b. The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign       PAIs conducted for animal drug applications, along with the       average time for completing the PAIs, and include this       information in its annual performance report. The time for       completing the PAI is understood to mean the time from the       inspection scheduling request through notification to the       Center of inspectional findings.                         2. Foreign GMP Inspections         The Agency commits to working to implement and maintain the       United States and European Union, and the United States and       United Kingdom, Good Manufacturing Practice mutual       recognition agreements and future mutual recognition       agreements with respect to animal drug products subject to       review.        Beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2024, the Agency will report       quarterly in FDA-TRACK the percentage of pre-approval       inspection risk decisions which relied at least in part on       information from inspections recognized under a mutual       recognition agreement with a foreign regulatory authority.      B. Meetings                1. Presubmission Conferences Held Virtually         Beginning on October 1, 2023, for qualifying presubmission       conferences where the sponsor requests that the conference be       held virtually (not in person), the Agency will provide the       following:        At least 6 days prior to the scheduled presubmission       conference date, written responses to the questions posed by       the sponsor in their meeting request. Responses will be       commensurate to the level of information and complexity of       questions submitted by the sponsor.        Permit the sponsor to cancel the scheduled presubmission       conference should the Agency's written responses provide all       the information they were seeking from the Agency.        Should the presubmission conference be held, provide a       memorandum of conference within 30 days after the       presubmission conference date.        Sponsors may request a virtual presubmission conference and       opt out of the process above. The sponsor will identify their       decision whether to opt out of the above process within the       presubmission conference request. If the sponsor chooses to       opt out, the Agency will not issue any written responses       before the presubmission conference and will provide a       memorandum of conference within 45 days following the       presubmission conference date.                         2. Stakeholder Engagement         a. The Agency is committed to engaging with all our       external stakeholders in substantive ways that work for all       parties. Further, the Agency commits to coordinating with AHI       to identify the most appropriate forum based on topic,       timing, and public health safety precautions with the       understanding that it is a priority for AHI to meet in person       when possible.        b. FDA will host triannual meetings (three times a calendar       year) with the Animal Health Institute (AHI) members.        c. During one triannual meeting with AHI per calendar year,       the Agency will dedicate up to 8 hours for an education       session intended for the animal drug industry. These sessions       will be open to the public and hosted in an appropriate       forum. The Agency and AHI will build a plan of educational       topics for the five years of the ADFUA V program period.       Education sessions will be recorded and posted publicly to       the Agency's ``For Industry'' website in a new ``Education       for Industry'' section.        d. The Agency will conduct an industry engagement sub-      meeting during each AHI triannual meeting, that includes CVM       leadership and designated AHI attendees and uses a structured       agenda to provide updates on metrics and performance related       to the ADUFA program and resource utilization (i.e., CVM       staffing).      C. H submissions     1) Supporting Information for Presubmission Conferences and INAD                     Protocols without Data Submissions         The Agency and the regulated industry agree that data and/      or information which uniquely describes the general       attributes of the new animal drug (e.g., the known       characteristics of the drug that can impact safety,       effectiveness and/or quality) needs to be submitted early in       the new animal drug development process in order to enable       the parties to reach agreement at a presubmission conference       or to begin review of a protocol. The intent of this       provision is to avoid the submission of data or information       between the presubmission conference and the submission of a       protocol. Eligibility both for short justifications in       protocols and for concurrent supporting data and protocol       review described below is predicated on the sponsor       submitting information early in the new animal drug       development process.        The Agency will allow for the inclusion of these data and/      or information in presubmission conferences and/or in an H       submission prior to the presubmission conference; however, a       presubmission conference may be held without such data. By       October 1, 2023, the Agency will publish a Program Policy and       Procedures Manual Guide (P&P) for CVM reviewers who are       advising sponsors on:        information/data included in H submissions related to       presubmission conferences,        timing of the related meeting request submission, and        how CVM should schedule meetings, such that they occur on,       or in close proximity to, the H submission due date.        The Agency will allow short justifications within INAD       protocols without data submissions that are limited in scope       (e.g., no more than ten pages or no more than two (peer-      reviewed) journal articles).        The Agency will allow for the concurrent submission of       supporting data (INAD H submissions) and protocols (INAD E       submissions) provided that the protocol is not submitted       until the supporting data has been in the Agency's queue for       at least 50 days.        By October 1, 2023, the Agency will publish a P&P for CVM       reviewers who are advising sponsors regarding the appropriate       timing of a protocol submission in relation to an H       submission containing information to support the protocol.       The P&P will address situations where information was       submitted early in the new animal drug development process,       as described earlier in this section, and situations where       this information was not submitted early in the animal drug       development process. The P&P will provide information to CVM       staff who are advising sponsors about when a protocol may or       may not be submitted after the supporting data has been in       the Agency's queue for at least 50 days.                         2. Dosage Characterization         The Agency and the regulated industry agree that dosage       characterization is part of the effectiveness technical       section of an investigational new animal drug file. In       instances where data and/or information about the dosage are       integral to the review of a protocol, the Agency and the       regulated industry agree that these data and/or information       should be submitted as supporting data (INAD H submission)       well in advance of the protocol submission. Such information       may be needed to ensure selection of optimal study time       points and would be particularly important for novel drugs       and drugs with modified-release characteristics.                    3. Raw Data Submission Expectations         By October 1, 2024, the Agency will publish a draft       Guidance for Industry on raw data submission expectations for       non-clinical studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practice       requirements and clinical studies conducted under Good       Clinical Practice requirements.        By October 1, 2023, the Agency will publish a P&P for CVM       reviewers reviewing H submissions in which the sponsor is       seeking agreement on a proposed list of copies of raw data       and documents related to their submission of a target animal       safety (TAS) protocol without data submission. After       publication of the P&P, CVM will permit the submission of H       submissions containing a proposed list of copies of raw data       and documents supporting a TAS protocol.                4. eSubmitter and H Submissions for Raw Data         By October 1, 2023, FDA will launch a new or updated       eSubmitter template for TAS protocols, to facilitate       efficient review of the H submissions containing proposed raw       data to be included in TAS study reports, provided that       industry stakeholders that use the eSubmitter tool have       provided timely feedback to further the Agency's work. FDA       will continue to accept stakeholder feedback on the       eSubmitter template for these H submissions during ADUFA V.        The Agency and industry stakeholders will assess the       benefits of the eSubmitter template for H submissions for TAS       protocols before the Agency develops a template for H       submissions for effectiveness protocols. If the Agency       proceeds with the template for H submissions for       effectiveness protocols, industry stakeholders that use the       eSubmitter  [[Page S5041]]       tool will be invited to provide timely feedback to advance       the Agency's work.      D. Exploration with Industry     1. Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) Combination Medicated Feeds         The Agency agrees to explore, in concert with affected       parties including the animal health industry, CVM P&P       1243.5730, ``Review of 60-day original Animal Drug       Availability Act of 1996 (ADAA) feed use combination new       animal drug applications (NADAs)'', to determine why the       process is not being utilized and to understand how to       increase utilization of the process, thereby reducing the       review time for eligible ADAA combinations drug applications       following the approval of a new Type A medicated article. The       exploration phase will be completed by October 1, 2025. The       Agency may revise P&P 1243.5730 based on the outcome of the       exploration phase.                          2. Residue Method Trial         The Agency agrees to explore, in concert with affected       parties including the animal health industry, the drug       residue analytical method trial process and its requirements       as they relate to the approval of new animal drugs intended       for food producing animals. If implementation of       recommendations is possible, it may include modification of       current processes. Implementation also may include       procedural, policy, and/or guidance revisions. The       exploration phase will be completed by October 1, 2025.       Implementation of actionable recommendations will be       completed during ADUFA V.                     3. Sentinel Submission Clock Stop         Beginning on October 1, 2023, the Agency agrees to explore,       in concert with industry, the feasibility of using additional       review tools to enhance the efficiency of the animal drug       review process, such as implementing a ``clock stop'' during       the review of sentinel submissions. A working group will       develop a written analysis and recommendations for the tools       identified by September 30, 2025.                  4. Feedback on Product Development Plans         The Agency agrees to explore, in concert with affected       parties including the animal health industry, means for the       Agency to provide feedback on a sponsor's animal drug       development plan more efficiently and effectively for both       industry and the Agency. By October 1, 2025, a working group       will develop a report outlining suggestions for providing       feedback.      E. Other                 1. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls         By September 30, 2024, the Agency will publish a P&P for       Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) reviewers to       clarify when reviewers should request amendments, use       shortened review time, or classify submissions as incomplete.       In addition, this P&P will describe what administrative       actions are appropriate when GMP status (or pending PAI) is       the only comment remaining for a CMC technical section.        By September 30, 2024, the Agency will revise Guidance for       Industry 227 ``Two-Phased Chemistry, Manufacturing, and       Controls (CMC) Technical Sections'' to define situations for       which parallel submission of phased data submissions would be       allowed.                            IV. REPORTING METRICS       A. Sentinel Submissions Filed/Submitted at Division Level        Beginning in FY 2024, as part of the annual ADUFA V       performance report, FDA will report the number of certain       filed/submitted sentinel submissions by review division.       Performance will be reported at the program level. The       sentinel submissions are:        1. Original NADAs, CNADAs and reactivations        2. Administrative NADAs and CNADAs        3. Non-manufacturing supplemental NADAs and reactivations        4. INAD study submissions        5. INAD study protocols without data submissions        6. Qualifying labeling supplements        7. Presubmission conferences      B. Time in Agency/Time in Industry        Beginning in FY 2024, in concert with industry, explore       potential Agency-reported metrics regarding review time of       investigational submissions that lead to approvals by the       Agency and response time by industry. The exploration may       include discussions on which metrics to report, what       processes currently exist to calculate and report these       metrics, which systems might need to be developed to       facilitate reporting the metrics, what the results of the       metrics mean, and how best to report the metrics.        Following publication of the third-party assessment in       2025, industry and the Agency will initiate a follow up       effort, which may include a pilot period, to inform how these       metrics might be collected and reported.      C. Favorable Outcomes        Beginning in the second quarter (Q2) of FY 2024, FDA will       report quarterly in FDA-TRACK, for INAD protocols without       data and for INAD study submissions, the number of the       following outcomes: (1) favorable, (2) non-concurrence/non-      accepted but shortened review offered, and (3) non-      concurrence/non-accepted and shortened review not offered.        FDA and industry will work together to identify a process       to annually report the cycle number for all for INAD       protocols without data and INAD study submissions with       favorable outcomes and whether the favorable outcomes were       first, second, or third+ submissions.        FDA and industry will work together to make sustained,       substantial, and incremental improvements in the annual       percentage of favorable outcomes for the CMC INAD study       submissions and/or to improve utilization of the shortened       review process.      D. INAD H Submissions Submitted at Division Level        Beginning in Q2 of FY 2024, FDA will report quarterly in       FDA-TRACK the number of H submissions submitted to ONADE by       division.      E. Average Review Times in Hours        Beginning in FY 2024, FDA will report in the ADUFA       performance report the average review times, in hours, for       protocols without data and INAD study submissions (broken       down by technical section) by fiscal year.                V. ENHANCING MANAGEMENT OF USER FEE RESOURCES         FDA is committed to enhancing management of ADUFA resources       and ensuring ADUFA user fee resources are administered,       allocated, and reported in an efficient and transparent       manner.      A. Third-Party Assessment        The Agency will engage an independent, third-party to       conduct a comprehensive assessment of the process for the       review of animal drug applications. The assessment will       include consultation with both the Agency and industry. The       assessment will include first cycle reviews as they pertain       to the ADUFA program's objective of expediting the animal       drug development process and the review of new and       supplemental animal drug applications and investigational       animal drug submissions.        The assessment will examine past and current utilization       and effectiveness of the review process, available resources       [e.g., full-time equivalents (FTEs)], and tools used by the       Agency and industry, as established through previous ADUFA       authorizations to foster favorable first cycle review       outcomes for sentinel submissions. The scope of this       assessment will include the analysis of submissions (starting       from the request to establish an INAD file and ending with       approval) and include all technical section submissions (both       sentinel and non-sentinel) to INAD files, NADAs, and       conditional approval application files. It will also evaluate       the impact of specific user fee-based enhancements from prior       reauthorizations on approved original NADAs and applications       for conditional approval.        The assessment will include evaluation of a random set of       applications approved from FY 2009 through FY 2022. The       samples will include representation from new chemical       entities, multiple animal drug sponsors, all major       species, and multiple different dosage form. The       evaluation will include the proposal and evaluation of the       optimal process to provide data on how resources are       utilized (i.e., user fee funds; headcount and process FTEs       with ADUFA allowable activities by office and division)       and of applicable metrics (e.g., time to approval, divided       between time in agency and time with industry, for       technical sections to INADs and NADAs; and favorable first       cycle outcomes) that evaluate progress towards the ADUFA       program's objective mentioned above.        The Agency will obtain the services of a contractor to       complete this assessment. After the final assessment report       is accepted by the responsible Agency official, it will be       posted on FDA.gov. When publishing the final assessment       report on the FDA website, the Agency will comply with       requirements to protect confidential commercial information       and other information exempt from disclosure.        FDA will convene a public workshop approximately three       months after accepting the final assessment report to present       the findings of the independent assessment, including the       third-party's report of anonymized, aggregated feedback       resulting from its interviews of animal drug sponsors and       Agency personnel. The assessment report and the public       meeting will be completed by December 31, 2025.        Following the completion of the assessment and public       meeting, the Agency and industry will analyze the       recommendations for improvement opportunities identified in       the assessment. FDA, with input from stakeholders, will       incorporate findings and recommendations, as it determines to       be possible and appropriate, into its management of the       process for the review of animal drug applications and       Industry will incorporate findings and recommendations, as       appropriate, into their filing and submission processes.      B. Financial Transparency        1. FDA will publish an ADUFA 5-year financial plan no later       than the end of the second quarter of FY 2024 that aligns       with the plans published for GDUFA II, PDUFA VI and BsUFA II.        2. FDA will publish updates to the 5-year plan no later       than the end of the second quarter of each subsequent fiscal       year.                          VI. Statutory Adjustments       A. Workload Adjustment        For the purposes of calculating the workload adjustment,       the base years will be a rolling average comprising the five       most recently completed fiscal years. For example, beginning       October 1, 2024 (FY 2025), the base will comprise FY 2019       through FY 2023. At the start of each fiscal year thereafter,       the base will be adjusted upward by one year on the upper and       lower ends of the range. There will be no workload adjustment       for FY 2024.  [[Page S5042]]       Workload adjustments are one-time adjustments and are       calculated annually. The weighting factor is the percent of       direct review time spent on each of the five component       submission types over the most recent five-year period.        As stated in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C)       Act, the workload adjustment ``shall be made for each fiscal       year that the adjustment determined by the Secretary is       greater than 3 percent, except for the first fiscal year that       the adjustment is greater than 3 percent, except for the       first fiscal year that the adjustment is greater than 3       percent.'' See section 740(c)(3) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C.       379j-12(c)(3)] for the full text of the workload adjustment.      B. Operating Reserve Adjustment        The operating reserve of carryover user fees for the       process for the review of animal drug applications will be       used to fund the third-party assessment described in section       V.A. and any ADUFA V negotiated, one-time IT enhancements.        Additionally, as stated in the FD&C Act, fee revenue       amounts will be adjusted to provide an operating reserve of       carryover user fees for the process of the review of animal       drug applications of not less than 12 weeks and not more than       16 weeks. The reduction of the operating reserve to the 16-      week maximum will be phased in over the 5-year lifecycle of       ADUFA V. Section 740(c)(4) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-      12(c)(4)] contains the text of the operating reserve       adjustment, as follows:        ``(4) OPERATING RESERVE ADJUSTMENT.--        ``(A) IN GENERAL.--For fiscal year 2025 and each subsequent       fiscal year, after the fee revenue amount established under       subsection (b) is adjusted in accordance with paragraphs (2)       and (3), the Secretary shall--        (i) increase the fee revenue amount for such fiscal year,       if necessary to provide an operating reserve of not less than       12 weeks; or        (ii) if the Secretary has an operating reserve in excess of       the number of weeks specified in subparagraph (C) for that       fiscal year, the Secretary shall decrease the fee revenue       amount to provide not more than the number of weeks specified       in subparagraph (C) for that fiscal year.        (B) CARRYOVER USER FEES.--For purposes of this paragraph,       the operating reserve of carryover user fees for the process       for the review of animal drug applications does not include       carryover user fees that have not been appropriated.        (C) NUMBER OF WEEKS OF OPERATING RESERVES.--The number of       weeks of operating reserves specified in this subparagraph       is--        ``(i) 22 weeks for fiscal year 2025;        ``(ii) 20 weeks for fiscal year 2026;        ``(iii) 18 weeks for fiscal year 2027; and        ``(iv) 16 weeks for fiscal year 2028.  Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act Reauthorization Performance Goals and                 Procedures--Fiscal Years 2024 Through 2028         The goals and procedures of the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA or the Agency) as agreed to under the       Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2023 are       summarized as follows:                        Application/Submission Goals         Beginning October 1, 2023, all applications and submissions       under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)       section 512(b) must be created using the eSubmitter tool and       submitted to the Agency through the FDA Center for Veterinary       Medicine (CVM) Electronic Submission System (ESS).        1. Original Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications       (ANADAs) and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of original ANADAs within 240       days after the submission date.        An application is incomplete if it would require additional       data or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the application. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies are not substantial, the       Agency will review and act on 90 percent of reactivated       applications within 120 days after the reactivated ANADA       submission date. This shorter review time for reactivated       ANADAs for which the deficiencies are determined not to be       substantial is not intended to prevent the use of minor       amendments during Agency review of an application. If the       Agency determines that the deficiencies are substantial or       new substantial information is provided, the Agency will       review and act on 90 percent of reactivated applications       within 240 days after the reactivated ANADA submission date.        2. Administrative ANADAs        Review and act on 90 percent of administrative ANADAs       (ANADAs submitted after all scientific decisions have been       made in the generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD)       process, i.e., prior to the submission of the ANADA) within       60 days after the submission date. Paragraph IV certification       applications (FD&C Act section 512(n)(1)(H)(iv)) submitted as       administrative ANADAs will be excluded from the       administrative ANADA cohort.        3. Prior Approval Manufacturing Supplemental ANADAs and       Reactivation        Review and act on 90 percent of Prior Approval       manufacturing supplemental ANADAs within 180 days after the       submission date. A Prior Approval manufacturing supplemental       ANADA includes: one or more major manufacturing changes       according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(ii) and in accordance with       Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and       Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA); and, changes       submitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30 Days''       that require prior approval according to 21 CFR       514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). If a Prior Approval supplement does not       clearly identify any major manufacturing changes, the Prior       Approval supplement will be designated by the Agency as a       ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected'' with a 270 days review       goal (see ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected Manufacturing       Supplemental ANADAs and Reactivations'' below).        A submission is incomplete if it requires additional data       or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the submission and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies are not substantial for       manufacturing supplements requiring prior approval, the       Agency will allow the manufacturing supplements to be       resubmitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30       Days'' as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) and the drug made       with the change can be distributed 30 days after the       resubmission according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 270 days after the re-      submission date of a complete submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies remain substantial or new       substantial information is provided, prior-approval is       required according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 180 days after the re-      submission date of a complete submission.        4. Supplement--Changes Being Effected Manufacturing       Supplemental ANADAs and        Review and act on 90 percent of ``Supplement-Changes Being       Effected'' manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and       reactivations submitted according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(vi)       and in accordance with Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or       ANADA), including manufacturing changes not requiring prior       approval according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv), within 270 days       after the submission date.        5. Generic Investigational New Animal Drug (JINAD) Study       Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD study submissions       within 180 days after the submission date.        A submission is incomplete if it would require additional       data or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the study submission and reach a       decision on the issue(s) presented in the submission. If the       Agency determines that the deficiencies are not substantial,       the Agency will review and act on 90 percent of resubmitted       JINAD study submissions within 60 days after the receipt date       of a complete study submission. This shorter review time for       resubmitted JINAD study submissions is not intended to       prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a       study submission. If the Agency determines that the       deficiencies are substantial or new substantial information       is provided, the Agency will review and act on 90 percent of       resubmitted JINAD study submissions within 180 days after the       receipt date of a complete study submission.        6. JINAD Protocols        Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions       consisting of protocols without substantial data, that the       Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of       the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve       an ANADA or supplemental ANADA, within 75 days after the       submission date.        Allow comparability protocols as described in 21 CFR       514.8(b)(2)(v) to be submitted as protocols without       substantial data in a JINAD file. The Agency will review and       act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions consisting of       protocols without substantial data within 75 days after the       submission date of the protocol. For potentially more complex       comparability protocols, for example sterile process       validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have       Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy.        7. Request to Establish a JINAD File        Review and act on 90 percent of original submissions       requesting establishment of a JINAD file, within 100 days       after the submission date.        For the application/submission goals above, the term       ``review and act on'' means the issuance of either: (1) a       complete action letter that approves an original or       supplemental ANADA or notifies a sponsor that a JINAD       submission is complete or that a JINAD file has been       established; or (2) an ``incomplete letter'' that sets forth       in detail the specific deficiencies in an original or       supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission and, where       appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an original       or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission in condition for       approval, filing, or complete submission. Within 30 days of       receipt of the application, FDA shall refuse to file an       original or supplemental ANADA, or their reactivation, that       is determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of       unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as       per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency will refuse to file an       application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws       in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of       the entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it       cannot reasonably be reviewed.  [[Page S5043]]       Within 60 days of receipt of the submission, FDA will refuse       to review a JINAD submission that is determined to be       insufficient on its face or otherwise of unacceptable quality       upon initial inspection using criteria and procedures similar       to those found in 21 CFR 514.110.        A decision to refuse to file an application or to refuse to       review a submission as described above will result in the       application or submission not being entered into the cohort       upon which the relevant user fee goal is based. The agency       will keep a record of the numbers and types of such refusals       and include them in its annual performance report.        FDA may request minor amendments to original or       supplemental ANADAs and JINAD submissions during its review       of the application or submission. At its discretion, the       Agency may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee       goal) to allow for the complete review of an application or       submission for which a minor amendment is requested. If a       pending application is amended with significant changes, the       amended application may be considered resubmitted, thereby       effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received       the amendment. The same policy applies for JINAD       submissions.        Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for       review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for       a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an       essential part of the basis for making the decision to       approve or not approve an original or supplemental ANADA, the       Agency will issue a complete action letter providing comments       resulting from a complete review of the protocol. The       complete action letter will be as detailed as possible       considering the quality and level of detail of the protocol       submission; will include a succinct assessment of the       protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees,       disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a       decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and data       analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of the study.       If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable, this       represents an agreement that the data generated by the       protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness       decision regarding the subject new animal drug. Having agreed       to the design, execution, or analyses proposed in protocols       reviewed under this process, the Agency will not later alter       its perspectives on the design, execution, or analyses unless       the Agency issues a written order that a substantiated       scientific requirement essential to the assessment of the       study appeared after the Agency's protocol assessment, or       public (human or animal) health concerns unrecognized at the       time of protocol assessment under this process are evident.        The term ``submission date'' means the date the FDA Center       for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Electronic Submission System       (ESS) receives an application or submission. Upon receipt of       an application or submission, the CVM ESS creates an       electronic receipt that contains the date of receipt and is       sent to the submitter.                         Work Queue Review Procedures         The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with       procedures for working within a queue. An application/      submission that is not reviewed within the applicable       Application/Submission Goal time frame will be reviewed with       the highest possible priority among those pending.                Amending Similar Applications and Submissions         The Agency and regulated industry agree that applications       and submissions to the Agency will be complete and of       sufficient quality to allow the Agency's complete and timely       review. The Agency will refuse to file poor quality and       incomplete applications and submissions rather than allowing       them to serve as ``placeholders'' in the review queue that       are subsequently amended to add the missing or inadequate       portions.        The Agency recognizes that there are circumstances in which       a controlled amendment process can make the review of       similar, pending submissions more efficient without       compromising the sponsor's responsibility for high quality       submissions. Thus, if the Agency requests an amendment to a       non-administrative original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental       ANADA, JINAD study submission, or a JINAD protocol submission       (a ``CVM-initiated amendment''), or issues an incomplete       letter for such an application or submission, a sponsor may       request to amend other, similar applications or submissions       it has pending with the Agency (``sponsor-initiated       amendment(s)'') in accordance with the following criteria:        1. The amended information for these similar applications       or submissions must be the same as in the CVM-initiated       amendment or incomplete letter; and        2. The amended information must not significantly change       the similar applications or submissions; and        3. The amended information for these similar applications       or submissions must be submitted no later than:        a. 120 days after the submission date for the similar       original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental ANADA; or        b. 100 days after the submission date for the similar JINAD       study submissions; or        c. 40 days after the submission date for the similar JINAD       protocol submissions.        If the Agency determines that the above criteria have been       met, it will not change the user fee goal for the similar       application or submission that has been amended by a sponsor-      initiated amendment. If the above criteria have not been met,       the Agency may consider the similar application or submission       resubmitted on the date of the sponsor-initiated amendment,       thereby resetting the clock to the date FDA received the       amendment.   Multiple Data Submissions to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls                             Technical Section         The Agency will continue to allow two-phased Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls technical section submissions       under the JINAD process.                   Timely Foreign Pre-Approval Inspections         1. The Agency and regulated industry are committed to       improving the review and business processes that will       facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-      approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and       predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily       submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of       foreign manufacturing facilities that are specified in an       abbreviated application, supplemental abbreviated       application, or generic investigational file and may be       subject to foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year; and 2)       a notification 30 days prior to submitting an abbreviated       application, a supplemental abbreviated application, or       generic investigational file that informs the Agency that the       application includes a foreign manufacturing facility. Should       any changes to the annual list occur after its submission to       the Agency, the sponsor may provide the updated information       to the Agency.        2. The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign       PAIs conducted for abbreviated applications, along with the       average time for completing the PAIs, and include this       information in its annual performance report. The time for       completing the PAI is understood to mean the time from the       inspection scheduling request through notification to the       Center of inspectional findings.                           Foreign GMP Inspections         The Agency commits to exploration and implementation of the       United States and European Union and the United States and       United Kingdom Good Manufacturing Practice Mutual Inspection       Agreement and future Mutual Recognition Agreements, with       respect to generic new animal drug products subject to       review, starting in FY 2024 for establishments manufacturing       animal/veterinary drugs. The Agency will provide annual       progress updates to the industry.                        Timely Meetings with Industry         The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of       both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences,       workshops) and informal communication by both parties is       critical to ensure high submission quality such that the       above performance goals can be achieved.                      Transparency in the Review Process       Bioequivalence Technical Section meeting process        The Agency will enhance transparency by establishing the       Bioequivalence Technical Section (BETS) meeting process. The       term ``Bioequivalence Technical Section (BETS) meeting''       means an optional meeting for a sponsor seeking further       discussion with the Agency after their receipt of CVM's       response to their submission of bioequivalence study data in       support of their ANADA.        The formalized process is the following: Once CVM receives       a bioequivalence technical section with study data for       review, CVM will schedule the BETS meeting for a date       approximately one month after the date CVM's review of the       technical section is due. The sponsor is expected to submit a       detailed list of questions to CVM by email no later than two       weeks prior to the BETS meeting date to facilitate       preparation for the discussion. The BETS meeting will be a       virtual meeting and will include the CVM scientific reviewer       and CVM team leader to whom the submission has been assigned       for review. CVM will not generate any formal documents after       a BETS meeting (e.g., a memorandum of conference).      Response to request to establish a JINAD file        When a sponsor submits a request to establish a JINAD file,       the Agency will include in its response information       describing its current thinking regarding specific elements       for inclusion in the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls       technical section for the dosage form proposed. The response       will list relevant guidance, regulations, and compendial       expectations relevant to that dosage form.                             Workload Adjustment         For purposes of calculating the workload adjustment, it has       been agreed to reset the base years to a rolling average       comprising the most recent 5-year completed fiscal years. For       example, beginning October 1, 2024 (FY 2025), the base will       comprise Fiscal Years 2019 through 2023. At the start of each       fiscal year thereafter, the base will be adjusted upward by       one year on the upper and lower ends of the range. There will       be no workload adjustment for FY 2024. Workload adjustments       are one-time adjustments, and are calculated annually. The       percent increase in fees will be made if the amount of the       workload adjuster is equal to or greater than one percent       (1%). The weighting factor is the percent of direct review       time spent on each of the six component submission types over       the most recent five-year period.
