 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I hope all of our colleagues had a  productive State work period and an enjoyable Fourth of July.   On Thursday, hundreds of millions of proud Americans joined together  all across our country in town squares, parks, and backyards to cohost  our Nation's 243rd birthday party. As always, the parades and fireworks  and picnics commemorated something serious: our proud national legacy  of liberty. It began in Philadelphia in 1776, and we continue working  to make it manifest to this day.   Celebrating our freedoms also means remembering the great sacrifices  that so many have given in order to protect and preserve them. It is  fitting that here in our Nation's Capital, the fireworks display lights  up our war memorials and the tombs of fallen warriors across the river.  And, of course, we remember also all the men and women currently  serving today.   We Americans have so much to be proud of. Just yesterday, we were  given yet another reason. Instead of taking the weekend off, the U.S.  women's national soccer team finished their time in France by winning  the World Cup. Earlier last week, the U.S. women commemorated  Independence Day early by beating England, and then yesterday, they  defeated the Netherlands--two to nothing--to take first place. Through  grit, teamwork, and dazzling talent, the American women have now raised  the World Cup trophy four times.   A billion viewers around the world tuned in to watch the tournament.  All told, they saw the United States outscore our opponents  collectively by 26 to 3 and follow our victory in the  [[Page S4684]]  last tournament in 2015 with a back-to-back win this time as well.   I know my colleagues join me in offering the Senate's congratulations  to the U.S. women's national soccer team for bringing this honor home.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week, the  Senate will continue to make headway and confirm the President's highly  qualified nominees for important Federal offices.   We will begin by considering Daniel Bress, who has been nominated to  serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Bress is  a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Virginia School of  Law. Clerkships after law school included time at the Supreme Court  clerking for the late Justice Scalia. Since then, he has built an  impressive reputation in private practice.   I look forward to continuing the work of our colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee, who favorably recommended Mr. Bress to the floor,  when we vote to advance his nomination later today and vote on his  confirmation later this week.   After him, the Senate will weigh three nominees for district court  vacancies in Florida, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. After them, we will  continue to staff up the executive branch with nominees for important  posts in the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, and the  EPA.   As I have said continually, I am sorry that it is necessary to file  cloture on uncontroversial district court and Assistant Secretary  nominees, but notwithstanding that hurdle, I am pleased that the  Senate's modest rules change from several months back is proving  successful and will enable us to get through this whole list of  impressive professionals this very week. I look forward to getting  these amply-qualified nominees on the job so they can go to work for  the country and the American people can be governed by the government  they elected.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the postcloture time on the Bress nomination  expire at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9 and that, if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I further ask  unanimous consent that following disposition of the Bress nomination,  the Senate vote on the pending cloture motions on the following  nominations in the order listed: Executive Calendar Nos. 47, 51, and  52; that if cloture is invoked, the confirmation votes occur on  Wednesday, July 10, at a time to be determined by the majority leader  in consultation with the Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry be discharged from  further consideration of S. Res. 208 and that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 9; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume the consideration of the Bress nomination. Finally, I ask  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:50 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 9, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
