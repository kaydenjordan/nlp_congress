 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, well, this amendment is actually quite simple.  It says that U.S. taxpayers should not subsidize coal-fired power  plants built in other countries.   Under the Obama administration, the Treasury Department issued  guidance saying that the United States, through multilateral  development banks, would no longer fund or support the construction of  such plants in foreign countries. Unfortunately, President Trump has  rolled back these efforts, and, in essence, the Trump administration is  saying to the American people that American tax dollars should go  overseas to subsidize fossil fuels and coal-fired power plants.   I support, as many in this body do on both sides of the aisle, the  efforts of multilateral development banks. In fact, the use of  America's power in that sense, through entities such as the World Bank,  is a great way for us to contribute to development across the globe and  use that soft power in a way that potentially keeps us from having to  go in a different direction. But we should not be using U.S. dollars on  projects that subsidize foreign sources of pollution that contribute to  increased carbon in our atmosphere and worsen climate change.   Now, there are some that say that the science is not settled on this  question. The people who are saying that, I am not quite sure where  they are getting their science. Climate change is real. We really don't  need a lot of evidence, even recently, to reinforce the notion that  climate change is real. Extreme weather events are real, and they are  making that point in ways that no discussion on this floor could ever  do. Unfortunately, experts are telling us it is only going to get  worse.   Congress should not be encouraging the use of American taxpayer  dollars to support coal-fired plants overseas. This amendment takes a  stand and says that we will not support these sorts of irresponsible  projects.   Here in Congress we continually advocate for the responsible use of  taxpayer dollars. And for the most part on this floor, we continue to  advocate for efforts that will reduce carbon emissions in order to  protect the environment, not just for ourselves, but for generations to  come.   Using American dollars to support coal plants in developing countries  is not responsible. It is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It  is not good for our environment.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.   I just encourage my colleagues to think about this as an opportunity  to stand up for the environment, stand up for responsible use of the  American tax dollar, and keep in mind that we work really hard here on  this floor to develop policy in this country that does not pass on to  future generations a planet that is at greater risk than the one we  inherited.   When it comes to the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars going overseas, we  ought to be able to clearly say that those dollars should be used in a  way that contributes to the development of those nations, but in a way  that does not undermine the quality of life across the globe and across  the decades and centuries to come.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645
