 Mr. Speaker, less science, more pollution--that is,  unbelievably, the Republican plan.   I want to just refer to what my colleague said. This is not long-ball  time. This is emergency time where we have to deal with a worldwide  environmental crisis, and this bill is just the latest attack on clean  air and clean water. And as the threat of climate change becomes  increasingly clear, Republicans are trying to reverse the progress that  we have made to address this global challenge.   President Trump proposed gutting the Environmental Protection Agency,  and this week he signed an executive order to ignore the effects of  climate change, increase drilling on Federal lands, and undo efforts to  promote renewable energy.   Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have voted to block environmental  protections. Republicans are replacing President Obama's Clean Power  Plan with, essentially, a dirty power plan that will pollute our air  and contaminate our water and put our children and our grandchildren at  risk. Those actions further confirm Republicans' place on the wrong  side of history.   It is time for America to lead, not to ignore reality. We should be  investing in clean, job-producing energy. We should be at the forefront  of the fight against climate change.   My constituents and most Americans expect to drink clean water and  breathe fresh air. They want to protect our planet for future  generations. Republicans, today, have it backward. We need more science  and less pollution.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and resist those attacks on  our environment.
