 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for my  first floor speech to stand with women across the country to  commemorate what should have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade  this past weekend.   This decision had guaranteed every woman and girl in our country the  freedom to make decisions about their own bodies. Yet, 7 months ago,  our radical Supreme Court ripped that freedom away.   In today's America, there are millions of women who won't be able to  have a say in their own futures. This came as a direct result of  extremist Republicans and their decades-long war on reproductive  healthcare.   Instead of focusing and delivering for Americans, Republicans have  proposed and prioritized a national abortion ban. Let's be clear:  Abortion is healthcare, and abortion should be accessible to every  woman in our country.   For this reason, I rise today strongly in support of the Women's  Health Protection Act to make Roe v. Wade the law of the land.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chair, releasing our Strategic  Petroleum Reserves helps us respond to emergencies, supply chain  disruptions, and disasters, and have been utilized by Presidents of  both parties, including the former administration.   Today, thanks to President Biden's use of the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, gas prices are down, saving the average family $170 a month.   While consumers are just now recovering from record costs and getting  back on their feet, oil and gas companies are sitting on billions of  dollars and thousands of unused but approved permits that they could be  using to boost production right now.   The last thing these oil companies need is more Federal land while  they sit back and watch the American people suffer.   This bill will not make energy cheaper, but it will harm our planet.  If we want our children to have a future, we must fight for climate  justice.   To my Republican colleagues from California, this bill could result  in leasing Federal land on the Outer Continental Shelf, including our  very own coasts here in California.   Will you vote to endanger our beautiful coastline back home? Will you  vote to jeopardize the jobs that our coastal economy provides?   This Republican bill puts polluters ahead of the American people. Our  planet is in distress. Storms are getting stronger, faster, and more  powerful, while wildfires take lives and destroy homes, and floods  devastate crops and communities throughout our Nation.   While Republicans in Congress sit back and do nothing to address the  climate crisis, Democrats know that we must act.   That is why I am introducing an amendment, which blocks  implementation of this bill until the Secretary of Energy certifies to  Congress that leasing will not increase harmful greenhouse gas  pollution.   My amendment would stop this Republican giveaway to big polluters in  its tracks. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the planet,  ``yes'' for our children's future, and ``yes'' for this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
