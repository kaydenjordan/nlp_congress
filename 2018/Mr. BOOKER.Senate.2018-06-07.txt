 Mr. Chairman, I will yield to you under almost every  circumstance.    Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to  the nomination of Kenneth Marcus to serve as the Assistant Secretary  for Civil Rights at the Department of Education. One of the most  critical functions of the Department of Education is the role in  enforcing Federal civil rights and upholding the protection of  students' civil rights in schools.   The Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Education is a  particularly important instrument in enforcing civil rights in schools,  protecting those precious rights of our children, and ensuring that  schools provide students with access to equal educational opportunities  and a nondiscriminatory environment in which to learn. It is an idea we  have in our country that it is fundamental that we have a level playing  field and abundant opportunity for all kids, no matter what their  background is.   The continued need for this office is clear. In fact, during the  Obama administration, the Office for Civil Rights and the Department of  Education handled 76,000 complaints over 8 years and issued dozens of  policy guidance documents to help schools better protect and preserve  civil rights of students.   In the last year alone, or year and a half, we have seen what is  clearly an abdication of this leadership in the Trump administration  and what that has meant for the protection of civil rights for our  country's children and for our country's students. We have seen an  Office for Civil Rights that has rolled back protections for LGBTQ  students, an office that has rolled back protections for students with  disabilities, and an office that is set on gutting the very mission of  the office itself, which is to protect all of our students from  discrimination and empower them with equal opportunities to succeed.   The confirmation of Kenneth Marcus would be another blow to the civil  rights of our students. Mr. Marcus is someone who, in his record and in  his testimony to my colleagues on the Senate HELP Committee, has  demonstrated that he possesses at best a disturbing apathy and at worst  a wanton disregard for the importance, if not urgency, of protecting  the rights of our kids in school.   When Mr. Marcus was asked by Senator Murray to name an example of  something--anything--that Donald Trump had said or done when it comes  to discrimination or civil rights that he disagrees with, and Mr.  Marcus could not name any area of disagreement. He couldn't find a  single disagreement in the way that Donald Trump demeaned Americans  with disabilities or how the President has spoken about Mexicans or  even the way the President has issued policies that attack the rights  of Muslims or the rights of LGBTQ Americans. There was no disagreement  mentioned whatsoever.   When he was asked during his confirmation hearing if as Assistant  Secretary he would intervene in an instance where Black students in a  school district were receiving lower quality teachers, fewer books,  fewer AP classes, and fewer educational resources than White students,  one would expect his answer to have been: Yes, I would intervene. Yes,  I would stand up for equality. Instead, Mr. Marcus refused to say that  he would step in in such a hypothetical circumstance.   When Senator Murphy asked about disparities in school districts that  were suspending or expelling five times as many Black students for the  same set of behaviors compared to White students, instead of just  saying the obvious thing--that this is wrong, that the same behavior  necessitates the same disciplinary action--instead of saying something  as simple as that, Mr. Marcus went on to say this:         ``I believe that disparities of that size are grounds for       concern, but my experience says that one needs to approach       each compliant, or compliance review, with an open mind and a       sense of fairness to find out what the answers are. I will       tell you that I have seen what appeared to be inexcusable       disparities that were the result of paperwork errors, they       just got the numbers wrong.''    I don't know how much of the data on this issue of disciplinary  inequality Mr. Marcus has seen, but it is abundantly clear that for  someone who wants to be in this position, they should understand the  crisis we have with discipline in this country. The data has shown that  even in preschool--from the age of 4 years old--Black preschool kids  are 3.6 times more likely to receive an out-of-school suspension than  White preschool kids. Again, that is also for the same infraction.    This is not about getting the numbers wrong. This is about being  aware of a problem we have in this country that fuels the school-to- prison pipeline. It is a problem that is so severe that I fought in a  bipartisan way to get an amendment about school expulsions in the Every  Student Succeeds Act. This is a problem that is so severe that in 2014  the Department of Education issued guidance clarifying that schools  must administer discipline without discrimination on the basis of race,  color, or national origin. The guidance provided important information  and support for schools to create a safer, more inclusive environment.  We know this problem is not going away, because just last month a new  report from the Government Accountability Office concluded that Black  students, boys, and  [[Page S3273]]  students with disabilities were still significantly overrepresented in  disciplinary action.   What we need is a Department of Education that is going to stand up  for kids on problems that we know exist. I was stunned that this is a  candidate who doesn't even acknowledge the urgency in protecting LGBTQ  kids. And at a time of such crisis, Secretary Betsy DeVos continues to  fail to protect the rights of all of our students, just this week, she  called discrimination against LGBTQ students in schools ``an issue for  Congress and the courts to settle,'' abdicating any responsibility.   That is unacceptable, and I don't understand. We have children who  are literally under attack. We face a crisis in this country when it  comes to LGBTQ youth. This is not an argument over facts. The facts are  clear: LGBT youths face a stunning level of prejudice and  discrimination inside and outside of schools, starting at a young age.  We know that LGBT youths are two times more likely than their  heterosexual peers to be physically assaulted in school. LGBT youths  are four times as likely to attempt suicide.   According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 34 percent of gay and  lesbian youth students were bullied on school property, and 13 percent  report not going to school because of fear for their safety. This kind  of harassment has no place in our classrooms or schools or anywhere in  the United States. It is far too common, from discriminating  disciplinary practice to physical violence against our kids, and we  have work to do in this country to keep all children safe, to treat all  children equally, to give every kid a fair shot in schools to make it  and thrive. Yet we are trying to elevate someone to one of the most  significant positions in our land to protect children who has a  disregard and an apathy toward the compelling and continuing problems  in our schools.   When I think about the role of the Federal Government in protecting  children, I think about a picture that, as soon as I walk out of my  office, the picture is there, and it is that picture from Norman  Rockwell of Ruby Bridges trying to walk to school, at the age of 6, to  become the first Black child to attend a White elementary school in the  South. The photo of her--and the famous painting--is jarring when you  see it. It is a reminder to me every day when I leave my office about  the roles and responsibilities we have in this body. The hate that was  being spewed on her--Ruby Bridges--was plainly evident.   I am telling you, if you visit schools right now and talk to some of  our children who are being bullied and intimidated, they can speak to  that kind of hate as well. You can still feel the pain and hatred  echoing from our past, and you can see it. You can see it echoing in  our present. She was determined, and, most importantly, she was not  alone. At the age of 6, walking to school, Ruby Bridges walked not  alone but, as Norman Rockwell's picture captures, she walked with  Federal Marshals, and they stood with her. She was not alone. She had  government folks who said: Your rights are my rights. Your future is my  future. We pledge an oath to be a nation of liberty and nation not for  some but for all--that ``injustice anywhere,'' as King said, ``is a  threat to justice everywhere.''   The Federal Government alone is not enough to educate our kids. It is  about local communities that keep them safe. It is about those soccer  coaches. It is about the drama teacher. It is about the English  teacher. It is about the love and the kindness and the nurturing  environment that is the common standard in all of our schools in  America in every State. We have seen from history that there is a role  for us to play in keeping folks safe. There are aberrations in our  country where hatred still thrives, where discrimination still exists,  where there is a role for us to play, and we can't surrender that role.   We can't retreat from our vigilance in protecting every child in  America. That is why the Office for Civil Rights and the Department of  Education are so critical and must be led by someone who understands  our history and understands the urgent work that still needs to be  done. We need a person in this role who is committed to every single  child no matter who they are and a person who sees within that child  their truth, their divinity, their limitless potential, their promise,  and how we as a nation need them to succeed.   We have a long way to go. There is work still to do. Children in this  country who are hurting now need champions in positions of high office.  That is why I oppose the nomination of Mr. Marcus. He is not the  person, by his own testimony, who sees our children, who will protect  all of our children, who understands their crises, and hears their  cries. I will be voting against his nomination.   I yield the floor.
