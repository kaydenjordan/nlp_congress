 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please join me in  protecting American workers by terminating U.S. participation in the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UNFCCC  charges signatories to work to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations  in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human  interference with the climate system.   The institution's mission to prevent dangerous human interference  with the climate system precludes the body from investigating potential  natural causes of climate variation and binds member states to act in  the interest of human safety even in the face of scientific  uncertainty.  [[Page H935]]    Together, these provisions require treaty signers to take significant  actions to curb their economic output without considering the  scientific basis for such actions or the effect such actions will have  on the environment.   The Paris accords present a prime example of the inefficacy of the  UNFCCC framework. The accords received major domestic blowback given  the deep GHG restrictions imposed on our Nation relative to the world's  major polluters; namely, China. Even if our GHG emissions could be  eliminated completely overnight, it would have no impact globally.  None. Chinese emissions would make up the difference, and the result is  the U.S. economy would be unnecessarily crippled, while the CCP's  economy would grow unencumbered.   The UNFCCC further requires that industrialized nations support  climate change action in developing countries on top of aid already  provided to these countries. Developing countries like China; like if  anybody here thinks they are still developing, well, I guess that is  why you have been sending our jobs over there for 40 years. We are  forced to pay for and bail them out. This amounts to the U.S. taxpayer  paying for and bailing out Chinese green industries at the expense of  U.S. jobs. We are tired of it. Put plainly, remaining party to a treaty  requiring our Nation to fund the offshoring of manufacturing jobs, our  very own jobs, should be met with contempt across this political  spectrum.   Finally, the UNFCCC's leadership has made clear that the treaty has  nothing to do with environmental policy. It is, quite frankly, an  effort to reshape the world's economy to eliminate free and competitive  markets. Former UNFCCC's Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres stated  as much. This is what she said: ``This is the first time in the history  of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally,  within a defined period of time, to change the economic development  model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the  industrial revolution.'' Free markets.   If the U.S. wants to impose significant economic harm on its own  citizens and overturn the free market economic system, it should be  done under the constitutional system in this body, not by the dictates  of the international community.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).    Madam Speaker, I would just say to my friends on the other  side of the aisle, stop obfuscating, stop sending our jobs overseas.  Start realizing what we have done together in this Chamber to our  citizens who want to work in their jobs in their country.   This has done nothing but overseas our jobs, outsource our jobs.  Let's not continue that process.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.
