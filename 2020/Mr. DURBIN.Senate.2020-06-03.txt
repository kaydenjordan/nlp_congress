 I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from  Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the  Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I came to the floor of the  Senate to ask for consent on the simple, timely Senate resolution  sponsored by nearly half of the Members of this Chamber. What did the  resolution call for? Well, it urged the United States to join global  coronavirus vaccine and treatment efforts. That doesn't sound like a  radical idea, does it? In the midst of a global pandemic that is  causing so much suffering and so many deaths, it would seem that asking  the United States to join other countries of the world in searching for  therapies and vaccines is just common sense.   We don't know where or when a vaccine will be discovered. We don't  know if an effective treatment will be discovered in the United States  or in some other place. Certainly, with the respected medical and  scientific leadership in the United States, you would hope that it  would be here, but let's be honest. If a safe and effective vaccine  against the coronavirus is discovered in some other country, the United  States would want to be there and be part of the discussion about its  production and distribution. Wouldn't we? That is all this resolution  says.   Why not team up with allies around the world since we are all looking  for the same thing--a safe and effective vaccine. Whether that vaccine  is stamped ``Made in the USA'' or is made in some other country is  secondary. Is it safe? Is it effective? Will it save lives? Do we  really want the American people to be left out of such an effort? It  was a global effort to eliminate smallpox, Ebola, polio, and so many  other deadly diseases we took for granted. We were all in it together.   These viruses and diseases don't know any boundaries. People around  the world have the same fears and concerns that we have in the United  States about what we are paying in price of suffering and death until  we find a way to avoid it. This resolution would just call on the  United States to be part of a global effort to find a therapy and a  vaccine, but this resolution was blocked here in the Senate. Since  then, since the 2 weeks that have passed, we have lost over 100,000  American lives. Sadly, the number still grows. This has been 100,000  lives in just a few months--the same number of American casualties in  the wars of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined.   What was President Trump's response? Was there empathy or a message  of national unity or healing during this tragic moment? No. Once again,  President Trump refused to take any responsibility for leadership  during this crisis. Sadly, he has cast blame in every direction and  ignored his own responsibility amid a deadly global pandemic that has  had devastating consequences for the American people.  [[Page S2671]]    Sadly, we lead the world in infections and death, but President Trump  has decided that now is the moment in history for the United States to  pull out of the World Health Organization--the same body that is  heading the global pandemic response. What is he thinking--that we  would walk away from the organization that has called to the table  countries from around the world in an effort to find a safe and  effective vaccine? Here we are, on the 40th anniversary of the World  Health Organization's historic achievement in eradicating small pox,  stumbling along with a President who is more interested in settling a  score, casting blame, and finding ways to divide us. Once again, the  majority of his party here in the Senate is not chiming in and joining  us in this effort to pass this resolution.   While we continue to have some of the world's best researchers and  experts, it is plausible that a vaccine will be found and developed  elsewhere. In a rush to research and validate a vaccine, ramp up  production, address global allocation and supply needs, ensure  affordability and access worldwide, and make sure the United States  gets its fair share of any safe and effective vaccine, where will we  stand if the President insists on being on the sidelines, unengaged?  When the United States pursues this Trump go-it-alone approach while  the rest of the world is working together, where does that leave us?  Pride cometh before the fall.   Just as with the smallpox effort, a global, collaborative approach  makes obvious sense, and it will save American lives. Joining forces  with other countries around the world will help to speed the  development and eventual distribution of the coronavirus vaccine we  desperately seek.   Do you want to know what one Republican Senator from Tennessee said  about this? He said: ``I disagree with the President's decision.''   Withdrawing U.S. membership from the WHO could, among other things,  interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of  a vaccine. No one knows where this vaccine will eventually be perfected  or produced. God willing, it will be soon. Yet why shouldn't we be  joining in this global effort? Why? Why, at this moment in history, has  President Trump said we are stepping away from the organization that  leads this effort?   Given this President's--sadly, I hate to use the word--``obsession''  with blaming everyone but himself for mishandling this situation, maybe  his dereliction of duty should come as no surprise, but what a bitter,  bitter disappointment it is.   I return to the floor to ask unanimous consent on a straightforward  resolution--a simple resolution that should have passed without any  fanfare by a voice vote unanimously in the Senate. This resolution  calls on the United States to join in the global effort to find a safe  and effective vaccine--something that we have done consistently  throughout our history until this President took office.   Ultimately, let's remember that this is a pandemic that affects the  world, and any solution has to be a worldwide solution as well. We  cannot isolate ourselves from the international ways of finding  treatments and the development of a vaccine. Doing so not only wastes  time but risks there being a loss of life.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 579    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further  consideration of S. Res. 579, a resolution encouraging the  international community to remain committed to collaboration and  coordination to mitigate and prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and  urging renewed United States leadership and participation in any global  efforts on therapeutics and vaccine development and delivery to address  COVID-19 and prevent further deaths; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble  be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I have respect for my colleague and thank  him for his positive statement about the work to be done in the Foreign  Relations Committee. There is nothing in this resolution that preempts  or tries to impact on anything he mentioned. The operative language is  a few words, ``urging renewed United States leadership and  participation in any global efforts on therapeutics and vaccine  development and delivery to address COVID-19 and prevent further  death.''   How we do that, whether we create an agency or not, this is simply an  expression of policy that I hope we can embrace. I will be back if we  don't move forward with alternatives. Lives are at stake, and we should  be part of the international conversation to avoid it.    Certainly.    Mr. President, Monday, President Trump stood in the Rose  Garden and called for the use of military force against individuals who  have been gathering across the country protesting racism and police  brutality against Black Americans. This historic call for empowering  the Commander in Chief to militarize law enforcement in our Nation  pushes this President's reach for new Executive authority to the most  extreme level.   This follows the President's tweets since last week, threatening to  turn ``vicious dogs''--his words--on protesters outside the White House  and quoting the racist phrase from the 1967 Miami police chief,  stating: ``When the looting starts, the shooting starts,'' bringing to  mind, sadly, for many, shameful moments in our Nation's struggle for  civil rights.   President Trump said nothing to address the anguish felt by many in  this country, particularly people of color, and instead called on  Governors to ``dominate the streets,'' as though the Americans, who  peacefully exercise their right to protest, are an enemy force.   Initially, Defense Secretary Esper went even further when he referred  to cities as a ``battlespace.'' I am heartened by the fact that he has  made it clear that he does not support the President's suggestion of  militarizing the police forces and police across America. These calls  by the President to militarize cities across America ignore that for  far too long he urged law enforcement to ``dominate,'' as the President  often says, rather than to protect and serve, which is exactly what is  contributing to the challenge we face today.   The other night, minutes before Mayor Bowser's 7 p.m. curfew came  into effect, the President used law enforcement personnel to use tear  gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators in LaFayette Square  across the street from the White House. They even beat these peaceful  demonstrators with batons and shields. There are conflicting reports as  to whether the National Guard participated in the violence. I have made  a direct inquiry to the Department of Defense, and they have denied it.   According to press reports, the assault began with law enforcement  kneeling, not to express any solidarity  [[Page S2673]]  with any racism efforts as we have seen some police officers do across  the country; instead, they were kneeling to put on gas masks to protect  themselves from the weapons they were readying to fire.   As soon as this gathering was dispersed, the President marched across  LaFayette Square to St. John's Episcopal Church. The Attorney General,  the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  all followed--only the battle that they were witnessing was against  Americans using their voices to stop racism who got in the way of a  Presidential photo opportunity.   I simply cannot understand what the President and each of these  senior officials were thinking, if they were consciously deciding to be  part of this by taking a stroll in the aftermath of the violence in  Lafayette Square and whether they approved of that treatment of their  fellow Americans.   The Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, DC,  said she was not even given a courtesy call by the White House ahead of  the President's action. In fact, the bishop was outraged by the use of  physical force and tear gas in the shadow of her church to remove  peaceful protesters so that the church and the Bible could be used for  some photo opportunity.   President Trump has ``not acknowledged the agony of our country right  now,'' she said in an interview. ``Everything he has said and done is  to inflame violence.''   President Trump's actions violate the sanctity of our First Amendment  freedoms and represent an abuse of his authority. We know this  President well after more than 3 years. As shocking as Monday night's  events were, they represent through and through who this President  really is. It is wrong.   The American people will have the last word in November, but I am  encouraged to see that in my home State of Illinois officials have  rejected the use of military force and are committed to American's  right to protest. Governor Pritzker said the President's call to send  troops to Illinois is ``illegal'' and ``ridiculous.'' Chicago Mayor  Lightfoot has called to ``turn our pain into purpose'' and to ``learn  from this moment and move forward together.''   In my hometown of Springfield, IL, on Tuesday, three high school  students, young African-American women, sponsored a Black Lives Matter  rally, and 1,000 people in Springfield, IL, gathered peacefully to  demonstrate against racism in law enforcement. No windows were broken.  No one was arrested. They exercised their constitutional rights, and I  am damn proud of them. They speak for me and for America; that we still  have the right to stand up and express ourselves, and they did so  effectively.   Right now those around the President should look themselves in the  mirror and ask whose agenda they are serving and whether it is the  right agenda for America. The collective leadership of our military,  civilian and uniformed alike, needs to decide what kind of leaders they  want to be for the men and women in uniform they command and what  legacy they want to be associated with. Monday night was not the legacy  this country deserves.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post  article and the statements of the Episcopal bishop of Washington be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From the Washington Post]   Episcopal Bishop on President Trump: `Everything He Has Said and Done                          Is To Inflame Violence'              (By Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam Bailey)         The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of       Washington, was seething.        President Trump had just visited St. John's Episcopal       Church, which sits across from the White House. It was a day       after a fire was set in the basement of the historic building       amid protests over the death of George Floyd in the custody       of Minneapolis police.        Before heading to the church, where presidents have       worshiped since the days of James Madison, Trump gave a       speech at the White House emphasizing the importance of law       and order. Federal officers then used force to clear a large       crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the street between the       White House and the church, apparently so Trump could make       the visit.        ``I am outraged,'' Budde said in a telephone interview a       short time later, pausing between words to emphasize her       anger as her voice slightly trembled.        She said she had not been given any notice that Trump would       be visiting the church and did not approve of the manner in       which the area was secured for his appearance.        ``I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington       and was not given even a courtesy call, that they would be       clearing [the area] with tear gas so they could use one of       our churches as a prop,'' Budde said.        She excoriated the president for standing in front of the       church--its windows boarded up with plywood--holding up a       Bible, which Budde said ``declares that God is love.''        ``Everything he has said and done is to inflame violence,''       Budde of the president. ``We need moral leadership, and he's       done everything to divide us.''        In a written statement, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry,       head of the Episcopal denomination, accused Trump of using       ``a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political       purposes.''        ``This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our       country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal       us,'' Curry wrote.        ``The prophet Micah taught that the Lord requires us to `do       justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our God,' '' he       continued, calling on Trump and others in power to be moral.       ``For the sake of George Floyd, for all who have wrongly       suffered, and for the sake of us all, we need leaders to       help us to be `one nation, under God, with liberty and       justice for all.' ''        Budde and Curry are among the pantheon of progressive       religious leaders who have long been critical of Trump's       political agenda. The Episcopal Church's policies include       supporting abortion rights, refugee resettlement, an       expansion of health care and other issues that Trump has       opposed or not embraced. According to the Pew Research       Center, 49 percent of Episcopalians are Democrats or lean       Democratic, compared with 39 percent of church members who       are Republican or lean Republican.        Trump's longtime religious allies, who are far more       conservative on both domestic and foreign policy, saw his       walk to St. John's much differently. ``What kind of church I       need PERMISSION to attend,'' tweeted Pastor Mark Burns of       South Carolina after Budde and others said Trump should have       let them know he was coming. ``Jesus welcomes All.''        Johnnie Moore, a spokesman for several of Trump's       evangelical religious advisers, tweeted favorably about the       incident as well.        ``I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly       & in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette       Square to St. John's Church defying those who aim to derail       our national healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,'' he       wrote. ``After just saying, `I will keep you safe.' ''        Trump did not enter St. John's on Monday evening. No one       associated with the church was present for his visit.        Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University who       studies Christian nationalism, said the president's       appearance was an attempt to promote the idea of America as a       distinctly Christian nation after his Rose Garden speech.        ``Going to the church, not going in it, not meeting with       any clergy, holding up a Bible, but not quoting any       scripture, after an authoritarian speech, was about using the       religious symbolism for his ends,'' Whitehead said.        ``It was a signal to the people that embrace the idea of a       Christian nation, that he will defend Christianity in the       public sphere,'' Whitehead said. ``He said he'll make America       safe. That raised the question, for whom? It's largely for       white, mostly Protestant America.''        Budde--who spent 18 years in as a rector in Minneapolis       before being elected bishop of the Washington diocese--said       the Episcopal Church disassociates itself from the messages       offered by the president.        ``We hold the teachings of our sacred texts to be so so       grounding to our lives and everything we do,'' she said. ``It       is about love of neighbor and sacrificial love and justice.''        Following a tradition set by President Franklin D.       Roosevelt, Trump attended a service at St. John's before his       swearing-in ceremony in 2017. He visited the church again       that year to mark a national day of prayer for victims of       Hurricane Harvey and in 2019 on St. Patrick's Day.        Budde said she learned he was headed back to the yellow,       19th-century building on Monday by watching the news.        ``No one knew this was happening,'' she said. ``I don't       want President Trump speaking for St. John's.''        The Rev. Robert W. Fisher, the church rector, said he felt       blindsided by the visit. Usually, the White House gives the       church at least 30 minutes' notice before the president comes       by.        ``We want St. John's to be a space for grace, as a place       where you can breathe,'' he said. ``Being used as a prop, it       really takes away from what we're trying to do.''        Earlier in the day, Fisher said, he and other clergy were       outside the church handing out water bottles and granola bars       to protesters, and expressing solidarity with their cause. He       said he left the area to be interviewed on television about       the damage from the fire the previous night and later watched       images of the protest being dismantled ``with disbelief.''        Fisher, 44, became the rector of St. John's in June 2019       and has not yet hosted a presidential visit. The church       usually draws  [[Page S2674]]       about 400 people on a typical weekend. But it has been closed       since mid-March due to the broad shutdown restrictions in       place to combat the novel coronavirus.        Damage to the building from Sunday night's fire and       vandalism will cost at least $20,000, Fisher said. But he       said the destruction should not become the focus of what has       been happening in the streets outside the White House.        Fisher said that when people have talked about the church       being burned, he has tried to redirect them, saying it was       likely one person who does not represent the majority of       people protesting.        ``That has pulled away from the more important message that       we have to address racism in this country,'' he said.     I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from  Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the  Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from  Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the  Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the  Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith), and the Senator from Montana (Mr.  Tester) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, Americans owe a great debt of gratitude to  the healthcare heroes on the frontlines of the fight against the COVID- 19 virus.   Today I would like to spend a minute talking about one special group  of those healthcare workers: immigrants.   Consider this: One out of every six healthcare and social service  workers in America is an immigrant--3 million out of 18 million  immigrants. They are playing a critical role in the battle against the  pandemic. Yet our broken immigration laws do not allow many of them to  fulfill their dreams of actually becoming Americans.   I have come to the floor today to tell the story of one of our  immigrant healthcare heroes. I will continue to highlight these stories  in the coming weeks. There has been so much negative publicity about  immigrants. Yet, when you follow what is happening in hospitals across  America--large and small, rural and urban--and so many times you ask  ``Doctor, where were you born?'' you find they weren't born in the  United States, but they came here to practice medicine, and now their  work is saving lives every day.   I invite my colleagues and others to share stories from their own  communities and their own States and to use the social media hashtag  ``Immigrant Health Heroes.''   Thousands of immigrant health workers are suffering because of a  serious problem in our immigration system. It is called the green card  backlog. If you are not in immigrant status, you may not know anything  about it, but trust me, they do.   This backlog puts them and their families at risk of losing their  immigration status, and it hinders their ability to join in the fight  against COVID-19. Under current law, there are not nearly enough  immigrant visas--also known as green cards--available each year. As a  result, many immigrants in the United States are stuck  [[Page S2686]]  in crippling backlogs, not just for years but for decades. Close to 5  million future Americans--close to 5 million--are in line waiting for  green cards. Hundreds of thousands are working in the United States on  a temporary visa while many more are waiting abroad, separated from  their American families.   Only 226,000 family green cards and 140,000 employment green cards  are available each year. The backlogs are a real hardship on these  families caught in immigration limbo. For example, children in many of  these families age out and face deportation. While their parents are  waiting for the green card, the child reaches the age where they are  deported, at age 21.   The green card backlog includes thousands of doctors currently  working in the United States on temporary visas. These doctors face  many restrictions due to their temporary status, such as not being able  to take shifts at hospitals in COVID-19 hotspots where they may be  desperately needed.   The solution to the green card backlog is very clear: Increase the  number of green cards.   In 2013, I joined a group of four Republicans and four Democrats who  authored bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Our  bill, which passed the Senate on a strong bipartisan 68-to-32 vote,  would have eliminated this green card backlog.   Last year I introduced the RELIEF Act, legislation based on the 2013  comprehensive immigration reform bill, which would clear the backlogs  for all immigrants waiting in line for green cards within 5 years. I  will keep fighting to help these immigrants here in the United States  who simply want a chance to continue to serve this Nation.   Last month I joined with my colleagues--Senators Perdue of Georgia,  Young of Indiana, Cornyn of Texas, Coons of Delaware, and Leahy of  Vermont--to introduce legislation to quickly address the plight of  immigrant doctors and nurses stuck in this green card backlog.   This backlog poses a significant risk to our ability to effectively  respond to this pandemic. Our bill, the Healthcare Workforce Resilience  Act, is a temporary stopgap effort that will strengthen our healthcare  workforce and improve healthcare for Americans in the midst of this  national emergency.   Our bill would reallocate 25,000 unused immigrant visas for nurses  and 15,000 unused immigrant visas for doctors. These are visas that  Congress has previously authorized but were not used.   It is important to note that our bill requires employers to attest to  a very important fact. They have to attest that immigrants from  overseas who receive these visas will not displace an American worker.  We want to ensure that the beneficiaries of this bill help build our  workforce but not at the expense of those already here in the United  States.   Our bill now has 13 Republican and 13 Democratic cosponsors and broad  support from the medical community. As Congress works on the next  legislation to address the COVID-19 pandemic, I am going to join my  Republican colleagues and push for the Healthcare Workforce Resilience  Act to be included.   Today, let me tell you the story of one immigrant healthcare worker  stuck in this green card backlog waiting indefinitely, for years, and  he would benefit from the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act: Dr.  Parth Mehta, born in India.   As a child, he was inspired to pursue a career in medicine by his  grandfather, who worked as an assistant to a physician, and by his  older sister, who is a surgeon.   Dr. Mehta came to the United States in the year 2004. He has been  here 16 years. He obtained a master's in public health at Saint Xavier  University in the city of Chicago. He then completed his residency in  internal medicine at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago.   In 2010, 10 years ago, Dr. Mehta began working as a hospitalist at  UnityPoint Health Methodist Medical Center in downstate Peoria, IL.   He sent me a letter, and here is what he says about being a doctor:         I feel that it is a great privilege to help people,       comforting them, healing them, and making them better when       they are most vulnerable.    Dr. Mehta lives in Peoria with his wife and his 10-year-old son and  4-year-old daughter, and he writes, in addition:         We have called Peoria home for 10 years now and we love our       community here. We have bought a home here, built a career       here, and we plan to stay in this community as long as we       can.    Now Dr. Mehta is on the frontlines of the pandemic, treating COVID-19  patients. He was also selected as the principal investigator for a  COVID-19 trial for which the hospital has applied, but unfortunately,  Dr. Mehta is one of thousands of doctors who are stuck in this green  card backlog. He has been on a temporary work visa for 13 years. He has  been forced to renew his visa four times since he became a doctor. His  green card petition was filed in 2011, but he will have to wait years  and years and years before he receives a green card.   In the midst of this pandemic, Dr. Mehta's immigration status puts  him at great risk. If, God forbid, he contracts COVID-19 and becomes  disabled or dies, his family would immediately lose their immigration  status and be forced to leave the United States.   Dr. Mehta has written goodbye letters to his wife and kids and  prepared an emergency binder with all the necessary information for his  family if he dies. To keep his family safe, Dr. Mehta has isolated  himself by living in the basement of his home. He is especially worried  about his wife, who has asthma. In March, she was diagnosed with  pneumonia and was hospitalized for 10 days, including a stay in the  intensive care unit.   Here is what Dr. Mehta wrote to me about this:         Seeing COVID patients, treating them, taking care of them,       and saving their lives is part of my job, and I will never       shy away from doing my job. But how is it fair that my family       gets no protection if I die doing my job?    Dr. Mehta's story makes it clear why Congress needs to pass the  Healthcare and Workforce Resilience Act. Under our bill, Dr. Mehta and  thousands of others like him could receive their green cards. They and  their families would get the permanent immigration status they deserve  and be able to use their skills to serve on the frontlines of the  pandemic, where they are needed most.   Don't put a sign in the window saying that you love healthcare  workers, don't come out at 7 at night and beat on a pan to show that  you care for healthcare workers and ignore the reality that this man in  Peoria, IL, is risking his life every day to treat those patients, and  we have written a law that says you are basically not welcome in the  United States.   How can we say this to him, to thousands just like him, doctors and  nurses who are really caring for the people we love and risking their  own lives in the process?   It would be great, in these times of political division, if we could  come together in this Congress to quickly aid these immigrant  healthcare heroes.   The bill that I have introduced with Senator Perdue, Senator Young,  and others is a step toward reality, toward realizing that people just  like these make us a better nation and a stronger nation.   Dr. Mehta and his family, with all their fears, should know that  there are many here in Congress, particularly here in the Senate, who  want to move as quickly as possible and make sure that their lives are  better because they have done so much to make the lives of others  better.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, there are so many critical jobs that go on  around the Capitol that may not always get the spotlight or  appreciation they deserve.   Today, I would like to mention one such amazing person, Pia Corona,  or as she is affectionately known, Ms. Pia.   You see, Pia is a teacher at the Senate Employees Childcare Center, a  caring, nurturing, and deeply special component of the Senate  community.   Six years ago, on the 30th anniversary of the center, then-Senator  Tom Harkin described the teachers and administrators at the center as,  ``some of the unsung heroes of the Senate.''   I couldn't agree more, and it is a privilege to pay special tribute  today to one of those unsung heroes.   This month marks Pia's 25 year anniversary teaching at the center, a  monumental accomplishment that has allowed her the opportunity to have  a lasting impact on countless young lives.   A number of children of my staff were fortunate to have Ms. Pia as a  teacher and cannot say enough wonderful things about her, so much so  that they still keep in touch and bring their children by to visit  years after leaving the center. Elle, Oliver and Leo, just three of  many examples, still recognize Ms. Pia as an impactful figure in their  early lives and in their education.   Pia, a stalwart New York Yankees fan, started at the Senate Employees  Childcare Center in May 1995, always working in the pre-kindergarten  class to help children prepare for the big jump to elementary school  kindergarten. Over the last two and half decades, she taught more than  400 children, including many siblings.   Ms. Pia has a unique understanding of how each child learns  differently and loving ability to meet those individual needs at such a  tender and formative age. Not surprisingly, she is described by her  colleagues as a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on child development,  and her classroom lessons and caring style reflect these incredible  talents.   One of her special field trips was a walk over to the late Senator  John Glenn's office when her students were studying space. A picture of  this outing still hangs at the center.   Pia also helped organize a visit to this very Senate floor for her  class. They listened patiently as the Secretary of the Senate gave her  own pre-K version of School House Rock. It was, without a doubt, the  most well-behaved gathering that the Senate floor has seen in years.   Pia makes such an impression on children that many of her former  students still reach out to her, including one recent college graduate  who wanted to say thank you all these years later. I know children of  some of my staff have returned to the center to read to Ms. Pia's  students during storytime.   As we struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, we have all been  reminded once again of the critical importance of our teachers and  schools. Ms. Pia's students certainly knew that was the case from their  time in her class.   We all remember a teacher or two who made a lasting impact on our  lives growing up--challenging us, inspiring us, nurturing us. Ms. Pia  will surely be one that many remember as just such a special teacher.   I congratulate Pia Corona on her notable anniversary and deeply  meaningful contribution to the Senate community. Our country and our  world need good news and kindness right now. Simply put, that is Ms.  Pia.  [[Page S2692]]                                ____________________
