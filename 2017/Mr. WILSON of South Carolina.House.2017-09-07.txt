 Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere  gratitude and appreciation that I have the opportunity to recognize  Leacy Burke, former communications director for South Carolina's Second  Congressional District. I will always appreciate Leacy for her years of  service on behalf of the people of South Carolina.   A native of South Carolina, Leacy is an esteemed alumna of the  University of South Carolina, where she graduated with both a bachelor  of arts degree in political science and criminal justice, as well as a  master's degree in mass communications, integrated communications.  Beginning as a deputy press secretary for the office in 2015, it has  been an honor to work with such a dedicated public servant making  meaningful provisions for our office.   It is with mixed feelings, but great happiness, that our office bids  Leacy farewell. She is now doing amazing work in her new role as  communications director for Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican, of  Oklahoma. I know her parents, Greg and Denise Burke, and family members  join me in recognizing her achievements.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are for  all persons threatened by Hurricane Irma, from the Caribbean Islands to  South Carolina.                            ____________________
