 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   In 2019, USA Today published the largest public database of  disciplinary records for police officers. They found that fewer than 10  percent of officers in most police forces had been investigated. But of  those who are investigated, most have 10 or more misconduct charges,  and worse, some face more than 100 allegations. Almost all still have  their badges today.   To address this issue, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act  includes a national registry to bring transparency to disciplinary  decisions, to bring transparency to police misconduct, and to bring  transparency to the high cost of irresponsible individuals to  taxpayers.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is about transparency and  sunlight. We need that now more than ever.
