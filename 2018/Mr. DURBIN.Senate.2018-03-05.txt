 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, today is the day--March 5--the deadline  imposed by President Trump on those who are being protected and allowed  to stay in the United States under the DACA Program.   It was last September 5 when President Trump's Attorney General held  a press conference and said: That is it. The protection that is  currently given to 780,000 young people in America to allow them to  stay in this country and pursue their dreams will end on March 5 of  2018--today--780,000 who were brought to the United States as infants,  toddlers, children, and teenagers, who have lived their lives in this  country, who have gone to school, who have never had a serious run-in  with the law, who have gone through criminal background checks, come up  with $500 filing fees, and who were given permission under an Executive  order by President Obama to legally stay in this country for 2 years at  a time. During that period, they would not be deported, and they would  be allowed to work.    Who are these young people? They are known as the Dreamers, although  President Trump hates that term. They are known as the Dreamers because  they represent young people who went to school in America, stood up in  their classroom every day and pledged allegiance to that flag. This is  the only country they have ever known. This was to be the country of  their future, but at some point in their lives, a member of their  family sat down and said: We have to have a serious conversation. You  see, we never filed the papers when we brought you to this country as  an infant, and right now you are undocumented in the United States of  America.   What that means is that any minute, there could be a knock on the  door and you and perhaps your entire family would be asked to leave. I  introduced a bill called the DREAM Act 17 years ago. Senator Hatch was  my cosponsor when I introduced it. The purpose of the DREAM Act was to  say to these young people: We will give you a chance. Though you are  illegal in the eyes of the law in the United States--undocumented--we  will give you a chance to earn your way to legal status, give you a  chance someday to be a citizen of the United States. It will not be  easy. There is no helping hand for you. If you want to go to college,  there will be no Federal assistance for you. You are going to have to  make it on your own. You will have to work and work harder than perhaps  the person sitting next to you at their desk in high school. See if you  can do it. If you can, we will give you your chance.   That is what the DREAM Act said. It passed with a majority vote in  the Senate many times, but it never quite made it to 60 votes, which it  needs to become the law of the land.   President Obama, when he was a Senator in this Chamber, was my  colleague from Illinois. He cosponsored the DREAM Act with me. So the  time came when he was elected President, and I wrote him a letter. Dick  Lugar, Republican of Indiana, joined me in that letter. He supported  the DREAM Act when he served in the Senate. We wrote to President Obama  and said: Can you do anything to give these young people a chance, to  spare them from deportation? He worked on it for 1 year. Then President  Obama came up with something called DACA, a program by Executive order  that gave these young people their chance--780,000 of them went through  the background check, paid their filing fee, and proved they were  eligible.   They were spared for 2 years at a time and allowed to stay in this  country. During the course of the campaign, President Trump said many  strong words about immigration. We remember them well--it is hard to  forget--the words about the wall, words about Mexican rapists, on and  on, but he seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for these kids. Many  times he would say: We have to give them a chance. They are different.   The very first time I met President Donald Trump was minutes after he  had been sworn in. It was at a luncheon here in the Capitol.   I went up to him and said: Congratulations. I want to thank you for  the kind words you said about the Dreamers and those protected by DACA.   He said: Dick, don't worry about those kids. We are going to take  care of those kids.   That is what President Trump said on January 20, 2017. I brought it  up to him several times too. It is an issue that is important to me,  but, more importantly, it is an issue that is critical to the future of  these young people.   Then, what happened on September 5 of last year, just 9 months after  the President was sworn in? His Attorney General held a press  conference and said: That is the end of the protection for these young  people. As of March 5, 2018, no protection.   Then he challenged Congress. He said: Pass a law. Do what you are  supposed to do here in the House and Senate. Pass a law that will  protect these young people.   A number of us took up the President's challenge. We had a bipartisan  effort, six of us--three Democrats and three Republicans--and we worked  through some really hard issues on immigration and on these young  people. I want to salute my colleagues who were part of that: Lindsey  Graham, Republican of South Carolina; Jeff Flake, a Republican of  Arizona; Cory Gardner, a Republican of Colorado; joined with myself and  Michael Bennet, a Democrat of Colorado; Bob Menendez, a Democrat of New  Jersey, and we put together an approach that gave these young people  protection and a fighting chance to prove they deserve to stay in  America.   We felt pretty good about it. The President called a meeting in the  White House on January 9--I remember these dates. I will always  remember them--with about 25 Members of Congress, Democrats and  Republicans, House and Senate. He held an open press conference for an  hour, which is unusual and rarely done in the White House.   We talked about DACA and we talked about Dreamers and we talked about  [[Page S1327]]  what was going to happen next, since the President had given us a  deadline of today, March 5, to do something.   The President outlined what he wanted to see, and then he said in  front of the television cameras: Send me the bill, and I will sign it.  I will take the heat on this one. That was January 9. So a number of  us, the six I mentioned earlier, came together immediately that same  day and said: Let's finish this bill, and let's get it in his hands as  quickly as possible.   By January 11, 2 days later, we were ready. We reached a compromise,  and it truly was a compromise. Parts of it I didn't care for at all,  but that is what we do around here if Democrats and Republicans are  going to produce something that might become a law. We called the  President. We met the President--Senator Graham and I and a number of  others, and he totally rejected what we had done. In fact, the  President went on to reject five other bipartisan proposals to try to  solve this problem.   This is the same President who said on January 9 of this year, ``Send  me a bill, and I will sign it,'' who turned down bipartisan option  after bipartisan option. He just said no.   We had a vote on the floor of the Senate. It has been about 3 weeks  ago now. It was a vote on four different proposals to deal with this  challenge. Not one of those proposals received 60 votes.   The one I had hoped for, a bill with a version of the Dream Act, was  put together by Senator Coons and Senator McCain and brought to the  floor. I remember it had 52 votes. It needed 60 votes. It fell short.  The bipartisan compromise led by Senator Rounds and Senator King with  the President's opposition ended up with 54 votes--6 votes short of  what it needed to pass. Then the President's own immigration proposal  came up here on the floor of the Senate. Now, there are 49 Democrats  and 51 Republicans in the Senate. The President's proposal came up and  got 39 votes--60 votes in opposition. It was a rejection by his own  party and the Democrats in the Senate.   So here we are on March 5. The deadline is here. No bill has passed  the Senate. The House will not even consider the measure--will not take  up any version of the measure. What is at stake? There are 780,000  young people protected by DACA, which officially, by President Trump's  order, ends today.   They have one ray of hope, perhaps two. Two courts have said they are  going to suspend this abolition of DACA until we hear the arguments of  the President's authority in the Constitution. So there is a  temporary--and I underline temporary--injunction in place while these  cases are pending, but I can tell you as a Member of the Senate and as  a lawyer, no one--no one--can predict how long that protection will  last. Is it a matter of days or weeks or months, at best?   That is what these young people live with, this uncertainty.   This humanitarian crisis in this country--and I call it that--was  created by President Trump on September 5. He has failed to agree to  six different bipartisan proposals to solve the problem he created, and  now these lives hang in the balance.   Well, who are they? Who are these young people?   I was with one of them earlier today. Her name is Ana Flores. Ana  grew up in Aurora, IL, and went to the public schools there. She is a  very bright young woman who was brought to the United States at the age  of 5 from Mexico by her parents. She is undocumented in America and  lives under the protection of DACA.   What did she do with her life?   She went to the Illinois Institute of Technology, one of the best in  the Nation, and she won a civil engineering degree there. Clark Dietz  is an engineering firm in Illinois that stepped up and said: We want  that bright young woman on our staff as an engineer, and they hired  her.   I met her for the first time today. She is a wonderful person. She  struggled against the odds all of her life. She is protected by DACA, a  program that officially, under President Trump's edict, ends today.   Will Illinois be a better State, Chicago be a better city, the United  States be a better nation with this young lady and her engineering  talents at work for us? Of course, there is no question about it. Why  in the world would we ever want to deport someone who has gone through  our educational system and excelled like this young lady?   She is not the only one, by any means. This is a photo of Elizabeth  Vilchis. She is the 109th Dreamer whom I have spoken about on the floor  of the U.S. Senate. She was brought to the United States at the age of  7. She grew up in Yonkers, NY. As a child, she heard about STEM  subjects--science, technology, engineering, and math. She decided to  make that her life's work. She excelled in math and science and decided  she would be part of the future of this country and took on these  important subjects. She said: ``From that point forward I made pursuing  a career in STEM my responsibility, as an American.''   During high school, Elizabeth was a member of the Honor Society, the  Key Club, the Architecture, Construction and Engineering Program. She  was editor of the yearbook and also played on the volleyball team. She  graduated high school with an Advanced Regents diploma.   She was then accepted into the Honors College at City University, New  York City College.   Remember, these Dreamers--these undocumented students--don't qualify  for Federal assistance to go to school as most kids do. They have to  find another way to work and save their money or take private loans.   She received a Community Service Award from the School of Engineering  4 years in a row for her work organizing engineering education programs  for low-income students. She received a Student Leader Award for her  work with an engineering student association. She was named Volunteer  of the Year 4 years in a row for managing the Manhattan robotics  competition.   I have seen those robotics competitions. A lot of young people in  high school do some amazing things in these competitions, and it  launches a career and a life in the STEM subjects.   Elizabeth graduated with a double major in mechanical engineering and  political science. She worked as an engineer for Samsung for 2 years.  Then she founded a nonprofit organization focused on creating funding  opportunities for early stage technology startups. Today, Elizabeth's  nonprofit has over 700 members. To date, they have raised over $8  million to grow their companies.   She wrote me a letter and Elizabeth said:         To me DACA is my opportunity to give back to the United       States and my family the way I dreamed of since I was 10       years old. It's the ability to help solve the STEM talent       shortage after 15 years of preparing for it and being told it       was impossible. It's the power to say ``No'' to going back to       the shadows and ``Yes'' to serving as a role model for young       girls across the country who aspire to be engineers and       entrepreneurs.    People like Elizabeth are the reason why more than 400 business  leaders signed a letter to Congress urging us to pass the bipartisan  Dream Act.   The letter says:         Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our       economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of       why we will continue to have global competitive advantage.    It would be a personal tragedy for us to deport Elizabeth Vilchis,  but the decision of President Trump to abolish the program that  protects her, sadly, makes that a possibility. If this injunction by  the court is lifted, at that moment, there could be a knock on her  door--or perhaps on the door of the company that hires her or her  engineering firm--and she could be told that her time is up. Under  President Trump, she has to leave the United States of America.    President Trump created this crisis. Instead of working toward a  solution, he has rejected every bipartisan effort that has been sent  his way to save the Dreamers.   What will happen next? Do we have to stand by and watch as these  families are divided, as talented young people like Elizabeth and Ana  are deported? Is that what we are all about? Is that what the President  meant when he told me ``We'll take care of those kids''? That is what  it has come down to.   It is a sad reality that all across America, hundreds of thousands of  these young people now live in fear of deportation. They should be  living, as Elizabeth said, outside the shadows and  [[Page S1328]]  as part of America and its future. What can we do about it? I am at a  loss.   Unless and until this President accepts the responsibility to help us  solve the problem he created, I am afraid we will never be able to  rally the necessary Republican votes to make this a reality. It is up  to President Trump.   In the part of the world that I come from in the Middle West, there  is a saying that I am going to clean up a little bit, and it goes  something like this: Any old mule can kick down a barn door, but it  takes a carpenter to build one. This President has kicked down DACA,  kicked it down to the dirt, and this is the day--the deadline that he  set. The question is, Does he have the will or the heart to rebuild it?   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Ms.  Heitkamp) is necessarily absent.
