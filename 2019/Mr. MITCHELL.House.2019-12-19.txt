 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady for being such a  leader on this.   I saw the impact of NAFTA on my State of Michigan, on my community,  and my family. Jobs disappeared at an astounding rate, including my  dad's job working an assembly line at an auto plant. I saw the unfair  treatment of farmers trying to export their products.   I live in a district with a major border crossing to Canada, the Blue  Water Bridge. So I also saw the importance of trade with our neighbors.  But trade must be fair, balanced, and not disadvantage hardworking  American families.   NAFTA failed miserably at that.   USMCA is a massive improvement over NAFTA in more ways than time  allows me to detail.   America needs the USMCA. We need it now. So let's finish this drawn- out process, pass the bill, and urge the Senate to proceed with speed.
