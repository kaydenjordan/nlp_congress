 Madman President, I rise today to honor the life  of Mrs. Barbara Hardcastle, who passed away on January 13, 2020, at the  age of 94.   Mrs. Hardcastle was trailblazer and a fierce advocate for her  community and her State. A native of Fort Smith, AK, she also made her  mark in politics and government in California. I was honored to know  her, and so I join her friends and family in grieving her loss.   Barbara Turner was born in Fort Smith on April 6, 1927. She graduated  from Fort Smith High School in 1944 and went on to earn a bachelor's  degree from Fort Smith Junior College. She  [[Page S129]]  married Ben Hardcastle, a banker and World War II veteran, in 1947, and  they would spend almost 63 years together before his passing in 2010.   Early in their married life, Ben accepted a job at the Beverly Hills  Savings and Loan, so they moved to North Hollywood, CA. They  immediately became active in their local church and, as a result, made  friends with many Hollywood actors, including Ronald and Nancy Reagan.   Their friendship with the Reagans led to Barbara's involvement in  California politics, including playing a key role in his race for  Governor of California. She is also credited by many as having  introduced the future President to Jelly Belly candy as he attempted to  stop smoking. Friends and family say she kept him stocked with the  company's signature jelly beans throughout his Presidency.   During their time in California, Barbara became an ordained minister  and public speaker. She was also a trailblazing professional, serving  as a supervisor and one of the first female executives with the Federal  housing agency, Fannie Mae.   Ben and Barbara decided to retire in 1991 and returned to Arkansas,  where they continued to be active in local, State and national  politics. In addition to helping candidates for all levels of public  office, Barbara used her experience to make a difference in the  community.   I had many opportunities to work with Barbara over the years, but no  occasion stands out more than her determined efforts on behalf of the  188th Fighter Wing when its future was threatened by the Base  Realignment and Closure Commission, BRAC. She used her organizing  skills to rally the community and show visiting BRAC committee members  how strong support was for the base. Her leadership and industry helped  save the Wing and bring more opportunity to the region.   Barbara was truly a force. Her strong values, hard work, wonderful  sense of humor and personal conviction made a difference. I am grateful  to have counted her as a friend and hope her legacy will continue to  inspire young Arkansans to fight for their communities and their causes  with the same determination that she did throughout her life.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor the life  of an outstanding Arkansan and Cleveland County leader, Judge Gary  Spears. After a multiyear battle with cancer, Judge Spears passed away  on January 10, 2021.   Judge Spears grew up on a small farm in New Edinburg, AR, and  graduated with honors from New Edinburg High School in 1987. He  attended the University of Arkansas at Monticello, where he studied  agricultural business before marrying his wife Melody. The couple moved  to Warren, AR, where Judge Spears worked as a distributor for Big R  Ice. The couple eventually returned to New Edinburg in 1996 and  purchased the New Edinburg County Store, which they operated together  for 10 years.   In 2007, Judge Spears was elected Cleveland County Judge, marking the  start of an illustrious 14-year career as the longest serving county  judge in county history. His undeniable leadership while presiding over  Cleveland County had ripple effects that extended beyond the county  borders and brought tremendous benefit to the entire State. A few  recent and notable achievements during his tenure include successful  efforts to ensure an accurate 2020 census count for Cleveland County  and directly overseeing the county's finances during the COVID-19  pandemic by authorizing and approving the disbursement of funds.   Representing the citizens of Cleveland County was a clear passion for  Judge Spears. He was also dedicated to farming. On the exact 10-acre  plot that his father once farmed, Judge Spears worked diligently to  continue his family's unique tradition of ``truck-patch farming.'' He  grew various crops, including tomatoes, beans, peas, squash, cucumbers,  watermelons, peppers, and much more. In fact, his family's agriculture  operation gained deserved recognition in 2019 when they were named  Cleveland County Farm Family of the Year.   Judge Spears leaves behind a lasting legacy thanks to the confidence  entrusted in him by his Cleveland County constituents. I am confident  his selfless leadership as a Cleveland County judge, businessman, and  family farmer will guide and inspire future generations of  Arkansans.                            ____________________
