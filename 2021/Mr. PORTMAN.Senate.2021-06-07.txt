 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here on the floor of the Senate  this evening to commemorate the 77th anniversary of D-day. This was a  huge turning point in World War II, of course. The invasion of Normandy  occurred 77 years ago yesterday.   Historian Douglas Brinkley wrote that D-day was the single most  important moment in the 20th century and one of the most tragic, too,  in terms of loss of life. I think he was right. There were 160,000  soldiers who crossed the Channel that day to begin the campaign to  recapture Europe from Hitler's rule. On their backs were rucksacks with  80 pounds of gear, but so too was the fate of all of us--our allies in  Europe and, really, the fate of the free world.   Many of our best and brightest young Americans did fall that day. We  lost more than 10,000 men in 1 day. The Nazis had spent 2 years  fortifying the coast to prepare for this moment. It was Hitler's so- called Atlantic Wall. The beautiful coastline of Northern France was  covered in barbed wire, land mines, and bunkers, but at the end of the  largest amphibious invasion in history, we stood victorious, battered  but not broken. On we marched through France, through Belgium, and,  finally, into Germany itself.   But even today, amid the flowers and fields of Normandy--I have been  there, and many of you have been there who are listening tonight--you  can feel, even today, the lingering presence of those who died that day  in the service of liberating Europe, and you can see it in the stark,  orderly U.S. military cemeteries, where row after row of white crosses  and Stars of David commemorate those brave souls who were lost-- representing lives lost in a noble cause. Though much has happened in  the following 77 years, we can never lose sight of the valor and the  sacrifice by our Armed Forces on that 1 day.   On Memorial Day, about a week ago, I spoke at the National Veterans  Memorial and Museum in Columbus, OH. It was a hopeful day for me not  just to have so many people together as we emerged from COVID-19-- really the first big public event they have had--but also to see the  generations of veterans and family members there to honor the fallen:  World War II veterans, Gulf war veterans, Korean war veterans, Vietnam  veterans, and veterans, of course, from Afghanistan and Iraq. They  represented the living embodiment of the stories we ought to be  remembering from a war that recedes further into the past with every  passing year.   They are the stories of valor like that displayed by Jim ``Pee Wee''  Martin from Dayton, OH. On that day, he and the rest of the 506th  Parachute Infantry Regiment parachuted behind German lines in the dark  of pre-dawn. Jim was wounded but fought bravely, earning both the  Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his efforts.   They are the stories of sacrifice like that of the Napier brothers of  Warren County in southwest Ohio, the county my mom is from. All five of  the brothers served in the war, and two of the five brothers landed at  D-day. One died there on the beaches, never to return to his Ohio home.   These are stories to be preserved for generations to come. The memory  of D-day and, indeed, of all of World War II must never be lost.   Since I have been here in the U.S. Senate, I have often come to the  floor on D-day to recite the special prayer that was given that day by  Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was expected, of course, that FDR would  give a speech when the invasion took place--one of his fireside chats  from the White House--but for some reason, FDR was moved to prayer. The  famous prayer that he gave that day has become known as the D-day  Prayer. It is a powerful statement, my favorite Presidential statement  and one that deserves to be remembered for generations to come.   In 2013, I introduced legislation, called the World War II Memorial  Prayer Act, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to install a  plaque to be placed at the World War II Memorial, on the National Mall,  with the words of the D-day Prayer. It is a beautiful memorial, but,  frankly, some more interpretation wouldn't be a bad thing, and having  that prayer there, as you will see in a moment when we recite it, would  be an appropriate way to pay tribute to those who lost their lives that  day.   It was the Ohio Christian Alliance President, Chris Long, who first  came to me with the idea of a plaque to display this historic prayer.  That legislation was actually signed into law with the help of Senator  Joe Lieberman. On a bipartisan basis, we got it passed in 2014.   The friends of the National World War II Memorial and the National  Park Service, since that time, have worked with us to develop and  refine the final permanent plaque design. Most recently, they received  design approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the  National Capital Planning Commission.    It takes a while to get things done on the National Mall, I found.  There is quite a process. It has now been 7 years, longer than World  War II itself. Despite the hurdles, we have yet to see the final plaque  installed, but it will be done, by the way, not at any cost to  [[Page S3956]]  the taxpayers, meaning private fundraising, not taxpayer dollars, will  be used. We had hoped to have the final plaque in place for the 75th  anniversary. In the meantime, in 2019, we were able to have a temporary  plaque in place with the words of the prayer at the permanent location  for the permanent plaque, which is at the Circle of Remembrance, next  to the World War II Memorial.   If you are on The Mall and you are coming from the Capitol, it will  be on your right. It is north of the World War II Memorial but right  next to it. In this very beautiful place, the Circle of Remembrance--a  good place to sit and reflect--you will see, right now, the plaque is  there, and you can read the prayer. The permanent plaque will be even  bigger and will allow even more people to have access to it. I  encourage people to go see that plaque. By the way, I think it is the  only prayer on display on our National Mall.   The temporary plaque, by the way, was generously donated by the  Friends of the National World War II Memorial. We are very hopeful that  the permanent plaque will be placed at the circle next year. I want to  thank the Lilly Endowment for its generous support of this project, by  the way. Last October, it provided a $2 million grant for the  construction and installation of the permanent plaque. This committed  financial support will be critical to finally bringing the project  across the line.   The fact that a prayer was offered that day by our Commander in Chief  is historic in and of itself, but it is the content of the prayer that  makes it so worthy of remembrance. I would now like to read this World  War II D-day Prayer, if I may.         My fellow Americans [FDR began]: Last night, when I spoke       with you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that       troops of the United States and our allies were crossing the       Channel in another and greater operation. It has come to pass       with success thus far.        And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in       prayer:        Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have       set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our       Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free       a suffering humanity.        Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms,       stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.        They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and       hard, for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.       Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return       again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the       righteousness of our cause, our sons will [prevail].        They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without       rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by       noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the       violences of war.        For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They       fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end       conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice       arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They       yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the       haven of home.        Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive       them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.        And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives,       sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts       and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to       rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of       great sacrifice.        Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single       day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the       desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a       continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again       when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips,       invoking Thy help to our efforts.        Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to       redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the       material support of our armed forces.        And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail,       to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our       sons wheresoever they may be.        And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith in Thee; Faith in       our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our united crusade.       Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not       the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but       fleeting moment let not these deter us in our unconquerable       purpose.        With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces       of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and       racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and       with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a       sure peace a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy       men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom,       reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.        Thy will be done, Almighty God.        Amen.    A powerful prayer. I love the part about they come not to conquer;  they come to liberate. The same can be said for our Armed Forces  throughout the ages.   I look forward to seeing these words of prayer permanently displayed  on the National Mall to help us memorialize such a noble day we must  never forget.   I yield the floor.
