 Mr. Speaker, I will include in the  Record a letter from the Association of American Medical Colleges which  states: ``Treatment of essential health benefits and health status  underwriting dilutes protections for many Americans and would leave  individuals with preexisting conditions facing higher premiums and  reduce access to vital care.''   Mr. Speaker, I rise to caution those Republicans who have allowed  themselves to be persuaded by this President into supporting this  terrible bill which would leave millions of Americans without health  care and raise the cost of care for millions more. You are going to pay  a terrible price for not protecting your constituents.   TrumpCare will cause 24 million Americans to lose their health  coverage and slash Medicaid by $880 billion; for older Americans,  premiums, deductibles, and copayments will skyrocket. Those between the  ages of 50 and 64 will be forced to pay premiums five times higher than  what others pay for the same coverage.  [[Page H4159]]    This crushing age tax will fall on some of the most vulnerable  members of our society, elderly people on fixed incomes who often have  serious health issues.   Meanwhile, hidden in this bill is an outrageous tax break for  billionaires. TrumpCare gives $600 billion in tax cuts to large  corporations and wealthy people, including $2.8 billion to the 400  richest families in America. The MacArthur amendment made this bill  even worse by jettisoning protections for people with preexisting  conditions.
