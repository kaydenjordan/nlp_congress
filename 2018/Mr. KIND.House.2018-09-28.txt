 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation  because this bill today, again, shatters one of the greatest cons ever  perpetrated on the American people, that the modern-day national  Republican Party is the party of fiscal responsibility.  [[Page H9168]]    The three bills that we have before us this week, coupled with the  tax cut version that passed last year, will add over $5 trillion to our  national debt at a time when 70 million baby boomers are fully invested  in Social Security and Medicare, giving them the excuse later on to  come back and say that we have to cut Social Security and Medicare  because we don't have revenue anymore.   If we are entrusted with the majority next year, we will do tax  reform the right way. We will simplify it, we will make it more  competitive, we will certainly make it fair, and we will do it fiscally  responsibly by shutting down extraneous loopholes in the Code to pay  for it. We will do it with hearings and with the proper feedback which  was lacking here.   For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, we should reject this bill and do  tax reform the right way.
