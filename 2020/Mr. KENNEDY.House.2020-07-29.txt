 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her  leadership on this important piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, already in this country, the skyrocketing cost of  childcare was solidifying deep economic and racial inequities that have  plagued us for decades.   Already, many childcare workers were living in poverty because  astronomical tuition rates are not enough to pay teachers the salary  that they deserve.   Already, working moms and dads pause promising careers because their  wages didn't match the cost of childcare.   Already, inability to find childcare locked many parents out of the  workforce altogether.   And already, children were denied access to high-quality early  learning programs because of a broken childcare system.   Then COVID-19 completely obliterated a faulty system for parents, for  childcare providers, for educators, and for children.   Providers are going out of business completely, which will make it  even harder for parents to find the childcare that they need. Costs  will skyrocket as class sizes shrink. State budgets that are already  stretched thin will undoubtedly decide childcare is  dispensable, despite big talk about how essential it is to our economic  recovery.    Madam Speaker, we will look back at this moment and regret that we  are not doing more because, ultimately, this decision will leave  families with young children behind. This is a decision to hollow out  an entire generation of parents' employment stability and economic  opportunity.   We have a decision as to whether to widen the achievement gap,  because our children will not be going to preschool programs that set  them up to thrive over the long term. It is a decision to perpetuate  systemic racism, because it is Black and Latinx women who are suffering  the most from our failure to act decisively.   Madam Speaker, we need to pass this bill, and then we need universal  childcare.   I want to thank the chair for her leadership.
