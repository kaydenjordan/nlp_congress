 Madam Speaker, the President's Build Back Better plan has  become the most important legislation in our history because it is  essential to overcome the effects of the first pandemic in more than  100 years. So essential are the bill's ingredients that Congress faces  a daunting task in trimming the bill.   One ingredient that is particularly essential is childcare because it  relates to so much else: the ability of both women and men to work, the  ability of children to go to school. The United States is the only  democratic country that does not afford quality childcare to all of its  families. The reason so many more women than men are still out of work  is the disproportionate responsibility women absorb for childcare. This  makes childcare an essential ingredient in the President's Build Back  Better plan.                            ____________________
