 Mr. Chair, I rise today in a unique position to oppose  this bill, especially section 8146.   I am proud to represent San Diego, the largest military community in  the country. I am also proud to serve as one of the youngest Members of  this body and the youngest woman on the House Committee on Armed  Services.   I am in a unique position to understand the importance of access to  reproductive healthcare, including abortion and fertility care for our  servicemembers and their dependents, because, as a young woman,  reproductive care is my healthcare. That is the case for the 1.62  million women of reproductive age in the military health system, too,  not to mention our LGBTQ+ servicemembers, who already have difficulty  accessing necessary care. This care is essential to our health, well- being, freedom, economic security, and empowerment, and for our  national security, too.   That is why I am thankful for DOD's policy that covers the travel and  transportation costs for abortion and fertility care, a policy that is  consistent with the law. This is so important now that nearly half of  all servicewomen are stationed in States with abortion restrictions  because our servicemembers have little say in where they are stationed.  They can't freely take days off work, and many can't afford to travel  thousands of miles and pay out of pocket to receive the care they need  and deserve.   DOD's policy took important steps to address those barriers and make  our military more accessible and inclusive. That is why I will proudly  fight for our servicemembers, who have fought so much for all of us  here today. The least we can do is ensure they have their necessary  healthcare.   For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee.   If the House rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with an  important amendment to this bill. My amendment would strike section  8146.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Ms. Jacobs moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4365 to the       Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Strike section 8146.     Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me in voting  for the motion to recommit.   Before I yield, I will also mention that while I am opposed to this  bill in general, I am very proud of a bipartisan amendment that we were  able to get into the en bloc that would set aside $5 million in  additional funding to recruit and retain direct-care staff in CDCs.   I have heard time and again that staffing shortages are the main  driver of our military childcare crisis. In my community that has  sacrificed and served so much for us, recently, more than 4,000  military children were waiting for childcare spots at San Diego's  military childcare centers. This amendment will help military families  access the care they need so they can focus on the mission instead of  wondering where their kids are placed or taken care of.    Madam Chair, I thank Congressman Gaetz for his  partnership on this important issue.   Many of us have this idea of American exceptionalism--that America is  set apart from the rest of the world.   Well, that is certainly true when it comes to cluster munitions and  not in the way that we want.   America is an outlier. We are one of the few countries that hasn't  become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and that is a  grave mistake.   These weapons maim and kill indiscriminately. In 2021, the Landmine  and Cluster Munitions Monitor found that over 97 percent of casualties  from cluster bomb remnants were civilians; and two-thirds of those were  children.   That is because these bomblets are small, colorful, and interesting  shapes, so to children they look like toys. So when kids find these  unexploded bomblets stuck in trees or in the water or simply on the  ground and try to pick them up and play with them, they can lose a limb  or their life in the blink of an eye.   Unfortunately, there is no amount of guardrails or promised  precautions for cluster munitions that are enough.  [[Page H4610]]  These weapons are unpredictable, and the human cost is far too high to  justify.   Now, let's be clear. This isn't about one country. This is not about  Ukraine. This is about protecting civilian lives and ensuring our  national security all over the world because sending these weapons  anywhere makes us complicit in unavoidable civilian harm and creates  blowback that undermines our national security.   Our partners and allies look to us and expect us to do the right  thing to protect the marginalized, defend human rights, and strengthen  democracy. This reputation is what allows us to build and maintain  international coalitions that further our goals.   If other countries don't look up to us and don't expect us to do the  right thing, we will be alone on the world stage.   I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to avoid all of  these horrific consequences and support our bipartisan amendment to  ensure that no funds can be used to transfer cluster munitions.
