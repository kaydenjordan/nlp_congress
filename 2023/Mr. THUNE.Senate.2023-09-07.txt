 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, I want to talk about something that  has been going really right here in the U.S. Senate, and that is the  use of regular order to consider the annual appropriations bills.   What do I mean by ``regular order''? For starters, regular order  refers to allowing bills to go through the committee process--including  hearings and a markup--where members of the committee have a chance to  amend and approve the bill before being referred by the committee to  the Senate as a whole for additional debate and deliberation.   The regular-order process is key. It provides the time and space for  real deliberation. It allows for input from a broad array of Members  and promotes collaboration and compromise. It is a transparent process,  one that ensures that both Senators and the American people can see how  the legislation in question is made and have ample time to digest it,  not to mention the fact that by ensuring the input of more Senators,  the regular-order process helps ensure that a broader swath of the  American people is represented in any final legislation.   One of Congress's most basic responsibilities is funding the  government. For all the reasons I just listed, the way we should be  doing that is through regular order. But we haven't been doing the  greatest job of that lately here in the Senate. But this year, for the  first time in 5 years, the Senate Appropriations Committee has  processed all 12 appropriations bills through the committee. A huge  amount of credit goes to Senator Collins and to her Democrat  counterpart, Senator Murray, for making this happen.   I hope this will not be a one-off but the start of a new habit for  the Senate--a habit of giving each of the appropriations bills the  time, debate, and serious consideration that it deserves.   In their press release following passage of all 12 appropriations  bills out of committee, Senators Collins and Murray noted that the  bills had passed the committee by overwhelming bipartisan margins, and  it is not surprising. When you give Members time to debate and amend  legislation and make their concerns and the concerns of their  constituents heard, you are a lot more likely to get bipartisan buy-in  on the final product.   Today, we expect the Democrat leader to file cloture on what we call  a minibus of three appropriations bills: Agriculture; Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, or what we call THUD; and Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs, or MILCON-VA. I hope the hearing  these bills got in committee will be matched by a similarly  deliberative process on the floor, including ample time for  consideration of amendments.   Debate and amendment on the floor is another key element of the  regular-  [[Page S4248]]  order process and one that also helps promote a bipartisan final bill.  The debate on the National Defense Authorization Act in July was a good  example of this. Members had the opportunity to file and offer  amendments when the bill came to the floor, resulting in consideration  of 131 amendments, including 33 amendment votes, which helped the bill  pass the full Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan margin.   I am looking forward to next week's debate on the minibus, and I am  very pleased that, among many other good provisions, this year's  MILCON-VA appropriations bill will continue funding for building out  the necessary infrastructure for the B-21 long-range strike bomber at  Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The B-21 will revolutionize  the Air Force's long-range strike capabilities and is an important step  forward in ensuring that our military is prepared to meet and defeat  21st-century threats. I have been working to ensure that the Air  Force--and Ellsworth, the main operating base for the first B-21s--has  everything it needs for the B-21 mission.   So, as I said, I am looking forward to debate on the Agriculture,  THUD, and MILCON-VA appropriations bills. I trust that we will continue  working through appropriations bills in the coming weeks with full  debates on the Senate floor. I expect we will need to pass a short-term  continuing resolution to enable these debates and to allow for time to  reconcile the House and Senate versions of these bills and get final  versions to the President's desk.   Before I close, I do want to mention one troubling thing among the  good news about the regular-order process, and that is the Democrat  leader's decision, in his words, to ``invent a new process'' to deal  with the thorny question of regulating AI, or artificial intelligence,  because the committee process ``won't suffice''--``won't suffice.''   I am not too sure what the majority leader hopes to gain by taking  responsibility for oversight and examination of this subject away from  the relevant committees of jurisdiction that consider issues like this  day in and day out and are well-versed in developing solutions. I am  definitely worried that this new process will restrict Senators' input  into the final product, leading to legislation created by the leader  exclusively without collaboration with other Members or relevant  committees.   It is a disappointing move, especially considering the progress we  have made on returning to regular order with appropriations bills. I  would like to see the leader show a little more faith in the committee  process and in his committee chairs.   But, again, I am very pleased that at least on the appropriations  front, we are back where we should be, and that is processing  appropriations bills in committee and on the Senate floor.   I am looking forward to next week's Ag, THUD, and MILCON-VA  appropriations debate.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kansas (Mr. Moran).
