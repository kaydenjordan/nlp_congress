 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday marks the  beginning of Small Business Week, where, as a nation, we come together  to show support for the many risk takers, entrepreneurs, and mom-and- pop shops that make America great.   More than 99 percent of all businesses in the United States are  classified as small businesses, and they are responsible for two out of  every three jobs that are created in this country. That is why we often  refer to small businesses as the backbone of the U.S. economy.   Thankfully, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has given a  boost to these operations, which is directly translating into more  jobs, better pay, and new investments and expansion across America.   I have traveled all across the 15 parishes of my district, Mr.  Speaker, over the last few months, and no matter where I go, our  constituents tell us how the historic reform has helped them and all of  our local mom-and-pop shops. Hardworking Americans everywhere, from all  walks of life, are reaping the benefits of our reforms, and the best is  yet to come.   So, for Small Business Week, which is next week, I want to thank all  those who truly are the backbone of our economy. Keep up the good work,  and we will continue to fight for you in Washington.                            ____________________
