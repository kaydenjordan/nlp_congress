 Mr. Speaker, someone near and dear to me once said that  the Republican Party is the party of rich men and women, and the  Democratic Party is the party of working men and women. Nothing proves  that more than this tax scam today.   I have been around here a long time. Of all the bills I have seen,  this is one of the worst bills I have ever seen on the floor of this  House. It is actually a disaster. It raises taxes on the middle class  and on millions of families across America. It adds trillions to the  debt to give tax cuts to America's wealthy families and corporations  while stripping credits and deductions from middle class families.   What ever happened to the fiscal responsibility of the Republican  Party?   This budget ransacks Medicare and Medicaid of $1.5 trillion, and the  GOP will use the new deficits to justify further devastating Medicare  and Medicaid.   Finally, it is a terrible disaster for my New York constituents who  already pay their fair share of taxes. New York is a donor State,  meaning that we pay more to the Federal Government than what we get in  return.   This will reduce or eliminate key deductions, such as curbing or  eliminating deductibility of State and local taxes, mortgage interest  deductions, college debt, student loans.   We are a high-tax State. This is a disaster. Scrap this disaster. Go  back to the drawing board and write a bill which is fair to middle  class taxpayers.
