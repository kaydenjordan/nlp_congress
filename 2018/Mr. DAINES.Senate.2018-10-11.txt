 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged  from further consideration of H.R. 6896 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Ethan Davidson of Lewis and Clark County for his  outstanding academic achievements.   Ethan Davidson epitomizes hard working Montanan's, his work ethic has  shown in his academics Ethan recently received a perfect score on his  ACT, being one of the 2,760 high school students across the United  States who received a perfect score of 36. About 2 million high school  students take the test each year.   At a young age, Ethan devoted himself to his academics, always  striving towards being a straight-A student. He attends Capitol High  School in Helena, where he is involved in many extracurricular  activities, ranging from being the cocaptain of the cross country team,  to being a member of the math and science club. To add to his  accolades, Ethan is a National Merit semifinalist and has earned the  rank of Eagle Scout.   I congratulate Ethan on his impeccable academic achievements, as well  as his willingness to give back to his community by being a role model  for all high school students I look forward to seeing his success in  his future endeavors.                            ____________________
