 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is already the rule. We are wasting our  time here today. These are reported.   The hypocrisy of coming to the floor and claiming to be for the  children, while opposing the President's supplemental budget that  actually will take care of these children.   The Members who are going to vote and who support this opposed the  President's funding request to actually take care of the thousands of  children who are crossing the border every week. Without that money,  you can't take care of these children.   So the proponents of this amendment--again, this is a totally  unnecessary amendment because this is already the policy of the  administration. This is make-believe. This administration reports the  deaths. It is the hypocritical proponents of the amendment who oppose  funding to take care of children on the border for purely political  purposes.   If they really want to take care of the children on the border, this  bill would have included a supplemental appropriation to take care of  those children. In fact, that amendment was considered in committee and  along party lines rejected. The majority rejected money to take care of  the children and now come to the floor and claim to be for the  children.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is, let's stop the  charades. This is already an administration policy.   I understand the desire to score political points against this  President, a president who has come to Congress and said that we need  more money because of the flood of children across the border. There  were 145,000 people who crossed the border last month, including  thousands and thousands of children--he needs money to take care of  them--and the majority refuses to bring this bill to the floor. In  fact, in a motion to recommit, they voted against it and in committee  they voted against it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am not sure what this amendment does  because it just says that you can't change the Office of Civil Rights  in contravention of the statute that set up the Department. There is no  change in the Office of Civil Rights.   The bottom line is that the Department of Education enforces civil  rights laws. Yes, there was misguided guidance by the last  administration that actually decreased discipline in the schools in my  district because the teachers in my district and the administrators in  my district were scared that they would lose Federal funds if they  disciplined students because they had to do paperwork, and there were  reports, and the Department of Education was going to come down on  them. Discipline suffered.   The bottom line is that the record of this administration on  minorities is clear: the lowest unemployment in history for African  Americans in the country and the lowest unemployment in history for  Hispanics in this country.   The record of this administration in dealing with minorities is  clear. It has provided economic opportunity for tens of millions of  minorities in this country. The Office of Civil Rights works in the  Department of Education, and I oppose the amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we have heard the debate. I don't know if  vouchers are brought into this debate.   It is interesting because, with vouchers like the OSP program in the  District of Columbia, 97 percent of the students are minorities. That  is a voucher program, and 97 percent are minorities supported by the  administration. The majority just yesterday rejected an increase in  funding to that program that benefits 97 percent that are minorities.   Let's get civil rights straight. If my colleagues support opportunity  and education for minorities in this country, that is what the  administration is doing.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, read the plain language of the amendment. It  decreases an amount, and it increases an amount. That is all it does.  It doesn't increase funding for firearm violence.   If the gentleman were so interested in doing more, more research, he  could have increased the amount. He didn't increase the amount.   At 1 o'clock in the morning, we are talking about a do-nothing  amendment instead of bringing a supplemental bill to the floor that  funds the care of children at our border that has been rejected by the  majority time and time again.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment, even  though I don't oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, this is a modest request, but it is offset  by a reduction in departmental management funds.   Now, there are a number of amendments that do that. Obviously, if we  do too many amendments that do that, you will leave nothing for the  department to be properly managed. But this is a modest request, so I  believe we should support the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise hesitatingly to oppose this  amendment. This is not an inconsequential amount of money. This is $3  million, and it is taken out of the Secretary's office.   It is not prioritizing and saying, well, this program is more  important than this program, so we are going to shift funds from one  program to another. It actually strikes at the core of how the  Secretary can manage the department.   I just don't think that is the responsible way to do business. If we  think this program is important, that is fine. Find another program  that is less important. But let's not just take it from the Secretary's  office because the Secretary has to manage a large organization.   And, again, I know we are in Washington, but $3 million is a lot of  money to take out of an office, so I rise in opposition to the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this is a good cause. This is a good idea.  But, you know, we have $10 billion in unspent CHIP funds sitting in a  fund.   So the question is: Why take this from the Secretary's office? I get  it. Some people don't like the Secretary. Some people don't like the  administration.   But there is $10 billion sitting there that could be spent on  programs like this, unspent CHIP funds.   So I have to oppose this amendment because, again, let's prioritize.  This is an important fund. Don't take it out of the Secretary's office.   I get it. You don't like the administration. You don't like the  Secretary. Don't take it out of his office.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Chair, are remarks supposed to be directed to the  Chair?    Madam Chair, Mr. Cole supports the children. He actually  supports funding these programs for the children past this month,  something the majority doesn't. Time after time after time, the  majority has refused the funding.   Now, Madam Chair, there is no need for this amendment because, in 1  month, we can't take care of any children because the majority has  refused, time after time after time, to provide funding to take care of  these children. And then, Madam Chair, the majority gets up, Members of  the majority get up and claim that they are for the children.   Sure, we need reporting. But before we need reporting, we actually  need funding. We should bring--instead of being here at 1:40 debating a  two-line amendment that says just decrease and increase, we ought to be  actually debating a supplemental bill.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Chair, if I can inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, there is no question that suicide prevention  is important, no question in anyone's mind. We have an epidemic of it,  but we also have an epidemic of substance abuse.   Here is the problem. This amendment takes funds from health  surveillance and program support, which supplement activities funded  under the headings mental health, substance abuse treatment, and  substance abuse prevention.   So there is a problem there, because no question suicide is  important, suicide prevention is important, but this amendment is  robbing Peter to pay Paul, Madam Chair. This amendment is taking money  from substance abuse.   If we are going to set priorities, both should be high priorities.  The gentlewoman should have found the money somewhere else, maybe in  the $10 billion that is sitting unspent in the CHIP account, instead of  taking money from substance abuse.   Madam Chair, that is why I oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the bottom line is this bill already  increases this program. With the committee report, page 59, we suggest  an increase of $15 million.   The $15 million in this amendment comes out of the Office of the  Secretary. Again, I don't know how the Secretary is going to do all the  work he has to do to take care of the entire Department if $15 million  comes out to supplement a program that is already being supplemented.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).                                time  0200     Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Chair, there are a lot of important issues we can  discuss on the floor. This is one of them, clearly. But we should be  discussing a much larger issue, the issue of border security and  stopping the flow.   144 pounds of fentanyl seized at the border, that could kill the  entire population of the United States. This is the amount we seized.   It is unbelievable that Congress can't act to control the flow of  drugs across our southern border, because we are playing politics with  our children's lives now.   Madam Chair, we should bring the supplemental bill to the floor as  soon as possible. As the gentleman from South Carolina suggested, we  are ready to go all night. Let's bring it to the floor. House  leadership can bring it to the floor tonight. Let's go ahead.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the bottom line is this is not the place and  this won't do what the offer in support of the amendment says it is  going to do, because the fact of the matter is that the DEA is the one  that enforced the classification of schedule I. This bill has nothing  to do with the DEA.   In fact, the problem with research and the problem with the  difficulty in doing research does not lie in HHS. The problem lies in  the fact that it is a schedule I drug, and the appropriate way to deal  with this is through an authorizing committee, as the gentleman from  California suggests, with legislation that would allow more research,  as has been suggested.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry), who is absolutely right. We do need more research. But the  current restriction that is struck, section 509, says that this  limitation shall not apply where there is significant medical evidence  of therapeutic advantage or that federally sponsored clinical trials  are being conducted.   Well, that is what we need. We need federally sponsored clinical  trials. The current section 509 does not stop this.   Now, look, I get it. There are people who want the legalization of  marijuana. I get it. But as a physician, I will tell you I urge the  people who suggest that there are broad applicabilities that are proven  medical uses of marijuana to go back to the Journal of the American  Medical Association, which did a review last year that indicated that,  of the over 50 suggested uses for medical marijuana, only 4 are proven  through rigorous scientific trials--4, Madam Chair.    PTSD is not one of them. It is not. Treatment for opioid abuse is not  one of them.   In fact, Dr. Nora Volkow, the head of the National Institute on Drug  Abuse, who I think knows probably more than anyone in this room about  the subject, says that marijuana is an addictive drug that is  dangerous, and recent research says that induces psychosis in young  people, serious major psychotic conditions.   And we want to remove all the restrictions in the health part of the  law?   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, the bottom line is that there is scientific  evidence about the danger of marijuana.   It is largely unstudied, and anyone, Madam Chair, who understands how  research is conducted here should realize that the roadblock is not in  HHS. It is not in the jurisdiction of this bill. It is with the DEA.  This does nothing to remove the scheduling with regard to how the DEA  views marijuana.   Dr. Volkow, one of the world's experts on addiction, it was brought  up that maybe we can treat addiction with marijuana, and she says  absolutely not. This drug causes addiction. One-seventh of the people  who are addicted to opioids started with marijuana. It is a gateway  drug. It is dangerous.   This amendment does nothing to deal with promoting research because  the problem is not in HHS. The problem is in DEA.   Madam Chair, I have tried to deal with this problem. I have  cosponsored a bill that promotes research with a broader approach, to  involve all the Federal agencies that could hinder research in any way.  This amendment does nothing to do that. This sends a bad signal.   As the gentleman from Pennsylvania suggested, this isn't about  marijuana, it is about every schedule I drug, and there are very  dangerous schedule I drugs.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, there is no question that everyone  knows that we are in a suicide epidemic. We have to do whatever we can,  whatever is within our powers--work with our States, work within our  local jurisdictions, work with our community agencies--to deal with  this horrible epidemic that we are having.   My problem with and my opposition to the amendment is not the fact  that we need to pay attention to suicide prevention. It is from where  we get the funds.   We take the funds from that, I guess, bottomless piggybank some  people think is the Secretary's office. In the short time we have had  since the last vote series, we will have taken $20 million from the  Secretary's office if all those amendments pass on final vote. Madam  Chair, we increased the Secretary's office by 1 percent in the  underlying budget, so we increased it less than inflation.   Again, the job of HHS is growing, not shrinking. We increased it only  1 percent. With this amendment, just since the time of the last vote  series, we will have decreased the budget by 5 percent in that office.   That is not responsible. That implies that the committee didn't do  good work in setting how much the Secretary's office needs to  administer a huge government agency, a very important government  agency, one that, in fact, runs suicide prevention programs and drug  addiction programs.   Madam Chair, we have to set priorities. It is nice to say we have  suicide prevention, but let's find the program--we didn't take it from  a program. This amendment doesn't take it from a program. This  amendment takes it from something that is not a limitless reserve: the  Office of the Secretary.   That is why I believe we should oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, we should expect that Members who want to prioritize  programs find other programs that have a lower priority and shift those  funds.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0230     Madam Chair, we are going to need a lot of volunteers,  actually, in a month because the majority, time and time and time  again, has voted against taking care of these children when money runs  out this month. That is a fact. Yes, we will need volunteers. We need  volunteers to do more than the mental health, which is very important.   When you talk about toxic stress, wait until a child comes to the  border and we can't provide medical services. And we can't provide  services because the majority in the House refuses to bring a  supplemental appropriation to the floor.   Now, the gentlewoman commented on someone--I don't know, maybe it was  me--voting against a bill that has $1.3 billion, that spends tens of  billions of dollars above the statutory Budget Control Act numbers, and  yet the majority voted in committee this week to provide billions of  dollars of funds to take care of children at the border. They leave  that inconvenient fact out.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry).   The fact of the matter is that the majority, last year, when they  were in the minority, voted along party lines to not provide funds to  take care of children in the Labor-HHS bill in committee. Every single  member voted against it in committee, of the now-majority, then- minority. So I guess what is good for the goose is not good for the  gander.   But we did take votes this year on a motion to recommit, on an  amendment in committee this week, and a majority of the majority voted  to not fund care for the children. That is where we are going to run  out of money.   The President, to his credit, has asked and said: Please send money.  Please send money to fund the care for these children and to stop the  flow of drugs across the border.   Madam Chair, 144 pounds of fentanyl. We have to stop that.   Yes, certainly, it is important to do these screenings, and I thank  the gentlewoman for offering the amendment, but we have got to go much  further than that.   And again, Madam Chair, it is still early in the morning. We are  ready. Bring the supplemental bill to the floor.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, graduate medical education is absolutely a  problem; there is no question about it. The demographics are clear in  the United States.   We have an aging population that requires more services, and yet we  don't have enough graduate medical education to train all the  physicians and providers that we need to train.   Here is the problem with the amendment: It goes to one of those  bottomless wells, I guess. And not only does it go to a bottomless well  in the department that the money is spent in, it goes to a bottomless  well in another department.   Again, there is $10 billion in CHIP's funds unspent, could have come  from, but, no, the money is taken from the Secretary of Education's  departmental management fund.   Now, let's review the budget of the Department of Education, because  the budget is increased by 5 percent under the bill passed out by the  majority from the House, from the committee.   So get it. The Department of Education increased in size by 5  percent, and the bill itself level-funds the Department--management,  not Department, but the management.   So we are already asking the management to basically do 5 percent  more work for the same amount of money, and here comes along this  amendment, again, no question we need more graduate medical education.  Again, it is a question of priorities. If we need graduate medical  education, let's find something in HHS that we don't need much of, and  let's transfer that money.   But, no, that is not the approach taken here. It is magic. We want  magic to happen.   We want the Department of Education to do all the wonderful things  that we pay for in this budget, and we want them to do it with level  funding, even though the budget goes up 5 percent. And, now, this  amendment takes 1 percent--that is significant, 1 percent--because this  is not the only amendment that has gone after that pot of money. The  bottom line is it creates more mouths to feed.   This doesn't end well because, next year, this now becomes the  baseline and the Department--I don't know what they are going to do in  conference because, if all these amendments are passed, the Department  can't run on that money. They can't. You can't manage it.   Who are we going to fire? Are we going to fire 5 percent of the  people, 10 percent of the people expecting to do the same work?   This ain't the way to run anything, much less the Government of the  United States.   Madam Chair, I applaud the author of the amendment for the idea, but  for heaven's sake, we need fiscal sanity. We have a $22 trillion debt,  a $1 trillion deficit. We spend over $100 billion more than the  statutory authority in these appropriations bills. We have got to exert  fiscal discipline at some point.   Madam Chair, I reluctantly oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  even though I agree with the idea behind the amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, there is no question that the rural  areas in this country frequently get shortchanged. I know because I  represent a rural area. That is why I was surprised because we just  heard a lot of lip service to doing great things for the rural areas,  but, in fact, rural health is level funded in this bill before us.   The Department spending is $10 billion higher and nothing, no  increase could go to the rural areas. And now, all of a sudden, we are  all fans of rural areas. On the other side of the aisle I guess we are  all fans of rural areas.   We do need this extra $1 million. Here is the problem. It didn't  identify another program to take the money from. It went to the  believably bottomless well of department management, the Office of the  Secretary, which now is up to $21 million in being raided just since  the last vote series.   I don't know. I don't think you need an accounting degree to figure  out that that doesn't work. We are asking the Department to do more  with much less money. And, again, we do these rural health programs. No  question. But I wish that rural health programs had gotten a  proportionate increase in the base bill that we are talking about, but  they didn't.   Now, I will tell the gentlewoman about one problem that is very  rampant in my rural areas and across the country. If most people were  asked: Where is the opioid crisis worse, urban or rural areas? We know  what they will respond, but the data shows that it is rural areas. They  have a worse problem. And, yet, it is now 2:50 in the morning and we  still haven't seen the supplemental bill that would help stop the flow  of illegal drugs across our southern border.   If we really care for our rural areas, we would ask the leadership to  now bring the bill. We can have it here in a half hour. Let's spend all  night. Let's protect our rural areas. There was 144 pounds of fentanyl  seized. When are we going to be tired about fentanyl crossing our  borders and killing our rural citizens?   When are we going to stop proving a political point and dealing with  the problem? We have been promised we are going to fast-track this.  Madam Chairwoman, the President suggested this amount a month ago. No  wonder America has an opinion of Congress of 9 percent, because the  President identified a problem a month ago and said: We are going to  run out of money to take care of children and to secure our border, and  Congress does nothing.   We want to help our rural areas. This is not the way to do it. Let's  stop the flow of illegal drugs across our southern borders. Let's stop  playing politics with the lives of our youth in rural areas by allowing  that flow of drugs across the border.   Madam Chairwoman, bring the supplemental bill to the floor tonight. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, even though I support  the amendment.    Madam Chair, there is no question that we have  shortchanged career and technical education over the last few years  because, to be honest, the last administration had a very different  attitude about the needs of higher education. Thank goodness this  Secretary and this administration have said career and technical  education is important.   It is an important part of our economy, and we find that those  individuals who have career and technical education in those sectors of  the economy that are vibrant do have multiple job offers. They have  very lucrative job offers.   On the other hand, some of the individuals who go to a traditional  college leave with liberal arts degrees and leave with huge debts and  very limited opportunities for employment.   We have to rebalance that. I applaud the gentlewoman from Minnesota  for emphasizing the importance because this is long, long overdue.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the idea is okay. This is all part of the  puzzle. The Senior Medicare Patrol is a part of the puzzle.   But, again, my problem with this amendment is not that this program  doesn't have some value. It is from where it takes the money. It makes  the judgment that the other things in that pot of fraud control-- because that is the pot it comes out of. It doesn't say that this fraud  control program is so important that we are going to look into some  other part of HHS to take those dollars. It says that the other parts  of fraud control are not as important.   Madam Chair, part of this money goes, for instance, to Department of  Justice special attorneys who actually have to prosecute the cases. It  is nice to find fraud, but if we don't have money to prosecute the  cases, then we have a problem.   Again, this is the wishful thinking that we can just create all kinds  of programs and that it doesn't make a difference where the money comes  from. But it does because this $2 million comes out of some other fraud  control somewhere. That is my concern.   I don't know that we have the knowledge to know that this fraud  control actually yields more in terms of catching fraud and getting  fraud moneys back than other uses of this account.   That is why, again, I applaud the idea. Let's train everybody to  look. We know that fraud in Medicare and Medicaid is huge. The American  taxpayer deserves to catch all the fraud. I am just not sure this is  the best way to spend our fraud dollars. This account has already been  plussed-up in the underlying bill, and that is why I reluctantly oppose  the amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I don't oppose the amendment, because this  is a very important topic. There is no question about it. This is  another one of the ways that our country needs improvement. Certainly,  the Federal Government is an appropriate place to look for strategies  to do that improvement.   Here is the problem: We have to set priorities. If this is a  priority--look, we have a trillion-dollar deficit. And this should be a  priority. Let's find a program that is not as important, decrease the  funding to that program, increase the funding to this program.   Madam Chair, that is not the approach the amendment takes.   We are now up to $22 million, if all the amendments pass that we have  discussed since just the last amendment vote--$22 million coming from  the Secretary's management account.   You know, this is having your cake and eating it too. This is saying:  This is important, but I am not going to make the tough decision of  what is less important. Because it is mythical to believe that we are  going to cut $22 million out of a growing agency's budget to manage  that growing agency and not have an effect.   So, that is why I reluctantly rise to oppose it. Madam Chair, it is  about priorities.   They send us to make the tough decisions. The tough decision isn't to  say: Here are all the things. Let's go fund them all.   The tough decision is: This is what needs priority. And this does  need priority. The tough decision is asking what has less priority, not  going to that magical, bottomless well of the Secretary's management  funds, because, Madam Chair, we are up to $22 million. And that is just  since this vote. I haven't totaled up before the last vote series.   At some point, the Secretary is going to have to start taking out  loans.   So, Madam Chair, again, I reluctantly rise to oppose the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I join the gentlewoman from California in  recognizing the incredible importance of this. I have stated that.   Having your cake and eating it too is not related specifically to  this amendment, but the idea that we have been discussing now for 2  hours, that we have all these things that are good--they probably are  priorities--but the tough decision is to find where we are going to-- and not pretend that the Secretary's management budget is an endless  well. That is just pretending.   Madam Chair, that is why 9 percent of Americans have a favorable view  of Congress. Because, in our households, when we make a decision about  a priority to spend money on something here, we take it out of  somewhere else where we are not going to spend money, and not make- believe stuff.   So, Madam Chair, again: Well intentioned, well needed. We need to set  priorities, and then we need to find places to make the cuts to fund  those priorities.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, there are a lot of wonderful things we can  do, but here is the problem: Since the last vote series, we have  actually cut management by $22 million, and now we expect them to do  more.   This is wanting to have your cake and eat it too. Literally, this  amendment causes the administration to have to spend more.   Look, that could be a priority, but, if we pass all the amendments  that we have considered since 1 p.m.--1 a.m.--I am sorry--East Coast  time when we had the last vote series, we have cut the Secretary's  ability by $22 million to do these things.   So you have got to choose: Do you want this, or do you want to cut  the Secretary's budget? This is what priorities are all about.   So, no matter how useful this could be, Madam Chair, I would urge my  colleagues, if we pass the amendments that cut tens of millions of  dollars from management, then we can't accomplish this.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, it is nice to believe that, somehow,  if we put this language in, we are going to save money somehow.   This was the promise of the ACA: If we just insure more people, for  instance, they won't use the emergency room as much. Remember that?   Back in 2010, they said: Oh, we are using the emergency room a whole  lot. All we have to do is pass the ACA and our emergency room usage  will go down.   What happened? It went up 20 percent. Healthcare spending actually  went up.   Now, look, having insurance is a good thing. No question about it. I  am a physician. I get it. But, to say that we are going to save money  by doing this--no. This is going to cost money because management has  to obtain these figures.   If this was going to save money, this is easy. Let's find someplace  to pay for it rather than the Secretary's account if it is this great  money saver.   As useful as this could be, again, I would urge my colleagues: If we  pass all the amendments, again, just the $22 million in cuts to  management since the last vote series, we can't afford this.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, here we go again. I mean, let's play some  more pretend.   Look, it's 3:30 in the morning, America is watching. This is why they  have a 9 percent favorable rating of us.   The fact of the matter is, this whole budget is pretend. It pretends  that our current statute, under the Budget Control Act, isn't at a  billions of dollars lower level. So the committee pretended and said,  we are going to pretend that the statute is something else, and we are  going to spend all this money, including over $500 million more for  AIDS. Laudable. It is pretend though.   So what does this amendment do? It just pretends a little more. It  pretends that we can take that $5 million because, Madam Chair, this  comes from that same fund. This is the Secretary's management fund.   We are up to $27 million we have taken in just 2\1/2\ short hours.  This isn't a bottomless well.   I get it. We want to make a point that--and look, congratulations to  the President. The President's State of the Union address, standing  right on that podium, said that we have to have a struggle and a fight  to end HIV/AIDS.   But you don't do it by taking the money from the Secretary's  management fund, now up to $27 million in just 2\1/2\ short hours. Find  it somewhere else. If this is so important, find it somewhere else.  Don't play pretend.   We are not going to fool the American people. When they make a budget  decision today, they choose to do something that they think is  important. They choose not to do something that they think is less  important. That is the way they expect us to act, not play pretend.   We have a $22 trillion debt, a $1 trillion deficit, and we are  playing pretend at 3:30 in the morning. No wonder we have a 9 percent  favorable rating. No wonder Americans don't trust Congress, because  they know we make this stuff up.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, well, we finally have a prioritization here.  This amendment actually takes money from one program that it thinks is  not as important and puts it in another program it thinks is  underfunded. But that is interesting because, look, the Inspector  Generals are very important.   God knows the Inspector General over at Justice is doing a very  important job right now. He has got to look into what the heck went on  over in the senior levels of the Department of Justice that resulted in  that Steele dossier, paid for by a campaign, actually ending up causing  an investigation during a political campaign. Oh, those Inspector  Generals are important. I will agree with on you that.   But this bill already increases the funding of the Inspector General  by 4 percent, higher than inflation. The bill already has an increase.   Most people would think that is enough. Most Americans, if they got a  4 percent increase in their paycheck, they would go, wow, this is  great. This is more than inflation. We want to do a little more.   But that is not the problem with this. It is where the money comes  from. You see, because the money comes from already-reduced funding at  the Office of Labor Management Standards.   So what is the Office of Labor Management because, you know, Madam  Chair, we have--at 3:45 Eastern Time we probably don't have millions of  people watching, but we have Americans watching who might be asking,  what is this Office of Labor Management?   This is the one that actually sees that unions are following the  rules.                                time  0345    Now, that is actually pretty important now, because there was a major  Supreme Court decision called Janus last year that actually said that  unions can't force their members to pay dues for political purposes.  That is a broad, new responsibility.   So the fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court has basically  said there is this broad, new responsibility for the Office of Labor- Management Standards because, Madam Chair, we already have reports of  how unions are kind of gaming this and not really complying with the  Supreme Court. The committee already cut it.   Madam Chair, I do commend the gentleman, because if he has been here  a while--well, he may not have been here for the last couple of hours,  but I have said, look, when we fund one program more, we have got to  fund another program less. Madam Chair, I congratulate the gentleman  for doing it.   I just disagree with what the gentleman wants to fund less, because  this is critical, because American workers who don't believe in the  politics of what their union is promoting shouldn't be forced to pay  for that political advocacy. Janus was clear on that.   It is also clear that unions are trying to get around that, and the  enforcement is through the Office of Labor-Management Standards.   We should be increasing this, not decreasing it as it was in the  baseline budget, and certainly not decreasing it further, as the  gentleman has proposed.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I stand corrected. The gentleman is  absolutely right. It is the unions actually forcing nonunion members to  pay. And it is equally egregious. It equally is enforced under this,  and that is why I oppose it. We should actually be increasing the  funds.   Again, I congratulate the gentleman for setting priorities. I just  disagree with his priorities.   Madam Chair, I urge the Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, there is no arguing that these programs are  important, but, again, we have to set priorities.   This doesn't say this program is important, and this other one is  less important so we are going to take money from it. In fact, it takes  money from CMS management.   Now, that is kind of interesting, because I have a lot of seniors in  my district who depend upon Medicare being administered properly.   Thirteen thousand seniors enter Medicare every day, and what this  amendment does is cut the funding to HHS that oversees the management  of CMS, oversees the management of those 13,000 people entering  Medicare every day.    I have no argument with these school health programs. They are  important. But if they are important, then we have to choose what is  less important.   I wouldn't have chosen, certainly, the management of the Medicare  program. I think the seniors in my district would beg to differ that  that is a good priority choice.   For that reason, Madam Chair, I reluctantly oppose the amendment  because it doesn't set the priorities that need to be set, despite how  important they are.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts for  recognizing the importance of these programs.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I am not going to argue about the  importance of the clinics, but to somehow suggest that a program that  is a complete subsidy program--Madam Chair, all we have to do is just  read. This is, again, why the American people just have to read the  amendment.   The amendment doesn't say anything about forcing administrative  savings. It says we are going to administratively cut. It doesn't  suggest how savings are going to be found.   Again, it is important to get that $5 million for this program, but  for heaven's sake, the fact of the matter is we have to make priority  decisions. I would offer that cutting the administration for Medicare,  when we take 13,000 people into the program every day, is not the  proper offset for this.                           Parliamentary Inquiries     Madam Chair, parliamentary inquiry.    Parliamentary inquiry, Madam Chair. Does any time remain  on that side?    Madam Chair, parliamentary inquiry. Does any time remain  on that side?    Madam Chair, that is what I thought. That is what I  thought.   Madam Chair, parliamentary inquiry. So it is inappropriate for  someone to speak while I have the floor. Is that correct?    Madam Chair, parliamentary inquiry. That was not a  hypothetical question. Someone was speaking while I had the floor.    Madam Chair, I move to adjourn.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee rise.   Madam Chair, I will repeat my parliamentary inquiry, and I may  withdraw the motion. Is it appropriate for someone to speak while  someone else has the floor?    Madam Chair, so I assume that answer validates my point.   Madam Chair, I withdraw the motion to rise.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0400
