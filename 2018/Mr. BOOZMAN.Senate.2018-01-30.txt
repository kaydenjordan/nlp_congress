 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, tonight in the State of the Union  Address, President Trump will discuss the importance of infrastructure  investment. This is an important conversation for the administration to  lead because our Nation's infrastructure is in need of an overhaul.  Having the support of the administration provides us tremendous  opportunity to revamp the way we prioritize and fund our Nation's  infrastructure.   As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I  understand the importance of infrastructure investment. Since I came to  Congress, I have been a constant advocate for increased investment,  particularly for our Nation's water resources. Last Congress, I  supported the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the  Nation Act, as well as a comprehensive highway bill, the Fixing  America's Surface Transportation Act. Passing these pieces of  legislation was a major step forward, but only a step in the process.  There is still more to be done, and I am looking forward to the  opportunity to make critical infrastructure investments this Congress.   Like many Americans, I am encouraged by the President's commitment to  improving our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Looking at the example  set by President Dwight Eisenhower and the establishment of the  Interstate Highway System, it is clear that infrastructure investment  boosts our economy, creates immediate jobs, and produces decades of  economic prosperity and opportunity.   Unfortunately, since President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid  Highway Act of 1956, we have relied on a fix-as-fail approach to our  Nation's infrastructure. Not only is this approach more expensive,  increasingly causing delays to commerce, but it also poses a risk to  public safety. By ensuring that our roads, bridges, and water systems  meet an American standard for excellence, we can save many lives. In  water infrastructure funding alone, the United States faces a shortfall  of over $500 billion, which includes drinking water, wastewater, storm  water, and water supply projects. This funding shortage is reflected in  the American Society of Civil Engineers' overall grade for America's  infrastructure, which is a D-plus. This is not a rural issue or a big  city issue. It is not a red State problem or a blue State problem. This  is a national emergency, one where we can find bipartisan support.   We can, and must, work together to provide all Americans with safe  and reliable drinking water and effective wastewater and storm water  treatment. Access to safe and clean water is critical to the livelihood  of every American.   Senator Booker and I am introducing commonsense legislation that will  revolutionize the way we invest in needed water infrastructure. The  Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now--or SRF WIN--Act  takes the best of State revolving funds, SRFs, and combines them with  the best of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, better  known as WIFIA.   The SRF WIN Act creates a significant pot of money within the WIFIA  Program that is available only to SRFs. Further, the bill allows State  SRFs to bundle their priority drinking water and wastewater projects  together and make a single loan request. This dramatically increases  the availability of SRF funding to communities across the Nation while  substantially reducing the time and related costs for completing  projects.   Because all 50 State SRFs have a triple A bond rating, they have a  very low risk of default, less than one-half of 1 percent. This,  combined with the leveraging power of WIFIA, has given the SRF WIN Act  the leveraging capacity of an incredible 100 to 1, according to  technical assistance provided by the EPA's Office of Water.   Simply put, the SRF WIN Act is a critical component to future water  infrastructure financing. With a $1 billion investment, the U.S.  Government will create over $50 billion in project money.   This is not a handout; this is a loan from the Federal Government to  the States that will be paid back over 35 years. The SRF WIN Act gives  communities the tools they need to help themselves. Instead of waiting  decades for funding, communities will be able to invest in their  crumbling water infrastructure now. With 35 years to pay back their  loan, ratepayers will avoid harm and not see massive rate spikes.   What the SRF WIN Act does is simple. It combines the efficiency and  trust associated with the SRF with the leveraging power of WIFIA. This  legislation makes the process easier and more affordable for States and  communities to access Federal water infrastructure funding. I encourage  my colleagues who support the SRF, WIFIA, and more funding for water  infrastructure projects in rural communities and big cities alike to  cosponsor the SRF WIN Act.   This has been a monumental effort of bipartisan work. Senator Booker  and I have been working for months to meet with everyone in the water  industry to ensure that our bill helps people all over the country, in  communities both big and small. This bill is the result of months of  negotiations, taking the best ideas available to ensure this  commonsense, bipartisan legislation will work effectively and  efficiently, providing billions in project dollars to communities that  have traditionally not had access to these types of funds.   I would like to specifically thank the EPA Office of Water, the  Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, the American Water  Works Association, the Water Environment Federation, and the  Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies for providing us technical  assistance to ensure that we preserve the WIFIA and SRF Programs.   The fact is, communities need every possible funding tool at their  disposal, and this bill is another great tool that will work with the  WIFIA and SRF Programs.   The SRF WIN Act has strong support from rural and municipal water and  [[Page S584]]  wastewater organizations. This landmark legislation also has the  support of our Nation's leading construction, engineering, labor, and  manufacturing organizations, including the National Rural Water  Association, the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, the  American Society of Civil Engineers, the Associated General Contractors  of America, the American Council of Engineering Companies, the National  Association of Clean Water Agencies, Ducks Unlimited, the American  Public Works Association, the Rural Community Assistance Partnership,  the Water Systems Council, the International Union of Operating  Engineers, the Vinyl Institute, the Hydraulic Institute, and the  California Association of Sanitation Agencies.   Congress needs to do a better job of providing basic public services,  such as safe roads, bridges, and an up-to-date water infrastructure  system. This is the time to act to make water infrastructure investment  a priority.   With innovative financing and private sector investment, not only  will we be providing Americans with basic water infrastructure, but we  will also be creating jobs, keeping commodity and utility prices low,  and remaining competitive on the global stage.   We can no longer kick the can down the road and ignore our  infrastructure problems. It is time for the United States to be  realistic about its water problems and start investing in water  infrastructure today.   I ask my colleagues to join Senator Booker and me in supporting  significant new investment in our Nation's water infrastructure and to  cosponsor the SRF WIN Act today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, tonight in the State of the Union  Address, President Trump will discuss the importance of infrastructure  investment.
