 Madam President, I don't need to tell anyone why we are  here. We are here because ObamaCare is fundamentally broken. That is  clear. It is evident. Everybody knows that.   A combination of soaring premiums and rapidly decreasing insurer  participation has left the law's centerpiece--the healthcare  exchanges--literally on the brink of collapse. Insurers are fleeing.  Nationwide, 141 insurers have registered to offer plans on the  exchanges in 2018, which represents a 38-percent drop from 2017, and  that is on top of a nearly 30-percent drop in insurer participation  from 2016 to 2017.   If the trend of the past 2 years continues, the final number of  insurers offering plans on the exchanges in 2018 is likely to be  roughly half the number that offered plans in 2016--a year ago. At  least 40 counties around the country are likely to have no ObamaCare  insurer in 2018 and another 1,300-plus counties are likely to have just  one choice of insurer.   President Obama once said that shopping on the exchanges would be  like buying a TV on Amazon. For a lot of people next year, it is going  to be like shopping for a TV on Amazon, if Amazon only offered one  brand of TV. Of course, for some people it is going to be like shopping  for a TV on Amazon only to discover that Amazon has no TVs at all.   Another thing ObamaCare was supposed to do was make health insurance  more affordable. That hasn't worked too well. Premiums on the exchanges  have soared and soared again. Between 2013 and 2017, the average  individual market monthly premium in the healthcare.gov States  increased by 105 percent. How many families in this country can afford  to have their health insurance premium more than double in just 5  years--and there is no end in sight.   Here are some of the premium hikes insurers are proposing for 2018:   In Maryland, one insurer has proposed an average premium increase of  52 percent; an Iowa insurer is seeking an average 43.5-percent premium  increase; a North Carolina insurer is pursuing an average 22.9-percent  hike; a Virginia insurer is looking for an average rate increase of 38  percent; a Delaware insurer is looking for an average rate hike of 33.6  percent; a Maine insurer is seeking an average rate hike of 40 percent;  and in New Mexico, one insurer is seeking a rate increase of nearly 80  percent.   Again, those are rate hikes for just 1 year. That is after years of  dramatic premium increases on the exchanges. Suffering under ObamaCare  isn't limited to high premiums and decreasing choices. There are the  Americans who have lost their healthcare plans, and the Americans who  have lost access to the doctors they liked, the huge deductibles that  left some Americans unable to use their insurance, and the ObamaCare  tax hikes that have hurt small businesses and driven up the cost of  health insurance.   ObamaCare has failed. Americans are suffering. Doing nothing is not  an option. Yesterday we moved forward to debate legislation to provide  relief to the millions of Americans who have been hurt by ObamaCare. We  are going to have a full debate and give people a chance to help shape  the final bill.   I hope that at the end of the week, we will be able to pass a strong  bill to start undoing the harm ObamaCare has caused. We owe the  American people nothing less. We made a commitment to the American  people; that if they elected us, we would do everything we could to  give them relief from ObamaCare. It is time to make good on that  promise.   Chances to do away with damaging government programs don't come  around every day. Once you give the government power, it can be pretty  hard to wrest it away. This week, we have the chance to start repealing  a really bad government program. We need to take it. If we don't act to  help the American people, no one will. Democrats have made it clear  that if they were in power, they would be doubling down on ObamaCare's  failures.   The head of the Democratic Party in the U.S. Senate openly stated  single-payer healthcare is on the table for Democrats. A number of  colleagues on the Democratic side have proposed that legislation. An  analysis of one of our Democratic colleague's single-payer plan  estimated that it would cost $32 trillion over 10 years. Well, that  would require a tax hike so staggering the Washington Post pointed out  that even the Senator who proposed it--an avowed Socialist--didn't  offer anything close to what would be needed to pay for it.   We are the only hope Americans have of getting out from under  ObamaCare's burdens. This week, we have a chance to pass legislation to  finally provide them with relief. I heard my colleagues get up and talk  about the impact the proposed legislation that is before us  [[Page S4241]]  would have on people across this country and American workers. I have  to say, I talked to a lot of rank-and-file, hard-working South Dakotans  and South Dakota families who have been hit so hard by these premium  increases. I talked to families--a mom and dad with two kids who are  paying more than $2,000 a month in premiums to get insurance in the  individual marketplace.   In my State of South Dakota, premiums since 2013--the last 5 years-- have gone up 124 percent. They have literally doubled. Do you know what  that means in South Dakota? That is almost a $3,600 increase in just  the last 5 years. What average family who is trying to raise kids,  trying to pay the bills, trying to save for retirement, trying to put  something aside for college education, trying to pay the mortgage and  the utility bill--how many families can put up with a healthcare bill  that has gone up in the last 5 years by almost $3,600? That is a  crisis. That is why we are here.   Our colleagues on the other side want to turn a deaf ear and blind  eye to what is happening out there. We can't afford to do that because  the status quo is unsustainable. There is absolutely no way the  American people who are suffering under the harms caused by ObamaCare  can continue to abide the status quo.   It is up to us to take the steps that are necessary to move us in a  different direction, a better path that brings stability to the  marketplace, that gives people more choices, more options, greater  competition, and brings down premiums and deductibles and the costs  that are driving family budgets through the roof.   What we have seen since ObamaCare has been implemented are higher  costs, higher taxes, and fewer options. It is as simple as that. That  is what we are up against, and that is why it is time for us to act. I  hope when we conclude this process at the end of this week--and we have  an opportunity for everybody to offer their amendments--we will move  forward with the bill and fulfill our promise to the American people.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Abigail  Kosiak. Abigail hails from Sioux Falls, SD, and is a rising junior at  Utah State University.   While interning on the Commerce Committee, Abigail worked in the  committee's front office, assisted the Communications, Technology,  Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee and gave tours of the  Capitol. She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the  most out of her internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation  to Abigail for all of the fine work she did for the Commerce Committee  and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
