 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a constituent of  the 21st Congressional District of Texas. This man was a hero, veteran,  and the oldest known graduate of Texas A&M University, the alma mater  of my bride. His name was Colonel Tom C. ``Ike'' Morris.   Colonel Morris passed away Sunday in San Antonio at the age of 109  years old, leaving behind a life and legacy all of us can only aspire  to someday.   Colonel Morris is the epitome of what the Greatest Generation  embodied. He worked five jobs to stay in school during the Depression  and graduated from Texas A&M with a bachelor's degree in agriculture.   Working his way through school didn't stop him from being an engaged  member of the Aggie community. He was senior class president, chaired  the committee that set the first requirements for seniors to earn the  famous Aggie Ring, and was a member of the track and field team.   He also knew what it meant to fight for a man's right to live free.  He fought in the 38th Infantry of the 2nd Infantry Division in World  War II. He went on to land on Omaha Beach during the invasion of  Normandy and, with his unit, he liberated the first city in France.   Colonel Morris married his high school sweetheart, and they were  married for 77 years.   Colonel Morris celebrated his 109th birthday this August. When asked  about the secret to living a long life, Colonel Morris said, ``Do your  best.''   We could improve from adhering to such sage, simple advice.   Colonel Morris, we thank you for your service and for leading a life  worthy of example. May you rest in peace now. God bless you, sir.                            ____________________
