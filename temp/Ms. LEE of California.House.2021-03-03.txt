 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me rise to  support the Pressley-Meng-Schakowsky amendment. I thank Congresswoman  Pressley for bringing this forward and to say that she is about the  future and really about making sure that civic participation is really  enhanced and moved forward by allowing for this amendment to come into  this bill, H.R. 1, because this is what it is about. It is about our  democracy, and she has been consistent in terms of inclusion and making  sure our democracy works.    Elections are about the future, and no one has more at stake in that  future than our youth. By age 16, we trust our young people with a host  of important decisions and responsibilities. It is the moment when  lifelong habits are built and when ideas about the world become to be  fixed. Evidence has shown that when people start voting younger, they  are more likely to exercise their right to vote as they grow older.   Too many of the arguments against lowering the voting age to 16  crumble when you really examine them clearly. Often the objection is  simply that 16-year-olds are too young to exercise good judgment. This  is really a patronizing thought. In fact, it is downright scary to  think that we would have our government policies decide what  constitutes as wisdom for our young people.   It is past time for us to elevate voting as one of the central  responsibilities of our democracy. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
