 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Lilie  Murray of Rye as October's Granite Stater of the Month for her work to  provide support and necessities to those in need.   Lilie was first inspired to take up the cause to help less fortunate  members of her community after her advisor and sophomore-year honors  ecology teacher, Kimberly McGlinchey, taught Lilie's class about the  United Nation's sustainable development goals, The class focused  specifically on 3 of the 17 goals: no poverty, quality education, and  sustainable cities and communities.   In an effort to make progress on these goals in her community, Lilie  started Portsmouth Community Closet, which donates new or gently used  clothing to people in need on the Seacoast. The group distributed its  first donations at Gosling Meadows, a public housing neighborhood in  Portsmouth.   During that event, Lilie learned that Gosling Meadows' residents were  struggling to clean their clothes after the neighborhood laundromat  shut down. Many of the residents did not have cars, and the local city  buses do not allow residents to bring large bags on the bus.   In response, Lilie organized a fundraiser to bring washers and dryers  to families living in Gosling Meadows, giving priority to families with  students who attended her public high school. The fundraiser was a huge  success, raising $4,500 to provide eight families with energy-saving  washers and dryers.   Following up on her work with Gosling Meadows, Lilie started a summer  program at Greenleaf Recreation Center in Portsmouth, which mainly  serves children ages 6 to 13 from Gosling Meadows, as well as another  public housing neighborhood in Portsmouth. She and her classmates  brought the children in the program on trips that they normally would  not be able to afford, such as rock climbing or blueberry picking.   Her work with these kids inspired her to jump into another project to  help her community, this time focusing on literacy. Lilie could see how  much these children love to read, but there was no dedicated space in  the Greenleaf Recreation Center for quiet reading. So over the summer  she and her classmates built a colorful reading nook in the Greenleaf  Recreation Center to give these children the space and resources that  they needed to read and learn.   What is so wonderful about Lilie's story is that each one of her  volunteer services builds on the next and goes to show how inspiring  and motivating it can be to volunteer in one's community.   Thank you, Lilie, for your continued efforts to help those less  fortunate and for committing yourself to creating a more just and equal  society.                            ____________________
