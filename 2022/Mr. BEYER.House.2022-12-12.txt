 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 7077) to require the United  States Fire Administration to conduct on-site investigations of major  fires, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering the U.S. Fire       Administration Act''.       SEC. 2. FIRE SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS.         The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15       U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 38. INVESTIGATION AUTHORITIES.         ``(a) In General.--In the case of a major fire, the       Administrator may send incident investigators, which may       include safety specialists, fire protection engineers, codes       and standards experts, researchers, and fire training       specialists, to the site of the fire to conduct a fire safety       investigation as described in subsection (b).        ``(b) Investigation Required.--A fire safety investigation       conducted under this section--        ``(1) shall be conducted in coordination and cooperation       with appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       territorial authorities, including Federal agencies that are       authorized to investigate any fire; and        ``(2) shall examine the previously determined cause and       origin of the fire and assess broader systematic matters to       include use of codes and standards, demographics, structural       characteristics, smoke and fire dynamics (movement) during       the event, and costs of associated injuries and deaths.        ``(c) Report.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), upon       concluding any fire safety investigation under this section,       the Administrator shall--        ``(A) issue a public report to the appropriate Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and territorial authorities on the       findings of such investigation; or        ``(B) collaborate with another investigating Federal,       State, local, Tribal, or territorial agency on the report of       that agency.        ``(2) Exception.--If the Administrator, in consultation       with appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       territorial authorities determines that issuing a report       under paragraph (1) would have a negative impact on a       potential or ongoing criminal investigation, the       Administrator is not required to issue such report.        ``(3) Contents.--Each public report issued under paragraph       (1) shall include recommendations on--        ``(A) any other buildings with similar characteristics that       may bear similar fire risks;        ``(B) improving tactical response to similar fires;        ``(C) improving civilian safety practices;        ``(D) assessing the costs and benefits to the community of       adding fire safety features; and        ``(E) how to mitigate the causes of the fire.        ``(d) Discretionary Authority.--In addition to a fire       safety investigation conducted pursuant to subsection (a),       provided doing so would not have a negative impact on a       potential or ongoing criminal investigation, the       Administrator may send fire investigators to conduct a fire       safety investigation at the site of any fire with unusual or       remarkable context that results in losses less severe than       those occurring as a result of a major fire, in coordination       and cooperation with the appropriate Federal, State, local,       Tribal, and territorial authorities, including Federal       agencies that are authorized to investigate the fire.        ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to--        ``(1) affect or otherwise diminish the authorities or the       mandates vested in other Federal agencies;        ``(2) grant the Administrator authority to investigate a       major fire for the purpose of an enforcement action or       criminal prosecution; or        ``(3) require the Administrator to send investigators or       issue a report for a major fire when the Administrator, in       coordination and cooperation with the appropriate Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and territorial authorities, determine       that it may compromise a potential or ongoing criminal       investigation.        ``(f) Major Fire Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term `major fire' shall have the meaning given such term       under regulations to be issued by the Administrator.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7077, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7077, the  Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration Act.   Although significant progress has been made in preventing major fires  over the past 25 years, building fires in the United States remain a  serious problem.   According to the U.S. Fire Administration, there was an estimated  372,000 residential building fires within the United States in 2020.  These fires caused an estimated 2,615 deaths, 11,825 injuries, and $8.6  billion in property loss.   It is very timely that we are about to enact this bill as winter  approaches and residential building fires are more likely to occur.   It is essential that we learn from major fires to inform and improve  future fire prevention efforts. The U.S. Fire Administration is an  essential part of these efforts.   Unfortunately, the agency currently lacks the authority to  participate in post-fire onsite investigations.                                time  1415    H.R. 7077 addresses this gap by authorizing USFA to send their own  experts to the site of a major fire to conduct an onsite investigation  in coordination and cooperation with Federal, State, local, Tribal, and  Territorial authorities. In doing so, this bill more fully leverages  the unique expertise of the U.S. Fire Administration to help strengthen  fire prevention.   This bill would also require the administrator to issue a public  report on the findings of an investigation or collaborate with another  investigating agency on their report. This report would include  recommendations on improving tactical response and civilian safety  practices, as well as on approaches to mitigation. These reports are an  essential component of ensuring that everyone can utilize the knowledge  we collect from major fires to improve future prevention efforts.   I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Ritchie Torres, for  his leadership on this bill. Representative Torres introduced this bill  after a major residential building fire in his district on January 9 of  this year resulted in the tragic deaths of 17 people, including 8  children.   I also thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, Representatives Haley Stevens, Anthony Gonzalez, and Peter  Meijer for their leadership on this bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join us in passing this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 558) to establish a national integrated flood information  system within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S. 558, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 558, the Flood Level  Observation,  [[Page H9657]]  Operations, and Decision Support Act or FLOODS Act.   Flooding is the most common weather-related natural disaster in the  United States. It affects every State in the Nation, with 99 percent of  U.S. counties having experienced a flooding event in the last 25 years.   Unfortunately, climate change is predicted to increase the frequency  and severity of extreme weather events and sea level rise, which will,  in turn, increase flooding in the future.   This bill would establish a National Integrated Flood Information  System to coordinate and integrate flood research at the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The bill would  designate a service coordination hydrologist at each National Weather  Service River Forecast Center and would leverage existing work within  NOAA and through partnerships to improve timely decisionmaking. It  would improve observations and modeling for total water prediction  through partnerships with other Federal agencies and academia and  create a fellowship for graduate students in hydrologic fields to work  at Federal agencies. Additionally, this bill amends the Weather  Research and Forecasting Innovation Act to improve NOAA's tornado  warning and hurricane forecasting programs.   Section 13 of the FLOODS Act would also codify the interagency Water  Subcabinet established under Executive Order 13956 through the  Interagency Committee on Water Management and Infrastructure  established in this bill. This existing interagency body plays a key  role in ensuring Federal agencies can efficiently and effectively  manage water resources in America. Codifying this body not only shows  Congress' support for these ongoing efforts, but also ensures the work  will continue unimpeded. Congress does not intend this act to require  the creation of an additional Federal interagency committee that would  be duplicative of, or even in conflict with, the existing interagency  Water Subcabinet.   Overall, this bill would improve the coordination and communication  of flood events by NOAA, as well as improve tornado warning and  hurricane forecasting. These measures will protect lives and property,  especially in regions at high risk of flooding.   I thank Senator Wicker for sponsoring this bill, and I also thank and  recognize my colleague on the Science Committee, Representative  Sherrill, for her leadership on the issue of flooding and for leading  the House companion of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the passage of this important legislation so we can send it to  the President's desk, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, once again, I have no more speakers on this  bill, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for presenting  this with me. I wish we could do everything this way, but it is a very  nice thing.   Madam Speaker, as you know, I am privileged to represent one of the  most environmentally friendly districts in the country right across the  river. We never get 6 feet of snow. I can't remember a drought. We get  the occasional vestiges of a hurricane and a tornado once every 10  years that rips up somebody's garage. But it floods all the time. Not  only does it flood on the river, it floods 2 miles up the river as all  the storm sewers back up, storm sewers that were built in the 1930s or  the 1910s that can't handle the rain that we have right now.   When they reintroduced earmarks, we discovered with 1,000 nonprofits  it was difficult to pick a nonprofit for 10 earmarks. So we went to our  local governments, Alexandria, Falls Church, and Arlington, and said:  What do you need?   Every one of them asked for flood relief.                                time  1430    This is one of those rare instances where an environmental bill has a  huge impact, even on my own district, and I  [[Page H9658]]  know it has a much greater impact on so many places around the country.  I think about poor Iowa that was under water for most of a year.   Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to be able to present this with  Representative Bice in a bipartisan way, and I urge my colleagues to  support S. 558.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank chairwoman Maloney for all of her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bill, H.R.  7082, which would designate the post office on 2200 North George Mason  Drive in Arlington as the Jesus Antonio Collazos Post Office Building.   Jesus was the epitome of the American Dream.  [[Page H9669]]    He was born in 1953 in Colombia and grew up in a modest, hardworking  family. Even at a young age, he was passionate about education and  wanted to help his community and did so by helping teach literacy while  still a high school student.   After graduating high school, Jesus attended the University of de San  Buenaventura Cali to pursue a degree in accounting.   In 1978, Jesus immigrated to Washington, D.C., to reunite with his  mother and sisters in the hopes of seeking a better future.   In 1980, Jesus married the love of his life, Luz Miriam, who is here  today with their children, Vanessa and Michael.   After working in accounting positions at various hotels, he applied  to work for the United States Postal Service as a letter carrier, where  he would embark on a 25-year career.   He made an impression early on and was given a temporary assignment  in leadership which turned into a permanent offer. He ultimately turned  it down to remain a letter carrier.   This turned out to be the right decision, as Jesus preferred to spend  his days outdoors, building relationships on his route, and connecting  with the neighborhood. He fell in love with that neighborhood so much  that he waited patiently for the right opportunity to buy his own  family home there. When the day came, his affable personality gave him  an advantage over other buyers. So much so that the seller accepted his  offer despite it being the lowest of all bids.   In 1999, Jesus and Luz moved their family from an apartment to a new  single-family home on his mail route becoming his own mailman.   Motivated by a desire to spend more time with his family and  particularly his friends, he retired in February 2019.   At the start of the pandemic, he discovered a lump on the side of his  neck that turned out to be an aggressive cancer. On Monday, May 4,  2020, during his first oncology appointment, he was sent to the  emergency room for COVID. He spent the next two weeks in ICU and  suffered a stroke. And on June 6, Jesus took his last breath.   He was one of millions of Americans taken from us by COVID-19, but  Jesus was also a treasure to our local community. Jesus will be  remembered for his infectious personality, outstanding work ethic, and  loyalty to his loved ones.   After his death, the Collazos family immediately began to receive an  outpouring of love via messages, calls, cards, and meals from countless  family members and friends. An outdoor memorial service for Jesus was  held on June 26, 2020, where many came together to honor his memory.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   As a testament to Jesus' impact, his U.S. Postal Service coworkers  opened his outdoor memorial service with a mail truck parade.   We were lucky to have Jesus Collazos in our community. May his life  be a reminder of the positive impact immigrants, new Americans, have on  this country. Please join me, the Collazos family, and the Arlington  community in honoring Jesus' memory by voting ``yes.''                                time  1545
