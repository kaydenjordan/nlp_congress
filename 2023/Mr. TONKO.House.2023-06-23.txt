 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the epidemic of gun  violence our country is experiencing.   On average each year gun violence in America kills some 43,000 people  and injures around 76,000 more.   Over and over, our communities are left reeling from senseless  tragedy, stuck in a devastating cycle of violence. We can no longer  allow this level of pain to be our normal. Change must happen and  happen now.   I am proud to have signed the discharge petitions to bring essential  gun violence prevention legislation to the House floor, including the  Assault Weapons Ban, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and the  Enhanced Background Checks Act.   These are rational and commonsense bills. They are not about taking  away rights. They are about protecting our children, families, and  communities. They are about taking the fear out of the every day.   Going to school, the grocery store, or even making a wrong turn  should not be a death sentence. Our communities deserve better, and I  vow to continue to fight for long overdue action to address gun  violence in our beloved country.                            ____________________
