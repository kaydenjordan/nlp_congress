 Mr. Speaker, last week, some of my  Doctors Caucus colleagues and I took a trip to the southern border to  observe the ongoing humanitarian crisis. What we saw was nothing short  of tragic.   The bottom line is that the situation stems from several key Biden  policies that have created an incentive for migrants to cross the  border illegally. President Biden abolished the Remain in Mexico policy  despite the fact that it helped migrants avoid numerous dangers. The  policy was accompanied by his administration's moratorium on  deportations, not abiding by title 42's expressed purpose.   Let there be no mistake, no one gets into this country without the  expressed permission of drug cartels at our southern border. Not only  are illegal immigrants coming in, but drugs, weapons, and human  trafficking are coming now in record numbers.   Even worse, this crisis falls on terrified unaccompanied children. I  will never forget seeing a 4-year-old with nothing on her back except  her clothes and a telephone number written in Sharpie upon her chest.   Only securing our border will end this crisis. I ask the Biden  administration to return to the previous administration's border  policies.                            ____________________
