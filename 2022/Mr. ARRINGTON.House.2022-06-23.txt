 Madam Speaker, God's Word says, To be absent from the  body is to be present with the Lord.   On June 21, 2022, after 76 years, Donald Wayne Porter went home to be  with his Lord.   Despite a battle with Parkinson's that may have overcome his body, it  never conquered his spirit.   Wayne Porter represents the very best of America, the epitome of west  Texas, and a true cowboy spirit.   He was a third generation cattle rancher, grocery store owner, deacon  in the First Baptist Church, and a decorated combat veteran of the  Vietnam war.   But his greatest legacy, Madam Speaker, was his fierce love and  commitment to his God and his family. Wayne had just celebrated 50  years with his beloved wife, Edith, and is survived by his 6 children  and 11 grandchildren.   His only son, John Porter, served as my chief of staff.   While I didn't know Wayne Porter, they say the apple doesn't fall too  far from the tree, so I felt like I knew the man. It was clear to me  that Wayne Porter was a man of immense character, quiet strength, with  a Texas-sized heart for God and people, the proudest of family men, and  a patriot to his core.   God has blessed America with men like Donald Wayne Porter, and may  God continue to bless John, Madison, Duke, and the entire Porter family  in their great loss but in heaven's gain.   Go west Texas.                            ____________________
