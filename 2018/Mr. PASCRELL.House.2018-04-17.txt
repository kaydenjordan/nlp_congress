 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak today in support of the Moving Americans Privacy  Protection Act, which would require that U.S. Customs and Border  Protection ensures that personally identifiable information is not  publicly disclosed during an international household move.  [[Page H3360]]    Customs is currently required to adequately protect personally  identifiable information that is provided on, among other things,  international shipping documents. In order to fulfill this mandate,  Customs currently maintains procedures that allow shippers to request  confidential treatment of certain information.   However, it can often take Customs several months to make a  determination on such a request. Some determinations are not even made  until after the information has already been publicly disclosed. That  is the problem.   As a result, personally identifiable information has been mistakenly  disclosed to the public. This impact has been acutely felt by U.S.  civil servants and military personnel, which make up a large percentage  of international household moves.   Disclosing this information has increased the risks that individuals  may be the victims of identity theft and credit card fraud.                                time  1315    In my view, the current system at Customs is not working as well as  it could or should.   I also do not believe that individuals should bear the burden of  making a proactive request to Customs to ensure that their personally  identifiable information is not publicly disclosed. We should be able  to expect that our government will protect such sensitive information.   This bill is intended to rectify the problems by mandating that  Customs put in place a proactive system that will prevent personally  identifiable information from being made public.   I call on my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that  has support on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, today is tax day, as if you didn't know that, and newly  filed FEC reports show that the President's campaign paid his  businesses $150,000 in the first quarter of this year, including  $68,000 to the Trump Hotel in D.C., and $58,000 for rent.   Lobbyists in foreign governments continue to spend money at these  hotels. We have no way of verifying what that income looks like or  where it is coming from.   Candidate Trump said on the campaign trail: ``My whole life I have  been greedy, greedy, greedy. I have grabbed all the money I could get.  I am so greedy.''   Since the election, we have witnessed not just his own conflicts of  self-enrichment at taxpayers' expense, but petty graft from members of  his Cabinet and his administration, lavish travel on military jets and  first-class tickets for personal reasons, and expensive office  decorations. Lobbyists have been welcomed into agencies to write their  own regulations.    His campaign and White House is filled with the ranks of people who  already have pleaded guilty; Michael Flynn, who sold his connections to  Russia and Turkish dictators while working for Mr. Trump; and so many  other associates and their connections to foreign governments as  leverage, and that is potentially a conflict of interest.   Bribery and grift might have a place in a crime family, but it has no  place in the Office of the President or in the Congress of the United  States, and this Congress has been absolutely derelict and complicit in  the unprecedented conflicts of this Presidency.   Since February of 2017, I have been calling on the chairman of the  Committee on Ways and Means to request the President's tax returns,  which he has the authority to do under section 6103 of the Tax Code. I  have called up resolutions. Eighteen times the committee and this House  have voted against seeing the President's tax returns. Why?   Why did the President support giving rich people and corporations a  giant tax cut? Why is he letting Wall Street and Big Oil write their  own rules? Why are his children still running his company? Why has he  not divested, as he was told to do by the ethics commissioner?   President Trump seems to have an unhealthy admiration for  authoritarian leaders. He seems to have a vision of turning America  into an economy and government run by his own greedy and connected  circle of oligarchs. But subverting our democracy for personal gain  while Congress looks the other way is poisonous to our republic and our  democracy and it is an anthema to our values.   Today is tax day, the 452nd day of Mr. Trump's Presidency and the  452nd day this Congress has let him off the hook.   I call on the chairman of Ways and Means to stop delaying and get Mr.  Trump's tax returns now, like every other President for the past  several decades. The American people demand it. We owe it to our  democracy to shed light on his conflicts.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from New York  magazine.                  [From New York Magazine, April 1, 2018]                           501 Days in Swampland     (By Joy Crane and Nick Tabor, Introduction by David Cay Johnston)         On the day he took the oath of office, Donald Trump       delivered two messages about what to expect from his       administration. First came the lofty promise of his inaugural       address. ``The forgotten men and women of our country will be       forgotten no longer,'' he vowed. ``For too long, a small       group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of       government while the people have borne the  [[Page H3361]]       cost. Washington flourished--but the people did not share in       its wealth.''        The second message, which Trump delivered without speaking       a word, was aimed at a much smaller, but very rich, audience.       As the new president's motorcade left the Capitol, rolling       past knots of supporters and protesters, it suddenly stopped       three blocks short of the White House. Trump, the First Lady,       and the rest of his family got out of their limos and took a       three-minute turn in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue.        This was no random spot. The very first place Trump headed       after being sworn in--his true destination all along, in a       sense--was the Old Post Office and Clock Tower, which only 12       days before the election had been repurposed as the Trump       International Hotel Washington. The elegant granite       structure, whose architectural character Trump had promised       to preserve, was now besmirched by a gaudy, faux-gold sign       bearing his name. The carefully choreographed stop sent a       clear signal to the foreign governments, lobbyists, and       corporate interests keen on currying favor in Washington.        Oil companies, mining interests, insurance executives,       foreign diplomats, and defense contractors all rushed to book       their annual conferences at Trump's hotels and resorts, where       Cabinet members graciously addressed them. After hiking the       nightly rate to $653--32 percent higher than other local       luxury hotels--Trump collected $2 million in profits from the       property during his first three months in office. By last       August, the hotel's bar and restaurant had hauled in another       $8 million in revenue. And although Trump has pledged to give       away any money his hotels earn from foreign governments, the       plan contains a lucrative loophole: Employees at his hotels       admit that they make no effort to identify guests who       represent other countries, meaning that much of the foreign       money spent at Trump's properties flows directly into his own       pockets. On March 28, a federal judge allowed a lawsuit to go       forward that charges Trump with violating the Constitution by       accepting money from foreign governments at his D.C. hotel.        In fact, although Trump refuses to disclose the details of       his myriad business operations, he continues to enjoy access       to every dime he makes as president. Instead of setting up a       blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest, as other       presidents have done, Trump put his two grown sons in charge       of his more than 500 business entities. His sons regularly       brief Trump about how the enterprises are doing. What's more,       only 15 days after this ``eyes wide open'' trust was set up,       Trump amended the fine print to allow him to take money out       of the operation any time he pleases. The loophole, buried on       page 161 of the 166-page form, stipulates that any ``net       income or principal'' can be distributed to Trump ``at his       request.'' Far from putting his wealth in a blind trust,       Trump asked the public for its blind trust, effectively       sticking his money in a piggy bank in Don Jr.'s room that he       is free to raid at any hour of the day or night.        Trump's children are working hard to cash in on his time in       office--especially with foreign investors. At taxpayer       expense, they have flown to Uruguay, the Dominican Republic,       Dubai, and India in search of licensing and real-estate       deals, trading on the president's influence in exchange for       investments. But the biggest complication of Trump's       presidency--and the one he works hardest to keep secret--is       the way his entire business operation is mired in massive       debt. Rather than being independently wealthy, public records       show, Trump and the business partnerships in which he is a       leading investor owe big banks and foreign governments at       least $2.3 billion--far more than his disclosure reports       indicate. His largest single loan--for nearly $1 billion--is       from a syndicate assembled by Goldman Sachs that includes the       state-owned Bank of China If either Trump or Jared Kushner,       who tried to shake down Qatar's finance minister for a loan,       winds up needing to negotiate new terms on his ballooning       debt, America could find itself being dictated to by a       foreign government--all because the White House, thanks to       Trump's business model, has become a true House of Cards.        What follows is 501 days of official corruption, from       small-time graft and brazen influence peddling to full-blown       raids on the federal Treasury. But as even this initial       glimpse makes clear, Trump isn't draining the swamp--he's       monetizing it.--David Cay Johnston                            Trump's Hotel in D.C.       2016        12/7 Diplomats from Bahrain move the country's National Day       celebration from the Ritz-Carlton to the ballroom at the       Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.      2017        1/20 A watchdog group calls on the General Services       Administration, a federal agency, to stop leasing the Old       Post Office to Trump for use as the hotel.

Trump's haul: $270,000.        2/25 The Kuwaiti Embassy, reportedly pressured by the Trump       Organization, moves its National Day celebration from the       Four Seasons to Trump's hotel.        3/1 The National Railroad Construction and Maintenance       Association hosts a dinner at the hotel, drenched in Trump-      branded coffee and wine.        3/22 The American Petroleum Institute holds its board       meeting at Trump's hotel, where it meets with EPA chief Scott       Pruitt. A month later, Pruitt suspends drilling regulations.        5/1 Rates at the hotel jump to $653 per night, a price hike       of 60 percent since Trump's election.        5/21 A Turkish government council holds its annual       conference at the hotel. The group's chair founded the       company that paid $530,000 to former national-security       adviser Michael Flynn for lobbying work.        7/17 E-cigarette-makers hold their annual conference at the       hotel. Ten days later, the FDA announces it will delay       federal oversight of e-cigarettes until 2022.        8/11 A federal agency accidentally posts the hotel's Q1       profits: $2 million.        9/13 Staffers for Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business       Administration, try to cover up the fact that she addressed a       business lobbying event at the hotel, avoiding images of       hotel signs bearing Trump's name when posting photos of the       event on Twitter.        9/28 The Fund for American Studies, a conservative       organization, hosts a lunch at the hotel. The keynote       speaker, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, thanks Trump's       staff for helping him get confirmed.        10/4 At its annual board meeting, the National Mining       Association is addressed by three Cabinet members: Commerce       Secretary Wilbur Ross, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, and       Energy Secretary Rick Perry. ``Coal is fighting back,'' Perry       exults over breakfast with the country's top mining       executives. ``Clearly the president wants to revive, not       revile, this vital resource. ``Five days later, the Trump       administration announces the repeal of Obama's Clean Power       Plan, which would have encouraged states to replace coal with       wind and solar energy. The plan would have cut climate-      warming pollution from coal plants by a third and saved       taxpayers and consumers as much as $93 billion a year.

He claims to have sold the stock he       owns in the pipeline's builders--as much as $300,000--but       offers no proof.        1/27 Trump issues the travel ban but leaves off Saudi       Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt--countries where he has significant       business interests. His company was paid as much as $10       million for use of his name on a tower in Istanbul, and he       registered eight new businesses in Saudi Arabia during his       campaign.        2/3 Trump, who owned as much as $5 million in bank stocks       in 2016, orders the Treasury secretary to consider ways to       roll back regulations on banks. The value of bank stocks       soars nearly 30 percent during his first year in office.        2/14 Trump, who owned stock in large oil companies, allows       oil companies to hide the payments they make to foreign       governments in exchange for extraction rights.

The company poured $450,000 into Trump's campaign and       inauguration after Obama announced plans to end all federal       contracts with private prisons. GEO also hired two of Jeff       Sessions's former aides, plus a former Trump Organization       employee, as lobbyists. The investment paid off: A month       after Trump took office, he ended the ban on private prisons.       GEO received a $110 million contract to build a new       immigration jail in Texas, plus $44 million a year to operate       it. Earlier this year, the federal Bureau of Prisons       announced it would slash some 6,000 jobs and transfer more       inmates to private facilities.        10/18 Defense contractor L3 Technologies holds its annual       meeting at Trump National Doral.

The deal--which would put Trump's name on 17 high-rises--      violates a Dominican height limit for new resorts. It also       breaks Trump's vow not to seek overseas deals during his       presidency. The Dominican president personally approves the       high-rises. ``Here in the palace, the president's thoughts       are that this U.S president is angry and we better not get in       his way,'' a former Dominican ambassador explains. ``We don't       want to cross him.''        2/6 Melania's lawyers, suing a British paper for libel,       argue its reporting ruined her ``once-in-a-lifetime       opportunity'' to monetize her position as First Lady by       cashing in on ``multi-million-dollar business       relationships.''        2/9 Kellyanne Conway offers ``free commercial'' for       Ivanka's clothing line on Fox News. ``Go buy it today,       everybody.''

To date, he has been forced to change his disclosure form 39       times for failing to mention potential conflicts of interest.        10/4 ProPublica investigation reveals that after Manhattan       DA Cyrus Vance dropped a criminal investigation against       Donald Jr. and Ivanka, their attorney arranged a fund-raiser       on Vance's behalf, donating $32,000 himself and raising at       least $9,000 more.        11/1 Apollo Global Management lends Kushner's real-estate       company $184 million--triple the size of its average loan--      after meeting with him in the White House six weeks later,       the SEC drops investigation into Apollo's finances.        12/3 Kushner is exposed for failing to disclose that his       family's foundation--which he led for nine years--funded an       illegal Israeli settlement on the West Bank. Just before       Trump took office, Kushner tried to sway a U.N. vote against       an anti-settlement resolution.      2018        2/20 Donald Jr. tours India to sell Trump-branded homes;       several newspapers run an ad promising a ``conversation and       dinner'' with him--for an additional fee of $30,000.                            Officials & Their Pals          ``We are going to send the special interests packing.''--      Donald Trump      2017        1/19 During his confirmation as Treasury secretary, Steven       Mnuchin fails to disclose a hedge fund he registered in the       Cayman Islands to avoid paying federal taxes--the very thing       he is supposed to collect as Treasury secretary.        1/24 During his confirmation as secretary of Health and       Human Services, Tom Price fails to disclose an insider deal       he got on $520,000 in stock in a biotech company. As       secretary, he will be in a position to approve a drug the       company has developed.  [[Page H3363]]         2/9 Reports reveal that a top White House aide, Chris       Liddell, participated in meetings between Trump and the CEOs       of 18 companies in which he held large amounts of stock--a       possible criminal offense. The companies included Lockheed       Martin, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and Dow Chemical.        3/16 Congressional investigators reveal that Trump's former       national-security adviser Michael Flynn--who wanted to ``rip       up'' American sanctions on Russia--failed to report $45,000       in fees he received from the Russian state media outlet RT.        4/14 The White House stops releasing logs of visitors,       concealing trips made by lobbyists and corporate executives.       In Trump's first two months alone, by one estimate, more than       500 executives and foreign leaders made unrecorded visits to       the White House.        6/29 HUD Secretary Ben Carson tours Baltimore--accompanied       by prospective business associates being courted by his son.       One administrator on the tour later offers Carson's daughter-      in-law a contract worth $500,000.        11/5 New reports reveal that during his confirmation       hearings, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross failed to disclose       that a shipping firm he owns a stake in has close ties to       Vladimir Putin's son-in-law. His new job puts him in charge       of American trade policy with Russia.        12/18 Under pressure from watchdogs, EPA chief Scott Pruitt       terminates a $120,000 contract for a firm he has worked with       in the past to dig up information on EPA staffers who had       criticized him or his policies.        12/22 ``You all just got a lot richer,'' Trump tells       wealthy patrons at Mar-a-Lago hours after signing a massive       tax giveway to the superrich. The bill saved Trump $15       million in taxes and Jared Kushner $12 million. It also       enriched much of Trump's inner circle--including Linda       McMahon, Betsy DeVos, Steven Mnuchin, and Rex Tillerson.      2018        1/12 Performant Financial is one of only two companies       awarded $400 million in contracts from the Education       Department to collect on defaulted student loans. One notable       former investor in Performant: Education Secretary Betsy       DeVos.        1/31 CDC chief Brenda Fitzgerald is forced to resign over       her purchase of stock in one of the world's largest tobacco       companies. She bought the shares a month after taking over       the agency tasked with reducing tobacco use.        2/1 William Emanuel, a Trump appointee to the National       Labor Relations Board, is investigated for a possible ethics       violation after he votes on a case involving his former law       firm. His tie-breaking vote would have made it harder for       employees at franchises like McDonald's to hold their parent       companies accountable for labor-law violations, but the       decision is thrown out because of his conflict of interest.        3/29 ABC News reports that EPA chief Pruitt spent much of       his first year in Washington living in a townhouse co-owned       by the wife of J. Steven Hart, a top energy lobbyist. Hart       lobbied the EPA on several policies last year, including coal       regulations and limits on air pollution.                           Lobbyist & Other Sleaze         ``We're going to end the government corruption, and we're       going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.''--Donald Trump      2017        1/17 Scott Mason, a key member of Trump's transition team,       returns to lobbying--one of nine transition-team members to       violate Trump's pledge that he would bar such revolving-door       moves for at least six months. One of Mason's clients,       Peabody Energy, later helps dream up a coal-industry bailout       promoted by Energy Secretary Rick Perry.        1/23 Trump appoints Jeffrey Wood, a lobbyist for a coal       polluter, to prosecute environmental crimes like coal       pollution.        2/6 Lauren Maddox, who guided Betsy DeVos through her       confirmation process for Education secretary, is hired by a       for-profit law school to help restore its access to federal       student loans. After paying $130,000 in lobbying fees, the       school gets its wish: The Education Department agrees to       reconsider its eligiblity for millions in loans.        2/27 Billionaire Carl Icahn, an unpaid adviser to Trump,       submits a regulatory proposal that would raise the value of       his investment in an oil refinery. During Trump's first six       weeks in office, Icahn makes an extra $60 million on the       deal.        4/12 Marcus Peacock, a policy expert in Trump's budget       office, takes a job lobbying the budget office for the       Business Roundtable, which represents zoo of America's       largest corporations. Trump makes no move to enforce the       five-year moratorium he vowed to place on such revolving-door       moves.        5/19 Trump nominates K. T. McFarland, adviser who once       siphoned off $14,000 in campaign funds for ``personal use,''       as ambassador to Singapore.        8/1 A top aide to EPA chief Scott Pruitt, who oversees       federal grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars,       receives permission to work as a consultant for private       clients. Despite his influence over public policy, the       identities of his clients will be kept secret.        8/15 Two Trump campaign operatives register a new lobbying       firm, Turnberry Solutions, named after the Scottish town       where Trump owns a golf club. Its first client, Elio Motors,       hires it to help obtain government handouts.        10/17 Whitefish Energy, a Montana firm that employed the       son of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is awarded $300 million       in a no-bid federal contract to restore storm-battered Puerto       Rico.        10/26 Trump nominates J. Steven Gardner, a coal-industry       consultant, to oversee enforcement of strip-mining       regulations. The Senate winds up rejecting the nomination.        11/8 Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump's pick to head the Department       of Homeland Security, was guided through her confirmation by       a lobbyist whose clients compete for DHS contracts.       Privatizing the ``sherpa'' role in confirmations--work long       performed by government staffers--opens up a brazen new       frontier in corruption. The lobbyist, Thad Binge, oversaw the       drafting of official policy memos and was included on emails       between the DHS and the White House, enabling him to exploit       internal information for private gain. Among Bingel's clients       is an Israeli defense contractor being paid $145 million by       DHS to build part of Trump's ``virtual wall'' along the       Mexican border.        12/6 A photographer at the Department of Energy is fired       after leaking a photo that shows Rick Perry receiving a       confidential ``action plan'' from a coal magnate in March.       The plan is a blueprint for the coal-industry bailout that       Perry announced in September.      2018        1/12 Trump gives Kenneth Allen, a former mining executive       who still profits from coal sales to the Tennessee Valley       Authority, a seat on the TVA board.        1/29 Alex Azar, a former lobbyist who worked his way up to       the presidency of a drug company, is sworn in as secretary of       Health and Human Services. Azar, whose company hiked the       price of insulin and other drugs under his watch, is now in       charge of making drugs more affordable.        2/12 Carl Icahn, who served as an unpaid adviser to Trump,       sells $30 million in steel stocks just before Trump announces       tariffs on steel imports.        2/18 Dina Powell, who advised Trump on foreign policy,       returns to Goldman Sachs only two months after leaving the       White House. At Goldman, she will focus on ``enhancing the       firm's relationships'' with some of the same foreign       governments she advised Trump on.        3/2 Trump nominates Peter Wright, an attorney for Dow       Chemical, to lead the EPA's regulation of chemical spills.       Dow has 100 polluted sites that Wright would be in charge of       cleaning up.                                 Petty Graft       2107        2/28 The State Department spends $15,000 in taxpayer money       for the grand opening of a Trump hotel in Vancouver, an event       attended by Eric, Tiffany, and Donald Jr.        4/14 Trump jets to Mar-a-Lago via Air Force One at a cost       to taxpayers of $142,380 per hour. For years, Trump heckled       President Obama for taking vacations and golfing trips at       government expense. If elected, he vowed, he would ``rarely       leave the White House, because there's so much work to be       done.'' In fact, during his first three months in office,       Trump's taxpayer-funded flights to his private properties       exceeded $20 million--on track to quickly surpass the amount       Obama spent on travel during his eight years in office. Trump       made more than 90 visits to his golf courses and played       almost twice as much golf as Obama. His family joined in,       requiring Secret Service agents to rack up an extra 4,054       days of taxpayer-funded travel to keep up.        5/16 Rick Perry and his staffers take a private Jet to a       small-business forum in Kansas City, at a cost to taxpayers       of $35,000, rather than taking a nonstop flight to the       airport 45 minutes away from the event.        6/2 David Shulkin's chief of staff falsifies an email to       suggest that the VA secretary needed to travel to Europe to       receive an award. Shulkin's 11-day trip with his wife, most       of which was devoted to sightseeing, cost taxpayers $122,344.        6/7 Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief, spends $36,000 in taxpayer       money to take a military plane to New York.        6/24 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin marries Louise       Linton and requests a military plane for their honeymoon to       Europe--at a cost to taxpayers of $25,000 per hour.        6/26 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spends $12,375 in       taxpayer money to fly home aboard a private flight from Las       Vegas, where he hung out with a hockey team owned by his       biggest campaign donor.        7/7 Zinke uses $6,250 in taxpayer money for a helicopter       flight from Virginia to Washington, D.C.--a three-hour car       ride--for a horse-riding date with Mike Pence.        8/4 HHS Secretary Tom Price takes a private jet at taxpayer       expense to St. Simons Island, an exclusive resort where he       owns land. The trip, like many of the 26 flights Price took       on corporate jets, could have been accomplished with a       routine commercial flight.        8/21 Mnuchin and his wife travel to Kentucky aboard a       government plane, at a cost to taxpayers of $33,000, to watch       the solar eclipse.        8/30 EPA chief Pruitt spends $43,000 to build a soundproof       phone booth in his office, enabling him to hold secret       conversations with lobbyists and corporate executives. The       Government Accountability Office is investigating whether the       move violated agency spending rules.        9/29 HHS Secretary Price is forced to resign over the       nearly $1 million in taxpayer money he spent taking military       planes and private jets, often to visit family and friends.      2018        2/27 HUD Secretary Ben Carson spends $196,000 on a dinette       set and lounge furniture,  [[Page H3364]]       exceeding the $5,000 legal limit for office improvements.        3/7 Zinke spends $139,000 to renovate his office doors at       Interior.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
