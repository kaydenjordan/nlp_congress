 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the occupant  of the White House.   Mr. Trump, you took an oath, just as I did 5 days ago, to protect and  defend the Constitution and the American people. Sir, you dishonor that  oath. You devalue the life of the immigrant, the worker, and the  survivor. I see right through you and so do the American people. This  has nothing to do with border security. Your shutdown, another Trump- generated crisis, has brought a tsunami of hurt on the American people.   Today, I rise to lift the voices of the unheard. I rise today on  behalf of the families concerned about feeding their children because  their WIC benefits will run dry.   I rise today in solidarity with the thousands of workers with  calloused hands and broken spirits working for no pay.   I rise today in support of the survivor fleeing violent hands,  seeking safety, only to find the shelter door locked because of your  shutdown.   I rise today in support of the American people who believe in the  promise of this Nation and ask for honest pay for an honest day's work.   Today, I rise as one and I stand as thousands.
