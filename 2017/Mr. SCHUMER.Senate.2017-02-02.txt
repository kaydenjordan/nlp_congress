 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I spoke at length about the Supreme Court  nomination yesterday, but I just want to underscore a few points. We in  the Senate have a constitutional duty to examine the record of Judge  Gorsuch robustly, exhaustively, and comprehensively, and then advise  and consent, as we see fit. We have a responsibility to reject if we do  not.   We Democrats will insist on a rigorous but fair process. Part of that  process entails 60 votes for confirmation. Any one Democrat can require  it. Many already have. It was a bar met by each of Obama's nominations;  each received 60 votes. Most importantly, it is the right thing to do.  And I would note that a 60-vote threshold was reached by each of them  either in cloture or in the actual vote.   On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan  support is essential and should be a prerequisite. That is what a 60- vote threshold does; 60 votes produces a mainstream candidate. And the  need for a mainstream consensus candidate is greater now than ever  before because we are in major new territory in two ways.   First, because the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Roberts, has  shown increasing drift to become a more and more pro-business Court-- siding more and more with corporations, employers, and special  interests over working and average Americans--we need a mainstream  nominee to help reverse that trend, not accelerate it. I will remind my  colleagues, that is how President Trump campaigned, but his nominee  seems not to be in that direction at all--not for the average working  person but, rather, for special business interests.   Second, given that this administration--at least at its outset--seems  to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory and  is testing the very fabric of our Constitution within the first 20  days, there is a special burden on this nominee to be an independent  jurist, someone who approaches the Court without ideological blinders,  who has a history of operating outside and above politics, and who has  the strength of will to stand up to a President who has already shown a  willingness to bend the Constitution.   Requiring 60 votes has always been the right thing to do on Supreme  Court nominations, especially in these polarized times. But now in this  new era of the Court, in this new administration, there is an even  heavier weight on this tradition. And if the nominee cannot gain the 60  votes, cannot garner bipartisan support of some significance, then the  answer is not to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee  and find someone who can gain those 60 votes.   Changing the rules for something as important as the Supreme Court  gets rid of the tradition, eliminates the tradition of mainstream  nominees who have bipartisan support. It would be so, so wrong to do. I  know many of my colleagues on the other side are hesitant to do it, and  I hope they will remain strong in that regard.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, the pending nominations of the  President's Cabinet, again, we are in  [[Page S611]]  unchartered waters with this administration. They have not proposed a  normal Cabinet. This is not even close to a normal Cabinet.   I have never seen a Cabinet this full of bankers and billionaires,  folks with massive conflicts of interest and such little experience or  expertise in the areas they will oversee. Many of the nominees have  philosophies that cut against the very nature of the Department to  which they were nominated.   Let me give you two examples this morning: Betsy DeVos, the nominee  for the Department of Education, and Andrew Puzder, nominee for the  Labor Department.   First, Betsy DeVos. When you judge her in three areas--conflicts of  interest, basic competence, and ideology, views on education policy--it  is clear that Betsy DeVos is unfit for the job of Education Secretary.   In all three areas, ideology, competence, and conflicts of interest,  she rates among the lowest of any Cabinet nominee I have ever seen. At  her hearing, she didn't seem to know basic facts about Federal  education law that guarantee education to students with disabilities.  She didn't seem to know the basic facts of a long simmering debate in  education policy measuring growth proficiency. And in her ethics  agreement, which was delivered to the committee after her first  hearing, it was revealed that she would keep interests in several  companies that benefit from millions of dollars in contracts from the  Department of Education, which she would oversee.   There was a rush to push her through--one round of questions, 5  minutes each. Why? Why did someone generally as fair as the chairman of  that committee do that? My guess, an educated guess: He knew how  incompetent this nominee was, how poorly she fared under normal  questions, and the idea was to rush her through.   Well, that is not what we should be doing on something as important  as this. And if the nominee can't withstand a certain amount of  scrutiny, they shouldn't be the nominee.   The glaring concerns have led two of my Republican colleagues, the  Senators from Maine and Alaska, to pledge a vote against her  confirmation, leaving her nomination deadlocked at 50 to 50. I believe  both of them cited the fact that in their State, charter schools are  not the big issue; it is public schools. How are we going to treat  public schools? Particularly in rural areas, as I am sure my friend the  Presiding Officer knows, there is not a choice of schools outside the  major metropolitan areas, the major cities. If you don't have a good  public school, you have nothing. So particularly people from the rural  States should be worried, in my judgment, about our nominee's  commitment to public education.   For the first time ever, we have the chance that the Vice President  and a pending Cabinet nominee, the nominee for Attorney General,  Senator Sessions, are casting the deciding votes on a controversial  Cabinet position for Betsy DeVos. Mr. President, this has never  happened before.   The White House will, in effect, get two deciding votes in the Senate  on a nominee to the President's Cabinet: the Vice President and the  nominee for Attorney General, our friend Senator Sessions.   It highlights the stunning depth of concern this nominee has  engendered in Republicans and Democrats alike. It is clear now that  Senators of both parties agree she is not qualified to be Secretary of  Education. And I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle--this is such an important position; the nominee is so laddered  on issue after issue after issue that we could get someone better. I  don't think it will be that hard. It will be President Trump's nominee.  It will not be us deciding, but it will be someone who has basic  competence, fewer conflicts of interest, and, above all, a commitment  to public education.   So I urge my Republican colleagues, friends, to stand up and reject  Betsy DeVos, as the Cleveland Plain Dealer urged in an editorial this  morning.   This is not a normal nominee, once again. In my view, when I dipped  into her record and how she performed in her brief hearing, she has not  earned and should not receive the Senate's approval.   Second, the nominee for the Department of Labor, Andrew Puzder. The  hearing for his nomination has now been delayed four times because he  still hasn't submitted key paperwork laying out his disclosures and  detailing a plan for divesting, if necessary, to avoid conflicts of  interest. But that might be the least of the Senate's concerns.   This is a nominee who is being sued by dozens of former employees due  to workplace violations. This is a nominee who has repeatedly attacked  the minimum wage, opposed the overtime rule, and advocated for more  automation and fewer jobs. He talked about--I think in very positive  terms--robots and how they may run the fast food industry. This is a  nominee for Secretary of Labor who not only wants workers to earn less,  he wants fewer workers.   For several of these Cabinet positions, it seems the President has  searched for candidates whose philosophies are diametrically opposed to  the very purposes of their Departments. For Education, pick someone  with no experience in public schools and has spent her career  advocating against them. For Labor, pick someone who has spent his  career trying to keep the wages of his employees low and advocated  against policies that benefit workers.   Again, I repeat: This is not your typical Cabinet. This is highly,  highly unusual.   So when my Republican colleagues come to the floor every day to  complain about delays and holdups, I would remind them that this is  very serious. These Cabinet officials will have immense power in our  government and wield enormous influence over the lives of average  Americans: their wages and the education of their children, for  instance.   To spend a few more days on the process is well worth it. And if they  prove unfit for the austere and powerful roles they are about to take  up, then it is our responsibility, as Senators who advise and consent,  to reject their nomination.                            ____________________     One final point: I want to take a moment to mention  Ukraine.   Yesterday Rex Tillerson was sworn in as Secretary of State. In  addition to dealing with the fallout from the President's first  engagements with Australia and Mexico, I want to call the Secretary's  attention to the situation in Ukraine.   Since President Trump's call with Mr. Putin last weekend, there has  been a significant increase in violence. I hope Secretary Tillerson  will ensure that there is a strong statement from the Trump  administration condemning these escalatory actions by the Russians.   I also hope my Republican counterparts will start doing what they did  last year every time this happened: Come to the floor and demand that  the Senate act on tough sanctions against Russia. As I have said  before, Russia remains a strategic threat to our Nation, and countering  them needs to remain a deeply bipartisan effort.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
