 Mr. Speaker, just this week June's inflation  numbers hit a 40-year high at 9.1 percent, and average hourly earnings  hit a new low.   Instead of providing relief for American families and job creators,  Democrats are working on new tax increases. Amidst a potential economic  recession and rampant inflation, this tax hike will crush Main Street  America, impacting 88,000 businesses just in Texas alone.   As a small business owner for over 50 years, I can tell you that  Democrats' out-of-touch policies are making it harder to operate a  business. Inflation is making it more expensive to purchase goods and  make ends meet, and Democrats' tax hike will further cut the operating  margins, making it harder to grow and compete.   While the economy is struggling, we should be cutting taxes, not  raising taxes. We must put an end to the Democrats' tax-and-spend  agenda and focus on building a stronger Main Street. Bottom line is, we  need businesspeople in Washington.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
