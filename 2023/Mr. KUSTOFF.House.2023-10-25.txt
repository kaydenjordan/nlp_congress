 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of this  critical resolution to condemn Hamas' brutal attack on Israel and  reiterate our Nation's support, our strong support, for our greatest  ally in the Middle East--Israel.   We all know that Hamas' heinous and unprovoked attack on innocent  Israelis is barbaric. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress  to stand united with Israel.   Let me be clear: Israel has a fundamental right to defend herself and  her people during this war.   I am honored to be chairman of the bipartisan House-Knesset  Parliamentary Friendship Group. From both  [[Page H5060]]  sides of the aisle, our members' support for the only democracy in the  Middle East is absolutely ironclad.   This resolution demonstrates our unwavering commitment to Israel and  our relationship. It is important for our Nation and the rest of the  world to hear this strong support and commitment from the United  States' House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for  their leadership.
