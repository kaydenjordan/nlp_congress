 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues to  join me in addressing the need for preventive healthcare for our  military's aviators. As a 20-year Navy veteran, I am concerned by the  alarming anecdotal evidence by former Air Force and Navy pilots of  increased incidence of cancer at a young age due to cockpit exposure.   We have a duty to ensure that our servicemembers receive the best  care possible. That is why I am introducing the Military Pilot Cancer  Incidence Study Act. This bipartisan bill will help the Department of  Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs understand the causes of  cancer among our military pilots so that we can ensure that our  aviators receive the preventive cancer screenings they have earned  through their service to our country.   By analyzing the correlation between cockpit radiation exposure and  cancer, health professionals at DOD and the  [[Page H1057]]  VA can determine the appropriate age to screen pilots for cancer so  they can live longer and healthier lives.                            ____________________
