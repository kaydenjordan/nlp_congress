 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to start today by saying I am  really appalled by the extreme, cruel, shameful abortion ban that was  passed yesterday in Alabama. That legislation is nothing short of an  attack on women, and it is part of a larger effort we are seeing today  around the country to take away the constitutional right of women to  safe, legal abortion and allowing politicians to make decisions for  women about their bodies, their health, and their lives instead of  trusting doctors and women.   I want every woman reading the news this morning and wondering what  this means for you, your family, and for your granddaughters to know I  am with you, and I am going to keep fighting for you every step of the  way.
