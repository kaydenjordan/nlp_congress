 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member  Pallone, Ranking Member Green, and Subcommittee Chairman Burgess for  their leadership in uniting our colleagues across the aisle on a bill  that supports patients and the life sciences industry. This user fee  bill is a testament to what can be achieved when we debate policies in  the open and confront challenges together.   I would also like to specifically focus on one piece of the  legislation, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017. A few weeks  ago, a friend of mine wrote to me and shared her story of hearing loss.  A 34-year-old lawyer, it nearly derailed her career by leaving her  unable to argue cases in the courtroom. She continued by outlining the  often overlooked side effects brought about by hearing loss--isolation,  anxiety, depression, and memory loss--all compounded by prohibitive  costs for hearing aids that aren't covered by Medicare or most private  insurers. Faced with prices upwards of $5,000, many Americans are  denied the relief and the treatment that they deserve.   With this bipartisan bill, we will not only spark innovation and  competition, we will help our constituents in their communities,  offices, factory floors, and even their own homes. I hope my colleagues  will support this bill.   I want to thank Representative Blackburn for her tireless work in  getting it across the finish line as well.
