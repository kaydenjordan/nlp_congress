 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as everybody knows, this country faces an  extraordinary set of crises--crises that are unprecedented in the  modern history of our country.   Over the last several weeks, hundreds of thousands of Americans have  taken to the streets and courageously demanded an end to police murder  and brutality and to urge us all to rethink the nature of policing in  America. In the midst of all that, we continue, of course, to suffer  from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken the lives of over 115,000  Americans and infected over 2 million of our people.   Then, on top of that, we are experiencing the worst economic meltdown  since the Great Depression of the 1930s, with over 32 million Americans  having lost their jobs in the last 3 months. In the midst of all of  that, enough truly is enough.   The U.S. Senate must respond to the pain and the suffering of our  constituents. Let us begin work today, not next week, not next month  but right now in addressing the unprecedented crises our people are  facing. If there is anything that the torture and murder of George  Floyd by Minneapolis police has taught us, it is that we have to  fundamentally rethink the nature of policing in America and reform our  broken and racist criminal justice system.   Let us be clear--and I think everybody understands this--the murder  of George Floyd is not just an isolated incident. It is the latest in  an endless series of police killings of African Americans, including  Rayshard Brooks, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald, Tamir  Rice, Alton Sterling, Freddie Gray, Rekia Boyd, Walter Scott, and many,  many others.   The American people are rightly demanding justice and an end to  police brutality and murder. And we have to hear that cry coming from  all across this country, from large cities and small towns, and the  Senate must act and act now.   Here is some good news in the midst of a lot of bad news, and that is  thanks to a massive grassroots movement, the Senate will finally begin  to debate legislation dealing with the police. That is a good thing.  The bad news is that the Republican legislation, at least what I have  seen this morning, goes nowhere near far enough as to where we need to  go.   Now is not the time to think small or respond with superficial,  bureaucratic proposals. Now is not the time for more studies. Now is  the time to hold racist and corrupt police officers and police  departments accountable for their actions. Now is the time to implement  far-reaching reforms that would protect people and communities that  have suffered police brutality, torture, and murder for far too long.  Now is the time to act boldly to protect the First Amendment right to  protest.   Let me very briefly describe some of the areas in which I think the  Congress should move with regard to police brutality and the whole  issue of policing.   First, and maybe most importantly, every police officer in our  country must be held accountable, and those found guilty must be  punished with the full force of law. That includes officers who stand  by while brutal acts take place. Every single killing of a person by  police or while in police custody must be investigated by the  Department of Justice.   We must create a process by which police departments look like the  communities they serve and be part of those communities, not be seen as  invading, heavily armed, occupying forces. That is not what police  departments should look like. We must, therefore, prohibit the transfer  of Department of Defense military equipment to police departments.   Further, we need to abolish qualified immunity so police officers are  held civilly liable for abuses. We need to strip Federal funds from  departments that violate civil rights. We need to provide funding to  States and municipalities to create a civilian core of unarmed first  responders to supplement law enforcement.   For too long, we have asked police departments to do things which  they are not trained or prepared to do, and we have criminalized  societal problems like addiction and homelessness and mental illness,  severe problems that exist in every State in the country. But these are  not problems that will be solved by incarceration. We are not going to  solve the crisis of addiction or homelessness or mental illness by  incarceration. We have done that for too long, and it is a failed  approach.   We need to make records of police misconduct publicly available so  that an officer with a record of misconduct cannot simply move two  towns over and start again. We need to require all jurisdictions that  receive Federal grant funding to establish independent police conduct  review boards that are broadly representative of the community and that  have the authority to refer deaths that occur at the hands of police or  in police custody to Federal authorities for investigation. We need to  amend Federal civil rights laws to allow more effective prosecution of  police misconduct by changing the standard from willfulness to  recklessness. We need to ban the use of facial recognition technology  by the police.   Finally, and certainly not least importantly, we need to legalize  marijuana. In the midst of the many crises we face as a country, it is  absurd that, under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is  at schedule 1, along with killer drugs like heroin. State after State  have moved to legalize marijuana, and it is time for the Federal  Government to do the same. When we talk about police department reform,  we must end police officers continuing to arrest, search, or jail the  people of our country, predominantly people of color, for using  marijuana.   We need to ban the use of rubber bullets, pepper spray, and tear gas  on protesters. The right to protest, the right to demonstrate is a  fundamental, constitutional right and a right that must be respected.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Glenn A. Dockham of Milton, VT.   Glenn lived a life of service. He was a Peace Corps volunteer, a U.S.  Customs officer, and the president of the National Treasury Employees  Union--NTEU--Chapter 142. It was in his capacity as a labor leader that  my staff and I had the pleasure of working with Glenn and came to  greatly respect his perspective. I am proud to have called on his  perspective on a number of occasions to discuss important labor issues.  During one occasion, when I organized a panel to discuss labor concerns  at the Department of Homeland Security, Glenn provided valuable  insights as the voice at the table representing NTEU members. At this  time, the Department of Homeland Security was still a relatively new  agency, and Glenn helped us to fight for the needs of his members.  [[Page S3062]]    I have always considered Glenn a fair and trusted voice in the labor  movement and a tireless advocate for Federal employees. I was grateful  for his leadership and the commitment that he demonstrated throughout  his career. He set an excellent example in his professional life.   In addition to his work, family was very important to Glenn. He  leaves behind his wife, Lisa, and his two children, Marcy and Tim. He  considered his greatest accomplishment to be raising his children. I  have no doubt he set an equally powerful example of hard work,  kindness, and service for them and others in his life.   Please join me in honoring the life and legacy of Glenn  Dockham.                            ____________________
