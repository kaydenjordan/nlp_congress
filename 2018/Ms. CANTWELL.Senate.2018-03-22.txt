 Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about H.R.  4851, legislation that just recently passed the Senate in the last hour  or so. Hopefully it is on its way to final reconciliation with the  House and hopefully will become law later today.   Before I talk about that, I want to take a second to recognize some  provisions that are in the omnibus that we also are going to be voting  on in the next few hours, two provisions that are very important to the  Pacific Northwest--one, finally a fix on fire borrowing, which is so  important to the entire Northwest but particularly in the State of  Washington, which has seen the great impact of forest fires in the last  several years. This will end the fire borrowing that we have seen that  has prevented us from doing the kind of fuel reduction that we would  like to see to protect our communities, and it will help us better  manage with stewardship contracts and release the funds that should be  going to recreation management within our forests.   This fire funding fix has been long in the making. I thank my  colleagues, Senators Wyden, Risch, and Crapo, for their hard work, and  I thank Bryan Petit from my office, who has worked tirelessly on this  as well. We are starting a new day in how we treat our forests and  hopefully one that will reduce the risks to many communities.   I thank our colleagues for working so diligently on including a  provision on  [[Page S1904]]  affordable housing. This is the first affordable housing increase in a  decade. I want to thank specifically Senator Schumer and Senator  McConnell and Senator Hatch, my cosponsor on this legislation, for  helping us get this done. This is not everything we would like to see  in affordable housing, but certainly it is starting to point in the  right direction.   I also thank Anna Taylor, Artie Mandel, Lara Muldoon, and Jay Khosla  for working so diligently on trying to make the housing crisis  something that we have to deal with here in the U.S. Senate. For us in  the Pacific Northwest, the homelessness crisis, our returning veterans,  our aging population, and workforce housing have become the No. 1  issue. For Seattle and the whole Northwest, starting to put more  resources on the table to build affordable housing is the right  direction, and we need it desperately now, and this legislation will  help us.                Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site Bill    Now, Mr. President, I come with my colleague Senator Young--and I  know Senator Donnelly wishes he could join us--to talk about the  legislation that Representative Andre Carson has sent to the Senate and  we just recently passed back to the House. This bill designates the  Landmark for Peace Memorial, which is located in the Martin Luther King  Jr. Park in Indianapolis, and it designates it as the Kennedy-King  National Commemorative Site.   This legislation provides that this commemorative site shall be part  of the African American Civil Rights Network that Congress established  last December, and it will be only the second commemorative site in our  beloved National Park System. The other designation went to Charleston,  AR, the location of the first public school in the South to be fully  integrated.   This national commemorative site, which will remain as part of a city  park, is not going to be part of the National Park System, although I  am happy to discuss that with my colleagues moving forward. The  National Park Service is authorized to enter into cooperative  agreements to help provide for education and interpretation of this  site.   The Young-Donnelly amendment removes language in the bill authorizing  the Park Service to conduct a special resource study and assess its  potential for inclusion in the National Park System. I know my  colleague Senator Young is here on the floor, and I thank him for his  leadership. I hope that some day he and I can continue, with Senator  Donnelly, to expand on this and revisit this issue. The original  legislation passed unanimously out of the House of Representatives, and  I know Senator Young worked hard to clear the one objection, but I  don't think that one objection should delay us from furthering our  interest in this issue.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the full text of Robert F. Kennedy's speech in Indianapolis on April 4,  1968, the 50th anniversary coming up next week.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     FULL TEXT OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY'S SPEECH: INDIANAPOLIS, APRIL 4, 1968         Ladies and Gentlemen,        I'm only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this       evening, because I have some very sad news for all of you       Could you lower those signs, please? I have some very sad       news for all of you, and, I think, sad news for all of our       fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the       world; and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was       killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.        Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to       justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of       that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time       for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of       a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.        For those of you who are black considering the evidence       evidently is that there were white people who were       responsible you can be filled with bitterness, and with       hatred, and a desire for revenge.        We can move in that direction as a country, in greater       polarization black people amongst blacks, and white amongst       whites, filled with hatred toward one another.        Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to       understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence,       that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with       an effort to understand, compassion, and love.        For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with       hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against       all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my       own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my       family killed, but he was killed by a white man.        But we have to make an effort in the United States. We have       to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond       these rather difficult times.        My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote:       Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget      falls drop by drop upon the heart,      until, in our own despair,      against our will,      comes wisdom      through the awful grace of God.         What we need in the United States is not division;        what we need in the United States is not hatred;        what we need in the United States is not violence and       lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward       one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still       suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether       they be black.        So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for       the family of Martin Luther King yeah, it's true but more       importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of       us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of       which I spoke.        We can do well in this country. We will have difficult       times. We've had difficult times in the past, but we and we       will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of       violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the       end of disorder.        But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority       of black people in this country want to live together, want       to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all       human beings that abide in our land.        And let's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so       many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle       the life of this world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that,       and say a prayer for our country and for our people.        Thank you very much.     Mr. President, some days we need a reminder of what  perspective in the face of crisis really accomplishes. We know that 50  years after this historic speech, we have an understanding about how  incredibly magnificent this moment was, so I am so glad to join my  colleague in commemorating it. It was about holding the consciousness  of a society and how to respond to an unbelievable, tragic, violent  event and to hold the consciousness of a society with words--just  words. And that is the point--that words matter; that words matter to a  society. They are what holds us together. They are what creates unity.  They are what creates perspective. In this case, they also created  history.   Senator Kennedy spoke to a crowd in Indianapolis and announced the  death of Martin Luther King--an unbelievable responsibility. If you  watch now in videos of the speech, you will hear the gasps of the  audience, who was unaware that that event, in that moment, had taken  place. Yet he spoke to the crowd about why violence and retribution  should not be pursued. He created calm among chaos. He created a moment  where everybody realized that they were commemorating the life of Dr.  Martin Luther King, that his life had been about a nonviolent response  to tragedy and to the challenges we face.   When we commemorate this moment with this designation, we are  commemorating a moment, in my opinion, of the human spirit. We are  commemorating a moment--the incredible pain Robert Kennedy must have  felt, knowing that Martin Luther King had just been assassinated. Yet  he spoke to the crowd about keeping the peace and remembering the  lessons of Dr. King.   We will never know what kind of Presidency RFK might have given our  Nation, but we know this from his speech: We know what kind of man he  was, and we know what kind of human spirit and soul can communicate, in  that moment of tragedy, the direction of a nation.   It is so important at this moment in our history that we reflect on  this 50th anniversary. At a time when it is better to use words to  speak calmly and competently in the face of tragedy, I hope that here  in Washington, we will remember one of the greatest political speeches  of all time.   I yield the floor.
