 Madam Speaker, today the House convened the  first public hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January  6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol and the very essence of American  democracy.   In shocking, raw, and real testimony, four brave police officers  shared stories of their harrowing experiences that day.   United States Capitol Police Sergeant Gonell, an 8-year veteran of  the United States Army assigned to some of the most dangerous duties  during Operation Iraqi Freedom, said he was more afraid to work at the  Capitol on that day than he was in his entire time serving his country  in Iraq.   The video is hard to watch, and the testimony is emotional, but the  committee's work promises truth and transparency. The events of January  6 would have yielded more death and destruction were it not for the  United States Capitol Police.   We are grateful for them and to the committee for working to provide  the answers and accountability needed to make sure this event never  happens again.                            ____________________
