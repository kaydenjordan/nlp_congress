 Mr. Speaker, today, for my Maui minute, I rise to  recognize and extend a heartfelt mahalo to the brave first responders  and disaster workers who rushed in to evacuate and support our people  and communities since the devastating wildfires on Maui.   From police and firefighters to paramedics and 911 operators, these  heroes play an essential role every day across our country, providing  physical and emotional support to those who have been hit hard by  disasters.   While they never cease in their important work in times of crisis,  first responders often face their own barriers with seeking help and  accessing the mental health services they need as they deal with their  own trauma as a result of what they see and experience.   On Maui, many first responders and disaster workers were also victims  and survivors themselves, losing loved ones and homes. Despite this, as  the fires raged, they continued to serve and protect.   That is why, this week, I have introduced the Crisis Assistance and  Resources in Emergencies for First Responders Act, or CARE for First  Responders Act, to increase access to mental health care services  specific to the unique needs and experiences of those on the front  lines of disaster.   These brave men and women have answered the call each time we have  needed them most. Now, it is our turn to do the same.                            ____________________
