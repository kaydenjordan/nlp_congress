 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the JOBS and  Investor Confidence Act of 2018. This is a true bipartisan compromise,  and I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for their  leadership and willingness to work across the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, every day I hear from Arizonans who are sick and tired  of the dysfunction in Washington. Arizonans want Congress focused on  job creation and national security, which is why this package includes  three bills I helped introduce that create good-paying jobs and fight  drug cartels that threaten the safety of our border communities.   First, I introduced the Fostering Innovation Act to deliver  regulatory relief to cutting-edge biotech companies like HTG Molecular  Diagnostics in Tucson that are hiring Arizonans into good-paying jobs.  Our bill cuts red tape to ensure HTG and other innovative biotech  companies can expand their high-wage workforces and develop lifesaving  medical breakthroughs.   I am also a cosponsor of the HALOS Act to help turn good Arizona  ideas into successful Arizona startups. ASU's SkySong Innovation Center  is a startup incubator that helps these ideas and visions turn into  companies and careers, and the HALOS Act cuts red tape to help Arizona  startups access the capital they need to thrive. That means more good- paying jobs all over our State.   To protect Arizonans from violent drug cartels, I am an original  cosponsor of the National Strategy to Combat the Financing of  Transnational Criminal Organizations Act. This bill requires the  administration to take a tough but smart step to combat drug and human  trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering, and other issues that these  criminals bring to our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with anyone willing to get  things done and deliver for Arizona.
