 Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address  the Senate on an issue of real importance to our country and to  families in Colorado and all across the United States.   Today, 120 economists wrote an open letter--in the face of the  inflation that we are now facing as a nation, as a result of the  economic growth that we are having coming out of this very deep  recession, and the supply chain interruptions that have caused  inflation, 120 economists sent an open letter saying:         The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the easiest, most       effective, and direct tools currently at our disposal to help       families deal with the impact of inflation on family budgets.        The exert opinions about the causes of and solutions to       rising inflation are as varied as the authors of this letter,       but we agree on this: the expanded Child Tax Credit is too       small to meaningfully increase inflation across the whole       economy.    That means that that $100 billion a year that the child tax credit  costs to lift half the kids out of poverty isn't going to drive  inflation in a $21 trillion economy. That is one of the points these  economists agreed on.   ``[B]ut,'' they wrote, ``it will make an important difference for  family budgets, especially families in the bottom half of the income  spectrum. Monthly Child Tax Credit payments are a proven success at  helping families keep up with the everyday costs of keeping a family  afloat.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the open letter signed by 120 economists.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Open Letter From Economists: Extend the Expanded Child Tax Credit To                  Help Families Keep Up With Rising Costs         The cost of everything from food and fuel to housing and       clothes is going up at the fastest pace in decades. Families       need relief. The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the       easiest, most effective, and direct tools currently at our       disposal to help families deal with the impact of inflation       on family budgets. A recent analysis by Moody's found that       inflation is costing the average family $296 per month, with       lower-income families being hit even harder. Each $250 to       $300 monthly child tax credit payment can offset the toll       inflation is taking.        The expert opinions about the causes of and solutions to       rising inflation are as varied as the authors of this letter,       but we agree on this: the expanded Child Tax Credit is too       small to meaningfully increase inflation across the whole       economy, but it will make an important difference for family       budgets, especially families in the bottom half of the income       spectrum. Monthly Child Tax Credit payments are a proven       success at helping families keep up with the everyday costs       of keeping a family afloat. With inflation causing those very       costs to rise, the Child Tax Credit is even more important       now to help families meet their basic needs.

Mr. President, this is no surprise to me. I was for the  child tax credit before we had COVID because for the last 50 years, as  I have said before on this floor, we had an economy that has worked  really well for the top 10 percent of Americans and basically hasn't  worked for anybody else.   We have some of the lowest economic mobility in the industrialized  world. We have got some of the greatest income inequality in the  industrialized world.  [[Page S1966]]    Stunningly--stunningly--in the last two economic downturns, economic  inequality has only gotten staggeringly worse in this country because  of the massive asset inflation that has benefited the wealthiest people  in the economy who are in the position to make money on their money or,  in the case of a lot of people, on real estate. In Colorado, it is  making it harder and harder and harder for working people to find a  place to live.   And I can tell you that our kids pay the highest price from this.   I was the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools before I was in  this job. A majority of kids were kids of color; a majority of kids  were kids living in poverty. And their families were working--contrary  to what some people around here think, their families were working two  and three jobs. The problem wasn't that their families weren't working.  It wasn't that they weren't working hard. They were killing themselves,  and no matter what they did, they couldn't get their kids out of  poverty, and that is not a consequence of anything that is their fault.  They are doing everything they can. For that matter, their kids are  doing everything they can--going to schools that ought to do a better  job for the kids living in poverty all over this country.   And some people think that we have to just accept this as a  fundamental aspect of our economy or our democracy or our society; that  somehow the United States of America is such a failure as a community  that we have to accept being 38 out of 41 industrialized countries in  terms of childhood poverty; that we are willing to permanently accept  the idea that the poorest people in our society are our children.   I think there is something we can do about it. I know there is  something we can do about it. I know there is a lot of skepticism about  the Federal Government's ability to do anything well. I share that  skepticism sometimes.   We fought two wars in the Middle East that lasted for 20 years, that  cost about $5.6 trillion--seems like a set of bad decisions.   We have cut taxes on the floor of this body by $8 trillion since  2001. Almost all of the benefit of that has gone to the wealthiest  people in the country, when we have got the worst income inequality  that we have had since 1928.   It has been staggering to watch--it has been staggering to watch  people stay here at the end of a legislative year, at the end of a  Congress, and burn the midnight oil to make sure that we can extend the  tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country and for the largest  corporations in America.   That is how you know it is 2 o'clock in the morning in the U.S.  Senate. It is when we have to extend tax cuts for the richest people in  this country during a time of devastating income inequality that is  perpetuated by the economic cycles that we continue to have.   But last year, Mr. President, as you know, because you were a big  part of this, we did something different. We adopted the expanded child  tax credit; we adopted the expanded earned income tax credit. Those  bills were Bennet-Brown and Brown-Bennet, respectively--my friend  Sherrod Brown from the great State of Ohio.   And here on this, ahead of tax day, I wanted to come down to the  floor just to give you a little report, kind of a book report, a status  report on what has happened.   And what I want to tell you is it worked. It worked. It worked. We  discovered we didn't have to live in a society that was 38 out of 41  industrialized countries. We discovered that we didn't have to accept  the world where the poorest people in our country were our children.   We benefited 61 million kids in the United States--90 percent of the  children in Connecticut, 90 percent of the children in Colorado, and 90  percent of the children all across this country directly benefited from  a bill we passed here.   We cut childhood poverty nearly in half. We cut hunger by a quarter  for families with kids during a pandemic, which feels like a worthy  thing to have done. We did it without adding a single bureaucrat to the  Federal Government. We did it without adding one more Federal Agency.  We proved we could do it.   And then we didn't extend it at the end of the year. And now,  predictably, childhood poverty is shooting up in the United States of  America. Hunger is shooting up in the United States of America.   I was on the phone with the leaders of the food banks across Colorado  who have done such an incredible job during this recession and during  the last recession making sure people are fed. I have visited some of  those food banks. I know that people are saying to me that there are,  you know, two-thirds of the people who are showing up were people who  didn't show up before we had this catastrophe of COVID.    But guess what is getting longer now, as a result of our failure to  extend the child tax credit. It is the lines in these food banks. It is  the people coming to get food for their kids instead of being able to  go to the grocery store with the dignity of the expanded child tax  credit.   There is a shred of good news here that I wanted to just speak about  for a second because this will be my chance to do it, and I just want  to remind people that as families file their tax returns, they will  receive the second half of their child tax credit, which is worth up to  $1,800 per child. That is still available. It is not coming in a  monthly form anymore. It is not coming into your bank account anymore  in that automatic way, but when you file your tax returns, you will  receive it.   And the other thing, because of the EITC work that we did--the earned  income tax credit work--workers without children will receive the  expanded EITC, which we tripled last year--we tripled last year.   We finally decided we are not going to tax people into poverty  anymore in this country, which is what we were doing before we expanded  that.   So I wanted to remind families to claim their child and dependent  care tax credit as well.   We expanded that last year to a maximum of $4,000 per child, and in  my view we have to continue to come down here and fight to make these  credits permanent. And it is my goal for us to end childhood poverty in  this country.   I think cutting it in half--that was an exciting thing. It has been a  long time around here--decades, generations--generations since we have  seen a reduction in poverty in this country like the reduction in  childhood poverty we saw last year, generations since we have seen a  reduction in hunger like we saw last year.   And the good news is, we now know that it is a fact that we can do  it. There are a lot of countries in the world that have an expanded  child tax credit or child benefit like the child tax credit, and in all  those countries, fewer of their kids live in poverty.   And their workforce participation rates are actually higher, which  doesn't surprise me at all, based on the stories I heard from families  about what they were spending the child tax credit on, which was  everything that had to do with their kids, from buying back-to-school  clothes to paying for a bicycle so a young man in Colorado Springs  could stay at school late so he could have extracurriculars that he  otherwise wouldn't have had the ability to achieve, so that his mom  could stay at work for a few more hours so she could provide for the  family.   There is literally no data in America or anywhere else that doesn't  support the idea that this is a pro-work policy, the child tax credit.   We didn't have any trouble, as I said earlier, extending the $8  trillion of tax cuts that we have cut for the wealthiest people in this  country since 2001.   For that money, we could have extended the child tax credit for 50  years. We could have doubled it for 25 years, and we could have ended  childhood poverty in the United States of America. I guarantee you that  would have been a better investment than sending money to people who  need it least in our economy.   I would say to my own party that I am really grateful that we passed  this last year, but I am deeply, deeply disappointed that we couldn't  come together and extend it.   I am deeply, deeply disappointed that we haven't fulfilled our  promise to reverse the Trump tax cuts for the richest people in  America. It doesn't make any sense. It is completely upside down, but  that is where we find ourselves.   I wish I could express how different it felt at the end of the year  when it was  [[Page S1967]]  kids, many of whom were living in poverty and their families who were  getting, on average, $450 a month--when the lights were going out on  them, and we just went home. We just went home. There was nobody  burning the midnight oil here to make sure that the kids got the  benefit of this.   And, by the way, even if you don't believe that living in a society  where the poorest people are your kids and that it ought to be a  purpose of a nation to lift kids who, through no fault of their own,  find themselves in poverty; who, through no fault of their own, find  themselves living in a country where we have less economic mobility  than almost any other industrialized country in the world and therefore  don't have the opportunity to rise that generations had before them-- and, hopefully, generations that will come after them--and that are  attending a system of education in this country because of the lack of  early childhood education in the United States, because of the lack of  quality K-12 education in this country, because of the incredible  expense of higher education--who are attending a system that is  actually reinforcing the income equality we have rather than liberating  people from their circumstances.   (Mr. MARKEY assumed the Chair.) The best predictor of the quality of  your education in this country is your parents' income, to the point of  ruthlessness--to the point of ruthlessness.   I want to mention that Senator Romney, who is a Republican from Utah,  has a very similar bill to my bill to expand the child tax credit. In  fact, it is basically the same bill. He is a little more generous with  kids under the age of 6, and we have a difference of view on pay-fors,  but I think that is a bridgeable difference. And I have no doubt that  in the long term, we will come to a bipartisan agreement in this  Chamber to make the enhanced child tax credit permanent; to decide that  even if you don't care about the kids, which you should, that the  country can't afford this level of childhood poverty, that our  democracy won't be sustained with this level of income inequality. That  is what I believe. That is what I know.   Childhood poverty costs the United States of America $1 trillion  dollars a year. That is why it is not surprising that Columbia  University did a study and found that we get an 8x return--that the  child tax credit would pay back the United States eight times what it  costs. Again, what it costs is $100 billion a year, but childhood  poverty costs us $1 trillion a year.   Instead of accepting the idea that we are going to be at the bottom  of the cellar when it comes to kids living in poverty, what we said  was: No, we are going to cut it in half.   And let me assure you, as a former school superintendent and--well,  as a former school superintendent--the cost of mitigating for childhood  poverty far exceeds the cost diminishing it.   It is an amazing thing to me, on top of everything else that we are  talking about today, that when families are in the grip of the kind of  inflation that they are in the grip of--which costs them somewhere  between $270 to $300 a month, depending on where they live and  depending on who they are--that it wouldn't occur to us that the  easiest thing to do would be just to reinstate what we were doing last  year and allow people to have the benefit of $450 on average to raise  their children, to pay for a little bit of extra childcare, to pay for  a little bit of transportation to fix a car that is broken so they can  stay on the job.   I know there are some colleagues here who think that this policy  disincentivizes work. Even before we passed this last year, every study  that looked at this that I was aware of, with the exception of one  outlier that I think had terrible data--every single one--said that  this was not going to negatively affect work.   And guess what. Now we have had a 6-month experiment in the United  States of America, and every study, including the one by the American  Enterprise Institute, which was a doubter about this policy--and I  think probably still is a doubter about this policy--found that it had  no effect on people's work habits.   The problem in America is not that people don't work hard. That is  not the problem that we have in this country. People are killing  themselves. And it is true that wages are up by about 5.6 percent since  the Biden administration went into office, which is great, awesome. It  is great, but we have had the effects of inflation, and we are a long  way from having an economy that, when it grows, it grows for everybody,  which, by the way, that is what we need to do. That is what we have to  achieve.   This democracy will not survive another 50 years of an economy that,  when it grows, it grows for the top 10 percent, and everyone else's  wages are flat or everyone else is effectively in a recession. There is  no evidence in world history that with that level of income inequality,  that lack of economic mobility, that, over 100 years, you can sustain a  democracy.   And we don't have to do that. We don't have to do that. We can make  it permanent, put it back in place--pay for it, by the way. I believe  we should pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthiest people in the  country, like we said we were going to do by reversing the Trump tax  cuts--the Trump giveaways which were sold as the middle-class tax cut.  They were so smart because they gave people in the lower levels of the  income ladder a little bit, to say: There is your Trump tax cut--so he  could go out to the Mahoning Valley, go out to Youngstown, and tell  people: You got your tax cut. You are welcome.   What he didn't tell them was that 52 percent of the Trump tax cuts  went to the top 5 percent of Americans; that after he left the people  of the Mahoning Valley and Youngstown, an old steel town, and then he  went on to Mar-a-Lago, where people were having a New Year's Eve  dinner, or whatever it was they were having, and the first thing he  said to them was: You are welcome. That was a lot closer to the truth.   You are welcome. You are welcome that I cut your taxes at a time when  income inequality is greater than at any time since 1929. You are  welcome that I cut the corporate rate to 21 percent, even though no one  in corporate America was asking for a 21-percent tax cut. ``You are  welcome'' is what he said.   I said earlier, Mr. President, before you were here, that there are  people in the country that are skeptical of the Federal Government  doing anything well and that I have my own skepticism for the reasons I  said earlier. But there are people in terms of the child tax credit  that said it would never work. You know, 6 months before we did it or 4  months before we did it, I was getting stopped by reporters everyday  asking: Do you think they are really going to be able to do this? Can  the IRS, can the Department of Treasury--can they really administer  this?   And the answer is yes, they did. They did a fantastic job. They  didn't get everybody at first. They didn't get everybody at first, and  we knew that would be a problem. We enlisted people all over the State  of Colorado who worked with folks, who worked with working families and  worked with families who are living in poverty, because, remember, this  wasn't just about kids living in poverty.    Ninety percent--90 percent--of America's children benefited from  this. That is why some people have called it Social Security for kids.  Some people have called it universal basic income for kids. I think it  is a good thing because I can tell you that 90 percent of the kids in  Colorado can use the help; because 90 percent of the people in this  country and in my State have not benefited from economic growth the  same way the top 10 percent of Americans have for the last 50 years.   And, as I mentioned--I just want to say again on this floor because  there were people out there saying, ``People are going to drop out of  the workforce,''--it did not happen. It didn't happen in other  countries that have a tax benefit like this, and it didn't happen  during the 6 months that we were here.   I understand that, maybe, we would have a different debate. People  would say: Oh, my God, Michael, all these people dropped out of the  workforce. It didn't work the way you said that it would.   It did work the way I said it would. It did work the way that data  said that it would, and moms and dads--very unsurprisingly to me--who  were working hard to begin with, probably just  [[Page S1968]]  worked harder because now they had the chance to pay for a little extra  childcare. Now they had the chance to fix a car or, as I said, let  their kid go to extracurricular activities so they could stay at work.  And that is what all the studies have shown.   So I suppose one good thing has come out of this, which is--or maybe  it is more than one good thing--it is that we now know that America is  no different than any other place in this respect: that when parents  get a marginal, incremental amount of money, they don't quit their  jobs; they feed their kids. But as a society, we are able to say that  we cut childhood poverty in half and we cut hunger in half--by 25  percent.   What good is it that now there are families that are lined up in soup  kitchens, today, who weren't there 6 months ago because they had the  benefit of the child tax credit?   As I said, parents spent this credit on all kinds of different  things. I mentioned childcare. I mentioned the bicycle for  extracurricular, but, I will tell you, the thing that I heard from  every single parent that I talked to--and there were a lot of them in  Colorado over the last 6 months, over the last 6 months of last year-- was the stress that it had relieved for their family--that grinding  stress of being in a recession, the grinding stress of being in the  middle of a pandemic, the grinding stress of having your kids out of  school or having interrupted schooling, the grinding stress of living  in an economy where people are saying to you, no matter how hard you  work, that somehow it is your fault that you can't give your family  that; and that the decisions that we have made over many years in this  Chamber and in the Chamber across there, and that some of the largest  institutions have made as well, unfortunately, have created real  headwinds for working people and for their families.   We are in the middle here of considering the China COMPETES bill,  which I think gives us a real opportunity to reassess what we have been  doing for the last 40 or 50 years.   Every single thing we set and we told the American people we were  doing in their name with respect to China and its presence in the World  Trade Organization and what China would do as a result of that--none of  that turned out to be true. And when I say ``China,'' I don't mean the  Chinese people. I mean Beijing. And we realize now that they weren't  going to follow the rules of the road. We realize now that they were  engaged in state-sponsored capitalism, and that is very hard to compete  with; and that instead of just privileging the people in our society  who want to make stuff as cheaply as possible in China, maybe we ought  to be thinking about other things, like our supply chain--protecting  our supply chain--or our national security or whether we are creating  good-paying jobs in the United States so that when the economy grows,  it grows for everybody.   We have an opportunity to do that now, and that is what I want. That  is what I really want: It is an economy that, when it grows, it grows  for everybody, because that is the American dream, that is the story we  told ourselves about who we are as a people, and that is the way to  strengthen our democracy. That is what I really want.   In the meantime, what I would like us to do, since we now know how to  do it, finally, is lift half the kids in this country out of poverty so  they have a chance to pursue the American dream themselves. I used to  say that this Chamber treated America's children like they were someone  else's children because of the education system that we have provided  for them. And when we did the child tax credit, I came out here and I  said: I can finally come to this floor and say: We are now treating  America's children like they are America's children.   But, for the moment, that is no longer true, and, for the moment, we  are treating them like they are someone else's children, and we will  rue the day that we did this. We will rue the day that we did this.   This is a pro-work policy. It is a pro-family policy. It is a pro- democracy policy. We now know it worked, and it worked well. We have  got to fight to make it permanent, and that is what I will do.   I yield the floor.
