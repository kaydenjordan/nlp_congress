 Mr. Speaker, this week we plan on voting on a very  strong bill known as the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act.   To better assess our immigration system and the security of our  border, I went to the United States-Mexico border near El Paso, Texas,  this weekend. I rise today to share some of the stories I heard from  our Customs and Border Patrol officers and the compassion they had for  these families and children they interact with.   These agents and officers had the highest on-the-job injury rate  among all law enforcement groups across the country. Additionally,  these officers see some of the worst conditions and are exposed to  wide-ranging health risks like scabies, lice, tuberculosis, chicken  pox, and many others.   Day to day, these officers are on the front lines protecting our  Nation's borders. They are often stopping drug trafficking, human  trafficking, and much more. They see the worst of the worst, and put  their lives on the line to secure our Nation every day. In exchange for  this, they are often portrayed on the national media as cruel and are  compared to unthinkable, unimaginable groups from our world's history.    This is not the experience I had with them this weekend. These  officers have huge hearts, and they are often given a tough task at the  border. They told me story after story of how they bring personal items  like teddy bears and toys from their homes to provide to children, and  oftentimes run to McDonald's and other restaurants to get food for  hungry kids who had a very long, dangerous journey.   No one is denying that the situation on our Nation's border is  terrible, and our agents at the border see this tragedy daily. Seeing  this for myself firsthand, I quickly realized, there is no perfect fix.  But it is imperative that we recognize and honor our Border Patrol  agents' hard work, and do our part in Congress to pass compassionate,  comprehensive immigration reform that still secures our borders and  helps alleviate the situation of crisis which now exists.                            ____________________
