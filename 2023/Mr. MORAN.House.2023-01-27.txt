 Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National School Choice Week,  I rise to support educational freedom and efforts to empower our  Nation's parents to make the educational decisions best for their  families.   Over the last 2 years, we have seen our school systems and classrooms  weaponized, pushing political agendas on our Nation's children.   These agendas have undermined the core purpose of our school systems:  educating our children and preparing them for a successful future.  These biased agendas are nothing more than liberal propaganda forced on  our children, and they simply do not belong in the classroom.   As the proud parent of four school-age children, I understand how  critical it is for parents to direct the education of their children,  whether through the public school system, private schools, charter  schools, homeschools, or otherwise. Each is a vital part of our  educational system.   As one of the newest members of the Committee on Education and  Workforce, I look forward to restoring the rights of parents to direct  their child's education, not the Federal Government acting in loco  parentis.                            ____________________
