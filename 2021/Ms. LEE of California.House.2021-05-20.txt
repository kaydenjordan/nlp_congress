 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of the Emergency Security Supplemental to Respond to January 6th  Appropriations Act.   I'd like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro,  Subcommittee Chair Tim Ryan and the other Subcommittee chairs for their  extraordinary leadership in crafting this emergency package to respond  to the urgent need for a safer and more secure Capitol.   I was here on the House Floor during the violent insurrection on  January 6th. In carrying out our tradition of the peaceful transfer of  power, a mob tried to violently overthrow our government because of  Donald Trump's false narrative of election fraud. On the global stage,  we are a nation that condemns violent attempts to negate the outcomes  of free and fair elections and yet in our Nation's capital we saw an  armed standoff at the door of the House Chamber and tear gas deployed  in the rotunda.   This bill would address the direct costs incurred by agencies in the  riotous attack. It funds security improvements to the Capitol and  specialized training for Capitol police. Lastly, it also provides  funding for the continued prosecution of the perpetrators.   As we have seen, the lie that incited the riot has not gone away. The  white supremacist ideology that fuels these lies and conspiracy  theories persists. Looking towards the future, it is important that we  pass this bill to improve the protection of the Capitol for those who  visit and work here daily.   I urge the passage of the Emergency Security Supplemental to Respond  to the January 6th Appropriations Act.
