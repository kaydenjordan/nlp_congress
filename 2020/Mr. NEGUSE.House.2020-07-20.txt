 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment,  which would amend H.R. 6395.    Mr. Speaker, as I referenced, I stand today in support of  this amendment offered by myself and the distinguished chair of the  House Natural Resources Committee, Chairman Grijalva, which would amend  H.R. 6395 to add the text of two bills that have already passed this  Chamber with bipartisan support, H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor  Recreation and Economy Act, or CORE Act, and H.R. 1373, the Grand  Canyon Centennial Protection Act.   Both of these bills are imperative, and this amendment would protect  public lands and preserve our access to clean air and water across the  State of Colorado and Arizona.   My bill in particular, the CORE Act, would protect over 400,000 acres  of public land, including establishing the first-ever national historic  landscape at Camp Hale. This unprecedented designation speaks to the  storied legacy of the Army's 10th Mountain Division in Colorado and  around the world.   It was in the mountains of Colorado in my district that American  soldiers received the training that allowed them to defeat Germans in  the northern Italian Alps, leading our Nation to victory during World  War II.   Today, Camp Hale is home to a network of 34 backcountry huts  connected by 350 miles of trails. Hut visitors share the special spirit  of the 10th Mountain Division in their pursuit of excellence, self- reliance, and love of the outdoors.   A National Historic Landscape designation ensures that future  generations will be able to learn about the history of the 10th  Mountain Division, appreciate these sacrifices of our servicemembers,  and enjoy outdoor recreation opportunities.   I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring those sacrifices by  supporting this amendment today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva).    Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, while I disagree with my colleague, Mr.  Tipton, on this particular issue, I do appreciate his friendship and  his service to the House for many years.   I would just offer three closing arguments.   First, for those who argue that these public land measures should not  be attached to the NDAA, there is certainly precedent for these type of  provisions to be included in the NDAA. In fact, the Hermosa Creek  Watershed Protection Act by my colleague from Colorado, my good friend,  was signed into law as a provision of the 2015 NDAA in the 113th  Congress under a Republican-controlled House. So there is ample  precedent.   With respect to the HAATS issue, I would simply note that, in  December of last year, the Department of Defense sent a letter to my  Senate companion sponsor, Senator Michael Bennet, informing him that  the Department had determined that:         The land management designation in H.R. 823, the CORE Act,       should not affect current or future military overflight in       Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, these bills have nothing to do with China or Kazakhstan  and everything to do with protecting crown jewels here in the United  States of America, the Grand Canyon and hundreds of thousands of acres  of wilderness in my home State of Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these important public  land designations and support the amendment being considered by the  House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
