 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Pierce County High School Lady Bears golf team for winning the State  Class AA championship on May 22, 2023.   This remarkable achievement makes the Lady Bears back-to-back State  champions after winning a Class AAA championship last year.   This year's championship was held on the team's home course, the  Okefenokee Country Club Golf Course.   Sophomore Mackenzie Connell was the first Lady Bear to come in with  the remarkable score of 1 over 73, followed by senior Maggie Sapp,  junior Lily Spivey, and sophomore Addyson Walker.   In Class AA, the two lowest scores count for the team, which gave the  Lady Bears an impressive 30-stroke lead over the second-place team.   Mackenzie Connell finished in first place for the Class AA  tournament, with all four members finishing in the top 10.   Again, I congratulate the Pierce County Lady Bears golf team on their  championship, and I wish them well in their future endeavors on and off  the golf course.                                time  1100                             Honoring Dana Wright     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Dana Wright. Mrs. Wright was an educator and impacted many children's  lives in Georgia's First District. She concluded her distinguished 33  years of teaching while serving as principal of Ebenezer Elementary  School.   She was born and raised in Statesboro, going on to be a Georgia  Southern alumni and a charter member of Alpha Omicron Pi. She was also  a valued member of the Delta Kappa Gamma professional educators  society.   When she wasn't teaching, she was cheering on the Eagles at football  or basketball games or spending time with the Statesboro crew, her  lifelong friends, Leah, Pam, and Amy.   Mrs. Wright was dedicated to improving her community through her  passion for education, and her impact will be felt for many years to  come.  [[Page H3488]]    My sincere condolences go out to the Wright family during this time  of mourning.     Savannah, Georgia: Named One of the Most Beautiful Places in America     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  city of Savannah, Georgia, being named the most beautiful place in  Georgia and the fourth most beautiful place in the country by  Travellers Worldwide.   Savannah is home to a lively tourism industry due to its historical  architecture, captivating greenery, entertainment, and southern  hospitality.   Savannah is also considered the largest national historic landmark  district in the United States, thanks to its abundance of artifacts  from the Revolutionary and Civil War eras.   The coastline of Savannah is home to miles of great fishing spots,  beautiful beaches, and warm waters.   Whether you are a history buff looking for a place to vacation or  doing business, Savannah has something to offer for everyone.   I am proud to represent such a beautiful area that aids Georgia's  economy tremendously and brings many Americans to the State I call  home.                         Congratulating Riyon Rankin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Brunswick High alumnus Riyon Rankin for winning the boy's high jump  title at the Nike Outdoor Nationals.   Mr. Rankin has been making a name for himself in the track and field  world for the past 2 years, being the first student to claim a track  and field State and national championship in Brunswick High School's  history.   Recently, he cleared a high jump of over 7 feet, breaking the 6A  State record. It was not long after his record-breaking jump that he  received the invitation to compete from Nike.   Mr. Rankin went on to win his event at the Nike Outdoor Nationals,  sharing with interviewers that he only plans to improve from there. He  is committed to the University of Georgia--Go Dawgs--where he will  begin attending in the fall.   I wish Mr. Rankin the best of luck in his track and field career at  UGA and thank him for representing the city of Brunswick and the First  District with such determination and persistence.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  longest standing superintendent of Cumberland Island National Seashore,  Gary Ingram, and to congratulate him on his new job offer at the Rocky  Mountain National Park.   Mr. Ingram has been with the National Park Service for over 20 years.  Before he joined us in Cumberland, he served in many different  positions at Yosemite and later as superintendent of Georgia's own  Jimmy Carter National Historic Site.   Mr. Ingram began leading the Cumberland team in 2014, and because of  his efforts and accomplishments, also became the superintendent of Fort  Frederica National Monument.   During his 9-year tenure, his elevating leadership style and his  enthusiasm for the outdoors ensured that each park was properly taken  care of.   Recently, Mr. Ingram accepted a superintendent position at Rocky  Mountain National Park. I thank him for everything he has done for the  beautiful parks of Georgia's First District and wish him the very best  of luck in his future endeavors in the Rockies.                            ____________________
