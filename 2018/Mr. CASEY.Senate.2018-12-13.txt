 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember those killed at  Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, in 2012, just 6 years ago.  Tomorrow will be the anniversary of that horrible day, when America  lost 20 first graders and 6 adults in one of the worst mass shootings  in our Nation's history.   Since 2012, I have kept--and I know others have done similar things  to remind us--one page from a newspaper on my desk in the Russell  Building. I will not show all of it, but here is the top half of it. It  is obviously yellowed from 6 years. It just happens to be the Wall  Street Journal, dated Monday, December 17, 2012. At the top of the page  it says: Connecticut school shooting. The headline there just says two  words: Shattered lives. Then it gives a photograph of almost every  child and every adult. They missed a few because of the timing of this.  But then it has a biography of each individual killed. As I said, 20 of  them were children.   We have to remember tragedies like this to remind ourselves of our  obligation--on many issues, but this is certainly one of them. I wanted  to start by reading the names of all of those 26 Americans who were  killed on that day. I will just read through them, and after reading  each name I will also note the age of the individual on that horrible  day in December of 2012:   Charlotte Bacon, 6 years old; Daniel Barden 7; Rachel D'Avino, 29;  Olivia Engel, 6; Josephine Gay, 7; Dylan Hockley, 6; Dawn Lafferty  Hochsprung, 47; Madeleine Hsu, 6; Catherine Hubbard, 6; Chase Kowalski,  7; Jesse Lewis, 6; Ana Marquez-Greene, 6; James Mattioli, 6; Grace  McDonnell, 7; Anne Marie Murphy, 52; Emilie Parker, 6; Jack Pinto, 6;  Noah Pozner, 6; Caroline Previdi, 6; Jessica Rekos, 6; Avielle Richman,  6; Lauren Rousseau, 30; Mary Sherlach, 56; Victoria Soto, 27; Benjamin  Wheeler, 6; and, Allison Wyatt, age 6.   Those are the 26 individuals.   There are so many ways to express our sorrow and to continue mourning  as we did as a nation. I can't even imagine what each family had to  live through and still lives through today, and how that community had  to endure in that moment of horror--those days of horror and mourning  and sadness and all these years later.   The great recording artist Bruce Springsteen, after the 9/11 attacks,  wrote a number of songs reflecting upon that tragedy. One of the songs  he wrote--at least the lyrics that I remember--probably capture the  same sentiment that we all think about when we are thinking about that  kind of a tragedy. The name of the song is ``You're Missing,'' and a  refrain of the song goes like this:         You're missing, when I shut out the lights.        You're missing, when I close my eyes.        You're missing, when I see the sun rise.    I am sure that has been the circumstance for those families every  day, missing the loved one--for 20 of those families missing a loved  one who was age 6 or age 7, and for 6 other families missing an adult  family member of various ages.   We have a lot to do in this body, not only in the next couple of days  but certainly as we start both the new year and a new Congress. This  scourge of violence, which has consumed our country for so many years  now, should be at the top of that list of priority issues we focus on.  Just think about it this way: The 20 children who died at Sandy Hook  would be in the seventh grade right now. As we still mourn, we must  make sure that we come together to make sure no other family has to  endure a tragedy like that.   The shooting at Sandy Hook was a turning point for me as a public  official and I am sure a turning point for many Americans about what  our obligation is to respond to this problem. The tragedy in  Connecticut fundamentally changed the way I view both our Nation's  response to gun violence and my own responsibility as a public  official. I believe that each of us has an obligation to help take  action, to work as Members of the U.S. Senate. I would include Members  of the House, of course, and the executive branch.   We must continually ask ourselves a number of questions. One of those  questions surely is, Is there nothing our Nation can do to try to  prevent this kind of tragedy or other tragedies that we will note in a  few moments? Is there nothing we can do to prevent this? There is no  law, no action, no policy change on which we can come together to at  least reduce the likelihood that we will have another mass shooting in  a grade school or in a lot of other places around the country?   Some people here in Washington seem to believe that there literally  is nothing we can do, the most powerful country in the world that has  solved some big problems. We haven't solved all of them. We have solved  some pretty tough problems in this Chamber and in the other body, the  House, working together on a number of big issues over the years. But  on this one, some people in Washington just throw up their hands and  say there is nothing we can do--absolutely not a single law that we can  pass--other than enforce existing law; that that is all we can do, and  we hope that enforcement will reduce the likelihood, but if it doesn't,  then we just have to throw up our hands. I don't believe that. I don't  think many Americans believe that no matter what side of the political  aisle they are on.   I believe we have an obligation to take a couple of steps. The first  one ought to be easy because some of the data tells us that it is  supported by 90 percent of Americans or maybe even more than 90  percent; that is, universal background checks.   We undertook an effort in the Senate in 2013, in the aftermath of the  Sandy Hook massacre, and we made progress on getting bipartisan support  for a universal background check bill, but we  [[Page S7573]]  haven't done a lot since then in the Senate on that issue. That is one  bill we could vote on in 2019. I hope the majority leader will schedule  a debate on that bill--whatever version we have now in front of us--or  will in the new Congress. We can schedule debate and have a vote.  Obviously, Senators can vote any way they want, but let's have a debate  and let's vote on universal background checks.   Is that a magic wand which will wipe out this problem forever? No.  Background checks will make it less likely that we will have the kinds  of mass shootings we not only have endured as a nation but have grown,  unfortunately, tragically accustomed to.   I believe as well--and I know there are plenty of people who disagree  with me--that we ought to have a debate and a vote on another issue:  banning military-style weapons. I know. I understand that we have, by  some estimates, double-figure millions of these weapons already on our  streets. I get that, but does that mean we should continue down this  road and have 20 million and then 25 million of those weapons on our  streets and then 30, 40, 50, 60 million? Just throw up our hands and  say: That is all we can do; that we have to have tens of millions of  military-style weapons--weapons that belong on a battlefield, not on  our streets in our communities and our neighborhoods. That would be a  good debate to have on that bill.   We ought to have a debate and a vote on a limitation on magazine  capacity so we don't have one person who can spray hundreds of bullets  in a matter of moments. Is there nothing we can do about that?   The greatest country in the world can't do anything about these  issues, these votes?   How about preventing people on the terrorist watch list from getting  their hands on a firearm? We made a determination after 9/11 that we  were going to take certain steps--even against political pressure not  to take certain steps--to protect our Nation from terrorists. One of  them was, if you are a terrorist, we are going to do everything we can  to prevent you from getting on an airplane, or if we have a reasonable  suspicion that you are a terrorist, we are going to try to prevent you  from being on an airplane so we don't have another 9/11.   The same country that did that, so far, because of inaction by the  Congress over many years, allows that same individual who is too  dangerous--we have deemed them too dangerous--to get on an airplane, to  get a firearm because we haven't yet plugged that loophole. We have  tried a couple of times but not nearly enough.   Let's at least have a debate on a few of these issues and have up-or- down votes. If you want to vote against them, fine, but let's not  pretend that we are dealing with an issue when we don't even have a  debate and don't even have votes. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me,  and I am sure it doesn't make sense to Americans, no matter what side  of the debate they are on.   We can't simply throw up our hands and do nothing as thousands of  lives are lost each year. Why not try to do something to reduce that  number? We need a sustained debate and a series of votes. It is a good  time, by the way, coming up. New year. New Congress in 2019. A brandnew  Congress. We can start fresh by putting these issues on the floor of  the Senate.   We need to make sure the American people know where their  legislators--in this case, Federal legislators, Members of the  House and Senate--stand so they can be held accountable. That is as  American as anything we can do in this body.    We need to do it for the children and the staff who were killed at  Sandy Hook Elementary School. We need to make sure their lives are  remembered--not just in mourning, not just in recognition of a tragedy,  but are actually remembered by way of our action, of taking action and  doing something substantial that will reduce the likelihood.   We have had too many of these tragedies in the last couple of years.  I will do a partial list or a partial itemization of other tragedies-- not all of them but just a few. We know these cities by the tragedies  that took place in them: Orlando, in a nightclub; Charleston, in a  house of worship; Sutherland Springs; Las Vegas; Parkland; Thousand  Oaks; in my home State of Pennsylvania almost 2 months ago now at the  Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, where the killer came into  another house of worship on a Saturday morning and gunned down people  who range in age, in that circumstance--not children but range in age  from midfifties all the way to late eighties, early nineties, in age-- 11 people.   Whether it is Sandy Hook Elementary School or the Tree of Life  synagogue or a lot of places in between--and I am mentioning just the  ones since 2006, roughly; there were plenty before that--we have to not  just remember but take action.   In 2018--just 1 year not yet completed--so far in 2018, there have  been 13,743 gun deaths and 26,581 injuries. This is a uniquely American  problem. It doesn't happen around the world; it is happening here. That  is yet another reason for the American people to demand that we do our  job in the Senate, in the House, and in the executive branch. If it is  a uniquely American problem, Americans should try to solve it or at  least get on the road to solving it.   I hope we would have a measure of satisfaction if we pass just one  bill in 2019. Even if nothing else happens for years, maybe 25 years  from now, we could prevent one school shooting, prevent just one  shooting in a synagogue where 11 people lose their lives in a house of  worship, prevent a school or another place in our community from being  unfortunately etched in that wall of tragedy and loss and horror  forever, the name of a town, the name of a community remembered only in  some cases because of the violence that took place there.   I will say it again. This is a uniquely American problem, and we have  to try to solve it together. To say the status quo is unacceptable is a  terrible understatement, but that is the truth. I think people  understand that.   I know this is an issue people on both sides care very deeply about.  We haven't come together yet to take very much action. If you look at  the record on taking action on gun violence--I hate to use the word,  but it is true--it is pathetic in terms of Federal action.   I am still hopeful that the American people will continue to demand  more of all of us--both parties, both Houses, and two branches of the  Federal Government coming together not just to mourn and to remember  and to pay tribute and to offer prayers and condolences, but to take  action, to do what Americans do when we are faced with a problem--take  action, just as we did after 9/11. We didn't throw up our hands and  say: This is just the new normal. We said: No, we are going to take  action to try to stop it or at least reduce the likelihood. We can do  the same on this issue of gun violence.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
