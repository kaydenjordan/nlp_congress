 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express deep  concern about the Japanese Government's handling of the case of  Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, a U.S. Navy officer stationed at Yokosuka  Naval Base.   In May 2021, Lieutenant Alkonis and his family were on their way home  from hiking on Mount Fuji. Tragically, Lieutenant Alkonis lost control  of his vehicle due to acute mountain sickness, causing him to lose  consciousness. As a result, two bystanders tragically lost their lives.   Lieutenant Alkonis is remorseful for the medical incident that caused  the  [[Page H6942]]  events of that day. He has offered $1.65 million in extrajudicial  restitution to the victims' families, a gesture expected in Japan, but  far beyond the family's means. Ultimately, Lieutenant Alkonis was  sentenced this month by the Japanese high court to 3 years in prison.   I have been extremely upset to learn that the case was not conducted  in a way that was fair to Lieutenant Alkonis, and that the Japanese  Government violated the status of forces agreement, which governs the  treatment of our servicemembers there.   I understand that our Embassy in Tokyo has been monitoring this case,  and I strongly urge them to do more to support a servicemember in need.   My office has been working with the Department of the Navy and the  Office of the Secretary of Defense to support Lieutenant Alkonis and  his parents, Suzanne and Derek, throughout this case.   As I do, the Navy believes that this is the wrong sentence for  Lieutenant Alkonis. I won't be giving up on Lieutenant Alkonis and the  Department of Defense must not either.                            ____________________
