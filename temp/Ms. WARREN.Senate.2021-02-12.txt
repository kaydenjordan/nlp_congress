 It is time to bring impeachment charges against       him.        Bring impeachment charges.         Take him out now.        Mr. Depp. When was the last time an actor assassinated a       President?        Mr. Wilson. They are still going to have to go out and put       a bullet in Donald Trump.        Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says a protest is supposed to       be polite and peaceful.         The way I see it now is that we pick ourselves       up and we fight back; that is what it is all about. We stand       up and we fight back. We do not back down, we do not       compromise, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. You can lie       down, you can whimper, you can pull up in a ball, you can       decide to move to Canada, or you can stand your ground and       fight back, and that is what it is about. We do fight back,       but we are going to fight back. We are not turning this       country over to what Donald Trump has sold. We are just not.       Look, people are upset, and they're right to be upset.        Now, we can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back.       We're up here to fight back. Me, I'm here to fight back. I'm       here to fight back because we will not forget. We do not want       to forget. We will use that vision to make sure that we fight       harder, we fight tougher, and we fight more passionately more       than ever.        We still have a fight on our hands. Fight hard for the       changes Americans are demanding. Get in the fight.        To winning the fight.        Fight.        Fighting.        Fighting.        We'll use every tool possible to fight for this change.       We'll fight. We'll fight.        Fight.        Fighting hard.        Serious about fighting.        And fight.        We've got to (inaudible) and fight back.        Problems--we call them out and we fight back.        I'm in this fight.        I am fighting.        I am fighting.        Get in this fight. Get in this fight. Get in this fight.        And fighting.        We all need to be in the fight. We all need to stay in the       fight. We stay in this fight.        We fought back. We fought back. I am not afraid of a fight.       I am in this fight all the way. You don't get what you don't       fight for.        Our fight.        Our fight.        We are in this fight for our lives This is the fight of our       lives.         I am here to say one more time in public, this       is not a fight I wanted to take on, but this is the fight in       front of us now.    Every single one of you and every one of you--that is OK. You didn't  do anything wrong. It is a word people use. But please stop the  hypocrisy.   Did you tone down the rhetoric last summer when all of this was  happening? Did you condemn the rioters, or did you stand with Nancy  Pelosi, who said: People are going to do what they are going to do.   (Text of video presentations.)          Take him out now.        Mr. Depp. When was the last time an actor assassinated a       President?        Mr. Wilson. They're still going to have to go out and put a       bullet in Donald Trump.        Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says that protest is supposed       to be polite and peaceful.         You don't get what you don't fight for.         Get in this fight.         We are in this fight for our lives.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts has a  question for the House managers.  [[Page S687]]    The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The defense's presentation highlighted the fact that       Democratic Members of Congress raised objections to the       counting of electoral votes in past joint sessions of       Congress. To your knowledge, were any of those Democratic       objections raised after insurrectionists stormed the Capitol       in order to prevent the counting of electoral votes and after       the President's personal lawyer asked Senators to make these       objections specifically to delay the certification?    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the  opportunity to respond to that.   The answer is no, we are not aware that any other objections were  raised in the counting of electoral college votes, either by Democrats  or Republicans. This has been kind of a proud bipartisan tradition  under the electoral college because the electoral college is so arcane  and has so many rules to it.   I think that my cocounsel on the other side had some fun because I  was one of the people who took, I think, about 30 seconds in 2016 to  point out that the electors from Florida were not actually conforming  to the letter of the law because they have a rule in Florida that you  can't be a dual officeholder. In other words, you can't be a State  legislator and also be an elector. That was improper form.   I think then-Vice President Biden properly gaveled me down and said:  Look, we are going to try to make the electoral college work, and we  are going to vindicate the will of the people.   And that is pretty much what happened.   Nobody has stormed the Capitol before or, as Representative Cheney,  the secretary of the Republican conference said, gone out and summoned  a mob, assembled a mob, incited a mob, and lit a match. As  Representative Cheney said, all of this goes to the doorstep of the  President. None of it would have happened without him and everything is  due to his actions. This would not have happened.   That is the chair of the House Republican conference, who was the  target of an effort to remove her, which was rejected on a vote of by  more than 2 to 1 in the House Republican conference, when there was an  attempt to remove her for voting for impeachment and becoming a leader  for vindicating our constitutional values.   So please don't mix up what Republicans and Democrats have done, I  think, in every election for a long time, to say there are  improprieties going on in terms of conforming with State election laws,  with the idea of mobilizing a mob insurrection against the government  that got 5 people killed, 140 Capitol officers wounded, and threatened  the actual peaceful succession of power and transfer of power in  America.   If you want to talk about reforming the electoral college, we can  talk about reforming the electoral college. You don't do it by  violence.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.
