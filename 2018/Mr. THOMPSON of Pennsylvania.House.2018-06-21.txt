 Madam Speaker, recently, I introduced  [[Page H5367]]  a resolution with Congresswoman Niki Tsongas to designate July as Park  and Recreation Month. It is a fitting time to celebrate our Federal,  State, and local public parks and recreation systems because so many  Americans will visit them this summer.   H. Res. 941 recognizes the important role that public parks,  recreation facilities, and activities play in the lives of Americans,  and the contributions of employees and volunteers who work daily to  maintain our public parks and recreation facilities across the Nation.   As a lifelong resident of rural Pennsylvania and an avid outdoorsman,  I strongly support our Nation's park and recreation facilities. Our  parks provide countless recreational and educational opportunities for  individuals and families to engage in the outdoors.   This resolution simply recognizes and supports Park and Recreation  Month and the many benefits that our parks provide to all Americans.  Our parks generate opportunities for people to come together and  experience a sense of community. They pay dividends to communities by  attracting businesses and jobs, and increasing housing values. In the  United States, public park operations and capital spending generate  nearly $140 million in economic activity annually.   Ninety percent of people in the United States agree that public park  recreation facilities and activities are important government services,  a figure that displays a base of support that spans across all people  in the country regardless of race, income, gender, or political party  affiliation. Nearly 75 percent of Americans agree that it is important  to ensure that all members of their community have equitable access to  public parks and recreation facilities.   The most economically sound communities are those with ample and  healthy public park and recreation facilities and activities. In fact,  a key factor in business expansion and location decisions is the  quality of life for employees, with a premium placed on adequate and  accessible public parks and open space.   Madam Speaker, public parks and recreation facilities foster a  variety of activities that contribute to a healthier society. People  who use public parks and open space are three times more likely to  achieve recommended levels of physical activity than nonusers.   Americans living within a 10-minute walk of a park have a higher  level of physical activity and lower rates of obesity. Recreation  programs in public parks provide children with a safe place to play,  access to healthy foods, opportunities to be physically active, and  enrichment facilities that help prevent at-risk behavior, such as drug  use and gang involvement.   As schools recess for summer break, scores of Americans will visit  public parks and recreation facilities to spend time outdoors with  family, friends, and neighbors. We are blessed with beautiful outdoor  facilities.   It is my hope that all Americans get out and enjoy the parks in their  areas. They are tremendous community treasures.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today on this first  day of summer to recognize June as National Dairy Month.   From calcium to potassium, dairy products, like milk, contain nine  essential nutrients that may help to better manage your weight and  reduce your risk of high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain  cancers.   Whether it is protein to help build and repair the muscle tissue of  active bodies or vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin, dairy  products are a natural nutrient powerhouse. Those are just a few of the  reasons that we should celebrate dairy not just in June, but all year  long.   National Dairy Month started out as National Milk Month in 1937 as a  way to promote drinking milk. It was initially created to stabilize the  dairy demand when production was at a surplus, but it has now developed  into an annual tradition that celebrates the contributions the dairy  industry has made to the world.   As vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am proud that  the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is one of the largest milk-producing  States in the Nation.   Happy dairy month.                            ____________________
