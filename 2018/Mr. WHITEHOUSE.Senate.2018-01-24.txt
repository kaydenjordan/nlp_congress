 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I begin today by adding a Rhode Island  voice to the chorus of coastal communities around the country standing  against President Trump's reckless and unwelcome choice to try to allow  oil and gas drilling off of nearly all U.S. coasts.   The Rhode Island ocean economy is worth over $2 billion and employs  more than 40,000 people. For whatever potential gain of fossil fuel  corporations, offshore drilling introduces all sorts of hazards to our  fishing industry and people who work in tourism and recreation along  Narragansett Bay.   Remember how devastating the 2010 BP oilspill was in the Gulf of  Mexico? This graphic depicts what a spill that size would look like off  of New England.   The administration has tossed aside a 5-year plan that underwent  multiple revisions and involved multiple agencies over multiple years  taking into account the input of stakeholders and literally millions of  comments from the public.   The final plan that had been developed after all that effort allowed  for only 10 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and one sale in the Cook  Inlet program area off the Alaska coast. There were no lease sales  allowed in the Pacific or Atlantic. Why? Because everybody hates it.   In ruling out drilling off our Atlantic coast, the Bureau of Ocean  Energy Management cited ``strong local opposition, conflicts with other  ocean uses, . . . current market dynamics, . . . [and] careful  consideration of the comments received from Governors of affected  states.''   None of that has changed, and the Trump administration ought to  listen to those coastal voices, not just the occasional Republican  Governor of a coastal State seeking a political boost.   Rhode Island, the Ocean State, has come out strongly opposed to this  proposal. Our Governor, Gina Raimondo, said the administration's plan  is ``endangering the health of nearly all coastal waters in our  country, including our 400 miles of coastline in Rhode Island, so that  rich oil companies can get richer.''   Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin vowed to ``continue to  fight this latest move by the Trump administration to give the oil and  gas industry carte blanche to destroy our environment.''   Rhode Island is a leader in offshore wind development. It was the  first in the Nation to have steel in the water, first in the Nation to  have electrons flowing to the grid. We also have vibrant fisheries and  a longstanding fishing economy. We depend on our coastal economy for  that, for tourism, and for many other things. Also, we are especially  susceptible to sea level rise and other consequences of climate change.  We are not about to go back in time and endanger our coast with the  extraction of more dirty fuels.   Here in Washington, I led a bipartisan group of New England Senators  seeking legislation to bar offshore drilling along our New England  coast. My Rhode Island colleague, Representative David Cicilline,  introduced the companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  The Trump administration will not be following through on its rash plan  if New England's bipartisan Members of Congress have anything to say  about it. The value of healthy oceans and coasts is tangible and  immediate for us.   The larger backdrop to this conversation about offshore drilling is  that our oceans are steadily getting sicker, even without the threat of  additional oilspills. The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent  of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since  the industrial revolution began. That is changing the ocean's chemistry  dramatically. The oceans have already absorbed roughly 90 percent of  the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. We  would not be living the way we have gotten used to through our  development as a species if it weren't for the ocean absorbing so much  of that excess heat. We owe the oceans a lot, but as a result of that  excess carbon dioxide and excess heat, our oceans are warming, and  because they are warming, they are rising and, as well, of course, they  are growing more acidic, putting marine life, coastal communities, and  ocean economies all in jeopardy.   Oceans face another emerging problem, which is deoxygenation. Oceans  need oxygen, and fish and other creatures that live in the ocean need  oxygen, and we are finding that there is less and less. Low-oxygen  zones in the ocean are nothing new. Dead zones or areas where oxygen  levels drop too low for marine life to survive occur naturally, but  dead zones are worsening. They are worsening near the coasts where  agricultural runoff spurs rapid blooms of phytoplankton. When the  phytoplankton die, their decomposition consumes large amounts of oxygen  from the water, and fish and other marine animals suffocate. We saw  this just a few years ago in Narragansett Bay's Greenwich Bay area.   Now, the Gulf of Mexico routinely sees dead zones as nitrogen-rich  waters  [[Page S495]]  flow from farms in the heartland, down the Mississippi River, and into  the gulf. Last year's gulf dead zone reached record levels. NOAA, which  measures these things, estimated the dead zone to be the size of New  Jersey--the largest ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA assessed  that the cause was unusually heavy rains in the Midwest associated with  climate change that washed large amounts of fertilizer into the river  and down to the gulf.   NOAA is not alone. Last year's Climate Science Special Report, the  scientific backbone for the Federal Government's Fourth National  Climate Assessment, discussed the growing issue of climate change- driven ocean deoxygenation. The report did not mince words. ``Global  ocean deoxygenation is a direct effect of warming.'' As water warms, it  loses its capacity to absorb gases like oxygen, and warmer water  circulates less, meaning there is less mixing of water and oxygen  between the surface and deeper waters. The report attributes 85 percent  of global oxygen loss to this stratification, as it is known, of the  water.   Worldwide, ocean oxygen levels have declined. According to the  Climate Science Special Report, the North Pacific, North Atlantic,  Southern Ocean, subtropical South Pacific, and South Indian Oceans are  all expected to experience further deoxygenation. Oxygen may drop off  as much as 17 percent in the North Pacific by 2100 if we don't rein in  carbon emissions.   Not surprisingly, fish and other marine wildlife try to steer clear  of dead zones. If they are not able to breathe in these low-oxygen  waters, they can die. Dr. Callum Roberts, a researcher at the  University of York, has also warned that large and fast-moving fish  that use more oxygen, like tunas, billfish, sharks, and fish like this  unbelievably beautiful marlin, are being relegated to shrinking high- oxygen areas causing them to change how they hunt. A 2010 paper in  Deep-Sea Research estimated that from 1960 to 2008, the areas in the  ocean where oxygen levels are too low to support fish and other big  ocean organisms have grown by over 1.7 million square miles--an added  1.7 million square miles with oxygen levels too low for God's beautiful  creatures like this one.    One example of this phenomenon comes to us from former NOAA  researcher Dr. Eric Prince, who noticed that blue marlin, a fish which  is actually well known for its diving capabilities, would not leave the  top hundred feet of ocean off of Costa Rica and Guatemala. Elsewhere,  in the ocean, marlin regularly go half a mile down to hunt. The reason  for constraining themselves to that top 100 feet of ocean? ``A deep,  gigantic and expanding swath of water that contained too little  oxygen.'' A 2011 study in Nature Climate Change estimated that over 50  years the surface ocean habitat in the tropical Northeast Atlantic used  by tunas and billfish, like the blue marlin, has shrunk by 15 percent  due to deoxygenation.   A study published earlier this month in the prestigious journal  Science warned that though there may be a short-term fishing surge due  to the crowding of fishing species into surface waters--they are easier  to find because there is less oxygenated water that they are in--``[i]n  the longer term, these conditions are unsustainable and may result in  ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic  harm.''   This portends devastating effects. The World Health Organization says  around 1 billion people rely on fish as their main source of protein.  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 10 to 12 percent  of the world's population base their livelihoods on fisheries or  aquaculture. Bringing it closer to home, commercial fish landings for  Rhode Island for 2016 totaled 82.5 million pounds and were valued at  nearly $94 million. In 2014, the New England ocean economy was valued  at over $17 billion and employed nearly a quarter of a million people.  All of that is at risk as we pull out the cornerstones of our ocean  ecosystem.   Here is where it actually gets a little weird. Oxygen depletion could  actually spur a boom in nitrogen-breathing microorganisms--tiny  microbes that breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen. They might then  demand enough valuable nitrogen that they crowd out other ocean species  that also need nitrogen, and these nitrogen species exhale nitrous  oxide, which is a greenhouse gas which creates another possible climate  change feedback loop.   As a recent Washington Post story put it, our growing understanding  of ocean deoxygenation ``underscores once again that some of the most  profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans,  rather than on land.''   As Dr. Denise Breitburg, the lead author of the recent Science paper  said, ``Of course, declining oxygen isn't happening in isolation. . . .  Warming itself threatens marine food webs, as does acidification caused  by increased carbon dioxide in the water. But the threats are worse  when combined.''   That is what we are seeing--deoxygenation, warming, acidification  combined.   We recklessly ignore the warnings that the oceans are screaming at  us. Scientists are seeing numbers and conditions in the oceans they  have never seen before. We ignore also the high tides that now  regularly flood downtowns of major cities as sea levels rise. We ignore  fish species moving northward and offshore in search of cooler waters  away from traditional fisheries. We ignore the oyster spat dissolving  in acidic seawater before they can grow to maturity. We ignore coral  reefs turning white and dying in warm, acidic seas. We ignore the  record strength of warm-water-fueled 2017 hurricanes that killed  people, destroyed homes, and caused billions of dollars in damage.   I wonder how long can we ignore the cries from our oceans? Truly, it  is time to wake up.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
