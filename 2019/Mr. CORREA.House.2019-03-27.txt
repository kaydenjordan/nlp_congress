 Madam Speaker, to my right is a picture of champs. I  congratulate the Fullerton College men's basketball team for winning  the State championship this last weekend.   This victory marks Fullerton College's fourth State championship  title, but the first since 2006. This awesome performance is thanks to  Coach Perry Webster and tournament MVP Lance Coleman, sophomore Rodrick  McCobb, and the rest of the talented players.   I am honored to recognize these fine young men. These players are  going to be role models, and they are going to be leaders in our  community. These men have learned a lesson, which is that hard work and  determination pay off.   These are our State champions. Congratulations to Coach Webster and  the Hornets. They have earned this victory.   Go Hornets.                            ____________________
