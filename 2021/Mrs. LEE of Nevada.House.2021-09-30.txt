 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  tremendous students, staff, and teachers at Nevada's 2021 Blue Ribbon  Schools.   Not one, not two, but three Clark County schools, all in Nevada's  Third Congressional District, were just named National Blue Ribbon  Schools by the U.S. Department of Education: Charlotte Hill Elementary,  Frank Lamping Elementary, and Pinecrest Academy of Nevada Inspirada.   These schools were recognized for their exemplary work to close the  achievement gap, expand educational opportunities, and excel  academically.   I always say education is the key to opportunity, and I cannot wait  to see where all of these incredible young Nevadans will go.   Congratulations, Clark County schools.                            ____________________
