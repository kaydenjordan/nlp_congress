 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Hawaii for  yielding and for his work on this bill.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to ensure that Great  Lakes States have access to the resources in this bill, so they can  address climate change threats specific to our region.   Increased rain has already led to more agricultural runoff into the  Great Lakes, resulting in higher bacterial counts and larger algal  blooms. This has put our drinking water supplies at risk. Lake Michigan  alone provides drinking water for 10 million people.   Climate change increasingly threatens Great Lakes wildlife, including  fisheries important to our economy, by changing temperatures,  precipitation patterns, and ice cover.   These are some of the reasons that America's ``third coast,'' our  Great Lakes States, need access to the resources in this bill.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Grijalva for his support, including my  amendment in this en bloc, and I ask my colleagues to join me and  support this amendment and the underlying bill.
