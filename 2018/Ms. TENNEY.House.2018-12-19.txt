 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the story of dear  friends of mine, Robert and Donna Force, who are deeply committed to  carrying on the tradition of family farming.   Robert served honorably as a member of the 106th Rescue Wing, a unit  of the Army National Guard. In 1986, Robert and Donna Force purchased  96 acres of land in Gilbertsville, New York. It is where they would  spend the next 26 years building their farm and growing their family.   All told, by 2010, the family had expanded to 111 acres of land in  the beautiful Catskill region of upstate New York. The family viewed  the farm as their retreat, a place of many happy memories. They cleared  the land to build a barn, renovated their farmhouse, and planted new  trees across the landscape.   Sadly, in 2014, the Forces were forced off their land due to an  accounting error in their local county. The county failed to cooperate  with them, instead putting their lovely farm up for sale and auction.   Mr. Force, as a veteran, also cared for his wife, Donna, who was  suffering grave, life-threatening medical problems through this and up  until today. The Force family believes this is part of a larger plan to  push families off their property, auctioning land to the highest  bidder.   Since that day, the Forces have continued to fight to save their  farm, their  [[Page H10324]]  property, and their family legacy. For more information, see ``Save the  Force Farm'' on Facebook and social media.   Thank you so much to the Forces and to Mr. Force for his honorable  service to our Nation.                            ____________________
