 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me  and for the work she does with this Special Order. And I thank my  friend from Texas (Mr. Veasey), for allowing me to participate.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to the scholarship of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, and  the perseverance of the Association for the Study of African American  Life and History, we continue to lift up the contributions of and  achievements of Black Americans.   The celebration of Black History Month has its roots in Black History  Week, established back in 1926; and because of the urgings of Carter G.  Woodson, the week was selected to be the second week of February in  order to embrace the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham  Lincoln.   Now, later, in fact, in 1969, students at Kent State University,  after having experienced some turmoil on their campus back in 1968, as  it took place on campuses in other places across the country--Jackson  State in Mississippi, South Carolina State in South Carolina--students  at Kent State decided, as a part of their redress, to expand the week  to a month. So they, in 1970, celebrated what they called Black History  Month.   Now, 6 years later, President Gerald Ford signed legislation creating  Black History Month. When he signed that legislation, he said it was to  honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans.   The Association for the Study of African American Life and History is  entrusted with the celebration every year, and it falls upon them to  select a theme for each year. This year they have selected the theme  which I think is very timely, ``The Crisis in Black Education.'' Having  started my professional career as a public school teacher, I totally  embrace this particular topic for this year.   Throughout our history, especially post-Civil War history, there has  always been a focus on Black education. As we all know, slaves were not  allowed to be educated, and, as a result, when the Civil War came to a  close, there was this big push to get the former slaves educated.   One of the leaders of that push was one of my heroes, Robert Smalls.  Robert Smalls, though he was not allowed to be educated himself because  he was born into slavery, used his God-given intellect to study the  currents of the Charleston Harbor and to study the whistles that were  used on the ship that he was working on as a slave. He decided that he  could, at some point, find his way to freedom.   Because he learned those currents so well, and because he became very  proficient at studying the sounds of the whistles on the ships, one  night, when the opportunity presented itself, he absconded The Planter  that he was working on, navigated the waters out of the Charleston  Harbor, picked up his wife and friends, and sailed them into freedom.  And when he delivered that ship to the Union soldiers, he was rewarded  with his freedom and a cash award.   Robert Smalls, after the war, went back to Beaufort and, in 1867,  founded a school to educate the newly freed slaves. He also  participated as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional  Convention, and in that Convention, he authored and got passed a  resolution that created the first free public schools for all in  America.   He turned his wealth--or his financial reward into great wealth. And  also, he became a very, I would say, successful politician. He served  10 years in the South Carolina Legislature and a total of 10 years here  in this House of Representatives.   While he was participating in politics, Robert Smalls authored a  piece of legislation that created what is now South Carolina State  University. Therein lies a part of my presentation I would like to  concentrate on tonight.    When South Carolina State University was created--I want to first get  people to understand, there are more than 100 Historically Black  Colleges and Universities in the country. Now, there is a difference  between--we commonly call them HBCUs. There is a difference between an  HBCU and what we call an MSI, a Minority Serving Institution. All HBCUs  are MSIs, but not all MSIs are HBCUs, simply because the definition  means that you must have been in existence before 1964.   We have had a lot of Minority Serving Institutions that have been  created since 1964; to name just a few, Malcolm X College, Medgar Evers  College. These are all Minority Serving Institutions. There are a lot  of Hispanic Serving Institutions, but they are not necessarily HBCUs.   The reason I point this out, because here in this Congress, in this  body, currently, 19 members of the Congressional Black Caucus are  graduates of HBCUs. Now, the reason I point this out is because I think  it is necessary for us to understand the role that these colleges and  universities play in our society.   I often spend a lot of time with friends, many of whom are graduates  of HBCUs, and I knew Astronaut Ronald McNair very well. I have a good  friend, a cardiologist, recently retired, David Dowdy. I also have a  friend, a California businesswoman who I interact with quite a bit,  Janice Howroyd. All three of these people graduated from North Carolina  A&T State University.   I have talked a lot with another former Member, Carrie Meek, a former  Member of Congress; her son, Kendrick Meek; former Congresswoman  Corrine Brown; and the chairman of the board of Microsoft, John  Thompson. All four of these individuals are graduates of Florida A&M  University, an HBCU. These are people who have made significant and are  making significant contributions in our thrust toward a more perfect  union.   I came before this body several times the week before last  highlighting some of the HBCUs that are in my congressional district.  Of the more than 100 in the country, 8 of them are in South Carolina.  Seven are in my congressional district. I talked about six of them when  I came before this body before. Tonight I want to close out my  discussion of these HBCUs by talking about two of them, Claflin  University and South Carolina State University, both located adjacent  to each other in Orangeburg, South Carolina.                                time  2100    Now, Claflin University was founded in 1869, by Methodist  missionaries to provide education for newly freed slaves in order to  prepare them for full citizenship. The university was named for William  Claflin, then-Governor of Massachusetts, and his father, Lee Claflin,  both prominent abolitionists and Methodists. They provided a large  portion of the funds needed to purchase the land for the campus.  Claflin is the oldest Historically Black College in South Carolina. In  its beginning, it had a law school which was headed by former South  Carolina Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Jasper Wright, the first  African American to serve on South Carolina's highest court.   In 1948, under the leadership of its first alumnus to serve as  president, Dr. John Seabrook, Claflin was accredited by the Southern  Association of Colleges and Schools. It has always featured a strong  music program, and the Claflin University collegiate choir performed at  the 1965 World's Fair in New York. Claflin graduate and Kingstree,  South Carolina native, Dr. Henry Tisdale has served as the university's  president since 1994. Under his leadership, Claflin has thrived and  grown to new heights. He has built Claflin to an enrollment of almost  2,000 students and consistently seen it ranked in the top 10 nationally  for HBCUs. In 1999, through funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation  program by this body, the historic Ministers' Hall was restored.   The auditorium at Ministers' Hall was named for former Chief Justice  Ernest A. Finney, one of Claflin's most notable graduates. Finney  graduated from South Carolina State's law school and would go on to  serve on the South Carolina Supreme Court from 1985 through 2000,  including 6 years as Chief Justice. Early in his career, Ernest Finney  represented the Friendship 9, a group of Rock Hill students who were  jailed in 1961 for a sit-in in McCrory's lunch counter. In 2015, Finney  represented the surviving eight members of this group to see their  convictions overturned--54 years after they were originally prosecuted.   Claflin is still affiliated with the United Methodist Church and  offers multiple master's degrees, as well as a highly regarded honors  program. For 148 years, Claflin has been a beacon of  [[Page H1349]]  hope and a place of refuge for those who desired a quality education  regardless of race and/or gender.   Mr. Speaker, the final HBCU in this series is my alma mater, South  Carolina State University. South Carolina State University has its  roots in the Morrill Acts, the first of which was passed by Congress in  1862. The Morrill Act of 1862 created land grant colleges, a system of  agriculture, science, and engineering and military science schools. One  of the schools established under this law was Clemson University. But  after Reconstruction ended, Southern States refused to admit African  Americans to these institutions; consequently, Congress passed a second  Morrill Act in 1890, which stipulated that Blacks must be included in  the land grant system. Southern States had the choice to either admit  Blacks to the 1862 institutions or create new land grant institutions  which would be open to Blacks.   In South Carolina, by the 1890s, White supremacists had gained total  control over State government. Though the State was still majority  African American, through illegal and violent intimidation, extreme  voter suppression, and outright fraud, Benjamin Tillman was elected  Governor in 1890. The Constitutional Convention of 1895 subsequently  codified White supremacy and the disenfranchisement of African  Americans into the State's system of governance. When the United States  Supreme Court sanctioned segregation the following year in Plessy v.  Ferguson, segregation was firmly the law of the land.   This was the context for the founding, in 1896, of the Colored  Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South  Carolina, as South Carolina State was originally named. The State of  South Carolina continued to resist but relented when land was acquired  from Claflin University, and the campus of what is now known as South  Carolina State University was born. It continues to be the only  publicly supported HBCU in South Carolina.   Now, I know, Mr. Speaker, that I have consumed a lot of time, and I  don't want to take all of the time from my colleagues, so let me just  close by saying this: South Carolina State's first president was a man  named Thomas E. Miller who served as a Member of this body. Thomas  Miller guided the school for several years. Notable graduates of this  institution are folks like Dr. Benjamin Mays, the noted president of  Morehouse College.   South Carolina State has a reputation as producing more African- American general officers than any other school in this country. I  entered South Carolina State in 1957, and, of course, I was there  during the turbulent sixties. It was my great honor to help organize  the first sit-in in South Carolina. You talk about grassroots. That  took place on March 15, 1960. Now, I was jailed as a result of that  sit-in, but it just so happens that sometimes good things can come out  of jail. While I was there, a young lady came to bring food. I was so  grateful for that hamburger she gave me, I married her 18 months later,  and if all goes well, come June 24, she and I will celebrate our 56th  wedding anniversary.   Now, when all of these cases took place growing out of these  demonstrations and sit-ins, one stands out which I will close with. I  mentioned Kent State in 1968, Jackson State, and South Carolina State.  A lot of people have heard of Kent State. Few people know about the  deaths of three students and the injuries of 27 others in an incident  called the Orangeburg massacre that took place in 1968, all over the  integration of a bowling alley.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to close my comments by thanking the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for giving me this opportunity and  the gentleman from Texas and thank them very much for highlighting  Black History Month.   Mr. Speaker, it is impossible for me to really share the real impact  that schools like Claflin, South Carolina State, and the over 100 other  HBCUs have had on our great country. But, as I conclude our observance  of Black History Month, I salute all of them and thank them for the  indelible mark that they have made on the fabric of our Nation.
