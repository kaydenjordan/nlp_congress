 Mr. Speaker, the safety and security of the United  States over 21 years since 9/11 is no accident. It is due to the sweat,  toil, and blood of thousands of young Americans.   Many Americans have enjoyed the fruits of this labor with not  contributing anything to the cost. As a veteran of the war on terror  myself, I stand here today and, from the bottom of my heart, genuinely  wish I could tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I could tell my colleagues:  ``Mission accomplished. We can go home.'' I truly wish I could say  that, but the mission is not accomplished yet. It is not finished.  There is still work to do, which our troops in Syria carry on today.   ISIS remains the deadliest terrorist threat in the world. The work  that these troops do day in and day out is a relatively small  investment in our security and the security of our allies.    Mr. Speaker, I share the general consensus that we  should re-debate the AUMF. That is Congress' job. I have voted for  measures similar to this in the past that will force that debate. We  should force Congress to debate the AUMF, but we should not force our  troops to withdraw.
