 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1009.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We are here to consider H.R. 1009. This is a bill sponsored by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell). It is cosponsored on the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Palmer). We are also pleased to have the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), chairman of the Committee on Rules, as well as the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) as cosponsors.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1009, the OIRA Insight,  Reform, and Accountability Act. OIRA stands for the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs. It has many responsibilities. It is  a little known agency, but very powerful and very important. Some of  its most well-known responsibilities are governed by an executive  order. Executive Order 12866 was issued by President Clinton in 1993.  The order was maintained under President Bush and reaffirmed by  President Obama in 2009.   The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act puts into statute  the basic structure that has existed for more than two decades. The  legislation also includes some minor adjustments for increased  transparency and accountability. For example, agencies are required to  provide OIRA with a redline of any changes the agency chooses to make  during the review process. This allows the public to better understand  how centralized review can improve the quality of rulemaking.   The bill clarifies the process for extending the time for OIRA to  review regulations. Currently, OIRA has 90 days to review a regulation,  but at the  [[Page H1431]]  request of the issuing agency, OIRA can extend the review indefinitely  without notice to the public. Under the Obama administration, many  rules were under review for more than a year with no explanation  whatsoever. H.R. 1009 requires OIRA and the regulating agency to agree  upon the extension and provide a written explanation to the public,  including an estimated date of completion.   The government works for the people. You would think if they are  going to miss deadlines and be late and go beyond the current rules,  the people who are involved in the rulemaking would at least offer a  little bit of a written explanation. The bill also requires OIRA to  update the explanation and estimated completion date every 30 days  after that moving forward.   Another significant difference from the executive order is H.R. 1009  includes independent agencies in OIRA's review of significant  regulations. Independent regulatory agencies already submit their  regulations to OIRA for the unified agenda and the annual regulatory  plans. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, independent agencies submit  information collection requests, which is another way to say government  forms, to OIRA for approval. For decades, experts across the political  spectrum, including the Administrative Conference of the United States  and the American Bar Association, have called for the inclusion of  independent agencies in the significant regulation review process.  Again, a good group there, the Administrative Conference of the United  States, as well as the American Bar Association also asking for these  independent agencies.   There is significant bipartisan agreement on including the  independent agencies. In fact, President Obama's Jobs Council  recommended including independent agencies in OIRA's regulatory review.  Sally Katzen, OIRA administrator under President Clinton, said: ``For  all practical purposes, the way executive branch agencies and  independent agencies conduct rulemaking is the same, so they both  should be expected to gather and use information on the costs and  benefits of new regulatory proposals.'' She went on to suggest:  ``Congress could adapt that approach for OIRA review of the analysis  underlying independent agency rulemakings.'' And she goes on.    That is exactly what the bill does, which brings me to the last major  difference between this bill and the executive order. This bill  requires OIRA to report on what it reviewed and the results of that  review. The Oversight Committee conducted an extensive investigation  into the Waters of the United States rulemaking, also known as WOTUS.  During the course of the investigation, it was clear OIRA was not  conducting the analysis I think we should all expect. OIRA even  shortchanged the interagency review process in order to meet the self- imposed arbitrary deadline.   H.R. 1009 requires OIRA to issue a report on each significant  regulation it reviews so the public can see exactly what legal  requirements OIRA focused on and what OIRA found. H.R. 1009 asks OIRA  to consider: Did the agency technically comply with the requirement?  Did it make solid effort to improve the regulation through the process?  Or was the agency just going through the motions? These are very  legitimate, easy, simple questions that we think can be answered.   Agencies are supposed to consider the public's comments, but what if  the final rule is drafted before the comments are even reviewed?  Perhaps the law does not explicitly prohibit that, but is it really an  effective regulatory practice? The question is more than just whether  agencies have simply complied. It is whether the agency is doing  everything it can to limit the burden and make its regulations  effective and easy to understand.   By requiring OIRA to make the results of its review of rulemakings  available to the public, this bill will encourage agency accountability  and improve the public's understanding of the rulemaking process. The  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill,  without amendment, on February 14 of this year.   I again want to thank the leadership of Congressman Mitchell for  doing all that he has done to bring us to this point where we are  debating this on the floor of the House. I also want to thank Katy  Rother for her tireless work on this bill. She has done an awful lot of  work, working with both sides of the aisle. Hats off to her as well.  Again, I urge the passage of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1009, the OIRA       Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew       Pickford.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.          H.R. 1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act  As ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government                        Reform on February 14, 2017                                   SUMMARY         H.R. 1009 would codify many executive orders and practices       of the federal government related to the process of issuing       federal regulations. The legislation also would expand the       role of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs       (OIRA) in the regulatory process and authorize OIRA to review       rules proposed by certain independent federal agencies.        CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase       administrative costs to OIRA and federal agencies by a total       of $20 million over the 2018-2022 period; such spending would       be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. CBO       estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct       spending by $3 million over the 2018-2027 period and would       reduce revenues by $2 million over the same period. Because       the bill would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-      you-go procedures apply.        CBO also expects that enacting H.R. 1009 could delay the       issuance of some rules. However, because of the large number       and variety of federal rules issued each year, CBO cannot       determine whether a delay in the effective date of some rules       would have a cost or savings to the federal government.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1009 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits by more than $5       billion in one or more of the four consecutive 10-year       periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 1009 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or       tribal governments.                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 1009 is shown in the       following table. The costs of this legislation fall within       all budget functions that include agencies that issue or       review regulations.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                   By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025    2026    2027   2018-2022  2018-2027 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION   Estimated Authorization Level.....................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40 Estimated Outlays.................................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40                                                                 INCREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING   Estimated Budget Authority........................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3 Estimated Outlays.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3                                                                     DECREASES IN REVENUES   Estimated Revenues................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        -1         -2                                           NET INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT FROM CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES   Impact on Deficit.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         3          5 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: *= between -$500,000 and $500,000.   [[Page H1432]]                                   BASIS OF ESTIMATE         For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 1009 will be       enacted near the end of fiscal year 2017 and that spending       will follow historical patterns for these and similar       activities.        CBO is not aware of any comprehensive information on       current spending for regulatory activities governmentwide.       However, according to the Congressional Research Service,       federal agencies issue 3,000 to 4,000 final rules each year.       Most are promulgated by the Departments of Transportation,       Homeland Security, and Commerce, and the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA). Agencies that issue the most major       rules (those with an estimated economic impact on the economy       of more than $100 million per year) include the Department of       Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and       the EPA.        H.R. 1009 would codify certain regulatory policies and       practices that are currently being implemented pursuant to       several executive orders. Those instructions require agencies       in the executive branch to analyze the impacts of regulations       (including costs and benefits), to coordinate with OIRA       during the rulemaking process, and to perform other       activities and analyses related to considering the effects of       proposed rules.                     Spending Subject to Appropriation         On the basis of information from OIRA and several federal       agencies on the cost of the rulemaking process, CBO estimates       that more personnel would be needed to produce additional       analyses and to perform other administrative tasks under H.R.       1009. CBO estimates that spending would increase by about $4       million annually and $20 million over the 2018-2022 period to       hire and train sufficient staff. Such spending would be       subject to the availability of appropriated funds.                              Direct Spending         CBO estimates that some independent regulatory agencies       would face an increased administrative workload under H.R.       1009 because, under current law, most independent regulatory       agencies are not required to submit regulatory analyses to       OIRA. Some of those agencies, primarily the Federal Deposit       Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau (CFPB), can spend funds for such activities       without further appropriation. CBO estimates that enacting       H.R. 1009 would cost about $3 million over the 2018-2027       period for the FDIC and CFPB to prepare additional reports       and analyses of proposed regulations for OIRA.                                  Revenues         H.R. 1009 would affect revenues by changing the cost of the       operations of the Federal Reserve System, which remits its       net earnings to the Treasury; those remittances are       classified as revenues in the federal budget. The legislation       would impose additional administrative expenses on the       Federal Reserve to prepare reports and analyses for OIRA.       Based on the cost of similar administrative work of the       Federal Reserve, CBO estimates those additional       administrative costs would reduce remittances by the Federal       Reserve to the Treasury by $2 million over the 2018-2027       period.                         PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in       outlays and revenues that are subject to these pay-as-you-go       procedures are shown in the following table.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On February 14, 2017, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported without       amendment H.R. 1009, the ``OIRA Insight, Reform, and       Accountability Act'' by a vote of 23 to 16. The bill was       referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform, with an additional referral to the       Committee on the Judiciary.        I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, February 23, 2017.      Hon. Jason Chaffetz,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chaffetz: I write with respect to H.R. 1009,       the ``OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act.'' As a       result of your having consulted with us on provisions within       H.R. 1009 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1009 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 998 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 1009.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me mention that the bill does not require any of these agencies  to provide new analysis. And I haven't really heard an example or a  reason why something would be prohibited in an agency from sharing  existing cost-benefit analysis.   What could the agencies have that they should not share with OIRA?   It just seems reasonable that if they have this information, they  should share it. Ultimately, we do work for the American people, and  the American people should be able to see this information as it goes  to OIRA.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just point out that these  independent agencies need oversight as much as any other agency; and,  ultimately, what we are trying to do is provide more transparency, more  information to the public. Whether or not they think they are  independent or not, they still work for the American people, and the  people that are footing the bills and that have to live under these  regulations should have the right to see this information and have this  information provided to them through the process.   We are never going to apologize for trying to increase the  transparency and the process. That is what this bill does.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to simply point out that the bill does extend OIRA to  review independent agencies. I also would point out, as I did earlier,  the Administrative Conference of the United States recommended OIRA  review be extended to independent agencies back in 1988.   In fact, the American Bar Association recommended OIRA review be  extended to independent agencies in 1990 and reaffirmed the need again  in 2016. They said: ``We strongly urge you to bring the independent  regulatory commissions within the requirements for cost-benefit  analysis''--I am going to just inject my own words here in the middle.   Cost-benefit analysis, isn't that something reasonable that we should  all look at? That is not asking an agency too much, especially if they  already have the information.   They went on to say: ``OMB review, and retrospective review of rules  currently reflected in Executive Order 12866. . . . `'   Those are not overly burdensome requests. In fact, in 2011, Sally  Katzen, the OIRA Administrator under President Clinton, urged Congress  to support extending OIRA review to independent agencies, when she  wrote: ``Our concern is that independent agencies are not typically  engaging in the analysis that has come to be expected as a form of  governmental best practice for regulatory agencies.''   It seems like a reasonable expectation to employ best practices. And  all that bill does is--again, it does not interfere with independent  agencies' rulemaking process or their policy decision. It simply  requires OIRA to review the regulations to ensure these agencies are  complying with legal requirements just the same as any other agency.   That is a reasonable request. That is why we urge its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires OIRA to maintain  records on each significant regulatory action reviewed such that it is  easily accessible and transferrable when responding to congressional  requests.   Unfortunately, in the last Congress, Mr. Chairman, the committee  asked for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA--asked  Administrator Shelanski for records relating to the review of the  Waters of the United States, often known as WOTUS, and that rulemaking  process. The administrator repeatedly failed to take the requests  seriously, which led me, as the chairman of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, to issue a subpoena in July of 2015.   Even upon issuance of a subpoena, OIRA resisted responding to the  request, blowing past deadlines and being totally nonresponsive. We  held multiple hearings. We conducted transcribed interviews. We had  lengthy staff-to-staff conversations, but still OIRA did not seem to  take the request seriously. I don't know how much money they wasted in  time and effort to slow this process down and resist our being able to  get the information that they said they had in order to make this  decision.   It was not until the committee, myself, as the chairman, getting on  the phone with the head of OMB, when I told him that I had every  intention to hold Mr. Shelanski in contempt and issue a contempt  report, that we actually received a full set of documents. This was  well past a year since the initial request. You should not have to go  through those gyrations whatsoever.   I will think the resistance was largely a political maneuvering--this  is my own opinion--by the administration that did not want us to see  how rushed, incomplete, and politically involved this regulatory review  was. That is my own personal opinion.   But for those who are here and the future generations, it seems  reasonable that they have to have their act in order if they are  actually going to issue a rule. And if Congress asks for the underlying  information, as Representatives of the people, that should be easily  transferrable to Congress upon request.   That is what this amendment does. This is why it should pass, and  that is what this amendment is intended to do.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate working with my  colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. We  disagree on many things, but we have good debates, and I do appreciate  the spirit in which Mr. Connolly brings this amendment forward. I enjoy  working with the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett),  and certainly our ranking member, Mr. Cummings.   I try to accept and work with the minority on all things, but  certainly amendments that they would like to see move forward.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to oppose this one. I am trying to  maximize transparency.   I think what Mr. Mitchell is bringing forward in this bill is the  right policy in opening up this transparency.   I see this going in the wrong direction. It would remove existing  requirements for agencies, such as the EPA or the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, to give notice about upcoming regulations. It  removes existing requirements, for instance, for the EPA to submit its  rules to OIRA for review.   In a March 2015 hearing, in fact, it was Mr. Connolly of Virginia who  said: ``OIRA boasts an incredibly hardworking, and dedicated corps of  career staff that is first-rate when it comes to conducting  quantitative analysis that weighs complex economic costs against  potential benefits.''   I happen to agree with Mr. Connolly. I think there are good,  hardworking, and dedicated people who are committed to this country,  and they work hard. That is why I think this hardworking, dedicated  corps of people who work as career staff should offer first-rate, as we  call it, analysis for all regulations, not just some of them. Let's do  it for all of them. I think that is fair.   We want to know that the regulations will be effective in achieving  their goals. We have to always keep sight, Mr. Chairman, that all of us  in the Federal Government work for the American people. They pay the  bills and they have to live under these regulations. We should maximize  that transparency, whether they are, quote, unquote, independent or  part of the executive agency.   If you are affected by a rule, you are affected by a rule, and people  who are affected by those have every right to see what helped create  that. So I don't think there should be an exemption that is carved out  under this bill, and that is why I stand in opposition to this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this particular  amendment. I think it takes us in the wrong direction. We need to  maximize transparency, and this will help us achieve that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
