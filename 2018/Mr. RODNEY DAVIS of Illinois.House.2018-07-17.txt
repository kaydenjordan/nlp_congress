 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and thank my friend, John Comerford, for his years of service and  leadership as president of Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois.   In his nearly 5 years as Blackburn's president, John provided  tremendous leadership and helped implement innovative policies with  tuition assistance and providing students with valuable work  experience.   Under his leadership, Blackburn College has steadily grown its  enrollment, renovated several buildings on campus, and implemented  policies that provide local students with access to college.   Under Blackburn's Macoupin Promise program, which was created last  year, high school students in Macoupin County can attend Blackburn  College for free if they meet the college's academic standards,  participate in the work program, and their household income falls below  a set threshold.   Beginning this month, John will be moving to Otterbein University in  Ohio, where he will serve as president. I wish John nothing but the  best in the future and thank him for his leadership, feedback, and,  most of all, his friendship.                            ____________________
