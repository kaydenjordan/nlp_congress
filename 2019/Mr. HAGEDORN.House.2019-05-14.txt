 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Communist Government of  Cuba announced that it is launching widespread rationing of food due to  the grave economic crisis in their country.   Unlike citizens of Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, and countless other  nations, Americans know their grocery store shelves will be filled  every day with an abundant supply of quality products at affordable  prices, and that is thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of America's  farmers and agribusinesses.   For Americans who lack the means to put food on the table, our  taxpayers generously provide hundreds of billions of dollars for food  stamps and other welfare benefits. Private entities such as churches  and nonprofit food banks rely on the voluntary generosity of their  members.   Yet it all starts with the supply of food. We could have fistfuls of  $100 bills and EBT cards, but that wouldn't matter if the grocery store  shelves were bare.   As Americans, we must always celebrate our system of free enterprise  and our incredible agricultural producers. We are, indeed, the envy of  the world.                            ____________________
