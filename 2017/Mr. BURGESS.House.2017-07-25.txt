 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B  Improvement Act of 2017.   This bill represents a series of bipartisan reforms from the  Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means that will provide  targeted reforms to improve access to care for Medicare beneficiaries.   Home infusion patients are oftentimes our Nation's sickest and most  vulnerable, and maintaining access to these services in home settings  has proved invaluable in ensuring that patients can continue to  effectively receive the care that they need.   Under last year's 21st Century Cures Act, we took the necessary steps  to ensure that taxpayers and beneficiaries were no longer overcharged  on the acquisition and dispensing costs associated with home infusion.  Additionally, we took complementary steps to recognize the unique  education needs associated with receiving infusion in the home.   However, as my subcommittee learned in a hearing on this issue just  last week, there is still more that must be done to integrate these two  policies without jeopardizing access to patient care. Therefore,  today's bill creates a bridge to connect these critical policies and to  resolve the issue.   Additionally, H.R. 3178 takes an additional needed step to protect  home health services by expanding opportunities for individuals to  receive home dialysis. Access to services like home infusion and home  dialysis has had a significant impact in my home State of Texas, and I  am encouraged by today's bill, as it will build upon these additional  successes for Texans and all Americans.   I would like to thank Chairman Brady, Chairman Tiberi, and Chairman  Walden for their leadership on the bill. They rose to the challenge to  address these tough policy decisions. This bill is a product of their  hard work, as well as the hard work of all the staff involved at the  subcommittee and full committee level, and I thank them as well.
