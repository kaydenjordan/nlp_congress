 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the homecoming of  World War II Private Andrew Ladner, whose remains finally came home 80  years after being killed in action.   Private Ladner was assigned to the 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd  Infantry Division. On November 30, 1942, during a blockade to prevent a  Japanese assault on the island of New Guinea, he was killed during the  initial wave and was reportedly buried 26 yards west of the road the  unit was blockading.   After the war, his remains could not be found and eventually were  declared nonrecoverable. However, between a little luck and the never- quit Army attitude and exhaustive research, they located his remains in  2016.   Now Private Ladner can be laid to rest in a way he deserves. I know  his family takes comfort in his example of a life well lived and the  legacy he left behind all those years ago.   Private Ladner was part of the Greatest Generation of Americans. His  family can find solace in knowing his legacy will never die but lives  on with every American who puts on the uniform of the United States  military.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Mississippi, we  honor the memory of Private Andrew Ladner, who gave his life for his  family and the country he so dearly loved.   Private Ladner, may you rest in peace. God bless you, and Semper  Fidelis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.
