 Mr. Speaker, we are in week 2 of this 115th  Congress, and, as promised, my colleagues and I are here to stand up  for this good Nation. Unfortunately, House Republicans cannot say the  same.   Last night, they decided that nursing home coverage for millions of  seniors, comprehensive health care for young children, and the benefits  earned after a lifetime of hard work are not worth fighting for. That  is exactly why the gentleman from Wisconsin offered an amendment to  ensure that the budget resolution being considered today could not be  used to cut benefits from three critically important programs:  Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.   In fact, the President-elect promised many times that he would  neither cut Social Security benefits for seniors nor would he support  cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. But the rule under consideration this  morning fails to allow a debate or vote on this amendment, which places  the earned benefits and the financial future of American people at  risk.   Who are my Republican colleagues looking out for? Certainly not their  constituents.   It is clear that we are faced with a Republican-controlled Congress  that is ensuring the divided and self-serving rhetoric that echoed  throughout this campaign season rings true. This is not democracy. This  is not outlined in our Constitution. This is not the democracy we are  sworn to protect.   With that, I urge my colleagues to reject this rule.
