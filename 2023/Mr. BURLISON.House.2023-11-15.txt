 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  the legacy of William Jung, III, of Springfield, Missouri. Bill was  born in Overland Park, Kansas, on May 24, 1941, and passed away in  Springfield, Missouri, on October 17, 2023.   He is survived by his wife, Ramona, and their 9 children, 36  grandchildren, and 41 great-grandchildren.   He is also survived by two sisters and a host of friends and  relatives.   Bill was passionate about life and his love for the Lord. He was  involved in many civic and religious organizations serving wherever he  could.   Bill had a passion for traveling and adventure. He and his wife  visited more than 30 countries, including a cherished trip to Israel.  He was always game for any adventure that came his way.   Madam Speaker, Bill was a dear friend of mine. His smile and warm  personality will be greatly missed by me, his many friends, and his  wonderful family.                            ____________________
