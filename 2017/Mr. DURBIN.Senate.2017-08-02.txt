 Mr. President, many times over the last 6 months, I have  come to the Senate to speak out on issues and to disagree with  President Trump. It is clear that we have very profound political  differences when it comes to the issues that face us, but I come to the  floor this morning in an unusual position to express my gratitude to  President Trump for a position he has taken, which I think is the right  position for America.   Let me explain. Five years ago, President Barack Obama created the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. It  enabled approximately 790,000 talented young people to contribute more  fully to this country. They are teachers, nurses, engineers, small  business owners, and more. DACA, which was an Executive action by  President Obama, provides a temporary legal status to immigrant  students who arrived in the United States as infants, toddlers, and  children. They have to come forward under this Executive action and  register with our government. They have to pay a substantial fee for  processing. Then they have to submit themselves to a criminal and  national security background check. If they are successful, they are  given 2 years of temporary relief from deportation.   This program is based on the Dream Act, a bill that I first  introduced in the U.S. Senate 16 years ago--in 2001. That bill would  give undocumented students who grew up in this country a chance to  become legal and to earn their way to citizenship.   These young people have come to be known as Dreamers. They came to  the United States under the age of 16, some of them 1 or 2 years old.  They grew up in the United States, going to our public schools, singing  the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' pledging allegiance to the only flag they  have ever known, the American flag. They are American in every way  except for their immigration status. We have already invested in them,  as you can tell--invested in their education, bringing them up in  American schools. I can't believe it makes any sense for the future of  our country to squander their talents by deporting them to countries  that many of them have never known.   A recent study by the Center for American Progress finds that ending  DACA, President Obama's Executive action, would cost our economy at  least $433 billion in gross domestic product over the next 10 years.  The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that the 1.3  million young people eligible for DACA pay $2 billion each year in  State and local taxes.   As I said at the beginning, I have had many differences with  President Trump, particularly on the issue of immigration in some of  the speeches and statements he has made, but I do appreciate-- personally appreciate--that this President has kept the DACA Program in  place.   I have spoken directly to President Trump only two times--three  times, perhaps. The first two times--one on Inauguration Day--I thanked  him for the kind words he had said about Dreamers and the DACA students  and those protected by the President's Executive action.   President Trump said to me: Don't worry about those kids.   Well, Mr. President, I continue to worry about those kids. I worry  about them now more than ever, not because I have heard any change of  heart or reversal from you but because of other circumstances that are  bringing this issue to a head. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton,  and nine other States have threatened to sue you, Mr. President, unless  by September 5 you rescind the memorandum that established DACA by  President Obama and announce that your administration will not renew or  issue any new DACA permits. This direct, specific threat to the DACA  Program has left hundreds of thousands of these Dreamers anxious,  concerned, and worried about their future.   Last week I was joined by Senator Chuck Schumer, our Democratic  leader, and 40 other Senate Democratic colleagues in writing a letter  to President Trump, asking him to order his Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions, to use all legal options to defend DACA so that these young  people can continue to contribute to a country they love.   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle oppose the DACA  Program. To them I say: If you don't support DACA, let's immediately  pass the bipartisan Dream Act. If you think President Obama went beyond  his Presidential authority with this Executive action, then let's take  up this matter where it should be taken up, here in the legislative  branch of the government in the U.S. Senate.   I recently reintroduced the Dream Act with my friend and colleague,  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Now that I am in the mood of thanking  Republican leaders, including President Trump, let me thank Senator  Lindsey Graham, as well as Senator Jeff Flake and Senator Lisa  Murkowski. They have stepped forward to join me in cosponsoring this  Dream Act.   Our government should give these young people a chance to earn their  way to citizenship. They were brought to this country as children. They  didn't make the family decision to cross the border. They have been  raised in this country. They have created no problems in terms of  criminal background.  [[Page S4701]]  They have gone to our schools. All they are asking for is a chance.   When we introduced the Dream Act a week or so ago, Senator Graham  said that the young people who have received DACA should be treated  fairly and not have the rug pulled out from under them. Lindsey Graham  is right.   Over the years, I have come to the floor nearly 100 times to tell the  stories of these Dreamers and to make it personal so that we come to  know who they are and why I have taken the time to make this a major  part of my service in the Senate. These stories put a human face on the  DACA Program and on the Dream Act. They show what immigration actually  means to our country in real terms.   This is Juan Martinez. When he was less than 2 years old, Juan was  brought to America from Mexico. He grew up in Dallas, TX, with his  parents and brothers. He was an honor student in high school. He  graduated and was valedictorian of his class with a 3.9 GPA, a member  of the National Honor Society, an active member of the debate team, and  in student government.    He was an accomplished student, but he was also a very active  community volunteer. Juan helped organize food drives at the local food  banks, he cared for children at recreation centers while their parents  worked, and he volunteered in soup kitchens.   In his senior year of high school, he applied to his dream school-- once my dream school--Georgetown University, and he was accepted. As a  college student, Juan has studied international politics, concentrating  on security, minoring in the Arabic language. In his first year of  college, Juan was elected as a student senator.   In his spare time here in Washington, he mentors disadvantaged high  school students so that they can apply successfully for college. His  dream one day is to work for our government, to help our country--the  country that he calls home--and to make the world a safer place.   Juan sent me a letter, and this is what he said:         Thanks to DACA I can focus on my studies without worrying       that it may all be taken away from me any second. I have       always thought of myself as an American, but it is thanks to       DACA that I can begin to truly feel like one, too. And that       feeling is something I am thankful for every single day.    Juan and other Dreamers have so much to contribute to this country.  But without DACA, without a similar protection, Juan could be deported  back to Mexico, a country where he hasn't been since he was 2 years  old.   Would we be a stronger nation if we lost Juan Martinez--if he were  deported? I don't think so. I think the answer is clearly no.   When we introduced the Dream Act last week, Senator Lindsey Graham  said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.''   I would say to the President first: Again, thank you. Thank you for  allowing DACA to continue under your administration. Thank you for  keeping your word to me and so many others when you said that these  young people don't have to worry. But we are reaching a moment, Mr.  President, when we have to come together and do something. We need you  and you need us so that we can pass important legislation and you can  sign it--legislation that will give these young people the protection  they deserve, the opportunity they seek, the chance to make America a  greater nation.   I know the reality of this issue. I know it from both political  sides. I witnessed it for over a decade. I know it is not popular, Mr.  President, that you have taken this position, to stand behind the  Dreamers and those protected by DACA, but you told me that you thought  it was the right thing to do, and I am sure you still feel that way.   Your new Chief of Staff, General Kelly, and I have had many  conversations about this, and I believe that he, too, thinks that  legislation is necessary to protect these young people. I hope we can  come together. I stand ready. Senator Graham stands ready. We have a  bipartisan coalition prepared to work with you.   Let's not let this decision be made in a courtroom somewhere far from  Washington. Let's take on our responsibility, yours as President and  ours in the Senate, to address this critical issue that really cries  out for justice. This is the time to do it. The concern, anxiety, and  stress is higher than ever among these populations of people affected  by DACA and the Dream Act and, of course, their families as well. I  hope you will join us in creating a legal option that will defend the  DACA Program and will work with us in Congress to make the Dream Act  the law of the land so that we can say to young people like Juan  Martinez and hundreds of thousands of others: Yes, we will give you  your chance--give you your chance to prove that you can become a  valuable part of America's future, give you a chance to make America a  stronger nation. That is all they have asked for, and that is something  we, on a bipartisan basis with the President, should give them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is  unanimously passing the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational  Assistance Act of 2017, known as the Forever GI Bill, which would make  important improvements to the GI bill.   The bill removes time restrictions on using the GI bill, enabling  future recipients to use benefits their entire lives as opposed to  within the current 15-year timeline. It provides 100 percent GI bill  eligibility to Purple Heart recipients. It also increases GI bill  funding for Reservists, Guardsmen, dependents, surviving spouses, and  surviving dependents.   While the bill includes many provisions I support, I also have  ongoing concerns about institutions of higher education, especially  for-profit colleges, which prey on veterans using GI bill benefits. I  do not believe this bill goes far enough to provide the type of  protections we owe to our servicemembers and the kind of institutional  accountability that taxpayers deserve.   I am particularly concerned that the Forever GI Bill does not address  the 90/10 loophole which incentivizes for-profit colleges to  aggressively recruit and prey on veterans. Under current law, for- profit colleges are prohibited from receiving more than 90 percent of  their revenue from Federal taxpayers, but due to a loophole in the law,  such revenue does not count Department of Veterans Affairs GI bill or  Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funding. This means that, by  targeting veterans and servicemembers, for-profit colleges can actually  receive 100 percent of their revenue directly from Federal taxpayers.   And many do. According to data released by the Department of  Education in 2016, 193 institutions received more than 90 percent of  their revenue from Federal taxpayers when Department of Education,  Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense funds were  counted together.   I have long called for this loophole to be corrected and for the  percentage of Federal revenue to be returned to the original 85  percent. I will soon reintroduce legislation, the Protecting Students  and Taxpayers, POST, Act, to address this issue.   While not addressed in the Forever GI Bill we are passing today, I  look forward to working with my colleagues--including Senator Carper  who has authored another bill on this topic which I support--veterans  service organizations, and others to consider this and other important  accountability concerns.
