 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the President just announced that the  United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The President  says he wants a better deal. So do a lot of us. The fact is, we need to  keep pressure on Iran with additional economic sanctions that will stop  it from developing ICBM missiles. That was not part of the Iran nuclear  agreement. We need to ratchet up the pressure on Iran in order to stop  its ICBM missile program.   Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal is a tragic mistake. It will  divide us from our European allies, and it will allow Iran to build a  nuclear weapon--a nuclear bomb--within a year, as compared to 7 to 12  years in the future if we stay in the agreement. I think keeping an  atomic weapon out of a radical religious outfit like Iran, headed by an  Ayatolla, is clearly in the free world's interest. Certainly, it is for  the free world. Clearly, it is for the United States, as it is for all  of our allies. That is why the United States had such broad support in  an agreement that Iran not build a nuclear weapon. Pulling out of this  agreement risks all of the unprecedented restrictions on Iran's nuclear  program that are in place right now--the hundreds of visits by the  IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its ability to get in  behind locked doors. Before this agreement, we never had that kind of  insight into Iran. Now is the time to continue ramping up the pressure  on Iran, not to back off, as pulling out of the agreement will cause us  to do.   First things first, let's keep restrictions on Iran's nuclear  program--the lessened enriched uranium, the complete cementing over of  the plutonium plant, the ability to inspect and verify. Then what we  ought to be doing is doubling down on Iran's ballistic missile program,  on its regional aggression, on its support for terror, and on its human  [[Page S2542]]  rights violations. It was the tough U.S. and international sanctions  that brought Iran to the table in the first place, and it was we in  this Congress who enacted many of those economic sanctions.   To sum up, we need to put more pressure on Iran with additional  economic sanctions to stop it from developing its ICBM missiles, and  pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement now is a tragic mistake. It  will divide us from our European allies, and it will cause Iran to  build a nuclear bomb within a year instead of preventing it from  building one for at least 7 to 12 years. That seems, to me, to be a  choice that we made at the time we entered this agreement. It seems to  be all the more clear today that we ought to continue the agreement.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today marks a special day. It is  the 10th anniversary of the designation of the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse  Outstanding Natural Area. This 120-acre site in Palm Beach County, FL,  contains invaluable historic and cultural resources, including an  archaeological record showing continuous Native American settlement  dating back 5,000 years.   Every year, tens of thousands of visitors enjoy tours of the restored  1860 Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse and historical grounds, which include the  1892 George Washington Tindall House.   The Federal designation also protects the area's rich natural  environment along the Indian River Lagoon, which provides habitat for  over two dozen State or federally listed species, from the West Indian  manatee to the Florida scrub jay.   A decade ago, I filed legislation to protect this special area, and  on May 8, 2008, President George W. Bush signed it into law, Public Law  110-229. To this day, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural  Area remains the only unit of the 34-million-acre National Landscape  Conservation System east of the Mississippi River.   I would like to commend the many partners who help the Department of  the Interior take care of this heritage landmark, including the  Loxahatchee River Historical Society, Palm Beach County, the town of  Jupiter, the village of Tequesta, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Together,  we have ensured this area will be preserved for future  generations.                            ____________________
