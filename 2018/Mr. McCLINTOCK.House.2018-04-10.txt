 Mr. Speaker, James Madison, the father of the  American Constitution, said that its most important provision was given  to the Congress, and not the President, the authority to declare war.   This is central to the separation of powers. Congress can declare  war, but cannot wage it; the President can wage war, but cannot declare  it.   This bright line has been badly blurred over the years, but that  doesn't change its clarity and importance. The Constitutional  Convention was clear that the President's inherent authority as  Commander in Chief was solely to repulse an attack against this country  until the Congress could convene.   The Syrian crisis presents no such exception.   If it can be proven that the recent use of gas against the civilian  population was initiated by the Assad regime, well, then supplying arms  and material to the Syrian opposition, economic sanctions, and other  nonmilitary responses are appropriate, but any military action against  Syria first requires a congressional declaration, period.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to ask ourselves  how legislation is actually doing once it has passed; and 4 months  after tax reform, I think it is time to reflect on that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for  organizing this time tonight.    In my California district, the average family is paying $1,900 less  Federal income tax this coming year. That means 1,900 more dollars that  they can spend to meet their own needs.   I want to urge everyone to visit a website called  taxplancalculator.com. There, you can put your own tax numbers in and  calculate how your family will fare under the new tax law this year.  Everyone I have directed to taxplancalculator.com has come back happily  surprised.   But the real importance of tax reform is expanding our overall  economy. That is the rising tide that lifts all boats.   One provision of the measure allowed companies to write off the full  cost of equipment purchases when they make the purchase. But what does  that mean in real life?   Well, Ken Steers is president of Freight Solution Providers, a local  shipping company in my district that provides worldwide transportation  logistics for businesses large and small. He tells me that since the  tax reform took effect, his shipping orders for manufacturing equipment  have gone through the roof and haven't let up.   Before the tax reform, our corporate tax rate was 35 percent, the  highest in the industrialized world. We reduced it to 21 percent.   Aslam Malik is CEO of AMPAC Fine Chemicals in Sacramento and El  Dorado Counties. They produce the active ingredient in several cancer  and epilepsy drugs. He said they could outcompete their European  competitors in terms of quality and technology and service, but many  customers told him that even if their product was free, the American  tax made AMPAC noncompetitive. Well, I checked back with Aslam this  week. They have already added $2 million to their budget for expansion  because, literally, a whole new world of business opportunities has  opened up for them.   Now, the left says this is just tax relief for the rich. Obviously,  they don't understand that this is precisely what produces higher pay,  better jobs, greater opportunities, and stronger financial security for  every American.   I attended the Oakhurst Rotary Club last week. They have a tradition  of donating dollars to the club as they report good news in their own  lives.   One Rotarian had been out of work for nearly 2 years. He was on the  verge of despair. With tears in his eyes, he announced to the group  that he had just landed his dream job with Pfizer pharmaceuticals and  that he would now be able to keep his home and stay in the town that he  loved. Relief was written all over his face.   To be sure, our economy still faces many threats--trade wars, bad  monetary policy, runaway Federal spending--but, clearly, the tax reform  is working. From what people are telling me, if it isn't yet morning  again in America, it is at least a new dawn.
