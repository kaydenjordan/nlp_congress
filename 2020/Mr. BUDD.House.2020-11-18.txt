 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm that House  Democrats are considering a rule change that would severely limit the  rights of the minority party in the House for years to come.   I am referring to the partisan push to water down or to eliminate the  motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, the MTR, as it is called, is a critical procedural tool  that gives the minority party one last opportunity to improve  legislation before a final vote on this House floor. An MTR not only  increases transparency between Members of Congress and their  constituents, but it holds Members accountable and forces them to go on  record for viewpoints that they hold.   Weakening the MTR would only serve to shield Members from criticism,  suffocate debate on key policy issues, and overturn longstanding House  precedent. It would be a blatant power grab by the majority Democrat  Party.   That is why my colleagues and I will be appealing to the Rules  Committee this week in writing, demanding that the MTR be preserved.                           Confronting Voter Fraud     Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 weeks, I have heard from an  overwhelming number of my constituents, and they do not have confidence  in the integrity of November's election.   They are outraged that media pundits and establishment Democrat  politicians are sneering at the very concept of taking the time to  ensure that every legal vote is counted and that every illegal vote is  thrown out.   Every citizen has a right to seek justice in a court of law, and that  includes the President of the United States. His legal team needs to be  given the time to collect and present evidence of voting and tabulation  irregularities.   Until the courts have played their constitutional role, we should be  wary of declaring winners and losers.   Look, if we could spend 2 years investigating conspiracy theories  about Russian collusion, we should be able to take a few weeks to  confirm the integrity of this election.   I am glad that Attorney General Bill Barr authorized the Department  of Justice to investigate any and all allegations of illegal activity.  He took this necessary step after 38 of my House colleagues and I  requested that the Department leave no stone unturned in this effort.   We will also be introducing legislation this very week that will  require the DOJ to create a national strategy to identify and combat  voter intimidation, fraud, ballot system glitches, sabotage, and  hacking.   Mr. Speaker, voting is the most sacred civic duty in our Nation. In  an election for our Nation's highest office, involving unprecedented  levels of mail-in voting, we must take the time to ensure that every  legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not counted.   Nothing is more important than the integrity of our ballots.  [[Page H5873]]                                ____________________
