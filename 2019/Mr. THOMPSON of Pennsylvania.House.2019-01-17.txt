 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Ridgway Area High School for being named a National Blue  Ribbon School.   Since 1982, the U.S. Department of Education has identified and  celebrated excellence in education through the Blue Ribbon Award.   Ridgway Area High School's tradition of academic excellence is a  testament to this rural community's dedication to the importance of  education. Like many small communities, the high school serves as a  central hub in Ridgway. Faculty and staff work diligently to help each  student reach their fullest potential.   Ridgway Area High School knows that families and community  stakeholders are vital to the educational mission. They strongly value  the idea that students who are involved in teams, groups, and community  service  [[Page H682]]  initiatives are those who grow habits of engagement that lead to  productive citizenship. All graduating seniors are required to have  completed 50 hours of community service in local nonprofit  organizations in the Ridgway community in an effort to instill in all  students a sense of service above self.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate Ridgway Area High School  on this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
