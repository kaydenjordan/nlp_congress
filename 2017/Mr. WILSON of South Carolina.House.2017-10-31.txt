 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  the statewide consortium of ten institutions of higher education in  South Carolina for receiving a 5-year Research Infrastructure  Improvement Track-1 grant from the National Science Foundation's  Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. This grant led  to the creation of the Materials, Assembly, and Design Excellence in  South Carolina initiative--or MADE in South Carolina--to create jobs.   This grant encourages small businesses to grow by providing seed  money through the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business  Technology Transfer awards to businesses and materials-related  projects. This consortium will further foster research and development  in the State by focusing on advanced materials discovery and  optimization efforts that are in high demand. MADE in South Carolina  will boost the manufacturing and materials science workforce by adding  new undergraduate degree programs and expanding current coursework,  which will provide and increase the skilled-labor workforce.   As a proponent of creating jobs and encouraging manufacturing across  South Carolina, I look forward to seeing these higher education  institutions utilizing the grant to stimulate small business growth,  jobs, and valuable research.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank  Congressman Rick Crawford for his leadership today.   I am grateful to sponsor and support the South Carolina Peanut Parity  Act of 2017, H.R. 2521. This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by all  seven Members of the South Carolina delegation. It gives the hard- working peanut farmers of South Carolina a voice and say on the United  States Department of Agriculture Peanut Standards Board. South Carolina  is fortunate to have Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers from Bowman  for his leadership.   When the 2002 farm bill created the USDA Peanut Standards Board to  advise on standards for the handling and quality of peanuts, South  Carolina was not a substantial peanut grower. Since then, South  Carolina peanut production has increased significantly, as it now  produces 8 percent of the United States peanut crop, making the  Palmetto State the fourth largest peanut-producing State.   As I have said before, South Carolina appreciates peanuts so much  that the State legislature has selected the boiled peanut as the  State's official snack. Each year, I look forward to the Pelion Peanut  Party festival which celebrates the importance of peanuts which is held  in Pelion, South Carolina, led by Mayor Barbara Carey.   The midlands of South Carolina is fortunate to have enterprising  entrepreneurs promoting boiled peanuts with Four Oaks Farm of Lexington  owned by the Mathias family and the appreciated Cromer's peanuts of  Columbia, heralded as ``guaranteed worst in town.'' That is actually  meant as a compliment.    My South Carolina colleagues and I are grateful to acknowledge the  significant increase in the peanut crops in the State and to advocate  for the increase to be reflected on the Peanut Standards Board. We look  forward to encouraging peanut farmers in South Carolina creating jobs  and having their valuable input reflected on the national level.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support today of H.R. 2521.
