 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Danny Weiss for  his service to Speaker Pelosi, to our House Democratic Caucus, and to  our country.   Danny is one of the many staff members who has worked tirelessly for  the people's House. He has never viewed his service on Capitol Hill as  a temporary stint. This was his life's work and a true call to public  service.   Most recently, as the Speaker said, I worked with Danny during my  tenure as co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications  Committee during the last session of Congress.   As then-Leader Pelosi's chief of staff, Danny helped our Caucus  develop our For the People agenda to clean up corruption in Washington,  lower healthcare costs, and rebuild our country through investments in  our infrastructure. Developing this agenda was no easy task, and as  anybody like Danny knows, it is just as hard to keep Members of  Congress on message--I thought that was funny--but Danny tried his  hardest.   With Danny's efforts and with his persistence, we were successful and  gained a historic majority and a record number of women in the 116th  session of Congress. To say that Danny was instrumental in our efforts  would be an understatement.   His career will also be defined by his undying belief that this body  and each and every one of us can make a difference in the lives of the  people whom we serve. Danny knows that even amid the chaos and the  sensational headlines, we all have the power to be a force of good in  this world.   I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Danny Weiss for not  just his years of service, but for always keeping his eye on the prize  and on the purpose and for his dedication to this institution.
