 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Green for  yielding. I thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership on this bill.   For far too long, consumers and businesses in the underserved  communities have been blocked from accessing safe and affordable  capital and credit. These systemic barriers worsen racial and economic  inequality and cut off opportunity for too many Americans.   This critical bill recognizes these changes and supports efforts to  eliminate racial disparities in lending.   My amendment is simple. It requires the Federal Reserve's ``Monetary  Policy Report'' to include demographic information on individuals with  dependent children in its analysis of labor force trends.   Why is it important? Because while the unemployment rate is near  historic lows, women with children have been one of the slowest groups  to return to work. Solutions like the child tax credit and affordable  childcare would help working families better balance childcare  responsibilities and their careers. This amendment would ensure we have  the data to understand this problem and begin to address it.   I thank Chairwoman Waters, again, for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the  underlying bill.                                time  1345
