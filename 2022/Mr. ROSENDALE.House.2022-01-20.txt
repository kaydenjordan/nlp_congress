 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Lauren  Gollofon from Bozeman, Montana. Lauren is a 17-year-old senior at  Liberty Online Academy and a former student at Bozeman High School.  When Lauren became aware that the Pledge of Allegiance was not being  said daily in public schools in Bozeman, she sprang into action. Lauren  notified school administrators that their failure to hold the Pledge of  Allegiance every day violated Montana House Bill 543, and asked that  they hold the Pledge of Allegiance daily in accordance with the State  law.   Within a week of her advocacy, local schools began to recite the  Pledge of Allegiance daily. When asked why this was so important,  Lauren said patriotism is on the decline in the United States. When  students say the Pledge of Allegiance, they are acknowledging the  freedom and the values and also everyone who has died and fought for  our country.   This display of patriotism demonstrates why a report just this year  found that Montana is one of the most patriotic States in the Nation, a  ranking which we are extremely proud of.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all Montanans, I want to sincerely thank  Lauren Gollofon for her leadership, community activism, and her  dedication to the core principles that make this country great.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being a leading  example on this charge for us.   Tomorrow will be a unique and significant day. Tomorrow many of us  will take the unfortunately similar steps of a march that began in  1974. This March for Life however may be the last one before the stain  of Roe v. Wade is lifted from this Nation.   However, even if we are so fortunate, the decision to continue this  crime will likely remain in many of the States.   Sadly, millions of Americans have yet to awaken, awaken to the  cruelty and the evil that is abortion. The reason for this slumber is  no less devastating than the murder of 63 million children. It is the  failure to recognize the inherent dignity of every life. This failure  has justified the intentional killing of a living child, led to the  many atrocities of the 21st century and this American tragedy. We,  however, are not reconciled to continue this moral failing.   I often think about the abortionist who has woken up to the evil  which he has been so complicit in. That moment when his heart converts,  when he has been availed of the truth inherent in human life. He looks  back at the trail of broken bodies that he has traveled.   But if we stop there at the horror and the tragedy, we would not have  hope because we know that when he looks up he now sees those glorified  souls looking down on him, singing in praise and rejoicing in his  conversion.                                time  1315    There is renewal in our movement, and there is hope. There is the  hopeful anticipation that everyone in every State will also see the  obvious truth and the inherent beauty in the tiniest life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for including me in this Special  Order today.
