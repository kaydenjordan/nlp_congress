 Mr. Speaker, let me see if I can inject some truth into  this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the deficit-exploding Republican tax  plan that rewards billionaires first, and then asks hardworking  Americans to pay for it.   The Trump Republican tax scam will raise taxes for millions of  working families. It will kill jobs in the home construction industry.  It will punish student loan borrowers. This reckless plan will repeal  the deduction for State and local income and sales tax. I would remind  my colleagues in the majority: If you vote ``yes,'' you are voting for  a $900 billion tax increase on American families.   This bill is not conservative. It is not pro-family. It is not pro- worker. It will kill jobs and reward the wealthy and corporations at  the expense of everyone else.   Vote ``no'' on the GOP tax scam, and let's pass a real tax reform  bill that puts middle class families first.                            ____________________
