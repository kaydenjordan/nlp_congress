 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague, my chairman, Greg Walden, that  his vote for this bill will result in 64,300 people from his  congressional district in Oregon losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump and congressional Republicans are not  leveling with the American people when they say no one will be worse  off under this repeal bill. TrumpCare dismantles the health and  economic security that millions of hardworking Americans have gained  over the last 7 years, and it should be defeated.   There is a reason this bill was hatched up in the back rooms only to  be finalized last night, and that is because congressional Republicans  did not want the American people to see what was in it.   TrumpCare provides less coverage, fewer protections, and higher  costs.   TrumpCare is Robin Hood in reverse, taking benefits and financial  assistance from hardworking, middle class Americans and our most  vulnerable in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest and the  corporations.   TrumpCare cuts a combined $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid.  These cuts are devastating, Mr. Speaker.   TrumpCare will ration care for the 76 million Americans who rely on  Medicaid, including seniors with long-term care needs, Americans with  disabilities, pregnant women, and vulnerable children.   I fear for seniors, Mr. Speaker, those in nursing homes. When States  get less money, what will they do? They will give less money to nursing  homes. We will go back to the days that I remember in New Jersey when  nursing homes were terrible places, where there weren't enough nurses,  where there were fires because of lack of maintenance of the nursing  home.   Working families are going to pay more for less. They will see their  premiums and deductibles skyrocket. My GOP colleagues talk about high  deductibles and copays. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.   You are going to see that this repeal repeals the limits on  deductibles and copays that exist under the current law. Out-of-pocket  costs are going to go through the roof. The deductibles will go even  higher. The copays will go even higher. The out-of-pocket costs will go  even higher.    And the bottom line is Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 will  pay an age tax and be forced to pay premiums five times higher than  what younger people pay for their coverage.   I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, that is only  fair. Well, I don't think it is fair that seniors should have to pay a  lot more, that those between 50 and 64 should have to pay a lot more.   Also, TrumpCare leaves the sickest and vulnerable Americans at the  mercy of insurance companies, allowing them to charge a 30 percent  penalty or sick tax to those who are unable to maintain continuous  coverage. So if you fail to pay your insurance for a month and then you  want to get it again, even if you have a preexisting condition, which  is often the case, you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty, or sick  tax. I don't think that is very fair.   Last night, in order to garner votes from the extreme right in their  party, House Republicans added a provision that eliminates protections  for essential health benefits. Now, maybe people don't understand that,  but let me explain it.  [[Page H2416]]    The ACA ensured that, when a consumer purchased health insurance on  the individual market or gained coverage through Medicaid expansion,  their plan would cover 10 critical, essential benefits.   TrumpCare eliminates this guarantee, meaning that unscrupulous  insurance companies can sell skeletal plans, junk insurance, without  benefits for hospitalization, maternity care, mental health, drug  treatment services, and Americans won't even know what they are  getting. They won't realize that they have worthless insurance until  they get sick and it is too late.   The bottom line is this bill should be defeated for so many reasons  because so many more people will not have health insurance, because  their costs are going to go up, and because they won't even know what  insurance they are buying. We are going go to back to the old days of  the Wild West when insurance companies could sell whatever junk  insurance they want and the public won't even know what they are  getting. It is a disaster for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that, in Mr. Barton's  case, his vote for this bill will result in 64,900 people from his  congressional district in Texas losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Michigan that  his vote for this bill will result in 43,500 people from his  congressional district in Michigan losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Mississippi that  his vote for this bill will result in 69,600 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene  Green), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous. TrumpCare  will rip health insurance from 24 million Americans, almost as many  people who live in the State of Texas.   TrumpCare is a direct assault on the President's promise to the  American people. It will saddle families across the country with  massive health costs. It will lead to higher premiums, less benefits,  and more people uninsured.   Under this bill, premiums increase 15 to 20 percent in each of the  next 2 years. It will particularly be terrible for the near-elderly  Americans because TrumpCare allows insurance companies to charge them  five times higher than what others would pay for coverage. It destroys  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It guts the  essential benefits so consumers won't know what coverage they have.  Plans would not have to cover things like emergency care,  hospitalization, or even prescription drugs.   What do you do when you leave people with that? Junk plans that are  insurance in name only. What is the point of having insurance if it  doesn't cover anything?   For those who aren't one of the 24 million who lose insurance, many  will be left with plans that are more expensive but don't have to cover  things like prescription drugs or mental health and substance abuse.   This bill will make it harder for people to get treatment. It will  destroy the Medicaid program, the bedrock of our social safety net that  insures 74 million Americans, including children, pregnant women, and  one in seven seniors on Medicare.    TrumpCare harms Medicare. It will make the program insolvent 3 years  earlier, directly causes part B premiums to go up $8.7 billion, and  takes away funds that seniors depend on for long-term care. It is  impossible to overstate how terrible TrumpCare will be for the American  people.   This is a dangerous bill. It is opposed by physician groups and  hospital associations.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Kentucky that his  vote for this bill will result in 44,000 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.  DeGette).   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised his healthcare  plan would be ``much better health care at a much lower cost.''  Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price even promised ``nobody  will be  [[Page H2418]]  worse off financially.'' In reality, of course, the TrumpCare bill will  leave just about everybody worse off, with less care at a higher cost.   This bad bill would rip health insurance money away from millions of  people--24 million over 10 years, and 14 million next year alone.   Americans who are lucky enough to hold on to coverage if this bill  becomes law will pay more for it in premiums, deductibles, and other  out-of-pocket costs, especially people age 50 and up.   Mr. Speaker, the deals that were cut last night to win more  Republican votes for TrumpCare would be even more devastating. Trips to  the emergency room, mental health and substance abuse treatment,  maternity care both before and after birth, prescription drugs, lab  tests, and more essential services could be cut.   Apparently, some people don't think these services deserve guaranteed  health insurance. They would let insurers sell skimpy plans that don't  even cover patients' basic needs.   Democrats believe we can, and should, work together to improve the  ACA, not to work on a misguided bill that would gut it.   We owe this to folks like Amanda Miller of Denver. Amanda changed  jobs last year. During her period of unemployment, she and her husband  decided the smart thing to do was to get coverage to fill the gap.  Thank God they did.   Shortly after that, she and her husband got into a serious car  accident. Amanda walked away unscathed, but her husband was badly  injured. She could see more of his skull than she could see of his  scalp. Luckily, there were some nurses in a car behind them, and they  stabilized him and took him to the emergency room.   Their hospital bill of $16,000 was paid in full, thanks to Amanda's  coverage through the ACA. What do we say to Amanda? Can we guarantee  her better insurance and a better financial situation? I don't think  so.   Let's defeat this bill, and let's start working towards a good one  that will cover everybody.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Indiana that his  vote for this bill will result in 37,800 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Michael F. Doyle).   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the last 7\1/ 2\ years, Republicans have promised Americans something better than the  ACA. Instead, today, they are giving us something much worse.   Twenty-four million people lose their insurance? Stripping away  guaranteed benefits? Putting maternity, mental health, and pediatric  care at risk? Shame on you.   Pitting the elderly against children, the disabled, and the mentally  ill in the Medicaid program? Placing a tax penalty on veterans?  Charging a crushing age tax on 50- to 64-year-olds, forcing them to pay  five times more than what others pay? Shame on you.   This isn't a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut bill masquerading as  a healthcare bill. This bill does nothing to lower premiums, copays, or  deductibles.   You cut taxes by almost $1 trillion for corporations and the rich,  while ransacking Medicaid and the Medicare trust fund. That is  shameful.   Americans will not forget who did this to them today.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Texas that his  vote for this bill will result in 61,900 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Indiana that her  vote for this bill will result in 37,700 people from her congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), the vice ranking member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from New York that  his vote for this bill will result in 58,000 people from his  congressional district losing healthcare coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Michigan that  his vote for this bill will result in 39,500 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, since the implementation of the ACA, over  3.9 million women age 18 to 64 have gained health coverage through  Medicaid. The ACA ended gender rating, meaning that the insurance  companies cannot charge women more than they charge men for the same  coverage. TrumpCare also eliminates Medicaid funding for Planned  Parenthood, reducing access to health care for women. Millions of women  rely on Planned Parenthood for both routine and lifesaving care, such  as preventative services, family planning, and preventing unwanted  pregnancies. When the GPO strips Planned Parenthood funding, health  care of women will suffer.   TrumpCare and its Medicare cuts also hurts seniors. Older Americans  account for over 60 percent of Medicare spending. Insurance companies  will now be able to charge more based on their age, which will increase  premiums by thousands.   Mr. Speaker, watching Republicans sell this bill is like buying a  used car from a guy with a crooked smile, even they don't believe in  it. I ask my Republican colleagues to withdraw this horrible bill and  work with Democrats to improve the ACA instead of trying to sell this  atrocity.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Georgia that his  vote for this bill will result in 62,800 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from North Carolina  that her vote for this bill will result in 80,600 people from her  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray  Lujan).   Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, my Republican  colleagues have called TrumpCare everything from an act of mercy to a  rescue mission. Now, I might live at the end of a long dirt road, but I  didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday and neither did the American  people.   Congressional Republicans are jamming their catastrophic bill that  will take health insurance away from 24 million Americans, raise your  premiums, raise your deductibles, raise your out-of-pocket costs, and  will slap a crushing age tax on those over the age of 50.   Republicans in Congress promised they would lower costs, but this  mess raises costs on families. Not only does the CBO tell us premiums  will increase 15 to 20 percent, but TrumpCare will allow insurance  companies to increase deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.   Under the guise of State flexibility, Republicans say they are  shifting responsibilities to States. Here is what that means: TrumpCare  will force States to raise taxes and ration care. It will repeal the  requirement for insurance plans to cover doctor visits, emergency room  care, prescription drug coverage, and even mental health services.   Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.  The fact is TrumpCare will raise your premiums, raise your deductibles,  and hurt millions of hardworking families.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague from Pennsylvania  that his vote for this bill will result in 37,100 people from his  congressional district losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke).   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this sham American Health Care Act.   I am from Brooklyn, and in Brooklyn we know: Men lie; women lie; the  numbers don't. Here are the numbers:   This reckless and destructive bill leaves 24 million Americans  without coverage. It will cause the uninsured rate for my district to  skyrocket over 12 percent and leave over 400,000 Brooklynites without  coverage.   Because of age discrimination in this bill, the age tax, it will put  our seniors in the terrible position of having to choose between  eating, visiting their doctors, or purchasing medication.   Which one do you, Mr. Speaker, suggest they choose?   I also vehemently oppose the Empire State kickback language put in  this bill as an attempt to get Republican votes. This language is a  dressed up earmark that specifically targets New York City. It targets  my home.   This would further reduce Medicaid funds for New York by an  additional $2 billion. The trade-off, raising city taxes to cover the  gap.   For most Americans, Medicaid benefits are not the end goal but rather  [provides] temporary support, but for our seniors Medicaid can mean the  difference between nursing home care, family home care and dying alone.   I urge my colleagues to consider the harmful real life impact of this  legislation and to oppose it. Brooklyn Resists . . . America must  resist.  [[Page H2422]]    Thank you and I yield the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The gentleman from  New Jersey has 68 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Oregon has  65\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, what did the Chair say?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. One hour and eight minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Loebsack).    Mr. Speaker, could we just ask the total because then  maybe we can figure it out on the minority side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has provided the total time  remaining for the minority. So that is the total time we are working  back off of. The Chair will consult with the gentleman on the committee  time.   The gentleman from Oregon has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining in the Energy  and Commerce time.    What is the total time remaining currently?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. There are 67 minutes remaining for the  gentleman from New Jersey as the designee of the gentleman from  Kentucky. That is 1 hour and 7 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, Chairman Walden is completely  mischaracterizing the bill that was led by Mr. Cardenas.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is very telling that the gentleman from  Oregon has no more speakers on his side for what they claim to be a  very significant bill, and it certainly is significant; but the reason  for that, in my opinion, is because this Republican bill is hurting  real people.  [[Page H2424]]    Don't tell the real people, don't tell the Americans in my district  or the rest of the country who are coming to your doors and going to  your legislative offices and calling you by the thousands to tell you  not to pass this bill, don't tell them your answer that I hear over and  over again: Well, trust us. Trust us.   The problem is we have to look at the bill that is before us today.  This is a terrible bill. Millions of people, 24 million people, are  going to lose their insurance. Many more are going to pay a lot more  out of pocket with higher deductibles and higher copays.   And the worst part of all is you are allowing the insurance companies  to sell junk insurance that doesn't even cover their care; it doesn't  even necessarily provide any coverage.   So I ask my colleagues on the other side, think of the people. Think  about your heart. Think about what this really means. And if you look  at it, you will know that this is a bad bill and should be defeated.   Vote ``no.'' I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 24, 2017, on page H2424, the following appeared: Mr.  Speaker, I yield back the balance      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  reserve the balance    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), and I ask unanimous consent  that he be allowed to control that time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.
