 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 188 and ask  unanimous consent that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the  amendment by number.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment       numbered 188.    The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that does not                             lower drug prices)         At the end of title IV, add the following:       SEC. 4__. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT                     LOWER DRUG PRICES.         (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:        (1) Total annual drug spending in the United States is       projected to reach more than $500,000,000,000 by 2018.        (2) One out of five Americans age 19 to 64 cannot afford to       fill their prescriptions.        (3) Spending on prescription drugs in the United States       grew by 12 percent in 2014, faster than in any year since       2002.        (4) Medicare part D drug spending was $90,000,000,000 in       2015, and is expected to increase to $216,000,000,000 by       2025.        (5) Medicare part B drug spending also more than doubled       between 2005 and 2015, increasing from $9,000,000,000 in 2005       to $22,000,000,000 in 2015.        (6) In 2014, prescription drug spending in Medicaid       increased by 24 percent.        (7) During the Presidential campaign, the President-elect       said, ``When it comes time to negotiate the cost of drugs,       we're going to negotiate like crazy, folks'' and his campaign       website said that, ``allowing consumers access to imported,       safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more       options to consumers.''.        (8) After being elected, the President-elect said, ``I'm       going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what's happened       with drug prices.''.        (9) On January 11, 2017, the President-elect said, ``We       have to create new bidding procedures for the drug industry,       because they are getting away with murder.''.        (b) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate       to consider a bill or joint resolution reported pursuant to       section 2001 or 2002, or an amendment to, motion on,       conference report on, or amendment between the Houses in       relation to such a bill or joint resolution that does not, as       promised by the President-elect, lower drug prices, as       certified by the Congressional Budget Office.        (c) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (b) may be waived or       suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-      fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative       vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly       chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of       the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under       subsection (b).     Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment is supported  by a number of Senators because, as the Senate majority plows ahead  with a scheme that I call repeal and run, it is putting tens of  millions of Americans in danger of losing their health insurance, and  Americans are waiting for Congress to step up and adopt smart policies  that will drive down the cost of prescription medicine.   We understand this is an era of miracle cures and treatments. There  are drugs on the market today that were science fiction not very long  ago. With drug prices rising, the question is whether Americans are  going to be able to afford them. This is a growing source of  inequality, and it cannot go unchecked.   Here is my bottom line.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    In a country as rich and strong as ours, cures have to be  available for everyone, not just the wealthy.   I urge support for this amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of  that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam Clerk, because health care--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate is not allowed during a vote.   The Senate will be in order.   --should not just be for the healthy and wealthy, I vote  no.   --should not just be for the healthy and wealthy, I vote  no.
