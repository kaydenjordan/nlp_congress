 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Gardner is  for counsel to the President:         Arguments have been made that any assertion of protection       from disclosure is indicative of guilt and that the House's       assertion of Impeachment power cannot be questioned by the       Executive. Is that interpretation of the House's Impeachment       power consistent with the Constitution, and what protects the       Executive from the House abusing the Impeachment power in the       future?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  that question.   The House managers' assertion that any effort to assert a privilege  or assert a legal immunity to decline disclosing information is somehow  a sign of guilt is not the law. It is, actually, fundamentally contrary  to the law.   Legal privileges exist for a reason. We allow people to assert their  rights. It is a basic part of the American justice system. Asserting  your rights--asserting privileges and immunities to process rights even  if it means limiting the information that might be turned over to a  tribunal--is not and cannot be treated as evidence of guilt.   To the second part of the question, as to the House managers' theory  that the power of impeachment means that the President can't resist any  subpoena that they issue pursuant to the power of impeachment, it is  not consistent with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the House  the sole power of impeachment, which means only that the House is the  only place--the only part of the government--that has that power. It  doesn't say that they have a paramount power of impeachment that  destroys all other constitutional rights or privileges or immunities.  It doesn't mean that executive privilege suddenly disappears.   The House managers a number of times have cited Nixon v. United  States or--I might get it reversed now--United States v. Nixon. It was  the case involving the President in 1974. The Supreme Court determined  that, in that particular case, after a balancing of interests,  assertions of executive privilege would have to give way, but it did  not say that there was just an absolute, blanket rule that anytime  there is an allegation of wrongdoing or that there is an impeachment  going on in the background, that executive privilege just disappears.  That is not the rule from that case. In fact, even in that context, the  Court pointed out that there may be an absolute immunity or privilege  in the field of foreign relations and national security, which is the  field we are dealing with here.   The Framers recognized that there could be partisan and illegitimate  impeachments. They recognized that the House could impeach for the  wrong reasons, but they didn't leave the executive branch totally  defenseless to that. Executive privilege and immunities rooted in  executive privilege, such as the absolute immunity for senior advisers,  still applies even in the context of an impeachment. That is part of  the checks and balances in the Constitution. They don't fall away  simply because the House says: Ah, now we want to proceed on  impeachment.   It is necessary for the proper functioning of the government and the  separation of powers for the executive branch to retain that ability to  protect confidentiality interests, to protect the prerogatives of the  Office of the Presidency. For any President to fail to assert those  rights and to protect them would do lasting damage to the Office of the  Presidency for the future.   I think that is a critical point to understand in that there is a  danger in the legal theory that the House managers are proposing here  because it would do lasting damage to the separation of powers--to the  structure of our government--to have the idea be that, as soon as the  House flips the switch that they want to start proceeding on  impeachment, the executive has no defenses and has to open every file  and display everything. That is not the way the Framers had it in mind,  because the executive branch has to have still its defenses for its  sphere of authority under the Constitution. That is part of the checks  and balances.   And before I sit down, I would just like to close by going back to  the Senator who asked the question about the review process in the  Bolton book. I believe I was clear about this, but I just want to make  100 percent sure to the extent the Senator was asking for an assurance  that only career officials in the NSC review it for classification  review.   I can't make that assurance because it is an NSC process, and I am  not sure. At the levels of the process, there might be other reviews.  So I didn't intend to give and I don't want it to be  [[Page S679]]  understood as giving that assurance to you.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Massachusetts.
