 Madam Speaker, we know it is expensive to be poor in our  country; that we live in a country with a system that continues to put  profit before our people, and it must stop.   In my home State of Michigan, communities that are more than a  quarter Black and Latino have 50 percent more payday lenders than  anywhere else in the State. These lenders target our communities, the  most financially vulnerable communities. Payday lenders in Michigan are  62 percent more common in low-income Census tracts compared to  statewide average.   That is what folks mean when they say that we need to abolish  structural racism in our country.   You cannot justify loans of 100 percent APR or higher as providing  access to credit when they trap borrowers in destructive cycles of debt  and ruin their credit. World Business Lenders offered loans of upwards  of 268 percent of APR, despite the fact that its rent-a-bank partner  was regulated by the OCC. They found a way around the rules, and that  is unacceptable.   OCC's rules leave States like our State of Michigan no ability to  enforce their own State rate caps, giving predatory lenders free rein  to exploit our neighbors with outrageous APRs.   Repealing the true lender rule is the first step toward protecting  borrowers from predatory lenders, and I am proud to support it.
