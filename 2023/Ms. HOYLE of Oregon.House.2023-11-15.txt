 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the memory of Chief Donald ``Doc'' Slyter, a revered leader of  the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians.   Chief Slyter's life was a testimony to his unwavering commitment to  his people and the cherished land he called home.   For 39 years following the Tribe's recognition, Chief Slyter stood as  a guardian of their resurgence, nurturing hope for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, may his spirit and memory leave a legacy of resilience  and hope, leaving an indelible mark on the community that he cherished.   During his tenure with the Tribal Council and as chief, he tirelessly  advocated for the restoration of lands, water, fish, and wildlife.   Chief Slyter's passing is a profound loss, not only to his family but  to all members of the CTCLUSI Tribe, the Oregon community, and beyond.   As we mourn his passing, let us remember his spirit, his commitment  to community, his kinship, and his enduring legacy of hope and  resilience. My thoughts are with Chief Slyter's family and all those  touched by his remarkable life.   Mr. Speaker, may his memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
