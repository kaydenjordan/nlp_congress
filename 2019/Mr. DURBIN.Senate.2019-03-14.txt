 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last month, I launched a new series of  floor speeches to recognize what is going on with prescription drug  pricing across America.   When you ask the American people about the economic things that are  on their minds, it is No. 1--the cost of prescription drugs. No. 2 is,  have I saved enough money for my retirement? It really gets to the  heart of the concerns families have every day. Each one of us knows  that the cost of prescription drugs is going up, and we also realize  how vulnerable we may be as individuals if one of those drugs is a  matter of life and death.   I came to the floor 2 weeks ago to talk about the cost of insulin.  Seven and a half million diabetics across America have seen dramatic  increases in the cost of insulin--increases that can't be justified  because the same American companies selling the same drugs in Canada do  it for a fraction of the cost. Americans pay outrageous prices.   Humalog, which is one of the most popular forms of insulin, costs  $329 a dosage in the United States. Twenty years ago, it was about $29.  It has gone up in price 35 times in that 20-year period of time. How  much does the exact same drug that costs $329 in the United States cost  in Canada? It is made by the same company. Thirty-eight dollars. You  look at that and you think there is something wrong here. The  pharmaceutical industry is not focusing on giving American consumers a  break.   What I want to talk about today goes to an issue that is hard to  believe but true. A few years ago, the New York Times reported that  nearly $3 billion worth of drugs was wasted each year. These are not  ordinary drugs; these are cancer drugs used in chemotherapy. Medicare,  Medicaid, and private health insurers spend billions of dollars on  medications. Many of them are literally thrown in the trash. How could  that possibly be?   You see, for many of the most expensive drugs, like new cancer  treatments, the pharmaceutical industry produces them in a one-size- fits-all container, a single-use vial that a physician has to draw from  to give a treatment to a patient. The dosage for the patient in the  cancer therapy is based on the patient's size and weight. The problem  is that the pharmaceutical industry insists on selling these drugs in  excessively large vials that contain dramatically more medicine than  the average patient would need, so doctors administer the proper dosage  and throw away the rest.   Here is a graphic to illustrate what I am talking about. Here is why  we are wasting billions of dollars each year on cancer drugs. One size  does not fit all.   This drug, Velcade--the vial size available is 3.5 milligrams. The  patient dose is 2.2. The amount that is left over is 1.3. Oh, you are  going to recycle that? You can't do it. That is the end of it, and it  is thrown away. In 2016, $300 million was wasted in this way.   This vial, the first one here that is produced, is a vial that would  apply to a person who is 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 250 pounds,  which means our linebacker Khalil Mack on the Chicago Bears--God forbid  he would ever need it--that would be his dosage size. Most people are  not as big as Chicago linebackers.   Why is Pharma sending us one vial, take it or leave it? Because they  make money. They make money when we buy it and have to throw it away.   Takeda Pharmaceutical sells this drug for those who are suffering  from multiple myeloma and lymphoma. As I mentioned, it is for a person  who is 6 feet 6 inches and weighs 250 pounds. Takeda made $310 million  in the year 2016 off of unused Velcade that got thrown in the trash-- $310 million.   What makes this even more appalling is that the pharmaceutical  industry titans actually sell the same drug in smaller containers in  other countries but not in the United States. Here, we are forced to  buy the largest container and throw away the difference.   This chart shows that the same company--Takeda--that makes Velcade  sells this drug not in 3.5-milligram vials, as in the United States,  but, in Europe, in 1-milligram vials. It seems like a simple thing,  doesn't it, that you would dispense this drug in a manner so that it is  not wasted? Sadly, wasting and throwing away the drug is part of their  marketing strategy.  [[Page S1865]]    Another Japanese company, Eisai, sells its chemotherapy drug Halaven  only in 1-milligram vials in the United States but sells smaller  vials--0.88 milligram--in Europe.   Merck's immunotherapy drug KEYTRUDA, which is truly a breakthrough,  an amazing drug--research was done by taxpayers at the National  Institutes of Health, which led to the development of this drug--they  sell this drug, KEYTRUDA, only in 100-milligram vials in the United  States but in 50-milligram vials in Europe. In 2016, Merck made $200  million on KEYTRUDA--this lifesaving drug--that was thrown away.   In 2016, I asked the inspector general of Health and Human Services  about this waste of taxpayers' money. The inspector general uncovered  that Medicare spent $195 million in just 1 year on 20 identified drugs  for medication that was thrown away. That year, Takeda received $47  million in taxpayer funding for amounts of Velcade thrown in the trash.  It wasn't alone. Genentech's Rituxan, one of the most common cancer  medications, only comes in vials that are 100 milligrams or 500  milligrams. In 2013, Medicare wasted $10 million on Rituxan that was  thrown away.   It is for this reason that I am presenting my second Pharma Fleece  Award to Takeda, Eisai, Merck, and Genentech. Patients in America  should not face higher drug costs because these Pharma fleecers choose  to sell their expensive cancer drugs in excessively large drug vials  that are necessarily going to be wasted.   Two weeks ago, I teamed up with Republican Senator Rob Portman of  Ohio to introduce the REFUND Act--a simple bill that Senator Portman  and I have introduced, and I hope others will join us. It says that  taxpayers will only pay for the drug that is given to a patient, not  for the part that is thrown away. Medicare already tracks how much of  this medication is being discarded, so the REFUND Act simply requires  Medicare to determine how much was wasted and to recoup the money from  the drug companies. We then provide a portion of that money back to  seniors for the 20-percent coinsurance they have to pay for the drugs.   An important point: When Medicare is paying for these drugs, and a  lot are being thrown away, the seniors are still paying their 20  percent, even for the drug portion that is being thrown away. So Rob  Portman's bill--the one I have introduced with him--says that the money  recouped from the drug companies will go back to the benefit of these  seniors. Under our new bill, this pharma fleecing for drug vial waste  will soon come to an end so that not just the patients but our  government will save money.    Remember the bottom line. When you ask the major health insurers  today: What is driving the cost of health insurance premiums, they say:  Senator, prescription drug pricing is No. 1.   Blue Cross Blue Shield, based out of Chicago, when I sit down with  them, say: We spend more money on prescription drugs than we do on  inpatient hospital care.   To give you an idea, it is out of sight. You can't turn on a  television set, particularly if you are over the age of 50, without  being bombarded with all these drug ads, right? You have heard them  over and over again.   The No. 1 drug being sold on television today is HUMIRA. What is it  for? psoriatic arthritis. It is serious. If you have that arthritis,  that may be a lifesaver for you, but it is now being sold for that  little red patch on your elbow called psoriasis. Interesting. Do you  know how much HUMIRA costs each month? Five thousand dollars.   I have legislation that would require these drug companies to  advertise the cost of their drugs on television. They tell us  everything else; don't they? They tell us, if you are allergic to  HUMIRA, don't take HUMIRA. I have never understood that warning. They  tell us everything under the Sun, but they never mention the price. So  what I want to do is get the price out in front of the public, and let  them know what being perfect in a swimsuit is going to cost you per  month.   From my point of view, there are people who need these drugs  desperately, and we ought to try to get the prices within their reach.  For those who are overusing and abusing the airwaves of America to  advertise drugs--to try to push doctors into writing the scripts even  when it is not necessary--we have to come to grips with this. If we  don't, we are not going to have a serious effort to reduce the cost of  health insurance and the healthcare costs that face our Nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the President often claims that he knows  how to make deals, but when it comes to the border, he seems  uninterested in a good deal, a deal to provide effective border  security, and he is hurting our military in the process. This week's  vote to repeal the President's national emergency is a vote to restore  sanity to our border security debate and restore Congress's  constitutional power of the purse.  [[Page S1880]]    We all remember Donald Trump's idea that we need a 2,000-mile  concrete wall from sea to shining sea and his claim that Mexico would  pay for it. He said it some 200 times on the campaign trail and in the  Oval Office. In December, after asking and failing to receive funding  from Congress for this wall, the President said, ``I am proud to shut  down the government for border security.''   What followed was the 35-day Trump shutdown, the longest government  shutdown in U.S. history. It cost our country $11 billion, according to  the Congressional Budget Office. After the President finally agreed to  reopen the government, Congress provided funding to the Department of  Homeland Security for smart and effective border security measures,  including technology and additional Customs personnel. We did this  because the President's own administration has stated that the vast  majority of lethal narcotics that cross our southern border come  through legal ports of entry.   But within hours of signing this bill, President Donald Trump  announced that it wasn't enough. The President went on television to  announce that he was declaring a national emergency over the border,  and he announced that he was taking $6.5 billion from our military to  build it.   Presidents of both parties have declared national emergencies. Each  time, it was done in response to a specific crisis, in order to unlock  certain statutory authorities. President George W. Bush declared a  national emergency after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the 1970s,  President Carter declared a national emergency as it pertained to Iran.  Presidents of both parties have declared and updated emergencies  relating to instability in Syria.   What Presidents did in those situations varied--sometimes levying  sanctions, sometimes seizing assets--but each time, it was accepted on  a bipartisan basis as necessary, legitimate, and in defense of our  national interests. What President Trump did was different. For the  last 2 years, he has struggled to fulfill a campaign promise, so when  he didn't get his way, he created a fake crisis and declared a phony  emergency.   The good news is that the American people aren't buying it. A poll  conducted earlier this month by Quinnipiac University found that 66  percent of voters oppose the President's end-run around Congress and  oppose his fake emergency declaration.   Newspapers around the country have concluded the same thing. The  Tampa Bay Times editorial board said it clearly a few days after the  President's announcement, ``Border wall is no emergency.'' In their  words, ``It is not a national emergency just because President Donald  Trump didn't get his way.''   West Virginia's Herald Dispatch newspaper concludes much the same,  urging the President to ``take a realistic look at whether the wall is  needed or if it's simply an unnecessary quest to satisfy his ego.''  That is common sense, but then common sense seems to be in short supply  in this White House.   Not only is the President declaring a fake emergency, but he is using  that crisis to take money. The President has told us that he will take  $6.5 billion that Congress gave to our troops and spend it instead on a  wall on the southern border. He is proposing to delay or cancel $3.6  billion in military construction projects--projects that our military  told Congress it needed less than a year ago--and divert it to his  wall.   Last Friday, Senator Schatz and I sent a letter to Acting Secretary  of Defense Patrick Shanahan demanding to know which projects have been  deemed, due to political interference, as less important than the  President's wall. There are almost 400 military projects at risk. They  cover 43 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and more  than a dozen foreign countries, including strong U.S. allies like Japan  and the United Kingdom.   The President will have to cancel or postpone approximately 20  percent of these projects for his wall. What are we talking about?-- $800 million for essential training facilities like National Guard  Readiness Centers, simulators, and firing ranges in Alaska, Arizona,  Colorado, and Montana, to name a few; $1.4 billion worth of  maintenance-related projects, such as aircraft hangars, and vehicle  maintenance shops in Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and  elsewhere; $1 billion worth of projects for medical and dental care  facilities, schools for military families, military barracks and dining  facilities in Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and beyond.   For instance, the Marine Corps needs a new rifle range at Parris  Island, SC. This base trains 20,000 new Marine recruits every year.  Also on the list is new training center at Fort Bragg, NC, to provide  top-notch training and prevent injuries among our special operations  forces. They are using old warehouse right now. Are we really going to  tell our military that their needs are being put on hold so the  President can fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall? I hope  those aren't our priorities.   In addition, the President also announced that he would take $2.5  billion in other military funds for his wall. The Pentagon tells me  that they may take some of this money from excess military pay and  pensions. Meanwhile, each of the military services--Army, Air Force,  Navy, and Marines--have met with me to discuss a long list of urgent,  last-minute needs, but with $2.5 billion being diverted for the wall,  none of those leaders were able to say whether or not they would get  the funding they need.   Last year, Hurricane Florence damaged 800 buildings at Camp Lejeune,  New River, and Cherry Point, causing $3.6 billion in damage from wind  and flood waters. A similar hurricane leveled Tyndall Air Force Base,  in Florida. Both of them could use billions right now for repairs.   I am also told that the Navy needs hundreds of millions of additional  dollars for unexpected ship maintenance. We can't afford not to make  sure our sailors are safe on deployment. The National Guard has 2,100  personnel on the border, but it is starting to run low on its pay  account. Unless DOD finds $150-300 million this year, the Guard will  have to cut short its summer trainings in all 50 States to pay for  this.   My subcommittee has identified almost $5 billion in military  priorities that need attention now, but after the President takes $2.5  billion to pay for his border wall, which priorities will get cut?   This week, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate should join the  House in rejecting the President's phony emergency declaration, and the  Senate should reject any effort by the President to take money from our  troops to build the wall.    Mr. President, in 1963, Leonard and Phil Chess, brothers  and  [[Page S1892]]  owners of the legendary Chess Records, bought WHFC-AM 1450 with the  goal of promoting their company. They renamed the station WVON--Voice  of the Negro. This tiny station with just 1,000 watts of power became a  broadcast hit, giving a voice to marginalized communities in the  Chicagoland area. Much of their airwaves were filled with music, but  politics wasn't far behind.   WVON hosted legends like Robert Kennedy, Jackie Robinson, and  Reverend Martin Luther King. King used this station as his bully pulpit  to organize around housing and job discrimination. It was Reverend  Jesse Jackson that called into the station to report of King's  assassination. When riots happened on Chicago's West Side, it was the  disc jockeys of WVON that went out with loudspeakers on trucks to calm  things down. WVON is a station of history and eventually became more  than the Voice of the Negro, it became the Voice of the Nation.   For the last 25 years, my friend Cliff Kelley has been a true voice  of the Nation as host on WVON. He has been the ``Governor of Talk  Radio'' and formed a bond with listeners that is rare. At the end of  this month, he will be stepping down from his daily show, but he will  continue hosting his weekly American Heroes show for veterans. Cliff  will serve as a community ambassador and a regular fill-in host.   Cliff is a native of Chicago's South Side and a graduate of Englewood  High School, Roosevelt University, and John Marshall Law School. Before  hosting his show, Cliff served 16 years as a former 20th Ward Chicago  alderman. He championed racial equality, was an elected school board  member, and a pioneer for LGBTQ rights. He fought for LGBTQ rights long  before it was popular.   Cliff continued as a voice of conscience and community as well as a  radio personality. He covered stories that weren't in the papers. His  show helped launch countless people's careers, including Senators,  Governors, congressmen, business leaders, and a President. A former  colleague you may remember guest hosted his show quite a few times when  Cliff went on vacation. He was a State Senator at the time, but Barack  Obama always had time for Cliff's show as a guest or a host.   Luckily for us, Cliff's voice is still going to be heard today. We  honor Cliff's decades of daily radio work, but we know that, as long as  there are battles for justice to be waged, Cliff Kelley will lead the  fight.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
