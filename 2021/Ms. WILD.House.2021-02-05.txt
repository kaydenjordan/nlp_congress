 Mr. Speaker, in November of last year, I stood in this  Chamber to support this legislation, the bipartisan National  Apprenticeship Act. The House passed it, but the Senate failed to put  it up for a vote. We need to seize this opportunity.   Revitalizing our apprenticeship system is not a Democratic or  Republican priority. It is a national priority for workers across our  country. It is essential to our task of building an economy that  provides a wider, sturdier bridge to the middle class.   For every dollar invested in our registered apprenticeship system, we  see a return of $28 in benefits. But the U.S. invests only $195 of  public money per apprentice, while our Canadian neighbors spend $1,300  per apprentice. We are leaving too many communities behind and at risk  of getting outpaced in the world economy.   Now is the time to invest in the American worker. This bill makes  long-term investments and provides grants for employers to incentivize  the hiring of apprentices, and it provides workers with the opportunity  to earn while they learn and obtain portable credentials without  incurring significant debt.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
