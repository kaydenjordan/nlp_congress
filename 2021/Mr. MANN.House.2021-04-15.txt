 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the southern border.  President Biden's policies paved the way for this full-scale crisis. He  promised outright citizenship to more than 11 million illegal  immigrants, placed a moratorium on deportations, and halted border wall  construction.   I went to the southern border to witness firsthand this crisis last  week:   I saw scared children. Under the Biden administration, Mexican  cartels are the winners, and innocent children are the losers. Cartels  are making hundreds of millions of dollars exploiting children as the  daily average of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has nearly  doubled.   I saw overcrowded facilities and overwhelmed Customs and Border  Patrol agents. Texas migrant facilities are well over 700 percent  capacity, and 40 percent of our agents are being pulled away from  border control to process unaccompanied children.   I watched agents place $8 million worth of methamphetamine, cartel- smuggled drugs, on a table, and I learned that the cartel would throw  migrant children in the Rio Grande as a distraction to avoid being  apprehended.   We must end these disastrous, no-consequence policies, secure our  border through a physical barrier, enhanced technology, and patrol  agents, and adhere to and modernize our country's immigration system.                            ____________________
