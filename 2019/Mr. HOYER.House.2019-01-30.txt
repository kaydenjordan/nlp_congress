 Mr. Chair, I am, of course, not shocked that those who  wanted to shut down the government and keep it shut had Federal  employees making nothing. I am not shocked that they don't want to give  Federal employees a cost-of-living adjustment.   Now, I could spend a lot of time responding to my friend from Ohio  about the qualifications necessary to run NASA and to work at NASA, or  the FBI, or the CDC, or the other agencies that require high levels of  skill to work.   I am sure my friend from Ohio has read the government reports from  the council that is charged with the responsibility of determining  whether we are paying comparable wages who say, no, we are not. As a  matter of fact, we are substantially under, if you compare apples to  apples, educational requirements, and skills requirements to the  private sector, similar requirements.   He doesn't mention that because the averages, they sound just much  better.  [[Page H1299]]  Now, of course, the average salary on the Washington National's team is  a little higher than that. Why, because their skill levels are higher  than almost anybody else in the country.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Representative Connolly and Representative  Wexton for their hard work, and I want to thank my friend, the chairman  of the committee. Representative Connolly, of course, has been a long- time advocate of the pay and benefits, and retaining, and being able to  recruit people who have those kinds of skill levels.   You better be careful; some 30 to 40 percent of our people are  getting pretty close or are at retirement age, and they are going to  say, you keep shutting them down and not keeping their salary level,  unlike our salary, which has deteriorated now for 10 years in terms of  its purchasing value. But averages are averages.   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Connolly in particular. He has  been an outstanding advocate for many Federal civilian employees living  and working in northern Virginia and across the national capital  region, and, indeed, around the country.   Let me disclose, I represent 62,000 Federal employees. You are not  shocked that I am for Federal employees. But when I was in the State  Senate, I represented a miniscule amount of State employees, and I was  for paying them comparable wages so that we could hire competent,  capable, committed people to serve my constituents.   This shutdown just showed what kind of pain it has caused. Do you  think those high-price people were in food lines because they wanted to  say: I am in a food line? No, sir. They were there because they were  not making enough in the Washington metropolitan area and in other  areas around the country, because less than 20 percent of the Federal  employees live in this Washington metropolitan area.   The pay freeze President Trump imposed on Federal workers has been  detrimental to our ability as a nation to recruit and retain the best  and brightest citizens to serve in government.   Now, very frankly, Abe Pollin, a very good friend of mine, owned the  Washington Wizards. He never asked me to play center because I have a  disability. I am 6-feet tall, not 7-feet tall. That is all. And the  people he asked, he had to pay a lot of money to them because he  wouldn't get them if he didn't.   The people who were running our space program, or running NIH, they  are just not run-of-the-mill people, frankly, like me. They have got  extraordinary skills. If we keep shutting them down and we keep not  paying them, you are going to have a second-rate government. That is  where you are going   You are going to have another opportunity to say shutdown is stupid.  I hope you join us on that because it is stupid. It cost us $11 billion  according to CBO. After 5 weeks of an unnecessary, costly, and painful  shutdown, the American people have been reminded how critical the work  our Federal employees perform is to our national security and economic  security.   Americans were horrified to learn that many civilian Federal  employees live paycheck to paycheck, as they do. Even a single month's  delay of income sent many of them to food pantries and in search of  emergency loans.   That isn't right. We had, for a long time, an agreement. We do parity  for our military personnel. Now we pay our military, who we put at the  point of the spear, hazardous duty pay, as we should. But our agreement  was we are going to make sure that everybody keeps their pay at pretty  much a stable level of purchasing power. That is the key.   Very frankly, some people in this House are not for raising the  minimum wage. The minimum wage has eroded 40 percent in purchasing  power since 1968. The Federal employee pay will erode in purchasing  power if we don't pass this legislation.   Let's not forget that 85 percent of Federal employees live outside  the Washington area in some of your districts; even in North Carolina.   Those who work hard to keep our country and its people safe deserve  to be paid competitively. This does not bring them to competitive pay  with the private sector, I tell my friends.   I am proud to represent, as I said, 62,000 of them. I have met many  of them over the years. They are wonderful people dedicated to serving  the Nation and the people of our country. They deserve better than to  be treated like pawns in political games with shutdowns and pay  freezes.   Now, the Senate included 1.9 percent. We included zero over here, of  course, not surprising. When you don't respect people, you don't  necessarily have to treat them as you would treat an employee in your  own firm.   Federal civilian employees, unlike their counterparts in the  military, have been asked to contribute $182 billion over the last 10  years in reduced benefits and pay. $182 billion they have contributed  to try to bring down our debt, which is sort of a drop in the bucket  when you give yourself $1.5 trillion for some of the wealthiest people  in America.   You give yourself headroom to create $1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion  of additional debt to give some of the wealthiest people in America a  huge tax cut, but not 2.6 percent for Federal employees. My no.   That scientist at NASA or the FBI agent who has maybe a college  degree, maybe a law degree, who has to figure out what some of the most  dangerous people in America and around the world are doing, no, not 2.6  percent for them.   Mr. Chair, we need to make sure pay is keeping pace with the rising  cost of living for those who serve this country in civilian roles, as  well as those in military roles. They are no less deserving of our  gratitude and fair compensation. This bill would ensure that civilian  Federal employees receive the same 2.6 percent that all of you voted  for on that side of the aisle for our military personnel.   I honor our military personnel. We should give them that. We should  make sure their purchasing power doesn't erode. And by the way, you can  talk to military families who also from time to time are in food lines.  Is that the right way to treat our people who work for our country and  our constituents?   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in  supporting this bill. In doing so, we can show the hardworking men and  women--unlike we showed them for 35 days--that we do have respect for  them; that we do care about their morale; and that we do care about  their ability to support themselves and their families. We can show  them that we value their contributions and thank them for their  important service.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues, at a time of extraordinary trauma  among our Federal employees, to show them the gratitude and respect  that they have earned and that they deserve.    Will the gentleman yield on the point he just made?    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much because he  makes a good point. When President Obama became President, of course,  we were in a deep trough as the gentleman remembers.  [[Page H1300]]                                     time  1115    It was January of 2009, and we sat around the Cabinet table. I was  the majority leader then as well, and I said:         Federal employees ought to get no cost-of-living       adjustment, Mr. President. The country is in a deep trough.       Many people are hurting in this country, and we should not       have a COLA adjustment this year.    I supported the second year of not having a COLA adjustment because  we were still in a problem. Mr. Chairman, you will not find any record  of my standing on this floor saying that we ought to give Federal  employees a COLA while so many people in the country were struggling  without a job and losing their homes. So I just wanted to tell the  gentleman that when a Democrat was President of the United States, I  told the Federal unions--all of whom supported me--Look, the country is  in trouble.   But we are not in trouble now. The President talks about what a great  economy we have and what low unemployment we have. So now is the time  to give them that raise.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.    I didn't support him, however, when he did those zeros in  those years when we were doing well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to respond to that last speech.   A bill came from the Senate unanimously, Republicans and Democrats,  that would have opened the government. We would have voted for that  bill, all of us, but after not moving on Department of Homeland  Security for 11-2/3 of a year, the then-majority party added into that  bill a piece of legislation they knew would not pass in the United  States Senate. Democrats would not be for it. The gentleman is correct.   The gentleman knew they wouldn't be for it, and the gentleman knew  they couldn't get 60 votes. Notwithstanding that, they passed a piece  of legislation that directly resulted in the shutdown of government.   I say that those are the facts.   As a matter of fact, we thought the President of the United States  agreed with that bill, but somehow, in the some 900 feet of there to  here, he changed his mind.   Maybe he talked to Ann Coulter or Sean Hannity. I don't know who the  operative adviser was, but he changed his mind.   As a result, we had the longest shutdown in history.   The CBO says it cost at least $11 billion. The economic adviser at  the White House said that it was costing at least one-tenth of a point  a week.   This resolution says: Shutdown is stupid.   I am sure some don't agree with that, because I have been in this  Chamber when you have voted to keep the government shut down. And you  don't like me saying that.                                time  1230    Your Speaker asked you to open up the government and 144 of you--your  Speaker, Mr. Boehner, not a Democrat, said: Look, this is stupid. We  need to open up the government--voted no. Now, it passed because all of  us voted with 87 Republicans, including your present leader, who voted  yes to open up the government.   This resolution is so simple. A shutdown is stupid. That is all it  says. We will see how you vote. And I am going to say something about  some people who think it is stupid.   I want to thank my friend from Virginia, Ms. Wexton, for her  leadership on this issue. She represents a district, as I do, where  there are many hardworking Federal employees, who were negatively  affected.   We had an argument here about whether we ought to give people a 2.6  percent raise, a COLA adjustment, to keep them even with the economy.  And we voted to give them nothing--zero, zip. Not a cost-of-living  adjustment. No pay at all.   I see my friend, the minority leader, on the floor. He said, not  paying 800,000 people was unacceptable. I agree with him. I think it is  unacceptable. I think asking people to work and then not paying them is  not a moral thing to do.   This resolution, as I said, is simple. It is one I believe nearly  every Member of this House ought to support, unless you support  shutting down the government of the United States of America. It says,  a shutdown should never be a strategy in negotiations over funding,  period, full stop.   We just endured 35 days of a dangerous and unnecessary partial  government shutdown that cost 800,000 American workers to be denied  their paychecks and that the CBO says, as I just said, $11 billion was  the cost. Those are the direct costs.   Our resolution makes it clear that such a use of shutdowns, or the  threat of shutdowns, ought not to be tolerated in our political system.  Now, this resolution says that, but I am going to have some other  people who are going to say that as well.   No other country has this phenomena. I can't find another country  that shuts its government down. In Australia, if you shut the  government down, the government falls, so you have to form a new  government.   There is no reason why Americans should have to live under the threat  of being taken hostage, yet again, the next time there is an unresolved  debate over an issue, whatever the issue might be.   Even many Republican leaders agree that using a shutdown is wrong. I  think most leaders, as a matter of fact, not everyone.   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell very definitively called  shutdowns ``a failed policy.''   And Senator Susan Collins, rightfully, said, just a few days ago  that: ``Shutdowns represent the ultimate failure to govern and should  never be used as a weapon''--let me repeat that--``and should never be  used as a weapon to achieve an outcome.''   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues all know Lamar Alexander,  the former Governor of Tennessee, former Secretary of Education, a  Member of the United States Senate, and someone who was prominently  mentioned and regularly mentioned as a candidate for President of the  United States on the Republican ticket. Here is what he said: ``It is  always wrong for either side to use shutting down the government as a  bargaining chip in budget negotiations.''   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to hear this, Senator  Alexander: ``It should be as off-limits as chemical weapons are to  warfare.'' Could Senator Alexander have said it any more powerfully  that shutdowns are not an option? That is all this resolution says.   Sadly, I think a lot of you are going to vote no, I suppose, on the  theory that you think: No, if we don't get our way, shutting down the  government is our option. That is certainly what you told Mr. Boehner  and then Leader McCarthy.   This resolution says, let's not allow that to happen again. We now  have 3 weeks to avert the next shutdown. I am hopeful that the  Appropriations Committee will present us with a bipartisan agreement on  how best to invest in border security. We all need to do our job.  [[Page H1310]]    Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to join us on this resolution to  make it clear to our Federal employees, to our contractors, to the  American people, and, yes, to the rest of the world that we don't  believe shutting down the government of the United States of America is  an option in negotiations. Vote for this resolution. You know that  shutting down government is not a positive result of our failures.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate  and 2 p.m. for legislative business following 1 minutes. The House will  recess to allow for a security sweep of the House Chamber prior to the  President's State of the Union Address. The House will meet again at  approximately 8:35 p.m. in a joint session with the Senate for the  purpose of receiving an address from the President of the United  States. Members are advised that there will be no votes in the House on  Tuesday.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business.   On Friday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business, with last votes no later than 3 p.m. We will  consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list  of those suspensions will be announced by close of business Friday.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 840, the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, introduced by Representatives  Brownley and Higgins. This bill would make permanent the VA's childcare  pilot program and expand it so that veterans across the Nation who are  parents or grandparents have a convenient, cost-free option for  childcare when they have VA medical appointments.  [[Page H1318]]         Madam Speaker, as I pointed out, additional items are  possible to be added. We said that last week. We did add one. It was  noticed on Monday, and we voted on it today. In effect, we met the 3- day rule, not the 72-hour rule, but that was a suspension. There may be  others that we will add.    Madam Speaker, we want to move on a bipartisan basis. The  good news was that this resolution, although it failed to have a two- thirds vote, did have a bipartisan vote with more than 20 Republicans  voting for it, which I appreciate. Of course, the balance voted against  the resolution, which said that shutdowns were bad.   But we will certainly try to give as much notice as possible to the  gentleman and to his party.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the conference  committee has either met or is meeting. It is my understanding that  Chairwoman Lowey is going to have a press conference after the first  initial meeting, so that we are in a conference. That is good news. I  am sure the conferees are going to talk about proposals that they have  to reach border security.    I might say that, although it appears to be the central part, in  terms of our perspective, a shutdown is not about border security or  any other particular issue. It is that it is a bad policy to shut down  the Government of the United States. Notwithstanding that, I expect  that Chairwoman Lowey will be explaining our position in the  conference.    Certainly.    Madam Speaker, not as far as I know.    Madam Speaker, I share the gentleman's view. I hope the  conferees can reach an agreement that will be agreeable to the  Democratic Party, the Republican Party, both the House and the Senate,  and the President.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at noon tomorrow; when the House  adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at 11:30 a.m. on Monday,  February 4, 2019; and when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn  to meet at noon on Tuesday, February 5, 2019, for morning-hour debate  and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
