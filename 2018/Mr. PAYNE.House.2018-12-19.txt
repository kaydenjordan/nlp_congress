 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor New Jersey City  University Professor Yumiko Ogawa.   Professor Ogawa is a registered play therapist. Along with current  and former NJCU students, she is providing play therapy for immigrant  children who are in the process of applying for asylum. Their play  therapy program is currently being implemented at the Newark office of  a nonprofit called Kids in Need of Defense.   Since 2014, the United States has welcomed more than 240,000  unaccompanied minors who are seeking protection. Many of them have  suffered from violence and child abuse. Some of them are escaping  persistent trauma, including human trafficking and gang violence.   Professor Ogawa's play therapy has already helped some of these  children cope with their trauma. I am proud of Professor Ogawa's  thoughtful leadership and the amazing research supported at New Jersey  City University.   It only takes an idea to change the world. I am proud to represent  NJCU in Congress, and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this  wonderful initiative.                            ____________________
