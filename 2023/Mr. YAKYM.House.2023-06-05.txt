 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate excellence in college  athletics and a very accomplished group of young men.   One of the many great things the University of Notre Dame is known  for is the slogan: ``Play Like a Champion Today.'' That is exactly what  the Notre Dame men's lacrosse team did last Monday when they defeated  the Duke Blue Devils to win their first national title in program  history.   The Fighting Irish had faced the Blue Devils in the championship game  twice before, only to fall just short. However, the third time was the  charm for the Irish. Their exhilarating 13-9 win came before a Memorial  Day crowd of more than 30,000 fans and countless more cheering from  around the country.   Notre Dame's defense proved key in taking home the title as the Irish  led the Blue Devils to their fewest goals of any game all season.   Congratulations to Head Coach Kevin Corrigan, his entire staff, and  all the Irish lacrosse players for bringing a national championship  back to Notre Dame.   God bless, and go Irish.                            ____________________
