 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks.    Mr. President, I rise today on tax day to recognize this  as the very last time Americans will have to file their taxes under the  complicated, burdensome, outdated system of the past. Today, we  officially kick off a new tax code--one that is simpler, fairer, and  allows hard-working Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money.   Since we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last December, success  stories have poured into my office from Indiana businesses that are  paying their workers more and from constituents who are earning more.  Tax reform has provided needed relief across Indiana and across the  entire country.   To date, we have found scores of companies in my home State of  Indiana that have invested in their employees, invested in capital  improvements, or lowered energy rates for consumers. They range in size  from large companies, such as Walmart and AT&T, to smaller Indiana  businesses, such as Family Express, which has 70 convenience stores  across the State and is building 10 more and increasing its starting  wage. ``We feel obligated to pass on a significant portion of the tax  savings to our staff,'' said Family Express president and CEO Gus  Olympidis.  [[Page S2200]]    My guest to this year's State of the Union Address was another  beneficiary of this historic tax overhaul. Chelsee Hatfield is a young  mother of three children and a teller at a rural branch of First  Farmers Bank & Trust in Tipton, IN. Chelsee received a raise and a  bonus as a result of this tax reform effort. This additional income  will help Chelsee go back to school to earn her associate's degree. It  will enable her to put money away for her children's future college  education. Chelsee represents so many Americans who work in small towns  and who live in our rural communities and are going to get a fair shot  because of the benefits from tax reform.   The tax reform success stories don't stop there. NIPSCO, or the  Northern Indiana Public Service Company, is an electric utility company  in Merrillville, IN. It is passing on $26 million in new savings to its  customers. Andy Mark, a mechanical and electrical parts supplier in  Kokomo, is hiring more employees. Muncie Aviation Company is providing  tax reform bonuses for all of its employees. One Hoosier, who lives in  Cedar Lake, IN, is growing his third-generation milk-hauling business,  and another, who lives in Southern Indiana and works for U-Haul in  Louisville, used his $500 tax bonus to pay a bill. These bonuses and  raises are allowing more Hoosiers to save for a rainy day, to put more  money away towards their child's education, to make repairs to their  home, and to keep food on the table.   It is worth noting that when we were debating tax reform, I listened  carefully to feedback from my constituents across Indiana. I spent a  lot of time traveling the State, holding roundtables, visiting  businesses, and talking to folks on the street. I am glad to say that  Hoosier voices were heard, and they are receiving the tax relief they  asked for. I look forward to continue hearing Hoosiers' tax reform  stories, and, like the rest of America, I look forward to this being  the last day of the old, outdated tax system.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
