 Madam Chair, my amendment shifts $5 million  in funding for fossil fuel research and development to Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy Research.   Increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, like  wind and solar, are the most cost-effective ways of reducing greenhouse  gas emissions. These funds can also fund research in more fuel- efficient passenger vehicles for transit options.   The Trump administration's 2020 budget proposed cutting over $2  billion from energy efficiency programs, and authorized an additional  $116 million to fund new oil, gas, and coal projects.                                time  2015    As climate change continues to threaten our future economic  prosperity and the lives of billions worldwide, we should be focusing  our efforts on clean, renewable energy.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making  this important amendment in order. I urge all of my colleagues to  support my amendment to further promote energy efficiency and renewable  energy research and development.
