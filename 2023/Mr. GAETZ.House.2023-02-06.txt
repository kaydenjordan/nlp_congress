 Madam Speaker, how much more for Ukraine? Is there any  limit? Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which redline  that we set will we not later cross?   China reminds us that we have real issues. China began its offensive  against our homeland by infiltrating our universities, stealing our  innovations, buying off our politicians, and surveilling our citizens,  all the while capturing the loyalty of America's most powerful  corporations. China's influence is overtaking ours, even in our own  hemisphere.   Our conflict with China may turn very hot very soon. Many believe we  are currently in the window of a possible invasion of Taiwan. If not  deterred, such an invasion would immediately make life worse for  virtually every American.   Tomorrow, President Biden will tell us how much more we must do for  Ukraine. Look around your house. How much stuff is made in Ukraine or  even Russia, for that matter? Next, do China. If you are watching this  speech on a smartphone, you are likely using Taiwanese technology.   So why Ukraine, a country that just rounded up dozens of senior  leaders in its government over overt corruption? Perhaps the answer is  as simple as the Hunter Biden life motto: a grifter's gotta grift.   The amount of money we now pour into Ukraine makes Burisma's wildest  dreams of wealth through Biden family influence seem meek by  comparison.   Defense contractors need there to be a war going on somewhere,  whether the arms end up in the hands of ISIS, the Taliban, the Azov  battalion, or on the black market. They get rich in the business of  weapons supply, but only when there is weapons demand.   A serious nation would never let foreign interests abroad or special  interests here at home dictate its foreign policy. The interests of our  countrymen must morally compel our greater attention. As the war slogs  on in Ukraine, the benefits to Americans are unclear.   Bandits in the Sinaloa mountains hurt more Americans than the men in  Crimea, but foreigners come to Washington to lecture us about spending  our constituents' money on a conflict thousands of miles away, and my  colleagues are eager to oblige.   On this floor, Zelenskyy's demands got bipartisan standing ovations-- from most. Stingers, HIMARS, tanks, at first, we said no to all of  these things. President Biden even said that some of these things might  lead to world war III, yet we sent all of them.   F-16s are likely still. Lockheed Martin sure is confident that  Ukraine will get F-16s. They told the Financial Times recently that  they are already ramping up production. Create the demand; provide the  supply.   This is escalating. We are placing trust in leaders who do not  deserve trust.   John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman who assured us the Afghan military  would withstand the Taliban offensive, now says that there is no risk  that Putin will go nuclear.   The risk of miscalculation in Ukraine is much, much higher than  getting it wrong in Afghanistan. A nuclear war between Russia and the  United States would end human life as we know it.                                time  1215    Yet, President Biden is doing everything possible to provoke such a  disaster.   And for what?   The actions we are taking are not going to end the war in Ukraine. In  fact, we are probably prolonging the killing. Tens of thousands of  Ukrainians and Russians will die this year because Congress feels good  when it sends instruments of death and billions in cash.  [[Page H687]]    Many dollars meant for the war in Afghanistan ended up in bank  accounts in Switzerland and Dubai.   To where will we trace the bounty of the Ukrainian grift?   This war could end tomorrow if we pursue negotiation, but Biden  refuses. Not only do we arm the Ukrainian military, we pay their  politicians' salaries. The $113 billion in aid included funding of the  Ukrainian Government.   We can and must push for peace. You don't really hear that from many  people these days with the exception of President Trump. Trump is right  to recognize that we are on the brink of world war III and that  immediate action for peace is necessary to stop disaster.   Unfortunately, there is a bipartisan coalition working to continue  the war. When Elon Musk proposed a peace plan, Nikki Haley attacked him  saying that we ``shouldn't push our weight on them.''   This is, of course, nonsense. We have pushed billions of dollars on  them. We can simultaneously pressure North Korea and China from  supplying Russia, and we ought to do so.                            ____________________
