 Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues on  the floor today, and I want to thank our great and distinguished leader  on this issue, Senator Durbin, who has devoted so many years and so  much energy and has been a model for me personally of what an advocate  should be in the Senate and most especially on this issue, which has  been preeminently important to me since my arrival here almost 7 years  ago.   For a time, I was on the floor almost every week, periodically, with  a photo of another Dreamer, and the reason was to make this issue real  in the hearts of the American people, to bring their voices and faces  to this body.   Today, I am joined in spirit by Alejandra Villamares. She is one of  8,000 Dreamers in Connecticut. I am proud of each and every one of  them. She is one of 700,000 Dreamers in the United States of America,  and I hope that my colleagues are proud of them in their States, as  well, because they are absolutely incredible people. Nobody's perfect,  but in many ways, they embody the spirit and values of America. They  work hard. They go to school. They are future engineers, scientists,  nurses, and doctors. They are of immense value to our economy because  they work and contribute, and they will better themselves through  education, through their values. And they know what it means to be an  American citizen. Even though they are not, they know the value of  citizenship.   Alejandra came to this country when she was 1 year old. She was  brought here by her parents, across the border from Mexico. Her family  lived in a cramped, small house with her two uncles. They had very  little money. She and her sister were bullied by students in elementary  school because, of course, they had to learn English. They spoke with  an accent. She told me: ``My mother told me not to give up.'' That is  what she wrote me a couple of days after the President of the United  States announced that he would end the DACA Program. She wrote me 5  days after the Trump administration rescinded DACA, and her story has  stuck with me, haunted me over these months, just as when I have met  with Dreamers--as I did just this past Monday in Hartford, CT--to  reassure them that I was going to fight every day that we have  remaining in this session, their stories have haunted and moved and  inspired me.   Alejandra was bullied, but even as she was bullied for speaking a  different language--her native language--and learning English, even as  her father was deported, even as her family was left without him and  with even less support, they persevered.   She wrote to me: ``I made it my mission to prove that I was worthy of  being considered an American.'' How many of us, growing up, made it our  mission to prove ourselves worthy of being an American? I daresay few  of us considered that mission. Most of us take for granted that we are  Americans, that we are citizens of the greatest country in the history  of the world.   Slowly but surely she learned English, and it became her primary  language. In 2012, she got a break: The Obama administration enacted  DACA. She could come out of the shadows. She could have a place, some  security. That step unlocked for her--literally unlocked for her--the  American dream.   For all of us who take for granted what it means to be an American,  who have never made it a mission to become an American, we often take  for granted the American dream. Well, we belong here. No one is going  to send us away. No one is going to deport us to a land we have no  knowledge of, to a place away from our friends and our families. But  DACA meant something else as well, more than just emotional; it meant  that she could go to college, and she did. She went to Wesley, where  she is now a student. For once, she had the immense luxury of not being  afraid. She could go to college and study--as she is now studying--film  and international relations. She felt empowered to speak up and  participate in her community.   She worked at Delaware Goes to College Academy and the Summer  Learning Collaborative. They both promote education for disadvantaged  youth. She was now not only learning and studying at one of the great  universities in our country but giving back to others, enabling others  to climb that same ladder, young people with disadvantages like hers to  make the most of themselves and to achieve that American dream.   When Attorney General Sessions, with the President's approval,  rescinded DACA in September, Alejandra wrote to me:         I wanted this to be my country so badly. One thing that I       knew from the bottom of my heart was that I wanted to stay       here, and that I was an American.    Anyone who looks at Alejandra, knows her story, and hears her words  has to be heartbroken that a young woman seeking so deeply to be an  American, to live the American dream and American values, to give back  to this country that she loves, and never to take for granted what so  many of us do--we have to be heartbroken to hear those words and her  story.   I have heard my colleagues say: Well, why now? Why not wait until  after the new year? Why not wait until March? Why not wait? Waiting  until March would mean an extension of her anxiety, apprehension, and  fear. It would also mean the extension of a humanitarian crisis.   Make no mistake, for 8,000 young people in Connecticut and 700,000 in  the United States of America, threatening deportation to them is an  unprecedented message to the world and to ourselves. It says something  about who we are. To leave them hanging is not only unfair, it is  unworthy of us as Americans.   More practically speaking, tens of thousands of DACA recipients are  estimated to have already lost their protection from removal. Kicking  the can down the road would mean continued anguish for those 700,000  young people, and it would mean breaking a promise. They came forward.  They provided their addresses, their cell phone numbers, their tax  information on the promise that it would not be used against them.   It would mean instability in the job market, and it would hurt our  economy. That is why employers are coming forward and urging us to act  now. Companies have been forced to consider whether they should fire  DACA recipients and train new employees in anticipation of the March  deadline. It would churn and create turmoil if we fail to act. In fact,  it already is creating chaos and confusion because  [[Page S7972]]  looming on the horizon ominously, inextricably, is the threat of mass  deportation.   It would be a humanitarian nightmare, and it is a bureaucratic  nightmare, as well, to wait. If the Dream Act is passed, the United  States Citizenship and Immigration Services has work to do. They need  to develop new regulations, process applications. This involves  conducting security checks, biometric screening, notifying the  applicants, and doing the paperwork. Experts say that this process  could take up to 7 months in total. So we are already late. We are  already late in beginning and accomplishing this task.   If we delay our action, thousands of Dreamers will lose their  protections before the law is fully implemented. Young, contributing  members of our society--like Alejandra--who have done nothing wrong  will be dragged back into the shadows, to lose their drivers licenses,  to lose their jobs, to lose their sense of security, to fear every day  the sound of police sirens, as so many do right now.   The administration has literally thrown a timebomb to this body, and  it is ticking. We have the power to diffuse it. We have the power to do  the right thing. We have the power and we have the obligation to truly  give those 700,000 Dreamers the ability to make the most of themselves  and make the most of this country.   Often, when I think of the Dreamers, I think of my father, who came  to this country in 1935. He was 17 years old. He knew virtually no one.  He spoke almost no English. He had not much more than the shirt on his  back, and he was a Dreamer, although he came here legally. He became a  U.S. citizen. Nobody loved this country more than my dad.   I sometimes think how sad and ashamed he would be about the way we  have denied Dreamers the opportunity and security that he felt coming  here, escaping persecution in Germany. This country has never been  perfect, but we are the greatest country in the history of the world  because we are a nation of immigrants.   If you are ever discouraged or down about your lives or about the  country, you may want to try going to the immigration naturalization  ceremonies in your State. They happen in Connecticut every week in  courthouses. I go as often as I can on Fridays, when they usually  occur, in Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport, because it is so  uplifting. It is so very inspiring to see people who are moved and  grateful beyond words--moved to tears--in becoming citizens of the  United States.   The judges usually give me an opportunity to say a few words, and I  thank them for wanting to become citizens. I tell them ``You passed a  test that most Americans couldn't pass,'' and they laugh, as perhaps  some who are listening now would laugh because they know it is true.   They wanted to become American citizens, so they studied and they  prepared. Many of them came long distances, escaping persecution--just  as my dad did--and left behind families, loved ones, jobs, careers.  They wanted to be citizens. They will never take it for granted, nor  will Alejandra if she is given that opportunity. She wants it too. She  is a Dreamer, not only in name but in spirit. I hope all of us keep her  in mind and in heart when we think about what we are going to do in the  next couple of weeks.   As for me, I am determined that we should not leave here for our  holiday without acting on this measure. I know we can do it if both  sides of the aisle are reasonable, responsible, and responsive. The  vast majority of the American people are with Alejandra. They know her  as a neighbor; they know her as a friend. Even though they may never  have met her, they know people like her who are in their communities,  and they know the immense contribution that she and others like her can  make.   I know so many of them who share that simple goal to become a U.S.  citizen, and it begins with permanent status, a path--a path to earn  citizenship. Whatever it may be called, it begins with a sense of  security and belonging.   I hope this body will pass the Dream Act and give Alejandra and so  many like her that opportunity to accomplish the American dream.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
