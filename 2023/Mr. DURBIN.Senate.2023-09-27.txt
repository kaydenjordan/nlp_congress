 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a few weeks ago, regulations enacted in  the European Union went into effect that cover more than a dozen of the  world's biggest tech platforms. This includes online marketplaces, app  stores, and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.   The European Union regulations address a host of harmful practices,  including preventing targeted advertising, minimizing illegal content  and hate speech, and, most importantly, protecting kids from horrible  content.   If companies fail to comply in the European Union, they could be  fined up to 6 percent of their annual global revenue. They can also be  banned from operating in the European Union countries.   This shows that Big Tech can be regulated. It is possible to craft  rules to protect our families without breaking the miracle of the  internet.   In contrast to what has happened in Europe, here in the United  States, Congress has failed to regulate high tech. And while we sit on  our hands, other nations are moving ahead and shaping the rules of the  digital world.   Worse than that, while we fail to act, children are left in harm's  way. We can, and we must, regulate Big Tech to protect our kids.   Let me tell you about one young man named Cornell Johnson. He is from  Illinois. He is a man who preyed on 17 victims, ranging in age from 4  to 17 years old and located across 8 States. His tool of choice:  Facebook.   Johnson would set up profiles claiming to be a woman and then use  these Facebook profiles to contact girls all over the country. First,  he would entice these girls to send him sexually suggestive images of  themselves in various stages of undress. Then he would  [[Page S4692]]  use these images to coerce the victims into sending him sexually  explicit content. He would threaten to post the nude pictures online  unless the young victims submitted to his demands for still more  explicit images.   Horrifically, Johnson also directed his teenaged victims to sexually  abuse younger children in their household and send him the images. He  was prosecuted and sentenced to 45 years in Federal prison.   Johnson was held accountable for his conduct, but what about  Facebook? Johnson could not have committed his crimes without the  social media platform. He could not have sexually exploited those 17  children in 8 different States. Yet our current law, as written,  shields Facebook from any accountability for the role they played in  making Cornell Johnson's crimes possible.   Sadly, there are many examples where Big Tech is failing children in  America.   Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal exposed how Instagram's  algorithms are connecting pedophiles and guiding them to locations  where they can purchase child sexual abuse material. The platform  permitted searches with terms associated with child abuse so vile that  I won't repeat them in this Chamber. Senator Lindsey Graham and I wrote  to Meta, Instagram's parent company, in June asking for answers to  explain these algorithms. We are still waiting.   On X, formerly known as Twitter, Elon Musk reinstated the account of  a user who was banned for tweeting an image of a toddler being  tortured. As of late July, that image had drawn more than 3 million  views and 8,000 retweets. A study released in June found that Twitter  failed to stop the uploading of copies of known child sexual abuse  material, CSAM. The study also found that Twitter would sometimes allow  accounts to remain active until they had uploaded CSAM multiple times.  Elon Musk's claims of a zero-tolerance policy for child exploitation on  his platform doesn't reflect the disturbing reality.   Another company failing our children is Apple. In 2021, the company  paused its plan to detect CSAM uploaded to its cloud service. Then last  month, Wired published a letter from Apple in which the company  confirmed it will make no effort to address child sexual abuse material  stored on its platform. Apparently, Apple views permitting this ongoing  child sexual exploitation as an acceptable and necessary cost of  protecting their right to privacy.   But I believe we can live in a world where user privacy and child  safety can coexist, and I believe I have written a bill that does just  that. My STOP CSAM Act will end Big Tech's free ride and give victims a  way to hold these companies accountable for their failure to stop  online child sexual exploitation and, in some cases, for their actions  that make it worse.   Importantly, the bill achieves this goal in a manner that will avoid  any unintended impact on technology that protects privacy.   The STOP CSAM Act is the product of extensive consultations with  stakeholders. It passed out of the Judiciary Committee, which I chair,  unanimously--every Democrat, every Republican supported it--and I am  working to bring it to the floor.   The Senate must act. Our failure to do so will preserve the status  quo where our children are being sexually exploited online every single  day. What a nightmare. As a father, mother, grandfather, grandmother,  you think all the time: What are they looking at on those phones all  day long? What is on those screens? What message is being sent to them?  What is changing them from that experience? And what can I possibly do  as a parent or grandparent to police what is going on there?   We need to have the law on our side. Sure, I want to be certain to  recognize the basic fundamental constitutional rights in our country,  but I have to acknowledge as well that we aren't doing anything at this  point. The current law says that these platforms are not responsible  for whatever they do or fail to do. It is a get-out-of-jail-free card  completely, and it has been that way for decades.   We have to wake up to the reality of the year we live in and the  reality of life in families across America. Even the most conscientious  parents cannot know what is going on every hour of every day with  children and these screens.   The sexploitation which I outlined here in detail is happening, and  what are we doing about it? If we are going to help Americans raise  good kids--and we want them all to raise good kids--we have to give  them the tools and we have to back them up with laws that say we are  going to take it seriously. The European Union has done it, so why not  the United States of America? It is time for us to make progress in  this area for the good of our children.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to speak about the critical  role that U.S. attorneys play in keeping America safe from the scourge  of drugs--like opioids, fentanyl--gun violence and violent crime.   Why are we on the floor? We are on the floor because one Senator has  decided to stop the appointment of U.S. attorneys for the Department of  Justice across the United States. He has picked four States--one is a  pretty red State, Mississippi; California; Ohio, his own home State;  and my State of Illinois--to stop the U.S. attorneys from being  approved by the U.S. Senate.   This is a pattern.   The Senator from Alabama, Senator Tuberville, has stopped 300  military officers--career officers--from getting a promotion for more  than 6 months. Many of these career officers, women and men, have  fought in combat and risked their lives for America. We salute them  every Memorial Day. We say that we love our veterans, and I certainly  do. I'm sure the Senator from Ohio does too. And yet they are being  treated so shabbily here in the U.S. Senate that the leading veterans  organization in the United States of America is protesting what this  Alabama Republican Senator is doing. He is stopping 300 of the best,  highest ranked individuals who will lead our military in the world from  being approved in the U.S. Senate for 6 months--more than 6 months.   Does he have a specific complaint about any one of them? No. Just,  categorically, this is his political approach: Let's stop all the  military from a promotion.   Is that fair to them and their families? I don't think so.   Now let's take a look at this situation. The Senator from Ohio has  decided he is upset with the Department of Justice. How upset is he?  Here is what he said:         I will hold all [Department of Justice] nominations . . .       We will grind [the Justice Department] to a halt.    Grind the Justice Department to a halt, he says.   Well, let's see. Do the people at the Department of Justice, the U.S.  attorneys, do they do anything important? Do we really need them?   Well, how about starting with the issue of narcotics: 180,000  Americans died from narcotics last year--180,000. You might know some  from your community, your church, your business. And 70,000 died from  fentanyl.   Let's talk about fentanyl for a minute. What is this narcotic? Well,  it is the new and deadliest narcotic on the streets. Let me tell you a  story that breaks my heart, because I know this couple. They had a  daughter who graduated from college. She went to a party in Chicago.  Marijuana is legal in Illinois. She decides to smoke a joint at a  party. It has been laced with fentanyl, and she drops dead on the  spot--22 years of age.   Fentanyl is a deadly narcotic. Where does it come from? It comes from  Mexico--mainly from Mexico. Two drug cartels are sweeping the United  States and into Europe with the sale of fentanyl that is killing people  right and left--last year, 70,000 Americans.   Who is trying to fight the scourge of fentanyl? The Department of  Justice--the same Agency that this Senator wants to grind to a halt.   Are we going to declare a timeout and call Mexican cartels and say:  Don't be selling your fentanyl for a while because we are going to make  sure you don't have leadership that you need in your department. How  can we do something that irresponsible?   Don't stand up and say you are for law and order, you are for law  enforcement, and then turn around and stop the appointment of U.S.  attorneys who prosecute the criminals who are responsible for the  narcotics sales.   I came to the floor last week and asked unanimous consent for the  Senate to take up and confirm these nominations. They are nominations  of Todd Gee, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.   If you think this is partisan, let me tell you the whole story. Todd  Gee is from Mississippi with two Republican Senators. Both Republican  Senators approved his appointment as U.S. attorney.   Is this political? Both Republican Senators are supporting the  nominee that is being held by another Republican Senator. It doesn't  make sense.   Tara McGrath--the request was made by the Senator from California  just a few moments ago. She wants to be the U.S. Attorney for the  Southern District of California, eminently qualified, no controversy  with her nomination.   Rebecca Lutzko--now this is interesting--to be U.S. Attorney for the  Northern District of Ohio, the same State as the Senator who is now  objecting to it.   He approved her. She went through the committee. She came out and was  reported to the floor, and now she is being held up.   Well, let's take a look here. Does Ohio have a narcotics problem?   Let me make sure we get this right.   Oh, my. In the last year, Ohio had 5,155 drug overdose deaths, the  fourth highest overdose deaths in America. And the U.S. attorney who  would be fighting these narcotics with the appropriate task force of  the law enforcement is being held up by which Senator? The same State.  The Senator from Ohio is holding up his own U.S. attorney to prosecute  narcotics criminals.   And it is not just drugs. In Cleveland, the largest city in the  Northern District of Ohio, the number of homicides is up 30 percent  compared to last year. Nearly 90 percent of all overall homicides in  Cleveland this year has involved a firearm. The city has seen a 99  percent increase in vehicle grand theft, a Federal crime, so far in  2023.   So to deal with the crime in the streets, to deal with the homicides,  the firearm violations and the increase in vehicle grand theft, you  count on one major prosecutor. Who is it? The U.S. attorney. So you  have a vacancy in the U.S. Attorney's Office. The Senator from Ohio  approves the person to fill the vacancy and then stops her nomination  on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I can't follow his logic, unless you are determined to grind the  Department of Justice to a halt, even at the expense of the people you  represent, the people you were sent here to protect. Don't tell me you  are for law and order in your own neighborhood when you stop the  nomination of the U.S. attorney for no controversy. It makes no sense.   U.S. attorneys are an integral part of our justice system in  overseeing important operations that help protect our communities. They  are empowered to prosecute all Federal criminal offenses. They play a  critical role in enforcing the law.   In the Northern District of Ohio, for example, the U.S. Attorney's  Office led the response to a surge in fatal doses from fentanyl. It  brought together doctors, State and local law enforcement, addiction  specialists, and other stakeholders and created the U.S. attorney's  Heroin and Opioid Task Force. This is in the Northern District of Ohio.   This U.S. attorney is to fill the spot to lead that, but she is being  held up on the calendar--by whom? The Senator from Ohio.   The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio also  recently secured the conviction of a drug trafficker who attempted to  traffic 1 kilogram of fentanyl pills, which were made to look like  oxycodone, into the State. In addition, the office coordinated with ATF  on a 3-month violent-crime-reduction initiative in Cleveland that  resulted in the arrest of 59 individuals who have been charged with  firearms trafficking, narcotics, conspiracy, and other firearms  offenses.   Are these important? They would be important in Chicago. They would  be  [[Page S4701]]  important in Los Angeles. They are important, I am sure, in Cleveland  and in other cities as well. These convictions are trying to keep  people safe in their homes and communities and to reduce violent crime.   The lead prosecutor--the lead Federal prosecutor--is a U.S. attorney.  It is a vacant position we are trying to fill with a person with  demonstrated competence to take it over--and who is holding it up but  the Senator from Ohio. I don't understand it.   When he ran for office, Senator Vance argued that he would ``fight  the criminals and not the cops.'' Well, take a look at what is  happening here. In this situation, the people we need to fight these  criminals--the prosecutors--are being held up by the Senator before  they can be voted on on the floor.   He has pledged to be ``tough on crime'' and to support our brave law  enforcement officers. In fact, just this May, he introduced a  resolution in the Senate, saying he has ``support for the law  enforcement officers of the United States.''   His resolution says:         [T]he Senate . . . highly respects and values the law       enforcement officers of the United States and greatly       appreciates all that [they] do to protect and serve.    The Senator's resolution then calls on ``all levels of government to  ensure that law enforcement officers receive the support and resources  needed to keep all communities . . . safe.''   Support and resources are great, but give them the job. The job is  still vacant because the Senator is withholding his approval for them  to move forward.   I say to my colleagues: Reread the resolution he introduced last May,  and take your own advice. Give these U.S. Attorneys' Offices the  leadership they need to keep their communities safe.   Now I would like to engage the Senator, if he doesn't mind, in a  question.   I listened carefully to what you said earlier in objecting to the  U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California. What is your  position, if you wouldn't mind saying it, in terms of the vote on that  nomination?    So you want a record vote for each U.S. attorney?    Do you understand, before President Biden was elected,  that that was common practice--that a unanimous consent request was all  that was necessary to approve a U.S. attorney?    Is the Senator aware--I am not going to ask this  question. I know you know the answer as well as I do.   I will just state, generally, that the people who were involved in  the prosecution of former President Trump were attorneys appointed to  that position by President Trump.    And a special counsel, separate and apart from the  Department of Justice, was independently making those decisions.   Your decision to stop U.S. attorneys from taking these jobs means  that they will not be in a position to be able to prosecute individuals  of either political party who are guilty of criminal wrongdoing. Do you  understand that?     So I am going to make a unanimous consent request  consistent with the statement that you just made. I have listened to it  carefully. I don't know if you have been given a copy, but I want to  make sure you understand.    No, and you are not expected to.   But if individual Senators have an objection to moving forward on a  nomination and they know a unanimous consent request is going to be  made on the floor, it is their responsibility to be present physically.  You can't mail it in.    So even if you got your way, even if you got a rollcall  vote, which you have asked for twice now, you are still not going to  allow us to move to fill these vacancies for U.S. attorneys, even in  Ohio?    That is what I am going to request right now, so you can  decide whether you are going to go along with it or object.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Republican  leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the  following nominations: Calendar Nos. 129, 314, 315, and 266; that there  be 2 minutes for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on each  nomination; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nominations  in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order; that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Madam President, there again, I just gave him what he  asked for, and he said it wasn't enough. He has to have every other  Senator come to the floor and agree to this.   Let me say that this is a unanimous consent request for four U.S.  attorneys who have gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee, which  Senator Padilla and I serve on. They went through that bipartisan  committee, and they have been reported to the floor. This is customary,  ordinary. There is nothing controversial about these individuals, but  still and all not  [[Page S4702]]  good enough. He has objected to even having a vote later in the day on  the very nominations that he asked for earlier.   You can't have it both ways. If you are going to vote no against  these nominees under any condition, make it clear. To say you want to  clear it with every other Senator, they have been given notice of this  unanimous consent request. They could be here on the floor if they  wanted to object personally. To my knowledge, this junior Senator from  Ohio is the only one objecting, and it is a shame he is because these  U.S. attorneys are needed desperately in California, Mississippi, Ohio,  and my home State of Illinois.   And to think that what we are going through is to the point at which  a Congressman who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee came  to Chicago to hold a hearing this week to outline how much trouble we  have with violent crime. We do have problems with violent crime. We  certainly need a U.S. attorney, who is one of the persons up for this  nomination, to do her best to make sure that we have a safer community  in Chicago.   How can she do it if she can't clear the Senate floor?   I hope the Senator will get it straight as to what exactly he is  trying to achieve here. If he wanted a rollcall vote, I just offered to  it him, and it wasn't good enough. I am going to be returning regularly  to the floor to make this unanimous consent request.   Sadly, during the period of time that we debate this, crime will  continue to be committed in Ohio, in Illinois, in Mississippi, and in  California that, in many instances, could have been avoided if the  Senate, on a regular dispatch approach, decided to move these  nominations forward as they have been traditionally.   To say that you want the Department of Justice to grind to a halt in  the United States of America, come on. That is the kind of statement  you make in a speech, come back later, and say: Well, I didn't mean  that exactly. Certainly, no one means that exactly.   We don't want the Department of Justice to stop its fight against  narcotics and fentanyl in the United States that are claiming thousands  of lives, and slowing down that process here on the Senate floor is  just unacceptable.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed  to executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar  Nos. 129 and 266; that there be 2 minutes for debate, equally divided  in the usual form, for each nomination; that upon the use or yielding  back of time, the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or  debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's actions and  the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, for those who are following this debate,  we had four nominations that were being held. Two were just approved.  We will keep working to make sure all four are approved. The two  remaining are in the States of Illinois and Ohio. We feel just as  intensely about those vacancies as all the others, but we are seizing  the moment to order a rollcall vote on the two that have been approved  by both sides.   I yield the floor.
