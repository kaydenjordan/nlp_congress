Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5892.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5892.   The effects of the opioid public health emergency can be seen  throughout our local communities, and maybe most acutely in our  workplaces.   According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence,  70 percent of the almost 15 million Americans misusing drugs, including  opioids, are currently employed. Furthermore, according to the Bureau  of Labor Statistics, the number of overdose fatalities on the job has  increased by at least 25 percent annually since 2012.   These statistics serve as a reminder that workplaces are not immune  from the worsening epidemic and that workplaces can often serve as  crucial places to provide outreach and assistance to those who are  struggling with opioid addiction.   The Committee on Education and the Workforce has been examining this  critical issue.   In February of this year, the Subcommittee on Health, Employment,  Labor, and Pensions and the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections held  a joint hearing to examine how the epidemic is affecting workplaces,  and to hear from business owners who have taken steps to address  problems of substance abuse and addiction in the workplace.   Some of the initiatives these businesses have taken are not only  inspiring, but they also show promising results. The U.S. Department of  Labor could benefit greatly from more information about the solutions  originating from the private sector to address the challenges of  maintaining a healthy workforce in the face of the opioid epidemic.   H.R. 5892 will create an advisory committee to make recommendations  to the Secretary of Labor on what specific actions the Department of  Labor can take to provide informational resources that will help  mitigate some of the most harmful effects of opioid abuse in the  workplace. The advisory committee will convene twice a year to discuss  successful employer initiatives and report best practices, and will  sunset after 3 years.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan bill will be an instrumental part of  the greater solution to fight the opioid epidemic and support employers  who are working to promote workplace safety and assist with employee  recovery.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H5131]]         Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I,  again, reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder  of my time.   Madam Speaker, I also thank my Democratic colleagues for their  efforts on behalf of this bill as well.   At a time when businesses, large and small, are noticing the effects  of this crisis, opioid abuse, on employee health and economic  productivity, the active coordination between the Department of Labor  and private stakeholders, prompted by this bill, is vital to securing  the continued safety of the American workplace.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5892,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 1091) to establish a Federal Task Force to  Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1091         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Grandparents       Raising Grandchildren Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) More than 2,500,000 grandparents in the United States       are the primary caretaker of their grandchildren, and experts       report that such numbers are increasing as the opioid       epidemic expands.        (2) Between 2009 and 2016, the incidence of parental       alcohol or other drug use as a contributing factor for       children's out-of-home placement rose from 25.4 to 37.4       percent.        (3) When children cannot remain safely with their parents,       placement with relatives is preferred over placement in       foster care with nonrelatives because placement with       relatives provides stability for children and helps them       maintain family connections.        (4) The number of foster children placed with a grandparent       or other relative increased from 24 percent in 2006 to 32       percent in 2016, according to data from the Department of       Health and Human Services.        (5) Grandparents' lives are enhanced by caring for their       grandchildren; the overwhelming majority of grandparents       report experiencing significant benefits in serving as their       grandchildren's primary caregivers.        (6) Providing full-time care to their grandchildren may       decrease grandparents' ability to address their own physical       and mental health needs and personal well-being.        (7) Grandparents would benefit from better coordination and       dissemination of information and resources available to       support them in their caregiving responsibilities.       SEC. 3.

In this Act:        (1) Advisory council.--In this Act, the term ``Advisory       Council'' means the Advisory Council to Support Grandparents       Raising Grandchildren that is established under section 3.

(B) The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       of the Senate.        (C) The Committee on Education and the Workforce of the       House of Representatives.        (D) The Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1091, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment to S. 1091,  the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act.   As the opioid public health emergency continues to unfold, it has  become clear that the epidemic is not contained to a single generation.  Rather, it affects everyone, from infants who have been left behind by  an addicted parent or a guardian, to seniors who have stepped into the  role of primary caregiver to take care of their grandchildren.   At present, there are more than 2.5 million grandparents in the  United States who are the primary caretaker of their grandchildren.  Experts believe this number is increasing in large part due to the rise  of the opioid epidemic.   A child going to live with his or her grandparent is often the best  outcome in a difficult situation, as it allows for important family  connections to remain intact and can reduce the trauma a child feels.  However, it can present certain challenges to grandparents who lack the  necessary information and tools to provide their grandchildren with  loving attention and proper care.   The House amendment to S. 1091, the Supporting Grandparents Raising  Grandchildren Act, will help to support these grandparents in their  caregiving responsibilities. The bill directs the creation of an  advisory council, led by the Department of Health and Human Services,  to identify and disseminate useful information to grandparents who are  primary caretakers of their grandchildren, placing a special emphasis  on those families who have been impacted by the opioid epidemic.   The advisory council will focus on disseminating information to help  grandparents meet the health, educational, nutritional, and other needs  of the children they are caring for.   The House amendment ensures the council will solicit input from State  and local entities and grandparents themselves to inform the best  practices, and ensure the most useful information is in circulation. It  also terminates the council after 3 years, to ensure the information is  disseminated in a timely manner.   Madam Speaker, with so many parents struggling with addiction,  grandparents are increasingly coming to the rescue. It is important  that we provide these grandparents with the information they need to  care for their grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the  gentlewoman is, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues across the aisle for their  efforts in this regard.   I too agree that, absolutely, we need healthcare reform to ensure  that people have the kind of coverage that covers things like opioid  and substance abuse. Part of that effort means that people can afford a  good insurance policy and choose the kind of coverage they want so that  they are not priced out of the market and go without any insurance at  all, which is really a problem with some of these people suffering  through this epidemic.   Madam Speaker, in conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of S. 1091, and I yield back the balance of my time.
