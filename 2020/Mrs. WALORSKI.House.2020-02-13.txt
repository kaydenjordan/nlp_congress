 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 2,411 unborn  children whose remains were finally laid to rest with dignity yesterday  in South Bend, Indiana.   These victims of Indiana's most prolific abortionist would be in  their late teens now, graduating from high school and entering into  college, but their innocent lives were cut short, and they were denied  a proper burial. Instead, their remains sat for almost 2 years in a  garage, a car trunk, in moldy boxes and Styrofoam coolers.   Such callous disregard for human life should shake us to the core.  These children deserve justice and dignity.   To ensure this never happens again, the House must pass the Dignity  for Aborted Children Act to build on Indiana's law, upheld by the  Supreme Court, that requires dignified treatment of aborted fetal  remains.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in observing a moment  of silence for the thousands of innocent victims who were laid to rest  yesterday.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 79.   Of course, I believe in equal rights. Women should never face  discrimination and harassment. I believe we should be empowering women  and girls to achieve their dreams.   So it is disappointing today to stand in this Chamber and see this  important issue turned into some type of political stunt. The deadline  for States to ratify the ERA passed nearly 4 decades ago. Even Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg has stated the only path forward is to start over.   Let's be honest, this is not about equality or women's rights. This  is about enshrining unrestricted abortion in the Constitution and  allowing full taxpayer funding for abortion. Now is not the time to be  weakening pro-life protections.   Yesterday, in South Bend, Indiana, in my district, the remains of  2,411 victims of abortion were finally given a dignified burial after  spending 20 years in moldy Styrofoam boxes in the back of the doctor/ abortionist's car and in his basement.                                time  0945    These unborn boys and girls would be young men and women today  entering college.   Moments ago, we stood on this House floor together and we offered a  moment of silence that these innocent lives were taken and there were  victims, over 2,400.   Madam Speaker, I would ask that, together, we stand again to defend  the rights of the most vulnerable among us, that we stand together  today for the sanctity of life, to lift women up, to protect women, and  to strengthen families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this  misguided resolution.
