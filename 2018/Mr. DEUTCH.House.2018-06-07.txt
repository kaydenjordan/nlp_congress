 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome my constituent, Pastor  Eddie Bevill, to offer the opening prayer today.  [[Page H4858]]    Eddie is the founding pastor of Parkridge Church in Coral Springs,  Florida, where he has served since 1992. Pastor Bevill's leadership and  service has been recognized with tenures on the Florida Baptist State  Board of Missions as well as the Gulf Stream Baptist Association Board  in Broward County, Florida. He is a pillar of our community. I am  honored to welcome him to Washington today.   After the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, our community was  gripped by unspeakable pain, confusion, frustration, and anger. In the  moments, days, and months since, Pastor Bevill has offered a voice of  peace, arms of comfort, and a guiding hand to surviving families,  students, teachers, and others in our community.   At a time when it was so easy to be lost in despair, our community  has been so fortunate to have Pastor Bevill lead us toward a place of  hope and solace.   Pastor Bevill is joined here today by his wife Laura. They have been  married since 1988 and have four children.   I know that my wife Jill joins me in welcoming Laura today in support  of Eddie as he offers today's opening prayer.                            ____________________
