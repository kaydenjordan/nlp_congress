 Madam Speaker, as Biden continues to  push the insulting $3.5 trillion Big Government socialist scheme, real  Americans will see their Thanksgiving 2021 ``shaping up to be the most  expensive meal in the history of the holiday,'' as reported by MSNBC.   The price of turkey already costs 25 cents more per pound. It is not  the only part of the holiday to take a bite out of your family account,  with Biden inflation destroying jobs.   ``Nearly every component of the traditional American Thanksgiving  dinner, from the disposable aluminum turkey roasting pan to the coffee  and pie, will cost more this year,'' as sadly admitted by The New York  Times.   Democrat elite think they are smarter than anyone, and they believe  Democrat voters are ignorant to believe that $3.5 trillion in spending  costs zero dollars.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America.   Congratulations to the people of Virginia and New Jersey and  Springdale Mayor-elect Justin Ricard.                            ____________________
