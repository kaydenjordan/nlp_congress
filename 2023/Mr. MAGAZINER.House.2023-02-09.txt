 Mr. Speaker, February 20th will mark the 20th  anniversary of a tragic fire at the Station Nightclub in West Warwick,  Rhode Island, that took the lives of 100 people and injured hundreds of  others. That horrific fire ripped a hole in our community and left a  deep scar on Rhode Island, one which we still feel every day.   But Rhode Islanders are resilient, and we support one another in the  face of tragedy. On that night in West Warwick, the heroism of  emergency responders and ordinary people saved countless lives. In the  wake of that horror, our State came together to mourn and memorialize  those we lost and to help each other heal.   Now, two decades after that awful night, I will submit the names of  those who were lost into the Congressional Record.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring all of the victims, and to  recommit ourselves to promoting fire safety across our country so that  such a tragedy can never occur again.    Louis S.
