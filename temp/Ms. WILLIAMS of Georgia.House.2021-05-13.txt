 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  Chair Waters' Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act and  amendments that I have been able to make to the bill.    Our work in Congress must focus on how to make life better for the  most marginalized in our communities. This bill centers that goal by  ensuring fair debt collection and consumer protection. Today, I am  offering two amendments to further advance that work.   Currently, a borrower's credit score isn't negatively affected if  they miss a Federal student loan payment during the pandemic. This  protection was made possible with bipartisan support. It is time that  we extend the same protection to private student loan borrowers, and I  am happy to have partnered with Congresswoman Alma Adams to advance an  amendment that does just that.   I also authored an amendment that commissions a report to analyze  racial disparities in debt collection practices and recommend  solutions. Additional study in this area will help us ensure greater  equity going forward.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments and the overall bill  before us today.
