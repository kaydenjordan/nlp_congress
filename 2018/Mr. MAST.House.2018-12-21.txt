 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1063) designating room H-226 of the United States  Capitol as the ``Lincoln Room''.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1063         Whereas Abraham Lincoln was elected to the House of       Representatives in 1846 to represent the 7th Congressional       District of Illinois in the Thirtieth Congress from March       1847 to March 1849;        Whereas Abraham Lincoln served the people for 15 years as a       State Legislator, Member of Congress, and President of the       United States;        Whereas Abraham Lincoln was a member of the Illinois       General Assembly for four terms and was respected as an       effective leader of his party and a popular campaigner;        Whereas during Congressman Lincoln's tenure, the room now       designated as room H-226 of the United States Capitol was       used as the post office of the House, where he spent almost       every morning exchanging stories near the fireplace;        Whereas the old post office space was just steps away from       Congressman Lincoln's desk, where he worked and voted and is       now marked by a gold plaque on the floor of Statuary Hall;        Whereas Congressman Lincoln was known to be the champion       story-teller of the Capitol, having an endless repertoire of       tales;        Whereas Abraham Lincoln was one of America's greatest       presidents, whose life was a story of adversity,       perseverance, and leadership; and        Whereas when the United States was at its darkest hour,       Abraham Lincoln fought to end slavery and brought the country       back together: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That room H-226 of the United States Capitol is       designated as the ``Lincoln Room''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 1063.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1036 designates the room H-226 of the U.S.  Capitol as the Lincoln Room.   I appreciate my colleagues' work on this and find it an appropriate  honor for such a distinguished leader of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7318) to amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016  to ensure that the Public Buildings Reform Board has adequate time to  carry out the responsibilities of the Board, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7318         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FEDERAL ASSETS SALE.         (a) In General.--Section 4(c)(2) of the Federal Assets Sale       and Transfer Act of 2016 (40 U.S.C. 1303 note; Public Law       114-287) is amended--        (1) by striking subparagraph (B);        (2) by striking the paragraph designation and heading and       all that follows through ``In selecting'' in subparagraph (A)       in the matter preceding clause (i) and inserting the       following:        ``(2) Appointments.--In selecting''; and        (3) by redesignating clauses (i) through (iv) as       subparagraphs (A) through (D), respectively, and indenting       appropriately.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7318.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7318 amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer  Act of 2016 to align the timeline for the sale of unneeded properties  with the appointment of the Public Buildings Reform Board.   This bill will result in more savings for the taxpayer by providing  the Board with sufficient time to identify properties to be sold or  redeveloped.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7319) to amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016  to provide flexibility with respect to the leaseback of certain Federal  real property, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7319.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7319 amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer  Act of 2016 to provide leaseback flexibility in certain circumstances  to facilitate the sale of property and maximize the return to the  taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7329) to make technical corrections to provisions of law enacted  by the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, and for  other purposes.
