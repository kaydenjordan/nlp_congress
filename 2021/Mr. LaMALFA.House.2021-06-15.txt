 Madam Speaker, in California, we are known for having a  lot of marijuana grows. But we have to  [[Page H2803]]  recognize this is still an illegal substance at the Federal level.   We have, in my district--it is amazing--many hundreds of illegal  hothouses that have been planted in Siskiyou County full of marijuana  grows.   Now, we haven't had many resources to help out up there until very  recently, when a sheriff up there took it upon himself to eradicate  these grows, to go against the county ordinances there, to go against  other ordinances on water use, chemical use. They are using chemicals  that are not even available to farmers that have long been made illegal  in this country and in the State of California.   These grows cause irreparable damage to the environment and wildlife  and are even dangerous to people who happen to traipse in there  accidentally, with folks who are so heavily armed. They are cartels  from out of the country that are in there doing this operation--all  illegally. Why do we allow this to go on?   These marijuana grows are dangerous and are against the law. The  Federal Government needs to be a stronger partner in backing the locals  on eradicating these grows because of how much damage they do to the  community, to the environment, to the wildlife, and to the overall  feeling people have of their community up there. We need to help more.                            ____________________
