Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak  in support of my amendment to Division A of H.R. 3354, the ``Interior  and Environment Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018.''   Let me also thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for  their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor.   Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Smithsonian  Institution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and  Space Museum; the Museum of African Art; the Museum of the American  Indian; and the National Portrait Gallery.   The Smithsonian also operates another national treasure: the National  Zoo.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important  message from the Congress of the United States.   The Jackson Lee Amendment simply provides that:   ``Sec.___. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used  to limit outreach programs administered by the Smithsonian  Institution.''   This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered to the Interior  and Environment Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 2822) that was  approved by voice vote on July 7, 2016.   Mr. Chair, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring Smithsonian  scholars in art, history and science out of ``the nation's attic'' and  into their own backyard.   Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian in Washington,  D.C.   But in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, ``the increase and  diffusion of knowledge,'' the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even  greater audience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities  who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history  offered by the Smithsonian.   The Smithsonian's outreach programs serve millions of Americans,  thousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50  states, through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of  educational resources via publications, lectures and presentations,  training programs, and websites.   Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with  Smithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate  institutions and others across the nation.   The Smithsonian's outreach activities support community-based  cultural and educational organizations around the country.   They ensure a vital, recurring, and high-impact Smithsonian presence  in all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a  network of affiliations.   Smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the  Institution and targeted audiences (African American, Asian American,  Latino, Native American, and new American) and provide kindergarten  through college-age museum education and outreach opportunities.   These outreach programs enhance K-12 science education programs,  facilitate the Smithsonian's scholarly interactions with students and  scholars at universities, museums, and other research institutions; and  disseminate results related to the research and collections strengths  of the Institution.   The programs that provide the critical mass of Smithsonian outreach  activity are:   1. the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES);   2. the Smithsonian Affiliations, the Smithsonian Center for Education  and Museum Studies (SCEMS);   3. National Science Resources Center (NSRC);   4. the Smithsonian Institution Press (SIP);   5. the Office of Fellowships (OF); and   6. the Smithsonian Associates (TSA), which receives no federal  funding.   To achieve the goal of increasing public engagement, SITES directs  some of its federal resources to develop Smithsonian Across America: A  Celebration of National Pride.   This ``mobile museum,'' which will feature Smithsonian artifacts from  the most iconic (presidential portraits, historic American flags, Civil  War records, astronaut uniforms, etc.) to the simplest items of  everyday life (family quilts, prairie schoolhouse furnishings, historic  lunch boxes, multilingual store front and street signs, etc.), has been  a long-standing organizational priority of the Smithsonian.   SITES ``mobile museum'' is the only traveling exhibit format able to  guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during  sustained periods of economic retrenchment, but also because it is  imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling  financially yet eager to participate in Smithsonian outreach.   For communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic  downturn, the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions, the  ``mobile museum'' promises to answer an ever-growing demand for  Smithsonian shows in the field.   A single, conventional SITES exhibit can reach a maximum of 12  locations over a two- to three-year period.   In contrast, a ``mobile museum'' exhibit can visit up to three venues  per week in the course of only one year, at no cost to the host  institution or community.   The net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach  locations to which SITES shows can travel annually.   And in addition to its flexibility in making short-term stops in  cities and towns from coast-to-coast, a ``mobile museum'' has the  [[Page H7137]]  advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people  live, work, and take part in leisure time activities.   By establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these, SITES  will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million,  but also advance a key Smithsonian performance objective: to develop  exhibit approaches that address diverse audiences, including population  groups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions.   SITES also will be the public exhibitions' face of the Smithsonian's  National Museum of African American History and Culture, as that new  Museum comes online.   Providing national access to projects that will introduce the  American public to the Museum's mission, SITES in FY 2008 will tour  such stirring exhibitions as NASA ART: 50 Years of Exploration; 381  Days: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story; Beyond: Visions of Planetary  Landscapes; The Way We Worked: Photographs from the National Archives;  and More Than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's  Archives of American Art.   To meet the growing demand among smaller community and ethnic museums  for an exhibition celebrating the Latino experience, SITES provided a  scaled-down version of the National Museum of American History's 4,000- square-foot exhibition about legendary entertainer Celia Cruz.   Two 1,500-square-foot exhibitions, one about Crow Indian history and  the other on basket traditions, will give Smithsonian visitors beyond  Washington a taste of the Institution's critically acclaimed National  Museum of the American Indian.   Two more exhibits, ``In Plane View'' and ``Earth from Space,''  provided visitors an opportunity to experience the Smithsonian's  recently opened, expansive National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy  Center.   For almost 30 years, The Smithsonian Associates--the highly regarded  educational arm of the Smithsonian Institution--has arranged Scholars  in the Schools programs.   Through this tremendously successful and well-received educational  outreach program, the Smithsonian shares its staff--hundreds of experts  in art, history and science--with the national community at a local  level.   The mission of Smithsonian Affiliations is to build a strong national  network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish  active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the  country.   There are currently 138 affiliates located in the United States,  Puerto Rico, and Panama.   By working with museums of diverse subject areas and scholarly  disciplines, both emerging and well-established, Smithsonian  Affiliations is building partnerships through which audiences and  visitors everywhere will be able to share in the great wealth of the  Smithsonian while building capacity and expertise in local communities.   The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) strives to increase the  number of ethnically diverse students participating in effective  science programs based on NSRC products and services.   The Center develops and implements a national outreach strategy that  will increase the number of school districts (currently more than 800)  that are implementing NSRC K-8 programs.   The NSRC is striving to further enhance its program activity with a  newly developed scientific outreach program introducing communities and  school districts to science through literacy initiatives.   In addition, through the building of the multicultural Alliance  Initiative, the Smithsonian's outreach programs seek to develop new  approaches to enable the public to gain access to Smithsonian  collections, research, education, and public programs that reflect the  diversity of the American people, including underserved audiences of  ethnic populations and persons with disabilities.   For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee  Amendment and thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for  their courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together  this excellent legislation.   Mr. Chair, I also want to thank you for this opportunity to speak in  support of my amendments to Division A of H.R. 3354, the Interior and  Environment Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and to commend  Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their leadership in  shepherding this bill through the legislative process.   Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service,  the National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution, which  operates our national museums including the National Zoo.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important  message from the Congress of the United States.   The Jackson Lee Amendment emphasizes the importance of Urban Wildlife  Refuge Partnerships and urban forests, and preserves our ability to  return urban areas to healthy and safe living environments for our  children.   Similar amendments were offered and accepted in the Interior and  Environment Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. 2822),  Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 2643), and Fiscal Year 2007 (H.R. 5386), and  were adopted by voice vote.   Mr. Chair, surveys indicate that some urban forests are in serious  danger.   In the past 30 years alone, we have lost 30 percent of all our urban  trees--a loss of over 600 million trees.   Eighty percent (80 percent) of the American population lives in the  dense quarters of a city.   Reforestation programs return a tool of nature to a concrete area  that can help to remove air pollution, filter out chemicals and  agricultural waste in water, and save communities millions of dollars  in storm water management costs.   I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban  reforestation.   In addition, havens of green in the middle of a city can have  beneficial effects on a community's health, both physical and  psychological, as well as increase property value of surrounding real  estate.   Reforestation of cities is an innovative way of combating urban  sprawl and deterioration.   Mr. Chair, a real commitment to enhancing our environment involves  both the protection of existing natural resources and active support  for restoration and improvement projects.   Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group,  estimated that the tree cover lost in the greater Washington  metropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540  million cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have  taken more than $1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.   Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen.   People breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.   A typical person consumes about 38 lb of oxygen per year.   A healthy tree, say a 32 ft tall ash tree, can produce about 260 lb  of oxygen annually--two trees supply the oxygen needs of a person for a  year!   Trees help reduce pollution by capturing particulates like dust and  pollen with their leaves.   A mature tree absorbs from 120 to 240 lbs of the small particles and  gases of air pollution.   Trees help combat the effects of ``greenhouse'' gases, the increased  carbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels that is causing our  atmosphere to ``heat up.''   Trees help cool down the overall city environment by shading asphalt,  concrete and metal surfaces.   Buildings and paving in city centers create a heat-island effect.   A mature tree canopy reduces air temperatures by about 5-10 degrees  Fahrenheit.   A 25 foot tree reduces annual heating and cooling costs of a typical  residence by 8 to 12 percent, producing an average annual savings of  $120 per American household.   Proper tree plantings around buildings can slow winter winds, and  reduce annual energy use for home heating by 4-22 percent.   Mr. Chair, trees play a vital role in making our cities more  sustainable and more livable.   The Jackson Lee Amendment simply provides for continued support to  programs like Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnerships that reforest our  urban areas.   For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee  Amendment and thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for  their courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together  this legislation.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                   Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Grijalva    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mitchell). The gentleman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's  support for robust funding of the Superfund program, particularly the  cleanup program.   There is a need for Congress to make progress to address the backlog  of 1,300 sites on the national priority list. The bill proposes to do  so with a $47.6 million increase for cleanup work. However, the  amendment proposes merely to increase EPA's enforcement budget by $12  million, with a stated objective of reducing BLM's oil and gas  management program.   The committee wrote a balanced bill, and I support the wise use of  Federal oil and gas resources. Therefore, I oppose the amendment and  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    I would be happy to engage the gentleman from Colorado  in a colloquy.    I would be happy to engage the gentleman from Colorado  in a colloquy.    I would be happy to engage the gentleman from Colorado  in a colloquy.    I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his  amendment, and I fully agree with his concerns about the backlogs, but  I have concerns with the proposed offset and appreciate the intention  to withdraw it.   The committee has made a concerted effort in recent years to fix  these problems and has increased the recovery account by almost $4  million over the last 2 years.   Under House Republican pressure over the past 7 years, the Fish and  Wildlife Service has delisted more species than all other previous  years combined, but, clearly, we still have a long way to go.  [[Page H7139]]    The Service has been directed and funded to complete all 5-year  reviews within the period required by law, and the committee will  continue to press the Service to see that they eliminate these  backlogs.   I thank the gentleman again for raising this issue, and I pledge to  work with him on this.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  504, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2. The list of  the amendments included in the en bloc is at the desk and has been  agreed to by both sides.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments en bloc.

None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to propose to repeal section 105(a)(2) or section       105(b) of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (43       U.S.C. 1331 note).               Amendment No. 54 Offered by Mr. Burgess of Texas         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ____.

Amendment No. 70 Offered by Mr. Emmer of Minnesota         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to withdraw National Forest System lands within the       Rainy River Watershed on the Superior National Forest from       disposition under United States mineral and geothermal       leasing laws.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert) and the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum) each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc and urge  its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment. I certainly urge Members to support it.   This bill maintains the increases provided last year for deferred  maintenance and increases the construction account by $10 million. This  amendment will further our efforts to address the longstanding deferred  maintenance needs.   I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your support of the  amendment, and I would ask all Members on both sides of the aisle to  support our national parks and support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 12 will  not be offered.                   Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Griffith    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman's overall goal  is to continue funding for the AML pilot project, consistent with a  fiscal year 2017 enacted level, and structure for the six Appalachian  States.   Therefore, we can accept this package of amendments at this time,  work toward maintaining funding for 6 States in a final fiscal year  2018 enacted bill. If we are able to achieve that goal, I hope we can  count on the gentleman's support to pass both this House package and to  enact the 2018 end-of-year spending bill.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, once again, I appreciate the challenges  that the gentleman is suffering in his State and throughout Appalachia,  but I cannot support any more deeper cuts to the EPA, so I must oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Jody B. Hice) for the purpose of a colloquy.   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman  Frelinghuysen and Interior Subcommittee Chairman Calvert for their  efforts on this legislation, and I thank them for the opportunity to  speak today.   I am committed to pursuing a comprehensive all-of-the-above energy  strategy, and I would like to take this time to engage in a colloquy on  section 438 of this bill, pertaining to offshore wind development. As a  representative from a coastal area, I want to ensure that all offshore  energy development is pursued in a pragmatic manner.   Section 438 restricts funding for the Department of the Interior to  administer offshore wind leases within 24 nautical miles off the coast  of Maryland. This language hinders offshore wind development by  imposing unprecedented and burdensome requirements on three existing  leases.   Typically, offshore wind turbines are constructed roughly 12 nautical  miles from the coastline, which is generally out of sight from shore.  By doubling the setback, section 438 unreasonably restricts these  projects and sets a poor policy precedent for future development.   Furthermore, modifying the terms and conditions of the leases  violates the sanctity of the lease and creates considerable uncertainty  for companies pursuing any offshore wind project.   It is critical that we establish regulatory and contractual certainty  in all areas of natural resource development. America's offshore wind  industry is in its infancy, and the policies and precedents that we set  today will affect investment long into the future.   The language contained in section 438 is concerning for this reason,  and I look forward to working with the gentleman from Maryland in the  future to find a more appropriate solution.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Harris) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Harris) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned at our full committee  markup, I understood that my colleague, Dr. Harris, was offering his  amendment to address local concerns from his residents with respect to  the visibility of offshore turbines. With all of these offshore  projects, many varying viewpoints need to be taken into account. I  appreciate that we have been able to discuss many of these views and  concerns here today.   It is my hope that we can work with the authorizing committees of  jurisdiction, the administration, and all interested stakeholders to  identify some better solutions as we move forward through the fiscal  year 2018 process.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Tipton). The Chair understands that amendment  No. 14 will not be offered.           Amendment No. 15 Offered by Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am certainly prepared to accept this amendment. I understand the  importance of the program to the gentleman from Pennsylvania and other  Members in the Appalachian region. I look forward to working with him  and all of the interested Members.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, given our allocation, which was $824 million  below the fiscal year 2017 level, we had to find areas to trim. It is  also important to note that the bill does not support the elimination  of the program, as has been proposed in the President's budget. It was  the committee's effort to find some middle ground.   While I can certainly appreciate the gentleman's interest to maintain  fiscal year 2017 enacted level, the allocation of the committee doesn't  support those levels. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate my friend's support  for the research conducted at the EPA, and particularly the Research  Triangle Park. I am a supporter of the world class research that occurs  at RTP with respect to the computational toxicology program. That  research has helped to identify alternative high throughput testing  methodologies that have reduced the number of animals used in  laboratories.   Given the current allocation, however, which is $824 million below  the  [[Page H7145]]  fiscal year 2017 level, we had to find areas to trim. We certainly  don't have a funding level that can support the fiscal year 2017  enacted levels, but we tried to do the best we could to find common  ground.   I certainly look forward to working with the gentleman in the future,  if we happily come to some kind of budget agreement, where we can  reallocate funds to something as important as this. But, again, because  of our allocation, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have to acknowledge that  the chairman did a pretty good job of describing some of the research  that we have underway in North Carolina and around the country, and I  know he understands that and wants to support it.   I also know that we have got to do better than the allocations  represented in this eight-bill omnibus effort. So I pledge to work with  him and other colleagues to achieve that kind of agreement, and then  also to revisit this account and other accounts that we know need  attention if we are to do our duty as representatives of our  communities and also maintain the investments a great country must  maintain.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).   The amendment was rejected.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Lance) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Lance) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Slaughter).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    While the amendment itself is drafted in order as a  general increase to EPA geographic programs, the gentleman proposes to  fund a program that was not requested in the budget and is not  authorized.   Further, he proposes to reduce grants from DERA, the DERA program,  which is a key program for improving air quality in areas like mine  that are in a nonattainment area with existing standards.   For those reasons, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am sorry. I didn't hear the gentleman, and  I happily accept his offer to withdraw the amendment. I will happily  work with him to see if we can't work some time in the future to find  room for this program that the gentleman is obviously supportive of.    Mr. Chair, I won't take the 2 minutes. I just want to  let the gentleman know I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I  encourage adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment because  water infrastructure remains a top priority of this committee. I urge  adoption of the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  reluctant opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I think it is important that EPA right the  wrong that was caused by the Gold King Mine spill and ensure that the  affected States, and the Tribal areas, have the resources they need  following the spill.   The FY17 bill included $4 million to work with the States and Tribes  on an independent water monitoring plan as authorized by the WIIN Act.  Therefore, the proposed level in this amendment would exceed the  authorized level. And for that reason, I must oppose the gentleman's  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman very  much for his comments and look forward to working with him on this  issue.   We arrived at $6 million for water monitoring after consulting with  the State of New Mexico, and, in fact, it is my understanding that New  Mexico has about $15 million in priority needs related to the Gold King  Mine spill, including $6 million specifically for monitoring.   And so we checked with the State before we came down this evening to  debate this amendment, and what the State of New Mexico shared with me,  they report that they have only received $577,193 in Federal funding to  support monitoring, which is less than 10 percent of what my home State  believes is needed.   In addition, the Navajo Nation and other impacted communities still  need support from the Federal Government to help recover from this  disaster. So, again, I look forward to working with both the chairman  and with the ranking member to ensure that all of the communities  impacted by this spill are made whole, and that we provide appropriate  support to vital water and monitoring efforts in New Mexico, Colorado,  Arizona, Utah, the Southern Ute Tribe, and the Navajo Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico  will be postponed.   It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House  Report 115-297.                    Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Beyer    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 36  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    In 1977, Congress made a deliberate policy choice to  exempt ordinary farming, silviculture, ranching, mining, related  activities, from the requirements to obtain Clean Water Act permits  when undertaken as normal activities: prepare and maintain land, roads,  ponds, and ditches.   Unfortunately, we heard concern for several years that, under the  Obama administration, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers changed  implementation of these provisions to significantly reduce the  application of the statutory exemptions.   Section 430 of the bill makes clear that Congress has always intended  that statutory exemptions are to have meaning, that the agencies cannot  simply ignore the will of Congress as set out by law.   For these reasons and a number of others, I oppose the amendment and  urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a strong ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 37 Offered by Mr. Beyer    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 37  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Since day one, everything about EPA's waters of the U.S.  rule has been flawed. The Obama administration claimed that it was not  expanding the waters under their jurisdiction, but we know that more  permits will be required.                                time  1915    The Obama administration claimed that the rule was based on sound  science but only released to science after publishing the rule. The  previous administration changed the name to call this the clean water  rule and took to social media to lobby the public, which led to  questions about whether the EPA violated law, which the GAO later  confirmed.   It was clear the previous administration had an agenda to implement a  rule, and they weren't going to be told otherwise. Thankfully, the  Sixth Circuit Court put a stay on that rule.   The language of the FY18 bill authorizes the withdrawal of the Waters  of the U.S. rule and seeks to bring resolution to the issue. The  language in this bill is consistent with the steps the new  administration has already taken.   For that and many other reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).   The amendment was rejected.                   Amendment No. 38 Offered by Mr. Ellison    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, where I come from, Midland Empire, which  is where I have lived my whole life, is part of the South Coast Air  Quality Basin, which has been a nonattainment ozone area for about as  long as the Federal standard for ozone has existed. But it is not for a  lack of trying, as the south coast has a long history--actually the  longest history--of implementing some of the most stringent Air  Pollution Control measures in the entire United States.   We have done about all we can to reduce emissions from stationary  sources. Our issue is the amount of cars and trucks traveling through  the region. So you will find no stronger advocate for clean air than  myself, which is why this bill funds targeted Air Shed Grant Programs  and DERA grants. States and communities need resources to help meet the  overlapping 2008 and 2015 air quality standards.   To be clear, the language in the bill does not change ozone  standards. It gives communities some administrative relief to allocate  more resources to meeting the 2015 standard of 70 parts per billion.   Similar language, by the way, passed the House in July. Therefore, I  urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, Mr. Chairman, I would reiterate that California  has done more to clean air than virtually any other State in the Union  based upon its regulatory structure that we created and I continue to  support.   But technologies do not exist to meet standards that have been set  out by the Obama administration. So this gives us time to do what we  need to do, and that is to clean up ozone, and that is exactly what we  are going to do. But this is not the amendment that is going to do  that.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose that amendment strongly and urge a ``no''  vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.  [[Page H7153]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the importance of agencies  working together to protect our coastal resources for future  generations. We must also ensure that such coordination is done  carefully with congressional input to ensure that it does not lead to  Federal overreach.                                time  1930    When the previous administration created the National Ocean Policy  through executive order, the impacts were so broad, so sweeping, that  it would have allowed the Federal Government to evaluate everything  from agricultural practices, mining, energy production, fishing, and  anything else with activities impacting our oceans.   This subcommittee asked the CEQ, DOI, and EPA on a number of  occasions to provide estimates of the impact of the policy on their  budgets, but the administration failed to work with Congress and  provide such information.   How can Congress adequately budget for something without knowing the  expected expenditures and implication of the policy?   The bottom line is, if the administration wants to fund the National  Ocean Policy with such sweeping implications, it must work with  Congress to provide relevant information and allow Congress to provide  the necessary oversight to prevent that Federal overreach.   I support the language of the underlying bill, and I encourage my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just because legislation isn't passed in  the House and the Senate and made into law doesn't mean that the  President can then go out and create an executive order. We have a  Constitution, and we have a process we must abide by. For that and  other reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no''  vote.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to support this amendment.   The recent court decision earlier this year overturned, really, a  longstanding EPA exemption for reporting from farms. These family farms  and ranchers across the Nation shouldn't be burdened with just more and  more paperwork to do an activity they have been doing for many, many  years in this country. It is not what Congress intended. Congress, last  I looked, still makes the laws around here.   I would support the gentleman's amendment and urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I was happy to accept the amendment in the  last year and will be happy to support it again this year.   With that, I urge its passage.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, once again, I really think that we need  to better utilize, in this Congress, in this institution, our policy  committees. They should be the first call for help if there are  questions, if there are concerns, if there are adjustments that need to  be made, not the appropriations committee, where there has been no  hearing on this.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the specific rule is now  being reconsidered by the Department of Interior, which is a good  thing, and I encourage my colleagues to support the Young amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  won't take nearly 1\1/2\ minutes. I just want to support the amendment.   I understand there are portions of the order that are widely accepted  and some parts that need to be reworked. I hope the Bureau gets the  message and works with all of the interested parties to improve onshore  order No. 3.   Mr. Chairman, I am happy to support the amendment.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I won't take 1 minute. I just want to support  the gentleman's amendment.   It is my hope that the gentlemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania may  be able to work with the new administration, find common ground on  approaches that will improve water quality in a flexible manner which  works for everybody.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote.    Will the gentleman from South Carolina yield?   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from  California.    Mr. Chair, I just want to let the gentleman know that I  oppose this amendment. I don't think we should stand in the way of  exploration research that could inform potential future decisions,  whether it is for or against drilling, but we need to know information  so once we know the potential, we can allow the agencies to weigh those  pros and cons.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, we do have hurricanes  coming. The Gulf of Mexico has prepared for hurricanes and dealt with  it in the oil and gas industry. That is not the issue.   We are talking about seismic surveys so that we as American  policymakers can see what may or may not be in the Earth for future  development. I would be willing to bet that, if it was natural gas that  was found off the coast of my home State of South Carolina, we would be  having a completely different conversation than if oil was found.   Let's at least have the guts to go out there and look and do G&G work  off the coast of the mid-Atlantic, the south Atlantic, and Florida and  find out what resources may or may not be there and whether they are  even recoverable or not.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Sanford).    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Walker) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.

The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my colleague for her  consistent work to protect taxpayer dollars, and I certainly support  her in all of the endeavors that she has done over the years to do  that. But this is not the type of approach that I can support. I  certainly like the idea of challenging the agencies, and I believe that  the agencies are going to meet that challenge to cut spending in a  responsible way.   This bill has made some very tough choices, within a subcommittee  allocation, that adheres to the current law. The Budget Committee asked  us to meet certain budget caps, and we have done so in this bill, while  asking that we increase spending for our national security, which is in  woeful shape.   So we had to make some very difficult tradeoffs. This bill, in its  current form, balances our needs, those tradeoffs carefully weighed for  their respectful impacts. We prioritize funding for fire suppression,  PILT, national parks--maybe the most popular agency in the United  States Government--and meeting our legal and moral obligations in  Indian Country.   Unfortunately, the process that the gentlewoman proposes--an across- the-board cut--would cut all those programs, including Indian health,  national park programs, and other programs, which already are taking  significant cuts.   This amendment makes no distinction between where we need to be  spending to invest in, say, energy independence, or to limit spending  to meet our deficit controls.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  but I certainly support the fact that we are trying to get our budgets  in line.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment.   This amendment discriminately cuts programs in this bill without any  thought to the merit of what is contained in this bill.   For example, in Indian Health Service, it really means fewer patients  being seen. It means fewer safety inspectors ensuring accidents don't  occur. Deferred maintenance in our drinking water, sanitation, and  infrastructure. We will lose investments in environmental  infrastructure, and, with that, jobs will be lost.   But the EPA, as has been pointed out quite a bit tonight for cuts and  for shifting funding around within this bill, is $2.2 billion less than  2010: 2,000 fewer employees. So employees are being pulled out of my  region and your region and all over to respond down in Harvey, meaning  work isn't being done. And I bet they are going to get the call to  leave their families and go look at sewer systems that have broken  apart, and water systems that don't have the ability for safe drinking  water. This is an agency that was funded and cut again in this bill,  and they have real jobs to do.   So when you discriminately cut across, you are also cutting across  those programs that we are relying right now for the EPA to do in  Harvey.  [[Page H7171]]    And then the Forest Service just notified us that they are out of  money for fire suppression. So we are going to cut the Forest Service  across 1 percent?   There might be places where you and I could agree, Mr. Chairman,  where we could be doing some cuts, and I could work with my colleagues  on it. But across the board, this year, in this bill, is something I  can't support.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.                                time  2215     Mr. Chairman, I understand, and I have taken a lot of  criticism over the last few years for cutting EPA's budget by 27  percent over the last number of years. However, I believe this  amendment is just going too far.   We have a new administration. We have a new Administrator. I think  there is a new day over at EPA. None of us want to see our rivers  polluted, toxic waste either on the ground or in the air, and I think  this administration will administer the law properly.   We may not always agree on where it is appropriate to draw the line  on environmental laws and regulations. Some think some standards are  too stringent, some think they are not tough enough, and that is a fair  policy debate to have. However, we know that no matter where the line  is ultimately drawn, there are individuals out there who are willingly  and knowingly trying to find ways around those laws. As such, EPA needs  the ability to look into criminal activity, whether it is illegal  dumping of waste, negligent dumping of toxics or oil, or the illegal  importation of products from other countries by those who would choose  to ignore United States law.   So we can debate the law and what is appropriate, but we can't give  criminals a free pass or ignore the laws that are on the books. Mr.  Chair, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I encourage a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns. I  would suggest that he go down to the Administrator's office, our new  Administrator, Mr. Pruitt, and meet with  [[Page H7172]]  him. I don't think that there is any desire on his part to militarize  the Environmental Protection Agency, and I think that he will see this  new Administrator wanting to do the right thing.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will  be postponed.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bergman, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.

Mr. Chair, last year, May of 2016, in the previous  administration, the Department of the Interior issued a finding of no  significant impact with respect to these operations; thus followed a  review of 23 oil and gas platforms currently operating offshore in the  State of California. The review drew upon the best available science  and reaffirms that these operations are operating safely, as they  should.  [[Page H7173]]    This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to restrict  offshore development, and I oppose the amendment and encourage my  colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Carbajal).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment was adopted on the floor  last year. I believe it is a good amendment. I encourage my colleagues  to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. I  appreciate my colleague for bringing the Bureau of Land Management's  Onshore Order No. 3 to the House's attention. Mr. Chair, I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, again, I appreciate what my chairman of the  subcommittee is saying in helping Members here, but we have a lot of  work to do just doing the oversight on how money is spent and  appropriated to make sure that we are doing our due diligence when we  appropriate funds, that they are used in the way that this Congress has  asked for them to be used. There is a Policy Committee to look at what  is happening with policy and to make sure that we move policy forward.   Mr. Chair, sometimes when amendments like this come to the floor, I  just think we are failing totally as a Congress to do our due diligence  in the Policy Committee, and then there is so much time spent on policy  in the Appropriations Committee, we fail to do our due diligence on  what has to happen for oversight for the tax dollars that we do  appropriate in these bills.   It is my hope that the Policy Committee will step up, speak out, and  start requesting that these bills be heard in the committee of  jurisdiction and not just put on as riders on our bills.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the House has spoken several times on the  Bureau of Land Management's methane regulation in the past 2 years. I  understand the administration is reviewing the regulation and that  litigation is ongoing.   In the meantime, I think action is needed, and so I support this  amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the Department  of the Interior from performing a necessary and thorough review of the  existing 5-year plan. Meanwhile, the committee encouraged a review of  the 5-year plan in the 2017 omnibus, which we just enacted just a few  months ago. For these reasons and others, I certainly urge a ``no''  vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, while I understand the gentleman's intent,  I share his concern with the 2015 ozone standards, the bill's language  in the amendment goes a little too far. It ties this new  administration's hands with respect to reconsideration or flexibility  efforts that they are trying to build in at the present time.   Meanwhile, the ozone language in the underlying bill provides the  necessary administrative relief for communities to comply with the  overlapping 2008 and 2015 requirements. I think that this  administration understands the complexities that are being imposed by  this 2015 requirement. They are trying to deal with it. Mr. Pruitt has  indicated that publicly.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The amendment was rejected.                                time  2315                   Amendment No. 67 Offered by Mr. Lamborn    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 67  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.   If we get additional resources in the future, I would love to make  sure that Fish and Wildlife has the resources to make sure they meet  their mandates, and they should meet them now.   One of the mandates they have is review the status of every listed  species every 5 years and a corresponding change in the status if it is  called for by those reviews. Instead of doing those reviews, in many  cases, the Service chooses to spend the money to list more species.   If the government isn't willing to shoulder the responsibilities that  come with listing species under the ESA, perhaps it shouldn't be  listing those species in the first place. So I think they need to meet  their obligations under the law.   I certainly support this amendment, and I encourage Members to  support the amendment and vote for it.    Mr. Chairman, I wanted to jump up and support this  amendment. Obviously, the agency has not leaped fast enough and  problems persist. So I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment, and I know it will squeak by with a large margin.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bergman, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 37 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, September 8, 2017,  at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
