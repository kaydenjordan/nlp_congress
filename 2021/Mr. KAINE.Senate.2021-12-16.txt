 Mr. President, communities of color and those living in  rural and underserved areas face significant barriers to healthcare,  including physician shortages that have only been exacerbated during  the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, in many communities of color and  rural areas, there are few pathways to enter the medical profession.  While medical school enrollment is up by 30 percent, the number of  students from rural areas entering medical school declined by 28  percent between 2002 and 2017, with only 4.3 percent of all incoming  medical students coming from rural areas in 2017. Similarly, Black,  Hispanic/Latino, and Native American students face several barriers to  matriculate and graduate from medical school, and there is significant  underrepresentation of these students at all U.S. medical schools with  the exception of historically Black medical schools. These medical  schools represent 2.6 percent of all medical schools but 15 percent of  Black medical students, indicating the important role that these  institutions play in increasing the diversity of the physician  workforce. Health outcomes for patients of color improve when they  receive care from doctors of their own racial or ethnic background, and  the shortage of providers of color exacerbates the barriers to care  that these communities experience. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened long  standing health inequities, and it is critical that we expand the  diversity of our physician workforce to tackle these rampant  disparities and the systemic biases within our health care system.   This is why I am introducing the Expanding Medical Education Act,  which aims to tackle the lack of representation of rural students,  underserved students, and students of color in the physician pipeline  by encouraging the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students  from disadvantaged backgrounds. The bill would provide grants through  the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, to colleges and  universities to establish or expand allopathic or osteopathic medical  schools in underserved areas or at minority-serving institutions,  including historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs. These  grants can be used for planning and construction of a medical school in  an areas in which no other school is based; hiring diverse faculty and  staff; recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students; and other  purposes to ensure increased representation of rural students,  underserved students, and students of color in our physician workforce.   Our rural communities and communities of color face significant  challenges accessing healthcare. It is time our physician workforce  reflected these communities. We need to diversify our physician  pipeline and change the disparity in representation, and this bill will  help get us there. I am proud to reintroduce this important legislation  to help us get one step closer to ensuring communities across Virginia  and the Nation have access to the medical professionals they need. I  hope the Senate passes this legislation quickly.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Lujan):   S. 3427. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to establish a Neuroscience Center of Excellence; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
