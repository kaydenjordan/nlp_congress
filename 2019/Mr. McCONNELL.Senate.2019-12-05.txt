 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for weeks now, the Republicans have  been asking the Democrats to take off their impeachment blinders and  let Congress legislate for the American people. We have argued that  American families deserve better than this partisan paralysis, where  the Democrats literally obsess over impeachment and obstruct everything  else.   This very morning, for example, the Speaker gave a speech on national  television to push forward her rushed and partisan impeachment, with  not one word on the outstanding legislation the American people  actually need--nothing on the USMCA or the NDAA or funding for our  Armed Forces. It is all impeachment, all the time. Only in this town,  only in Washington, does anybody think it is OK for our Armed Forces to  go unfunded and for a major trade deal to go unpassed, because the  Democrats are too busy hosting a panel of law professors to criticize  President Trump on television instead of being busy on the things the  American people actually need us to address.   The Kentuckians I represent cannot believe our military commanders  are being denied certainty, our men and women in uniform are being  denied stable funding, and 176,000 new American jobs are being held up  all because the Democratic leadership thinks there is more political  advantage in obstruction than in doing their jobs. Well, the  servicemembers and personnel in the Kentucky National Guard and at Fort  Campbell, Fort Knox, and the Blue Grass Army Depot aren't going to  simply stop doing their jobs. No, they are counting on us to pass  critical defense legislation that reforms housing and spousal  employment programs, that invests in construction, readiness, and  [[Page S6864]]  modernization, and that locks in--listen to this--the largest pay raise  in a decade.   These bills touch every single State. Of course, there are major  national and international issues at stake, as well, but the Democrats  are still holding the NDAA hostage for a partisan wish list that is  meant to appease trial lawyers, public sector unions, and their own  far-left base. They are holding up the NDAA over unrelated, nongermane,  leftwing wish-list items.   Meanwhile, the Speaker and the Democratic leader are withholding  their assent from important bipartisan provisions like the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, which has previously passed both Houses and  has been modified to resolve all concerns by the committees of  jurisdiction. Unlike the Democratic leader's rhetoric on Syria in  recent weeks, this bill would actually do something to stand up for the  Syrian people and hold Assad accountable. So I hope the Democratic  leader will allow this important demonstration of our support for the  Syrian people to go forward.   In the meantime, as if to underscore that the Democrats' top priority  is performance art for coastal elites and not the people's business, I  understand the Speaker of the House spent part of this week in Madrid,  talking about climate change. She took an international flight to  discuss carbon emissions. So the Speaker was in Spain, lamenting  President Trump's decision to pull us out of the Paris Agreement. Maybe  she pitched her conference's Green New Deal--its socialist plan to hurt  our economy for American families--while bigger emitters like China go  roaring right by.   As an aside, over the past 15 years, the United States' carbon  emissions have actually fallen significantly. We appear to be on track  for another decline in 2019. Meanwhile, Paris Agreement signatories,  like China and India, continue to emit more and more every year. China  already emits, roughly, twice as much as the United States, and it is  increasing every year.   Kentucky and many other States know exactly what happens when  Washington Democrats ignore these facts and decide America needs to  take on unilateral economic pain for no meaningful change in global  emissions. We are still trying to recover from the Democrats' last  ``War on Coal.'' We certainly don't need the Speaker of the House to  promise the Europeans that she is going to start a new one. So working  Americans and their families are not well served by the Democrats'  political performance art. What they really need are results.   The only path to results is bipartisan legislation, and, fortunately,  it is a well-trodden one. There are 58 consecutive annual defense  authorizations to prove it. Always in the past we have been able to  overcome these partisan differences and go forward. There is a  bipartisan-bicameral agreement that the Speaker and the Democratic  leader signed just a few months ago to help them find their way back to  the table, but the agreement needs to be honored. I hope they do so  sometime soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, while we wait for  our Democratic colleagues to let this legislation move forward, the  Senate has used the time to confirm more of President Trump's  impressive nominees for the Federal courts.   Some of my friends across the aisle complain that we devote too much  time to nominations. First, I would like to remind everyone that  district judges are the kinds of nominations that, historically, have  sailed right through the Senate in big groups by voice votes. If our  Democratic colleagues want to spend less time voting on district  judges, they should take it up with the Democratic leader, who is  forcing us to take cloture vote after cloture vote. As of this morning,  we have taken cloture votes on 81 district judge nominees.   By this point in President Obama's Presidency, we had taken one  cloture vote on a district judge nominee. Let me say that again. As of  this morning, we have taken cloture votes on 81 district judges. By  this point in President Obama's Presidency, we had taken one cloture  vote on a district judge nominee--just one.   At the comparable point in the five Presidencies preceding President  Obama's, combined, we had not taken a single cloture vote on a district  judge's nomination--not one. Yet, 3 years into the Trump Presidency,  there have been 81 cloture votes and counting just on district judges.  So there is your answer on floor time.   More broadly, I want to take a moment to help clarify why I and  millions of other Americans care so much about having Federal judges  who believe in the radical notion that words matter and that a judge's  job is to follow the law and the Constitution.   Take, for example, the subject of religious freedom. The liberty of  conscience and the freedom to live out our faiths has been a  foundational principle from the Republic's earliest days. Many of the  first Europeans who arrived in the New World came here after having  fled religious persecution.   James Madison wrote that religion ``must be left to the conviction  and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to  exercise it as these may dictate.''   Samuel Adams said in the summer of 1776 that America would be the  ``last asylum'' for ``freedom of thought and the right of private  judgment.''   Let me contrast the Founders' understanding with a couple of current  events. Last month, New York State convinced a district judge to throw  out the Trump administration's conscience protection rule for  healthcare providers. This straightforward rule ensured that healthcare  workers could not be forced to perform or assist with medical  procedures that profoundly violated their religious beliefs. Yet the  radical Democrats in New York could not abide by this basic protection  for people of faith. Instead, they wanted to force Christians and other  people of faith who work in healthcare to either assist in procedures  like abortion or lose their jobs--so much for freedom of conscience.   New York's behavior is part of a disturbing trend. Powerful interests  on the left want to shrink freedom of religion until it means freedom  to go to church for an hour on Sundays as long as it doesn't impact the  rest of your life. That shrunken interpretation is nothing like what  our Founders intended, and, candidly, I am not sure how much longer the  modern Democratic Party will even believe in that.   A few months ago, a Democrat who is running for President told CNN  that the government should take away the tax-exempt status of churches  and religious institutions that disagree with leftwing positions. He  was not some fringe candidate. He was a guy whom the Democrats and the  mainstream media had likened to John F. Kennedy. He was openly  suggesting the Federal Government should punish churches if liberals  don't like their social views--how appalling.   These disturbing signs have not been limited to the courts or to the  Democratic campaign trail. Absurd anti-religious arguments have  appeared right here in the Senate. In the last several years, some of  our Democratic colleagues have tried, literally, to impose religious  tests on nominees for Federal office. Just take the ``no religious  test'' clause and the First Amendment and throw them right out the  window. Get rid of them.   Judge Brian Buescher, now a district judge in Nebraska, was attacked  by two Democrats on the Committee on the Judiciary for being a faithful  Catholic and a member of the mainstream, worldwide Catholic group the  Knights of Columbus. He was attacked for being a member of the Knights  of Columbus? In written questions, one Senator called standard Catholic  teachings ``extreme positions'' and asked if he would dial down his  personal faith practice if confirmed. That happened in the Committee on  the Judiciary of this Senate.   As our colleague Senator Sasse observed at the time, the Democrats  were transparently implying that Brian's religious beliefs and his  affiliation with his Catholic, religious, fraternal organization might  make him unfit for service. It was plainly unconstitutional.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett, now a circuit judge on the Seventh Circuit,  was likewise subjected to a religious test during her confirmation  hearing. One Democratic Senator literally asked: Do you consider  yourself an orthodox  [[Page S6865]]  Catholic? She was asked that in the Committee on the Judiciary.   Another offered this bizarre and ominous remark: ``The dogma lives  loudly within you, and that's a concern.''   So, look, these warning signs on religious freedom are literally  popping up everywhere the modern political left rears its head.   Religious freedom in America has never--never--meant and will never  mean solely the freedom to worship privately. It has never meant and  will never mean the ability to practice only a subset of faiths  acceptable to some subset of politicians. What it means is the right to  live your life according to the dictates of your faith and your  conscience, free from government coercion.   If those statements strike anybody in this Chamber as remotely  controversial, that is exactly why President Trump, Senate Republicans,  and millions of Americans are focused on confirming Federal judges who  will apply our Constitution as it was originally written.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
