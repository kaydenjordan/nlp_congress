 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the  polluters over people act.   Protecting our environment is foundational to the heritage, culture,  and quality of life that we enjoy in the Pacific Northwest. We are  trailblazers in clean, renewable energy sources like hydroelectric,  wind, and solar.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should follow our lead  and focus on accelerating our transition toward a green energy economy  like Democrats did in the Inflation Reduction Act. Instead, Republicans  are pushing a messaging bill loaded with giveaways to the fossil fuel  industry that will blow a $2.4 billion hole in our deficit.    This legislation not only does nothing to lower energy costs, but it  raises prices for families by repealing Inflation Reduction Act  discounts for energy-saving home appliances.   I offered an amendment to this bill, with the support of every  Democrat from the Washington and Oregon delegations, that would prevent  oil and gas companies from drilling along the Washington and Oregon  coasts. The last thing any of us want is the next Deepwater Horizon  spill on our shores. This was rejected by the majority. An open  amendment process apparently only applies to Republicans.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.
