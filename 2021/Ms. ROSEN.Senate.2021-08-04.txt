 Mr. President, last summer, the United States saw up close  the horrific damage that wildfires can do to our communities. In 2020,  nearly 300,000 acres in Nevada burned to the ground. Right now, the  Tamarack fire is devastating the Nevada-California border and local  communities.   These natural disasters have done real, lasting damage to our  Nation's highways, causing cracks, potholes, and, in some cases,  literally melting the roads that we drive on.   My colleague Senator Risch and I offer this bipartisan amendment to  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which would add wildfires  as a specified damage for which Federal assistance from the National  Highway Performance Program may be used to rebuild our highways.   This will provide support to increase the resiliency of the national  highway system, helping to mitigate the cost of the damages.   I ask all of my colleagues to support this amendment.
