 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the  reconciliation package we have before us today. My colleagues and I  have been saying it for weeks, but I will say it again. This package is  simply the wrong plan at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.   It is the wrong plan because it will incentivize lockdowns that have  harmed our workers and our children for way too long.   It is the wrong time because our economy is improving, and we have  yet to spend a trillion dollars of the previously approved funding. In  fact, just this week it was reported that jobless claims dropped  dramatically.   Lastly, and worst of all, it is being pushed by colleagues across the  aisle for the wrong reasons. Less than 9 percent of this $2 trillion  goes to combat COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider these implications.
