--, I read somewhere that before Franklin Roosevelt was  elected President of the United States, that you were a socialist and a  follower of Norman Thomas, another American socialist. Why were you not  a Democrat?   He said: Dick, in those days, the Democratic Party was the party of  southern Democrats who were not good on civil rights and big-city  bosses, whom I always fought in the city of Chicago. So socialism was a  good alternative for a progressive like me.   I think he used the word ``liberal''--``a liberal like me.''   But then came Roosevelt and opened the door for a lot of us on the  liberal side to become part of the Democratic Party--the new Democratic  Party--under his leadership.   I always remember that and thought that in the course of American  history, so many times, tables have turned, and they are turning on  this very issue of voting rights, because if you look at the history of  voting rights in this country and the suppression of voting rights,  particularly toward African Americans, I am sorry to report that it is  my Democratic Party--one I am very proud of today--which was guilty of  so many sins in the past when it came to discrimination against voters  when it came to voting.   And that, to me, was a reality that is now interesting today because  the tables have turned. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham  Lincoln, was the party, by and large, that fought for voting rights for  the recently liberated African-American populations after the Civil War  and the Democrats in the South that resisted it.   I want to commend a book to those who are following this debate. It  is entitled ``One Person, No Vote.'' And the book is written by Carol  Anderson, who has become a friend of mine. Carol is a professor in  African-American studies at Emory University in Georgia, and she writes  the history of reconstruction and Jim Crow.   I want to read just a small section of this book to put in  perspective what was happening. Here it was, a Civil War in this  country, with over half a million Americans dead, with inflamed  feelings on both sides of the war. And, afterward, for the first time,  African Americans, because of the war and because of constitutional  amendments, were going to be enfranchised--actually be allowed to vote.  And, of course, when they did turn up in great numbers, they ended up  electing their own and electing people who were sympathetic to their  cause.   Well, there was a backlash, primarily among Democrats in the South,  and that backlash led to Jim Crow during Reconstruction and the  suppression of the right to vote.   It was horrible.   I want to read one part of this book, Carol Anderson's book, ``One  Person, No Vote.'' She writes:         That became most apparent in 1890 when the Magnolia State       passed the Mississippi Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes,       literacy tests, understanding clauses, newfangled voter       registration rules, and ``good character'' clauses--all       intentionally racially discriminatory but dressed up in the       genteel garb of bringing ``integrity'' to the voting booth.       This feigned legal innocence was legislative evil genius.        Virginia representative Carter Glass, like so many others,       swooned at the thought of bringing the Mississippi Plan to       his own state [of Virginia], especially after he saw how well       it had worked. He rushed to champion a bill in the       legislature that would ``eliminate the darkey as a political       factor . . . in less than five years.'' Glass, whom President       Franklin Roosevelt would one day describe as an       ``unreconstructed rebel,'' planned ``not to deprive a single       white man of the ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the       existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro voters'' in       Virginia.        One delegate questioned him: ``Will it not be done by fraud       and discrimination?''        Glass [answered]:        ``By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes.'' ``Discrimination!       Why, that is precisely what we propose . . . to discriminate       to the very extremity . . . permissible . . . under the       Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every       negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without       materially impairing the numerical strength of the white       electorate.    Well, the Mississippi Plan was picked up by other States. In  Louisiana, for example, where more than 130,000 Blacks had been  registered to vote in 1896, after the application of these laws, the  number dropped from 130,000 to 1,342. African-American registered  voters in Alabama plunged from 180,000 to fewer than 3,000 in just 3  years.   I am sorry to say that these were Democrats in the South who were  leading that charge. I am sorry to say that that was part of the  history of my party. But it is history. It does reflect what is going  on today.   Now there is a conscious effort by the other party--then-party of  Abraham Lincoln--to find ways to reduce the opportunity to vote. And  why? Why would they do this? In the last Presidential election, in  2020, we had the largest turnout in the history of the United States,  exactly what a democracy should celebrate. And, instead, we find State  after State dominated by Republican legislatures and Governors trying  to find ways to reduce opportunities to vote. Why? Why wouldn't we make  it as easy as possible for every eligible American to vote?   Justice Roberts, in his confirmation hearing before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I remember, talked about voting being the right  that is the preservative of all other rights. It is so fundamental. You  would think that we could accept the premise that if this democracy is  to work, the electorate should speak and as many as possible should  participate. But today we have the opposite: an effort by nearly 20  States or more to reduce opportunities to vote, and in reducing those  opportunities, many people will be denied their chance to speak when it  comes to the election.   Congress and our Nation marked the first anniversary of one of the  darkest days in America history yesterday: the January 6 insurrection,  the day American democracy was nearly lost. That day, an embittered,  defeated President Trump sent a murderous mob to attack this Capitol  and overturn the election he had lost.   I was honored to join my colleagues yesterday to speak to the bravery  of the Capitol Police, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police, and the  National Guard, who battled not only to defend this building but to  defend our way of life and our government. Those defenders of democracy  faced down violent extremists for hours. They endured vicious attacks  with fists, chemical sprays, baseball bats, flagpoles, steel bars, and  other weapons.   It is because of their courageous sacrifice that our democracy  survived.  [[Page S87]]  Five police officers who battled the mob on January 6 died over the  following days, weeks, and months. Most of them continue to protect us,  even as they heal from the wounds of that day.   As these officers will tell you, January 6 was not a normal day for  tourists in the Capitol, despite what Congressman  Andrew Clyde,  Republican of Georgia, claimed. And the threat of January 6 is not  over.   For a few short hours after the insurrection, many of our Republican  colleagues denounced the violence and the former President who provoked  it. But sadly, Republican lawmakers throughout America quickly changed  their tune. In a matter of days, more and more were intimidated to  embrace the former President's Big Lie that the 2020 election somehow  was not legitimate. Since January 6, we have seen a torrent of bills  introduced in Republican-controlled legislatures to restrict voting  rights and undermine the integrity of our democracy. Republican  lawmakers in nearly 20 States--including Georgia, Arizona, and  Florida--have passed laws making it harder for millions of Americans to  vote, and in some cases, making it easier--and this is so critical--for  politicians to overturn election results they don't like.    Let's be honest. These laws aren't about preventing voter fraud. They  are about giving politicians the power to pick and choose the votes  they want to count.   Does that sound like an echo of the history that we lived through  right after the Civil War in the 19th and 20th centuries?   Instead of denouncing these efforts, our Republican colleagues have  resurrected the age-old battle cry that they were using in those days:  States' rights. They insist--falsely--that Congress has no authority to  protect citizens whose voting rights are under attack. They are wrong.  They have not taken the time to read history or the Constitution.   Inside the desk in this Chamber of every single Senator is a little  book: the U.S. Constitution. I commend it to my colleagues,  particularly in light of this debate.   It is article 1, section 4 of that Constitution which says: ``The  Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and  Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature  thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such  Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.''   When you think about what we are trying to do here, as the Senator  from Minnesota has described it, we are setting out to establish the  standards by law for the choosing of Federal election.   Fast forward about 80 years after that sentence was written. The  Civil War had come to a close, and the 15th Amendment was ratified to  protect the rights of newly freed slaves, including the right to vote.  What does that section of the Constitution say? Section 2 of the 15th  Amendment:         Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by       appropriate legislation.    It couldn't be stated any more clearly. Preventing States from  denying citizens their right to vote is not constitutional overreach.  It is urgent, constitutional obligation, and we must honor it.   The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance is  a think tank in Sweden. Every year, for more than 50 years, it has  ranked the world's nations according to their commitment to democracy.  In 2021, for the first time ever, the United States' ranking fell to  what the group calls ``a backsliding democracy.'' The report said: ``A  historic turning point came in 2020-21, when former President Donald  Trump questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 elections in the United  States.''   We call it the Big Lie. If we in this Senate fail to denounce that  Big Lie, do you know what America's future is going to look like? It  won't be a government of and by the people. It will be a government  ruled by political strongmen with weak principles.   These new voter-suppression laws are a coup in slow motion. They are  the continuation of the January 6 assault on this building and our  Constitution. They are designed to bring your right to decide your  future--and deny it.   Ask yourself this: If the American people don't decide the outcome of  elections, who will? I will tell you: political partisans, special  interests, the rich and the powerful.   This Senate has the responsibility to protect the power and the  rights of American voters in our democracy. And right now, there are  two commonsense proposals before the Senate to do just that. I am  honored to cosponsor both. The first is the bipartisan--thank you,  Senator Murkowski, of Alaska--John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  It would strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the crown jewel of  the Civil Rights Movement.    For decades, Republicans and Democrats have worked together--on a  nearly unanimous basis--to reauthorize and update the Voting Rights  Act. As Senator Klobuchar mentioned earlier, there were times when more  than 90 Senators would vote in favor of the reauthorization of that  act. It reached a point in the House of Representatives where I believe  the only Republican Congressman who would stand up and continue to vote  for the reauthorization of that act was Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.  He has since retired.   This new version, named in honor of the great John Lewis, our friend  and colleague, would restore the full strength and authority of that  legislation, which has been dangerously weakened by a series of  misguided decisions from the conservative majority on the Supreme  Court. I worked with Senators Leahy, Murkowski, and Manchin to craft  this compromise bill.   The second bill, which Senator Klobuchar spoke to--the Freedom to  Vote Act--would preserve the integrity of our elections by establishing  minimum standards for voting access in all States, including same-day  voter registration and establishing election day as a Federal holiday.   What is behind all that? Just a very basic premise: Eligible voters  should not face obstacles in voting. We ought to make it easier for  them. Isn't it an embarrassment to you--it is to me--to watch the  newscast show people standing in line--literally, hours to vote? Bless  them for their determination to exercise their rights as citizens in  this country. But shame on us--this great Nation--that we would make it  so inconvenient and so difficult. And now State legislatures across the  Nation are doing even worse.   I am grateful to Senator Merkley, who is here, and Senator Klobuchar,  for leading the efforts on this critical legislation. Both of these  measures are simple, sensible, and popular. Together, they will protect  every eligible voter's access to the ballot box.   There is no guarantee that more people turning up to vote are all  going to vote for Democrats--or even for Republicans. But isn't it the  nature of democracy to leave it to the American people to make that  choice, not to those of us in legislatures, either State or Federal?   So why is it that our colleagues on the other side are once again  using the filibuster to prevent the Senate from even beginning debate  on these bills? It goes back to that old States' rights argument. I  mentioned it earlier. Some Republicans have claimed that our proposals  would amount to ``a Federal takeover of our election system.''   To those Republicans, I would say: Open your desk, and open this  book, and read.   It is a baseless claim. These measures are about preventing partisans  from poisoning the well of democracy. We cannot stand idly by as  Republicans State legislatures enact a wave of unprecedented voter  suppression, returning to that grim, dark period in American history of  suppression of voting. We cannot accept that the Senate is powerless.   Later this month, we are going to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  a champion of democracy in our lifetime. Throughout the civil rights  movement, Dr. King would quote a phrase from Thomas Carlyle, the  historian, who wrote in his account of the French Revolution: ``No lie  can live forever.''   So how much longer will we allow Mr. Trump's Big Lie to tear our  Nation apart? How much longer will we accord a simple Senate rule more  protection and respect than the Constitution--a Senate rule that began  as a clerical error and has been changed 160 times?   Right now, the only obstacle standing in the way of stopping this  voter suppression is the filibuster. But let's be clear. There is no  Senate rule more  [[Page S88]]  important than our constitutional right to vote. Americans have given  their lives to defend our constitutional rights. No one has ever been  asked to risk their life to defend the Senate filibuster rule.   For our Republican colleagues to feign outrage about preserving the  rules and norms of this Senate, I would ask them to think back a year  ago this week. Where were these precious rules and norms when the  leader of the Republican Party--then-President Trump--plotted an  overthrow of the government by disrupting the Senate business? Where  were these rules and norms when some of our colleagues echoed the Big  Lie that led to that bloody insurrection? And where were these rules  and norms when some members of the Republican Party openly endorsed  installing Donald Trump to the Presidency against the will of the  American people?    Right now, this is not just another political debate; the future of  the American democracy is at stake.   I yield the floor.
