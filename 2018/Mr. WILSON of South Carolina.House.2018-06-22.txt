 Mr. Speaker, last week the National  Federation of Independent Business released their May Small Business  Optimism Index, which is the highest Small Business Optimism rating in  history.   The NFIB reports that expansion plans for small businesses have hit  an all-time high. The positive sales trends for independent businesses  are at their highest level since 1995.   These statistics show that the Republican tax cuts and President  Donald Trump's economic deregulation have promoted jobs.   Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the National Association of  Manufacturers, led by President Jay Timmons, reports 77 percent of  manufacturers plan to increase hiring, and 72 percent plan to increase  wages or benefits.   Current unemployment is 3.8 percent, the lowest level in almost 50  years. In addition, African American unemployment is the lowest ever  recorded.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family and talented associates of Charles  Krauthammer, a megastar for truth on FOX News.                            ____________________
