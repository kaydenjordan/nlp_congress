 Please let him explain, Mr. President. Why was it false?  What was false about it?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is not in order--under S. Res. 47,  section 4, the party's presentation is not limited to the record  provided for in section 1 of the resolution, and that has been  appealed.   The clerk will call the roll.
