 Madam Speaker, this month marks the 10-year anniversary  of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded healthcare coverage to  millions of Americans, including those with preexisting conditions.   However, the ACA has also been attacked and undermined over the last  decade, with the latest attempt originating from my home State of  Texas. Texas, which has refused to expand Medicaid even though the  State has the highest uninsured rate in the Nation, and the Trump  administration argue that the entire law should be dismantled.   With the Supreme Court announcing they will hear the case this fall,  over 44,000 El Pasoans are again living with the threat of having their  healthcare coverage taken away from them. If the Supreme Court does  invalidate the ACA, nearly 20 million Americans will lose their  coverage.   At a time when we are confronting a public health emergency because  of the coronavirus, a pandemic, we should be looking for ways to  bolster healthcare coverage and protect community clinics and  healthcare providers, not tear it away from El Pasoans and other  communities around the Nation that need it the most.                            ____________________
