 Mr. President, I want to speak to my colleagues about  two things. One will take less than 1 minute, and the other will take  about 5 or 6 minutes. The first one deals with why I can't get answers  for citizens of the United States for the murder of a son.   In 2017, the U.S. Park Police fatally shot Bijan Ghaisar, after a  minor traffic accident led to a police chase in Virginia. Since then,  his family has been looking for answers, but they have only encountered  silence.   The FBI took over the investigation but has not shared any findings  or even an update with the family. So last December, I asked the FBI  where things stand. Even this Senator got silence from the FBI.   Investigations into the use of deadly force should be handled in a  manner that reinforces accountability and public confidence in law  enforcement. The FBI's silent treatment is concerning. The Ghaisar  family, Congress, this Senator, and the public shouldn't have to wait  years to get an answer from the FBI.
