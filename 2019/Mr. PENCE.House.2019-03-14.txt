 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure with a strong background in the  industry, I understand the vital role freight rail plays in getting  Hoosier-made and Hoosier-grown products to the market.   Short line freight rail makes up nearly 30 percent of all freight  rail, allowing rural communities like those across Indiana's Sixth  District to play an integral role in our economy. One such line is the  Madison Railroad, which provides exclusive access to the national rail  network for many Hoosiers in southeastern Indiana.   The city of Madison is working to obtain Federal grant funding to  replace the 100-year-plus Graham Creek Bridge, critical infrastructure  that keeps the Madison Railroad safely operating and serving our  community.   Built in the 19th century, the current structure poses an immediate  safety risk and cannot accommodate heavy commercial freight loads.  Replacement of this bridge will benefit southeast Indiana by removing a  potential safety risk and creating jobs and economic opportunity for  Hoosiers.   Mr. Speaker, we are proud of the historic architecture throughout  Indiana, and the Graham Creek Bridge has been an iconic landmark that  extends over the beautiful Muscatatuck River. I hope my colleagues in  this Chamber can join me in supporting this infrastructure project.                            ____________________
