 Mr. Speaker, this week marks the  eighth anniversary of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the  central Gulf of Mexico.   Accordingly, I rise today to, once again, vigorously oppose any  effort to allow energy exploration in the eastern gulf. The ban on  drilling east of the Military Mission Line, 86 degrees, 41 minutes  west, was put in place in 2006 and is going to expire in 2022. We need  to make it permanent.   Our tourism industry in Florida and our residential development need  protection from offshore drilling. We need protection from the oil  companies.   Another spill like Deepwater Horizon would be an existential threat  to Florida. The clockwise loop current, which runs all down the west  coast, would carry any chemicals that get into the water all down the  west coast to Key West.   We don't need the eastern Gulf to become self-sufficient in energy,  either. Technology and the shale revolution have taken care of that.   The Western Hemisphere is already independent and the U.S. itself  will be before long. It is estimated that the U.S. will supply 30  percent of Mexico's gas by 2030. In the Permian Basin alone, one of the  three producing sands is estimated to hold over 20 billion barrels of  oil equivalence.   As the CEO of Shell said recently: We will see peak demand for  gasoline and oil within the decade.   Shell's latest offshore platform, the Vito, has been scaled back 80  percent from 40,000 tons to 8,900 tons because it is just not  productive.   Shell is investing in alternative energies.   Mr. Speaker, please protect Florida and make the ban permanent.  [[Page H3382]]                                ____________________
