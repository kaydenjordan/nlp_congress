 MALONEY asked and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 3967, the Honoring our PACT Act, which will  ensure comprehensive benefits and care for our troops who suffer from  toxic exposure, especially from burn pits. I want to thank Chairman  Takano for his leadership on this bill. It is something we should all  support. It supports our veterans.   As the daughter of a veteran, the sister of a veteran, and the wife  of a veteran, caring for our veterans is extremely important to me, as  it should be to every American. I could not help but be struck by the  similarities between this bill and the 9/11 health and compensation  bill which served and supported our heroes and heroines of 9/11 who  likewise were exposed to burning toxins that later gave them cancers  and severe illness.   This bill could help over 3 million veterans who are currently  suffering from exposure to toxic burn pits.   Whether a veteran has served in Afghanistan, Iraq, or elsewhere, if  they were exposed to these toxic hazards, they are entitled to care.  They were there for us; we should be there for them. We should all  support this important bill.                            ____________________
