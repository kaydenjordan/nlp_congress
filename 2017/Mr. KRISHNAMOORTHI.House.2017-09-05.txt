 Mr. Speaker, today the President made clear that  he refuses to protect DREAMers. It is now imperative that Congress acts  to protect DREAMers before DACA ends.   This issue is personal for me because I, too, was brought to our  country by my parents as a child. The hope for a better life which  carried my parents here from oceans away was no different from that of  the parents of DREAMers and generations of immigrants before.   DREAMers play a vital role in our economy, and ending DACA would cost  our country nearly half a trillion dollars over 10 years. But the  contributions of DREAMers go beyond any single statistic: DREAMers have  built their lives here, started families here, built businesses here,  and bled in uniform for the only home they have ever known.   I urge Speaker Ryan and my colleagues from both parties to come  together to defend DREAMers and to develop a comprehensive approach to  immigration built on American values.                            ____________________
