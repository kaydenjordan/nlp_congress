 Mr. Chief Justice, on my own behalf and on behalf of  Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Coons, Klobuchar, Leahy, Markey, Peters,  and Udall, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is from Senator Whitehouse and other  Senators to the House managers:         The ``missing-witness'' rule--which dates back to 1893       Supreme Court case Graves v. United States--allows one party       to obtain an adverse inference against the other for failure       to produce a witness under that party's control with material       information. Here, one party, the President, has prevented       witnesses within his control from testifying or providing       documents. Do the House managers believe Senators should       apply the missing witness rule here, and if so, what adverse       inferences should we draw about the missing testimony and       documents?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S665, January 29, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The ``missing-witness rule--which dates back to 1893  Supreme Court case Graves v. United States--allows one party to  obtain an . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: The ``missing- witness'' rule--which dates back to 1893 Supreme Court case Graves  v. United States--allows one party to obtain an . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, we do believe that  you should draw an adverse inference against the party resisting the  testimony of these witnesses, like John Bolton. Courts have long  recognized that when a party has relevant evidence within his control,  which he fails to produce, that failure gives rise to an inference that  that evidence is unfavorable to him.   Courts have frequently drawn adverse inferences where a party acts in  bad faith to conceal evidence or preclude witnesses from offering  testimony.   I would suggest that it is bad faith when counsel comes before you  and says that if you really wanted these witnesses, you should have  sued to get them in the House and goes into the courtroom down the  street and says: You can't sue to get witnesses before the House.   But that is what has happened here. And you are, I think, not only  permitted but absolutely should draw an adverse inference that when a  party is making that argument on both sides of the courthouse, that the  evidence those witnesses would provide runs against them.   Now, the administration hasn't produced a single document, not one  single document. That is extraordinary. They can argue executive  privilege and absolute immunity. Most of that has nothing to do with  the overwhelming majority of these documents, not a wit. There is no  absolute immunity from providing documents. The vast, vast majority  don't have anything to do with privilege, and, if they did, there would  be redactions, very specific redactions. None of that happened.   Are you allowed to draw an adverse inference that the reason why the  President's team, which has possession of those emails regarding  inquiries by Ukraine into why the aid was frozen--are you allowed to  draw an inference--if they won't show you those emails. Those emails  would confirm that Ukraine knew the aid was withheld,  [[Page S666]]  just like the former Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine said publicly  when she told the New York Times: Yes, we knew; by the end of July, we  knew--this is the Deputy Foreign Minister at the time--we knew the aid  was frozen, but I was instructed by Andriy Yermak not to mention it. I  had a trip planned to Washington to talk to Congress, and I was told  not to go. Why? Because they didn't want it public.   Are you entitled to draw an inference that those records they refused  to turn over--all the State Department records; the fact that they  won't allow John Bolton's notes to be turned over; they won't let  Ambassador Taylor's notes to be turned over--should you draw an adverse  inference? You are darned right you should.   They say: Well, the President only told Sondland ``no quid pro quo.''  They leave out the other half where Sondland told Taylor: But he said,  no quid pro quo, but you have to go to the mike and announce these  investigations.   Well, Ambassador Taylor wrote down the notes of that conversation.  That took place right after that call with the President. Are you  allowed to draw an adverse inference from the fact that they don't want  you to see Ambassador Taylor's notes, from the fact they don't want you  to see Ambassador Taylor's cable? You are darned right you should draw  an adverse inference.   Finally, with respect to who has become a central witness here, I  think the adverse inference screams at you as to why they don't want  John Bolton. But you shouldn't rely on an inference here, not when you  have a witness who is willing to come forward. There is no need for  inference here. It is just a need for a subpoena.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk, and  because my question references an earlier question, I have attached  that earlier question as a reference to provide it to the Office of the  Parliamentarian in case it should be of interest.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Whitehouse is  to counsel for the President:         White House counsel refused to answer a direct question       from Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, saying he could       only cite to the record. Five minutes afterward White House       counsel read recent newspaper stories to the Senate from       outside the House record. Could you please give an accurate       and truthful answer to the Senators' question: Did the       President ever mention the Bidens in connection to corruption       in Ukraine before Vice President Biden announced his       candidacy in April 2019? What did the President say, to whom,       and when?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   I don't think that I refused to answer the question at all. We had  been advised by the House managers that they were going to object if we  attempted to introduce anything that was not either in the public  domain--so things that are in newspaper articles, things like that that  are out there we could refer to--or things that were in the record. And  so I can't--I am not in a position to go back into things that the  President might have said in private, and there has been no discovery  into that. It is not part of this inquiry, so I can't go telling now  about things that the President might have said to Cabinet Members. I  am not in a position to say that. I can tell you what is in the public,  and I can tell you what is in the record. I answered the question fully  to the best of my ability based on what is in the public domain and  what is in the record.   I would like to take a moment to also respond to the last question  that was posed by Senator Murkowski with respect to the vote on  authorizing the issuance of subpoenas because there has always been a  vote from the full House to authorize any impeachment inquiry into a  Presidential impeachment. It was that way in the Johnson impeachment.  It was that way in the Nixon impeachment.   There have been references to the fact that the House Judiciary  Committee began some investigatory work before the House actually voted  on the resolution--I think it was Resolution 803--to authorize the  impeachment inquiry. But all that work was simply gathering things that  were in the public domain or that had been already gathered by other  committees, and there was no compulsory process issue. And in fact,  Chairman Rodino of the House Judiciary Committee specifically  determined, when there was a move to have the House Judiciary Committee  issue subpoenas after the Saturday Night Massacre, that the committee  lacked the authority to issue any compulsory process until there had  been a vote by the full House authorizing the committee to do that.   This is not some esoteric special rule about impeachments. As I have  tried to explain, this is just a fundamental rule under the  Constitution about how authority had been given by ``we the people'' to  Chambers of the legislature, either the House or the Senate. Once it is  given there to the House, how does it get to a committee? It can only  get down to a committee if it is delegated by the House. That can only  happen if the House votes. There is no standing rule that gives the  House Judiciary Committee authority to use the power of impeachment as  opposed to the authority to legislate. There is no rule that gives you  the power to use the authority of impeachment to issue compulsory  process.   Rule 10 doesn't mention impeachment at all. The word doesn't appear  in it. That is why it has always been the understanding that there must  be a vote from the House to authorize the House Judiciary Committee or  in this case--it was contrary to all prior practice--it was given to  Manager Schiff's committee and other committees the authority to use  the power of impeachment to issue subpoenas.   It was very clear to the House of Representatives that the position  of the executive branch was that all of the subpoenas issued before H.  Res. 660 were invalid on their face, and Senator Murkowski's question  is exactly correct: There was no effort in H. Res. 660 either to  attempt to retroactively authorize those subpoenas or to say that those  subpoenas--to retroactively authorize those subpoenas or then to  reissue them under H. Res. 660, so the subpoenas remained invalid.  There was no response from the House to that. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
