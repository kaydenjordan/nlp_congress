 Mr. Speaker, Fritz Hollings dedicated his  life to service. Whether it was serving in World War II, as Governor of  South Carolina, or as a United States Senator, the legacy he leaves  behind is simply amazing. He embodied what it meant to be a part of the  Greatest Generation. He truly had a servant's heart.   During his Governorship, he was a champion of the civil rights  movement and helped ensure the peaceful integration of South Carolina  schools. He is also credited with creating the State's technical  college system which, to this day, helps people connect with jobs and  opportunities. He also helped develop the Charleston Port, which has  turned South Carolina into a world-class exporter and one of the most  competitive places to do business in the country.   An absolute titan in the United States Senate, he spent nearly 40  years advocating for policies that would benefit South Carolinians and  Americans.   Though I never had the pleasure of serving with him, I know that he  brought South Carolina spirit to Washington with his sharp tongue and  quick wit.   He will be missed, but we can find comfort that he is reunited in  Heaven with his beloved wife, Peatsy.   I am honored to join my colleagues and all South Carolinians in  celebrating his remarkable life.
