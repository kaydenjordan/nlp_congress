 Mr. Speaker, I am so incredibly grateful that the House  passed my amendment to the Military Construction and VA appropriations  bill.   Earlier this year, I was proud to lead 64 of our colleagues in  calling for a significant increase to address the funding gap in our  State Veterans Homes system. My amendment increases the funding for the  VA State Veterans Home Construction Grant Program by $5 million.   As many in the Michigan delegation know, southeast Michigan is home  to the largest concentration of veterans in the Midwest, however, we  don't have a VA home in the Detroit area. State Veterans Homes are a  critical counterpart for our VA system in providing long-term care and  services for our veterans.   With more than 30,000 beds nationwide, the State Veterans Home  program is the largest provider of long-term care for our Nation's  veterans with services that include nursing care and adult daycare.   The program enables States to construct, renovate, or repair these  State-owned facilities with the VA providing up to 65 percent of the  cost of construction.    Currently, there are more than $600 million in unfulfilled Priority 1  grant requests by the States, demonstrating that the States are eager,  willing, and prepared to take on an important responsibility, as well  as a share of the cost, of caring for our Nation's veterans.   Unfortunately, only $150 million was appropriated in the fiscal year  2023, and this bill only allocates $164 million, leaving many grant  requests unfulfilled and an inability for States to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, if we cannot take care of our Nation's veterans, we  shouldn't be sending them to war. My amendment, with the support of all  of you, is a small step toward addressing that funding gap.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee for their support in this effort,  and I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting this amendment. I  look forward to continuing this fight to ensure that our veterans get  the care they deserve.                Credit is an Obstacle for Meeting Basic Needs     Mr. Speaker, credit and consumer reports that often  contain errors are increasingly an obstacle for many of our residents  from meeting their basic needs.   Victims of financial abuse and fraud, or those strapped with medical  debt, are regularly denied access to employment, housing, and  transportation because of their credit history.   Our neighbors should not have to go without basic necessities because  they fell victim to fraudulent activity or predatory lenders.   Survivors of domestic abuse, for instance, do not deserve to have  debt resulting from the abuse of their credit report.   Medical debt should not prevent someone from securing shelter or an  education.   That is why I am reintroducing the Restoring Unfairly Impaired Credit  and Protecting Consumers Act to provide credit restoration for victims  of predatory lending, fraud, and other financial abuse; prohibiting the  reporting of medical debt; and to reduce the length of time that  adverse information appears on credit reports from 7 down to 4 years.   Economists say 7 years is not a good indicator. Many of the  residents, especially in our districts, will tell you that reducing it  down to 4 years can be transformative for their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this bill.           Recognizing the 1-Year Anniversary of the Mamas' Caucus     Mr. Speaker, it is the 1-year anniversary of the  Congressional Mamas' Caucus that I founded with Congresswomen Jayapal,  Bush, Meng, and Williams.   The Mamas' Caucus is not only committed to advocating for mothers of  color and working families, but committed to making sure that all  mothers have a seat at the table where policy decisions are made.   We can't be talking about mothers without mothers at the table. For  instance, the cost of raising a child in our country is among the  highest in the world, and our policies and social safety nets too often  leave many behind.   We must build childcare policies that support every family, and ones  that ensure providers are paid a living wage.   Whether on Black maternal health, reproduction justice, paid leave,  and so many other issues, mothers must be centered in the policies that  we advance here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who have joined us in this  fight and know that we have many efforts in store in the year to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Vermont for  her incredible courage.   I know I come from and grew up in the most beautiful, Blackest city  in the country, the city of Detroit, where every corner is a reminder  of the civil rights movement, a reminder of different movements that  ensured that our Black neighbors had human dignity.   Across the country, far-right extremists, elected officials like the  Governor of Florida, are attempting to whitewash Black history and ban  books in our children's classrooms.   Florida's own Board of Education just approved new Black history  standards, and public school students will be now taught that enslaved  Black folks benefited from slavery.   The audacity. There are no two sides, Mr. Speaker, to slavery.  Slavery was cruel, was inhumane. It was a violent practice that denied  our Black neighbors and communities their basic human dignity. It had  no redeeming qualities.   Many of the Founding Fathers in this Chamber even owned human beings  [[Page H4063]]  themselves. These are just facts. This is our history.   You cannot teach the truth about American history without teaching  African-American history.   We must teach our children, Mr. Speaker, the truth about our Nation's  history. That means reckoning with racism, oppression, lynching,  dehumanization, and white supremacist violence.   We cannot learn from our past if our past is no longer being taught.   We will not allow anyone to rewrite our history. Again, it is so  important that this Chamber understands that Black history is American  history.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Vermont, Representative  Balint, for really, truly championing this issue today.   Again, being from a community that taught me that oppression against  anyone needs to continue to be fought against, I can't stand idly by,  even if it is another State doing it, and say that it is okay. I can't  stand on the sidelines. We must continue to speak truth.
