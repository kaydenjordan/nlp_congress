 Mr. President, I would like to recognize and  congratulate the Carolina Youth Development Center, Cummins, Inc., and  the Hootie and the Blowfish Foundation on its new partnership to  provide youth aging out of foster care an independent living  transitional house. The Carolina Youth Development Center has been a  blessing to our State for over 200 years with their bold mission. They  work tirelessly to empower and equip South Carolina's most vulnerable  children by providing a safe environment, educational support, and  career readiness.   Carolina Youth Development Center has an impressive 227-year history  of serving the community's most vulnerable children and families,  dating back to its founding as the Charleston Orphan House in 1790. The  agency remains steadfast in its commitment to youth in foster care and  continues to lead the way, changing lives and transforming  communities.                            ____________________
