 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life and service of a true patriot, Bill Ramsaur.   A native of Atlanta, Bill attended Baylor University in 1959 and  graduated with majors in history and religion.   Upon graduation, Bill proceeded to Naval Officer Candidate School and  was assigned to an aircraft carrier, the USS Shangri-la. Bill served as  the Radio Officer in the communications department during his time  aboard the ship. His ship was home-ported in Mayport, Florida, where  Bill met his future wife, Gloria, a native of Brunswick, Georgia.   He obtained his master's degree in 1966 from Georgia State University  and joined Arthur Andersen & Co., where he became a certified public  accountant. Bill worked as an accountant with Arthur Andersen & Co. for  30 years before he and Gloria relocated to St. Simons Island.   Bill loved this great United States with a fiery passion, and was a  member of the Sons of the American Revolution, Marshes of Glynn  Chapter. He also performed as George Washington for thousands of local  students and participated in the Veterans Council of the Golden Isles.   His love for his family, friends, and this country will forever be  remembered.                            ____________________
