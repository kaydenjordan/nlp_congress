 Did he also mention to me in the past the       corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question       about that. But that is it. And that's why we held up the       money.    Mr. Manager CROW. When pressed that he just confessed to the very  quid pro quo that President Trump had been denying, Mulvaney doubled  down.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         QUESTION. To be clear, what you just described is a quid       pro quo. Funding will not flow unless the investigation into       the Democratic server happened as well.         We do that all the time with foreign policy.       If you read the news reports and you believe them, what did       McKinney say yesterday? Well, McKinney said yesterday that he       was really upset with the political influence in foreign       policy. That was one of the reasons he was so upset about       this. And I have news for everybody: Get over it. There is       going to be political influence in foreign policy.    Mr. Manager CROW. Remember, at the time he made these statements,  Mulvaney was both the head of OMB and the Acting Chief of Staff at the  White House. He knew about all of the legal concerns. He also knew  about the President's so-called drug deal, as Ambassador Bolton called  it. He knew exactly what was going on in the Oval Office and how OMB  implemented the President's illegal order to hold the aid.   Mulvaney confirmed why the President ordered the hold. It was not to  develop further policy to counter aggression. It was not to convince  the Ukrainians to implement additional anti-corruption reforms. And it  was not to pressure our allies to give more to Ukraine.   Since we won't have an opportunity to respond to the President's  presentation, I am going to take a minute to respond to some of the  arguments that I expect them to make.   You will notice, I am sure, that they will ignore significant  portions of the evidence, while trying to cherry-pick individual  statements here and there to manufacture defenses. But don't be fooled.   One defense you may hear is that the aid was held up to allow for a  policy review. This is what the administration told the GAO at one  point. But the evidence shows the opposite. The evidence shows that the  administration didn't conduct a review at any time after the President  ordered the hold.   Laura Cooper was not aware of any review of the funding conducted by  DOD in July, August, or September, and, similarly, George Kent  testified that the State Department did not conduct and was never asked  to conduct a review of funding administrated by the State Department.  In fact, on May 23, the anti-corruption review was complete and DOD  certified to Congress that Ukraine had complied with all of the  conditions and that the remaining half of the aid should be released.  This was confirmed by the June 18 press release announcing the funding.   Do you remember the fictitious ``interagency review process''? That  was made up too. No review is necessary because it had already been  done.   Next, the President's counsel keeps saying this was about corruption  in Ukraine. President Trump was not concerned with fighting corruption.  It is difficult to even say that with a straight face. The President  never mentioned corruption on either call with President Zelensky. But  let's go through the evidence.   As we just discussed, DOD had already completed a review and  concluded that Ukraine had ``made sufficient progress in meeting  defense reform and anti-corruption goals consistent with the National  Defense Authorization Act in order to receive the funds.''   In fact, Mark Sandy, who was not at that meeting but who was  initially responsible for approving the hold, said he had never heard  corruption as a reason for the hold in all of the discussions he had  about it.   Similar to the anti-corruption argument, there is simply no evidence  to support the President's after-the-fact argument that he was  concerned about burden-sharing; that is, other countries also  contributing to Ukraine.   I imagine the President may cite the emails in June about what other  countries provided to Ukraine, the reference to other countries'  contributions in the July 25 call, and testimony from Sandy about a  request for information about what other European countries give to  Ukraine. But there is simply no evidence that ties the concern to his  decision to hold the funding.   First, let's actually look at the contributions of European countries  to Ukraine. There is a slide in front of you. It shows that other  European countries have significantly contributed to Ukraine since  2014, and the European Union, in total, has given far more than the  United States. The EU is the single largest donor to Ukraine, having  provided over $16 billion in grants and loans.   The President's assertion that other countries did not support  Ukraine is meritless. There are other reasons too.  [[Page S533]]    After DOD and OMB responded to the President's request, presumably  with some of the information we just provided you, showing Europe gives  a lot to Ukraine, nobody in the Trump administration mentioned burden- sharing as a reason for the hold to any of the 17 witnesses that we  have been talking about.   Sondland, whose actual portfolio is the EU--not Ukraine--testified  that he was never asked to speak to the EU or EU member countries about  providing more aid to Ukraine. If President Trump were truly concerned  about that, he would have been the perfect guy to handle it because he  was our Ambassador to the EU. But it never happened. How could it?  Sondland himself knew the aid was linked to the investigations because  that is what the President himself had told him.   It wasn't until the President's scheme began to unravel, after the  White House learned of the whistleblower complaint and after POLITICO  publicly revealed the existence of the hold, that the issue of burden- sharing came up again.   If the President's concern were genuinely about burden-sharing, he  never made any public statements about it, never ordered a review of  burden-sharing, and never ordered his officials to push Europe to  increase their contributions. And then he released the aid without any  changes in Europe's contributions.   This last point is important. You know the President's purported  concern about burden-sharing rings hollow because the aid was released  after the President got caught, not because the EU or any European  country made any new contributions. As Lieutenant Colonel Vindman  testified, the facts on the ground had not changed.   Finally, you may hear the President's counsel say that Ukraine didn't  know about the hold until August 28, long after the hold was  implemented. Therefore, they could not have felt pressure. But this  makes no sense.   First, they found out about it long before August 28. Multiple  witnesses testified that the Ukrainians showed ``impressive diplomatic  tradecraft'' in learning quickly about the hold, and, of course, they  would know. The DOD release was announced in June. U.S. agencies knew  about it in July. It should be no surprise that the first inquiries  about the aid were on July 25, the same day as the call.   You see, it doesn't matter if extortion lasts 2 weeks or 2 months. It  is still extortion, and Ukraine certainly felt the pressure. Other  Ukrainian officials also expressed concerns that the Ukrainian  government was being singled out and penalized for some reason. And  they were, by President Trump.   Do you know how else you know they felt the pressure from the hold?  President Zelensky finally relented and was planning to do the CNN  interview. Ultimately, right around the time of President Zelensky's  conversation with President Trump, which is the subject of the  classified document that I urge all Senators to look at, President  Zelensky canceled the CNN interview. But the damage was already done.   The evidence is clear. The question for you is whether it is OK for  the President to withhold taxpayer money, aid for our ally--our friend  at war--for a personal political benefit; whether it was OK for the  President to sacrifice our national security for his own election. It  is not OK to me, it is certainly not OK with the American people, and  it should not be OK to any of you.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, President's counsel, the American people, once again, we are  gathered here, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as the left or the  right, not as progressives or conservatives, but as Americans doing our  constitutional duty during this moment of Presidential accountability.  As House managers, we thank you for your courtesy, your attentiveness,  and your hospitality.   At the heart of article II, obstruction of Congress, is a simple,  troubling reality. President Trump tried to cheat, he got caught, and  then he worked hard to cover it up. The President tried to cheat, he  got caught, and then he worked hard to cover it up.   Patrick Henry, one the Nation's great patriots, once said that ``the  liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure, when the  transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.''   Let's now address the effort by President Trump and his team to cover  up his wrongdoing. By July of 2019, White House officials were aware of  serious allegations of misconduct by President Trump regarding Ukraine,  but instead of halting the President's corrupt scheme, they worked  overtime to conceal it from the American people.   As additional evidence of the President's wrongdoing mounted, White  House lawyers redoubled their efforts to prevent Congress and the  American people from learning of the President's misconduct.   At the same time, top administration officials--including Secretary  of State Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Esper, and National Security  Advisor John Bolton--tried to convince President Trump to lift the hold  on the security assistance. They failed. President Trump was determined  to carry out his corrupt scheme.   The military and security aid was only released on September 11 after  the hold became public, after the House launched an investigation, and  after Congress learned about the existence of a whistleblower  complaint. The $391 million in security aid was only released because  President Trump was caught redhanded.   The actions of President Trump and high-level White House officials  allowed his abuse of power to continue beyond the watchful eye of  Congress and, most importantly, the American people.   As we have discussed at length, on July 10, Ambassador Sondland told  the Ukrainians and other U.S. officials that he had a deal with Acting  Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to schedule the White House meeting  President Zelensky wanted, if the new Ukrainian leader committed to the  phony investigations that President Trump sought.   As you have seen in testimony shown during this trial, following that  meeting, National Security Council officials, Dr. Fiona Hill and LTC  Alexander Vindman immediately reported this information to John  Eisenberg, the Legal Advisor for the National Security Council and a  Deputy Counsel to the President. According to Dr. Hill, Mr. Eisenberg  told her that he was also concerned about that July 10 meeting. On the  screen is Dr. Hill's deposition testimony where she explains Mr.  Eisenberg's reaction, saying:         I mean, he wasn't aware that Sondland, Ambassador Sondland       was . . . kind of running around doing a lot of these . . .       meetings and independently. We talked about the fact that . .       . Ambassador Sondland said he'd been meeting with Giuliani       and he was very concerned about that. And he said he would       follow up on this.    Mr. Eisenberg was very concerned about that and said that he would  follow up on this.   Dr. Hill further testified that Mr. Eisenberg told her that he  followed up with his boss, the distinguished White House Counsel, Pat  Cipollone. However, because the President blocked Mr. Eisenberg from  testifying in the House, we do not know what, if anything, he or Mr.  Cipollone did in response to this deeply troubling information. What we  do know is that President Trump's effort to cheat continued with  reckless abandon. By failing to put the brakes on the wrongdoing after  that July 10 meeting--even after they were notified by concerned  national security officials--the White House attorneys allowed it to  continue unchecked.   Right around the same time that the July 10 meetings at the White  House took place, the Office of Management and Budget began executing  President Trump's illegal order to withhold all security assistance  from Ukraine.   On July 10, Robert Blair, an assistant to the President, communicated  the hold to the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget,  Russell Vought. On July 18, an Office of Management and Budget official  communicated the hold to other executive branch agencies, including the  Department of State and the Department of Defense. And a week later, on  July 25, President Trump had his imperfect telephone call with  President Zelensky and directly pressured the Ukrainian leader to  commence phony political investigations as part of his effort to cheat  and solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.   The July 25 call marked an important turning point. If there was any  [[Page S534]]  question among senior White House officials and attorneys about whether  President Trump was directly involved in the Ukraine scheme, as opposed  to just a rogue operation being led by Rudolph Giuliani or some other  underlings, after July 25, there can be no mistake that the President  of the United States was undoubtedly calling the shots.   Thereafter, the complicity of White House officials with respect to  the coverup of the President's misconduct intensified. Immediately  after the July 25 call, both Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his direct  supervisor, Tim Morrison, reported their concerns about the call to Mr.  Eisenberg and his Deputy, Michael Ellis. In fact, within an hour after  the July 25 call, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman returned again a second  time to Mr. Eisenberg and reported his concerns.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I was concerned by the call. What I heard       was inappropriate and I reported my concerns to Mr.       Eisenberg. It is improper for the President of the United       States to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S.       citizen and a political opponent.        I was also clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation,       it was also clear that if Ukraine pursued investigation into       the 2016 elections, the Bidens and Burisma, it would be       interpreted as a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result       in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermining U.S.       national security and advancing Russia's strategic objectives       in the region.        I want to emphasize to the committee that when I reported       my concerns on July 10th relating to Ambassador Sondland and       then on July 25th relating to the President, I did so out of       a sense of duty. I privately reported my concerns in official       channels to the proper authority in the chain of command. My       intent was to raise these concerns because they had       significant national security implications for our country. I       never thought that I'd be sitting here testifying in front of       this committee and the American public about my actions. When       I reported my concerns, my only thought was to act properly       and to carry out my duty.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Timothy Morrison, the National Security  Council's Senior Director for Europe and Russia, also reported the call  to Mr. Eisenberg and asked him to review the call, which he feared  would be ``damaging'' if leaked.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Did he also mentioned to me in the past the       corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no       question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up       the money.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. After this really stunning admission, the House  issued a subpoena to require Mr.  [[Page S549]]  Mulvaney to testify, but on the day of Mr. Mulvaney's scheduled  deposition, the White House sent a letter to his personal attorney. It  prohibited him from obeying the subpoena. The letter said: ``The  President directs Mr. Mulvaney not to appear at the Committee's  scheduled deposition.''   When he issued this order, President Trump doubled down on his  previous blanket order. He did so after the House voted to approve  resolution 660, which in no uncertain terms made clear that Mr.  Mulvaney was being subpoenaed to testify in an impeachment  investigation.   This order was the first of many. President Trump also ordered  another White House official, Robert Blair, not to testify. Mr. Blair  is Mr. Mulvaney's senior adviser and his closest aide. He was involved  in communications about the hold on Ukraine aid.   The day after his initially scheduled deposition, Mr. Blair's  personal attorney sent a letter to the House. It said: ``Mr. Blair has  been directed by the White House not to appear and testify.''   The House also wanted testimony from John Eisenberg, the senior  attorney on President Trump's National Security Council. As you have  heard over the past few days, key witnesses, including Dr. Hill and  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, said they were concerned by President  Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine. They were told to report these  concerns to Mr. Eisenberg.   The day before his scheduled deposition, the White House sent a  letter to Mr. Eisenberg's personal attorney. It said: ``The President  directs Mr. Eisenberg not to appear at the Committee's deposition.''  Now, that language is starting to sound familiar.   Mr. Eisenberg's personal attorney then sent a letter to the House.  The letter said this:         Under these circumstances, Mr. Eisenberg has no other       option that is consistent with his legal and ethical       obligations except to follow the direction of his client and       employer, the President of the United States. Accordingly,       Mr. Eisenberg will not be appearing for a deposition at this       time.    Now, that language, I think, is important. And it is telling. It  shows that President Trump's order left Mr. Eisenberg with ``no other  option that is consistent with his legal and ethical obligations.'' By  directing him to defy a lawful subpoena, President Trump created a  legal and ethical problem for Mr. Eisenberg.   I am sure you know, contempt of Congress can be punished as a  criminal offense. It carries the possible sentence of up to 12 months  in jail. No President has ever dared, during an impeachment inquiry, to  officially and explicitly order government witnesses to defy House  subpoenas. You don't have to consider high-minded constitutional  principles to understand why this was wrong. It is simple, really. By  ordering specific government officials to defy congressional subpoenas,  President Trump forced those officials to choose between submitting to  the demands of their boss or breaking the law. Nobody should abuse a  position of power in that way. But President Trump specifically ordered  all three of these senior White House officials--Mulvaney, Blair, and  Eisenberg--to defy the House's subpoenas and refuse to testify.   President Trump's efforts to conceal his actions didn't stop there,  and they didn't stop at the front door of the White House. No less than  12 other witnesses were specifically ordered not to testify. One of  those witnesses, Ulrich Brechbuhl, hasn't been highlighted much over  the past few days, but the way he fits into the story is worth noting.   Mr. Brechbuhl is a senior official at the State Department. Like  these other senior officials, he was ordered not to testify. In a  letter to the House, his attorney said: ``Mr. Brechbuhl has received a  letter of instruction from the State Department directing that he not  appear.'' Mr. Brechbuhl is still another person who could shed light on  President Trump's actions. He was kept updated on Rudy Giuliani's  broader efforts in Ukraine. He had firsthand knowledge of Secretary  Pompeo's involvement. For one thing, he handled Ambassador  Yovanovitch's recall from Ukraine, though he refused to meet with her  in the aftermath.   Also, messages by Ambassador Volker show that Mr. Brechbuhl knew  about Mr. Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine as they occurred. On July 10,  Ambassadors Taylor, Volker, and Sondland discussed Rudy Giuliani's push  abroad. While discussing the problems Rudy was creating by meddling in  official U.S. foreign policy, Ambassador Taylor noted that he ``briefed  Ulrich this afternoon.'' Also on August 11, Ambassador Sondland emailed  Mr. Brechbuhl to ask him to brief Secretary Pompeo in the statement he  was negotiating with President Zelensky, the aim of ``making the boss  happy enough to authorize an invitation.''   Ambassador Sondland wrote to him:         Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Z to be delivered       for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully       make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation.    Now, State Department Executive Secretary Lisa Kenna answered  Ambassador Sondland several hours later, letting him know that she  passed that information on to Secretary Pompeo. Let's pause here and  consider why this message to Mr. Brechbuhl, which the State Department  continues to conceal, is important. In this exchange, Ambassador  Sondland told Brechbuhl that he had negotiated a deal to get President  Zelensky to make a statement and that Sondland hoped that the promised  statement would ``make the boss happy enough to authorize an  invitation.''   It shows that senior State Department leadership, including Secretary  Pompeo, was quite aware of the deal to trade an invitation to the White  House for a statement from President Zelensky.   Indeed, Ambassador Sondland confirmed that he kept them in the loop.  Here is his testimony:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. We kept the leadership of the State       Department and the NSC informed of our activities, and that       included communications with Secretary of State Pompeo; his       counselor, Ulrich Brechbuhl; his Executive Secretary, Lisa       Kenna; and also communications with Ambassador Bolton, Dr.       Hill, Mr. Morrison, and their staff at the NSC. They knew       what we were doing and why.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Eight other witnesses were also ordered not to  testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, but those eight  witnesses came forward anyway, despite the President's efforts to  prevent them from testifying. All of the following witnesses were told  not to testify: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, Ambassador Gordon  Sondland, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Ambassador  Bill Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, Deputy  Associate Director at OMB Mark Sandy, State Department official  Catherine Croft, and State Department official Christopher Anderson.  Each of these eight witnesses followed the law. They obeyed House  subpoenas, and they testified before the House.   In all, we know that by issuing the blanket order and later specific  orders, President Trump prevented at least 12 current or former  administration officials from testifying during the House's impeachment  inquiry. He specifically forced nine of those witnesses to defy duly  authorized subpoenas.   The facts are straightforward, and they are not in dispute:   First, in the history of our Republic, no President ever dared to  issue an order to prevent even a single government witness from  testifying in an impeachment inquiry.   Second, President Trump abused the power of his office by using his  official power in an attempt to prevent every single person who works  in the executive branch from testifying before the House.   Finally, President Trump's orders, in fact, prevented the House from  obtaining key witness testimony from at least 12 current or former  government officials.    President Trump's orders were clear; they were categorical; they were  indiscriminate; and they were wrong. They prevented key government  witnesses from testifying. There is no doubt. That is obstruction,  plain and simple.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, now let us turn to some  final sets of facts. In a further effort to silence his administration,  President Trump engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and  intimidate the dedicated public servants who came forward to testify.  To be clear, these  [[Page S550]]  witnesses didn't seek the spotlight in this way. For years, they had  quietly and effectively performed their duties on behalf of our  national interest and on behalf of the American people.   Why would they seek the spotlight in this way, knowing that the  President of the United States would lead the chorus of attacks against  them. And he did. In response, the President issued threats, openly  discussed possible retaliation, attacked their character and  patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and other insults--the  President. The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of  Americans, including the witnesses, their families, their friends, and  their coworkers. This campaign of intimidation risked discouraging  witnesses from coming forward voluntarily or complying with mandatory  subpoenas for documents and testimony. And, as we all know, witness  intimidation is a Federal crime.   There is simply not enough time today to walk through each of the  President's attacks on the House's witnesses, but let's talk about a  few. As I am sure my colleagues recall, the House subpoenaed Ambassador  Marie Yovanovitch for public testimony. Ambassador Yovanovitch's first  tour was in Somalia, an increasingly dangerous place as that country's  civil war progressed. During a different tour, Ambassador Yovanovitch  helped to open a U.S. Embassy, during which time the Embassy was  attacked by a gunman who sprayed the Embassy building with gunfire.  Ambassador Yovanovitch has also served as an ambassador to Armenia and  served the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. As Chairman Schiff said earlier, she  has served in some dangerous places around the world on behalf of our  interests and the interests of the American people.   President Trump's Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs  described Ambassador Yovanovitch as ``an exceptional officer, doing  exceptional work at a critical embassy in Kyiv.'' But during Ambassador  Yovanovitch's public testimony, President Trump tweeted:         Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started       off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to       Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably       about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S.       President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.    In that same hearing, Chairman Schiff asked Ambassador Yovanovitch  for her reactions to the President's attacks during her testimony  before the House. Let's listen to that exchange.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
