 Mr. President, the legislative year is quickly drawing to  a close, but the lights on the 116th Congress haven't gone out yet.  Before the House and the Senate gavel out for the final time this  Congress, we still have a lot of work to do.   Headlines have focused on the large, ``must-pass'' legislation, which  will require a good amount of debate and compromise in the coming  days--things like government funding, the National Defense  Authorization bill, and another COVID-19 relief package. But there are  actually countless other bills that have already passed the Senate with  broad bipartisan support and continue to linger in purgatory on the  House's legislative calendar.   After weeks, months, and, in some cases, more than a year of waiting,  the Speaker and the House leadership refuse to let these commonsense  bipartisan bills have a vote on the House floor. Just to give you an  idea of the type of legislation they are holding up, let's start with  the Jenna Quinn Law. This legislation carries the name of an inspiring  young Texan who is a survivor of child sexual abuse and who has made it  her mission in life to end the cycle of abuse that harms our children  in communities across the country.   Jenna was the driving force behind a 2009 Texas law requiring  training for teachers, caregivers, and other adults who work with  children on how to prevent, recognize, and report child sexual abuse.  You can imagine the teachers, in particular, who spend--at least before  COVID--day after day after day with children. They are actually in the  best position, sometimes, to identify symptoms of sexual abuse, if  properly trained.   Since 2009, a number of other States have passed similar laws, but  the training often lacks adequate funding, and that is where our  Federal legislation comes in. I introduced this bipartisan bill with  Senator Hassan from New Hampshire to finally back that training with  Federal funding through grants from the Department of Health and Human  Services. At a time when the experts believe that abuse is on the rise  as families are isolated at home due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts,  this legislation could not be more urgent.   Despite the fact that this bill will deliver real change for the most  vulnerable in our communities and that it passed the Senate with  unanimous support, the House refuses to even vote on it. House  Democrats have chosen to hold this lifesaving legislation hostage in  order to advance a partisan bill that they know has no chance of  becoming law.   Unfortunately, those are the types of games that, sadly, we have had  to become accustomed to when it comes to House Democrats. But, as I  said, this is only one of a long list of bills that they are sitting  on.   Over the summer, the Senate passed legislation that had taken aim at  another crisis harming our children, which is e-cigarettes. Prior to  COVID-19, headlines were dominated by stories  [[Page S7205]]  about mysterious vaping-related illnesses and healthy teenagers being  admitted to emergency rooms with symptoms usually associated only with  decades-long smokers.   Well, to state the obvious, the most effective way to prevent  children from becoming addicted to these devices is to stop them from  getting their hands on them in the first place. If the 16-year-old went  to a gas station or convenience store and attempted to buy an e- cigarette, they would be turned away because that sale could not take  place without a proper ID, but those same age-verification requirements  don't apply to online purchases. Devices can be ordered and delivered  without any proof of age or an ID.   Senator Feinstein, the senior Senator from California, and I  introduced legislation to change that and ensure that online purchases  are subject to the same age verification requirements as those made in  person. Once again, this legislation passed the Senate unanimously, but  the House has refused to take any action.   And here is another one. Last month, we passed a bill to provide  mental healthcare to those transitioning out of the criminal justice  system. More than half of the individuals in the criminal justice  system have experienced a mental health issue, and our justice system  too often fails to provided adequate diagnosis and treatment.   But even when these individuals do receive treatment while  incarcerated, they are rarely given the tools they need to succeed upon  release. Approximately 80 percent of the people are uninsured after  being released, making it nearly impossible for them to continue mental  health treatment without additional safety net provisions.   Senator Blumenthal, our colleague from Connecticut, and I introduced  legislation to support those who have become part of our criminal  justice system who have decided to turn their lives around and to  provide them stable treatment if they suffer from a mental illness as  they transition out of incarceration. That is not only in their best  interest, but it is in the best interest of the larger community,  because these people, rather than being a danger to the community, can  contribute to the community.   This legislation passed the Senate with unanimous support, but, once  again, no movement in the House, and the list goes on and on and on.   We unanimously approved legislation to provide justice to families of  human smuggling victims and assistance to local communities battling  the problem, to help State and local governments strengthen their cyber  security and safeguard their elections, and to increase cross-border  economic and educational partnerships with Mexico.   Those half dozen bills I just named are only a handful of the ones I  introduced that have passed the Senate but are collecting dust on the  House calendar. Add in the long list of bills led by our Republican and  Democratic colleagues, and we have a major legislative logjam in the  House.   As I understand it, next week is set to be the House's last workweek  of the 116th Congress. That means that, unless Speaker Pelosi and House  Democratic leadership allow movement on these compromise, commonsense  bipartisan bills, we are going to have to start from square one. We are  going to have to start all over again in the next Congress.   Now, I know it is not unusual for a Member of Congress to take  legislative hostages to advance their own agenda, but this is not a  time to play those kinds of politics, particularly on these kinds of  subjects. These aren't controversial bills. We are talking about grants  to prevent child sexual abuse, reform to stop kids from buying e- cigarettes online, a lifeline of hope for folks who suffer from mental  illness and are transitioning from our criminal justice system, and so  much more.    As I said, these bills are just one step away from heading to the  President's desk for his signature, so it is time for Speaker Pelosi  and the leadership of the House to quit playing games and allow the  House to vote on these life-changing bills.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, we know we have a lot  of lawyers in Congress, and we have some former businessmen. We even  have people who are lawyers and businessmen who serve in our midst.  They are doctors, educators. We have a few farmers. But we have only  two accountants, to my knowledge, one of whom is our friend Mike Enzi.   For those of us who have long fought to rein in spending and to get  our national debt in check, Mike's contribution to those efforts has  been invaluable. But that is only part of the reason we are sad to say  farewell to such an incredible colleague.   Long before Senator Enzi's career in politics or even accounting, he  joined the family shoe business, cleverly named ``NZ Shoes''--that is  capital ``N,'' capital ``Z,'' Shoes. It wasn't long before our friend  Mike, at the young age of 30, was lured into a life of public service  and elected mayor of Gillette, WY. His career would lead him to the  Department of the Interior, the Wyoming State House and Senate, and  eventually here to the U.S. Senate. But Senator Enzi still holds on to  the lessons he learned in those early days selling shoes.   A few years ago, he said:         Legislating is like selling shoes. You have to know your       market, what they want, and who's willing to buy what you're       [selling].    Well, I don't know how effective Mike was as a shoe salesman, but I  can tell you that he has been a master broker here in the Senate. I  still remember when I came to the Senate, the liberal lion of the  Senate, Ted Kennedy, was serving with Mike Enzi on the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. They were enormously  productive--one of the most conservative Members and one of the most  liberal Members of the U.S. Senate. So I asked Mike, our friend Senator  Enzi: How do you do it?   He said: It is simple. It is the 80-20 rule. You take the 80 percent  that you can agree on, the common ground, and you get it done, and you  leave the 20 percent that you can't agree on to another day and another  fight.   That is the kind of common sense we need more of here in the U.S.  Senate when it comes to solving our Nation's problems.   When there are big debates on policy or high-stakes negotiations,  Senator Enzi is not one to share his opinions with reporters in the  hallways or, thankfully, to air his grievances on national television,  but he does work behind the scenes, settling disagreements with private  phone calls and meetings rather than fiery speeches and press releases.   There is no question he has had to settle a lot of disagreements  during his 24 years in the Senate, especially, as I said, during his  time on the HELP Committee and as chairman of the Budget Committee. We  have 100 individuals in the Senate from all across this big and diverse  Nation of ours who have very different ideas about what should be done  and opinions on how to get it done, but part of what makes him so  successful is settling those differences--look past the areas where we  disagree, and look at common ground.   Besides the 80-20 rule that has forever stuck in my mind as a great  formula for solving problems and getting things done, Mike has a great  attitude about life--one that I find very positive and inspiring, even.  He says: ``You have to have an attitude of gratitude.''   That is another thing I will remember about Mike Enzi--always  grateful for his ability to serve his fellow Wyoming citizens, for his  family, his wonderful family, and for this great country that we live  in. I know he is eager to spend more time enjoying the great outdoors.  Mike has said he wants to actually go fishing in all 50 States. I don't  know how many States he has not yet fished in, but after he leaves the  U.S. Senate, hopefully he will accomplish his goal of going fishing in  all 50 States of the Union.   We will miss him here in the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
