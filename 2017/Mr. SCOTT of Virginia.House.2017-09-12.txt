 Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), and I have an amendment at  the desk, No. 113.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 346, strike line 18 and all that follows through line       2 on page 347.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike  language in the bill that would prohibit the EEOC from using its funds  to implement pay data collection.   Mr. Chairman, we know that racial and gender pay gaps exist in  America. The Obama administration, a few years ago, created the  National Equal Pay Task Force, which recommended this new data  collection, the EEO-1 form, which would, for the first time, require  employers to provide not just data on who is hired by race, sex, and  ethnicity, but also to include pay data.   The EEOC has collected employer data since 1966. There has been no  problem with confidentiality. So for 50 years we have gotten  information on the race, sex, and ethnicity of those employed, but we  do not have the pay data, and the pay data would expose the pay  disparities where all the women are paid less than men. You don't find  that on the present EEO-1 form.   Recently, the OMB, without warning or transparency, rescinded the  EEOC's plan to collect the data, which was to begin in March. This  amendment would make it clear that Congress should honor the purpose  and spirit of title VII and permit the EEOC to carry out its statutory  obligation to collect necessary data needed to enforce civil rights  laws.   Mr. Chair, I would hope that we would adopt this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chairman, the form is not a complaint. We know that there are pay  disparities. This would allow the EEOC to notice gruesome problems and  disparities and address them where appropriate.   In that hospital situation, it is obvious the situation is not  appropriate, but we do know that pay disparities exist, and this would  be information that would allow the EEOC to address them.   I would hope that we would allow the EEOC to do its job.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.   The Chair understands that amendment No. 114 will not be offered.                   Amendment No. 115 Offered by Mr. Zeldin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 115  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bi- partisan amendment that would increase funding for the Black Lung  Clinics Programs in the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA)  by $2.7 million. This increase, when added to the $7.2 million provided  in the appropriations bill being considered, will provide $10 million  in total funding for Fiscal Year 2018. I want to commend Representative  Griffith for his leadership on this issue.   The additional funding proposed by the amendment is fully offset by a  reduction in program management, and the total amount of $10 million is  equal to the permanently authorized amount. That level, I would note,  has remained the same since the Black Lung Clinics Program was first  authorized in the 92nd Congress as part of the Black Lung Benefits Act  of 1972.   Today, there are 28 black lung clinics located in 15 coal mining  states which, with small grants provided by HRSA's Federal Office of  Rural Health Policy, serve as a lifeline for disabled miners.   In many cases, these coal miners spent a lifetime working in our  nation's mines, but now face black lung disease--a debilitating and  frequently fatal lung disease that continues to erode lung function  even after a miner leaves work in the mines. Since 1968, 76,000 miners  have lost their lives to black lung disease.   The black lung clinics program is expected to serve 13,800 miners  this year. The need for these clinics is rising due to an increase in  the number of black lung cases, coupled with an increased number of  miners who are now seeking assistance following the closure of mines.   The rate of black lung disease in coal miners fell steadily in the 30  years following the enactment of binding coal dust exposure limits in  the 1969 Coal Mine Safety and Health Act. However, that favorable  downward trend started to reverse beginning in 2000, according to the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH is  also finding that miners are becoming totally disabled from black lung  at much younger ages.   The increase in black lung disease has been due in part to longer  mining shifts, more powerful mining machinery, and mine operators  cutting into more rock because the easiest reach coal has been mined  out. Much of that rock is quartz bearing sandstone which, which when  mined, releases large amounts of silica containing mine dust that is  far more toxic than coal dust.   The most severe form of black lung disease, known as progressive  massive fibrosis or PMF, has spiked dramatically. Earlier this year,  NIOSH reported that the Stone Mountain Resources clinic in southwest  Virginia had identified the largest cluster of PMF ever found--over 400  cases. National Public Radio has reported on large clusters in Kentucky  and other states.   PMF produces large masses of scar tissue in the lung, and often the  only means for survival is undergoing a high-risk lung transplant.   While funding for the black lung clinics has been frozen at virtually  the same level for the past 5 years, a number of clinics, including  many of those in Appalachia, have faced substantial increase in demand  from coal miners for screening, diagnosis and pulmonary rehabilitation.   Clinics provide benefits counseling, including assisting miners with  federal black lung benefits and state compensation claims.   Some clinics are so underfunded that they are operating with obsolete  and inefficient diagnostic equipment, which needs to be upgraded.   Mr. Chair, we owe it to coal miners to get them the care and benefits  they need and deserve. I urge a yes vote.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.   The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania) assumed the  chair.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this  amendment, which would increase funding for youth employment activities  under the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act.   As has been stated, about 5 million of our Nation's youth are both  out of school and out of work, so we have a choice: Do we invest to  help our youth get on a good path towards a good job, or do we pay  considerably more later?   We have to choose to invest now. This includes increased funding for  youth employment activities that help out-of-school and out-of-work  youth, and it helps fund summer jobs, on-the-job training,  apprenticeship training, and others. The alternative is to pay much  more later in incarceration, teen pregnancy, and public assistance.  When we make these Federal investments now, we make investments in our  communities, our Nation, and our shared future, and we save money in  the future.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would reduce  funding by 10 percent for programs administered by all accounts in the  Labor-HHS appropriations bill. By making it across the board, it makes  it more difficult for the agencies to actually administer their  programs, making it harder, if not impossible, for the government to  protect its citizens by enforcing wage and protection laws, ensuring  safe workplaces, ensuring education for students with disabilities,  support for those with drug addictions.   The bill, as the gentlewoman has already indicated, is already  underfunded, and this would just make matters worse.   Mr. Chairman, I would hope we defeat this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Ms.  Bonamici, the vice ranking member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee, for offering the amendment and for her leadership on issues  affecting older Americans.    The Older Americans Act was first passed 50 years ago as part of  Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. It helps older Americans live with  dignity and stay connected with their communities. I am proud that last  year we were able to pass a 3-year bipartisan reauthorization that  increased funding for the programs. But had our investments in these  programs actually kept up with inflation and growing populations, the  authorization levels would have been even much more. But, thankfully,  the reauthorization moved us in the right direction.   This amendment would bring funding for supportive services, nutrition  programs, and caregiver supports in line with the authorized level.  Even though these are not fully adequate to address the total need, it  is another step in the right direction. So I support the amendment and  our commitment to older Americans. We can maintain that commitment by  adopting this amendment, so I thank the gentlewoman for offering it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would take money from important college  access programs, GEAR UP and TRIO, and use it to increase important  funding for career and technical education. Because of the way the  amendment is drafted, it would also jeopardize funding for minority- serving institutions to be used to increase that funding. This  amendment reduces funding for programs meant to improve college access  for low-income students.   First of all, whether it is CTE or TRIO, all of these programs don't  have enough money. One should not be stripped for the sake of another.  By lifting one program that leads to one opportunity over neglecting  another that leads to another opportunity, you limit the choice of  future life outcomes at a time when members of the next generation  should be able to choose the best opportunity for them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment  and try to fund both more robustly.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, one of the agencies affected by this amendment is the  Department of Education's Office of Inspector General that is  responsible for conducting independent and objective audits and  investigations. It is through this agency that we can review offices  like the Federal Student Aid office, and Congress can learn about  policies and practices that need to be improved. It was just last March  that the OIG investigated that department and found that Congress needs  to do more to  [[Page H7298]]  monitor colleges with unstable finances in order to protect students  and taxpayers from abrupt school closures.   Any cuts to this agency will reduce the chances that such findings  will be made, and reduce consumer protections. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, as my colleagues have made clear, this amendment would  impose a 45 percent cut on the NLRB budget. The NLRB would expect that  these cuts could lead to the closure of regional offices in 17 States,  but it is really the American workforce and our economy that would  suffer.   We benefit from a worker's right to exercise freedom of association.  These cuts will delay NLRB-conducted representation or decertification  elections and delay democracy for workers who deserve a timely vote.   In the past 3 years, the NLRB has reinstated 7,000 workers who were  unlawfully fired by their employers, and the NLRB has awarded over $191  million to workers in backpay or fees.   Mr. Chairman, justice delayed is justice denied. Delayed justice is  what this amendment would inflict.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment irresponsibly  cuts funding for coal mine safety and health by 10 percent, cuts 96  positions in the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA. The  Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 established MSHA and  requires MSHA to conduct four wall-to-wall inspections every year on  underground mines and two wall-to-wall inspections for every surface  mine. These are mandatory and required for safety in the mines.   MSHA is required to conduct spot inspections every 5 days at those  coal mines that release large amounts of combustible methane since  those mines have the highest risk of fires and explosions.   In addition to the mandatory and spot inspections, MSHA responds to  hazard complaints from miners, investigates discrimination complaints,  and provides compliance assistance with standards such as the new rule  to prevent the scourge of black lung disease.   If this amendment is enacted, 96 positions will be cut and MSHA will  have to choose between the mandatory inspections or meeting its  obligation to implement these other essential functions. It can't do  both, yet all of these functions are necessary to protect the health  and safety of miners.   Mr. Chairman, the preamble of the Mine Act of 1977 states: ``The  first . . . concern of all in the coal''--or other--``mining industry  must be the health and safety of its most precious resource--the  miner.'' This amendment abandons Congress' commitment to America's  miners and should be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from Cecil E. Roberts,  the International President of the United Mine Workers of America, in  opposition to this amendment.                                 United Mine Workers of America,                                    Triangle, VA, September 7, 2017.      Members of the House of Representatives,      U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the United Mine Workers       of America, I strongly urge you to reject the Amendment       offered by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina that       would reduce the Coal Mine Safety and Health program and       workforce at the Mine Safety and Health Administration.        At a time when mining fatalities are on the rise, we should       be looking for ways to increase enforcement and oversight of       mining  [[Page H7300]]       operations, not make it harder to ensure that our miners are       safe.        America's miners put their lives and limbs on the line       every single day for us. Our government has a responsibility       to do all it can do to ensure they come home to their loved       ones at the end of their shift. This amendment is a step       backward in safety, putting miners at greater risk. I       strongly urge that it be rejected.            Sincerely,                                                 Cecil E. Roberts,.     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by Mr. Walberg that  [[Page H7301]]  would block the National Labor Relations Board election streamlining  rule because this amendment would result in reverting to a previous  rule that would result in needless delays in the process for conducting  union representation elections.   The election streamlining rule was adopted in 2015, and it has  increased transparency, reduced frivolous litigation, and decreased the  opportunity for bad actors to improperly delay union elections.   The preelection process previously had been open to manipulation,  delay, and drawn-out preelection maneuvering. I point out that the so- called 11-day election that has been referred to can only occur if both  sides agree to a consent election.   Another part of the rule requires the employer to provide more modern  forms of employee contact information to the union prior to the  elections, such as email addresses and phone numbers, as opposed to the  previous requirement that the employer only provide home addresses.  Under the new rule, employers must provide this electronically within 2  days of ordering an election.   By ensuring that there is a timely transfer of more complete voter  contact information, the rule removed another obstacle that had denied  workers the opportunity to be more fully informed prior to voting on  whether or not to form a union. The employer, of course, already has  unfettered and unlimited access to communicate with employees, even on  work time.   I also want to point out that the NLRB's election procedures are now  settled law. Every court where this rule has been challenged has upheld  the rule. The fifth circuit, for example, said that the Board ``acted  rationally and in furtherance of its congressional mandate in adopting  the rule.''   The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that ``the  Board engaged in comprehensive analysis of a multitude of issues  relating to the need for and the propriety of the final rule.''   Mr. Chairman, history has shown when workers' rights are respected,  the economy benefits. Protecting workers' rights to make their voices  heard helped build a strong middle class. Research shows that the  erosion of union density has weakened the middle class and exacerbated  wage stagnation by breaking the essential link between increasing  worker productivity and rising wages.   This amendment undermines workers in their ability to exercise their  right to collectively bargain. Plain and simple, the workers have a  right to join a union, and if they ask for an election, they should get  an election--not a delay, not interference, and not retaliation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk  made in order under the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  No funds made available by this Act may be used       to undertake any activities to prepare for or facilitate the       transfer of responsibilities or functions from the Office of       Federal Contract Compliance Programs of the Department of       Labor to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the  use of funds in this act to prepare for or facilitate the transfer of  the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance  Programs into the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.   The amendment would ensure that these two important agencies charged  with distinct missions to enforce workplace discrimination laws are not  unduly burdened by the administration's plan to transfer  responsibilities of Contract Compliance into the EEOC.   Although both agencies enforce discrimination laws, they differ in  their authorities, their scope, and their responsibilities. For  example, Contract Compliance only addresses discrimination by Federal  contractors, unlike the EEOC, which enforces the laws as they relate to  virtually all employees.   Contract Compliance is responsible for ensuring that the Federal  contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to ensure that  all individuals have equal opportunity for employment. EEOC was created  by title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and its support for affirmative  action is voluntary.   Contract Compliance, the focus is on contract compliance, and the  ultimate sanction is disbarment of a Federal contractor. It gets its  authority through an executive order and accomplishes much of its  enforcement through the administrative process. By contrast, EEOC is  established by statute and makes and enforces Federal statutes through  lawsuits in Federal courts. Other distinctions:   The ultimate client for Contract Compliance is the Federal  Government, while EEOC's clients are private employees;   EEOC is complaint driven, unlike the Office of Federal Contract  Compliance;   Contract Compliance can audit contractors, EEOC cannot;   EEOC has subpoena power, Contract Compliance does not;   Contract Compliance does not have the authority to file lawsuits and  get punitive damages, EEOC can seek punitive damages and lawsuits;   Contract Compliance enforces the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment  Act, the EEOC does not;   EEOC protects employees from genetic discrimination, Contract  Compliance does not.   The proposal to transfer the Office of Federal Contract Compliance  into the EEOC came about by some ideological groups that want to shrink  the Federal Government, but it is unwise because it is opposed by civil  rights groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   To underscore the collective voice and opposition to this transfer,  the Senate Committee on Appropriations adopted language last Thursday  that says that the committee rejects the budget's proposal to begin  plans to merge the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs with  the EEOC.   Mr. Chair, the realignment of responsibilities would ask the EEOC to  do considerably more with a lot less in terms of expertise, personnel,  and funding. Further, this combination would derail the EEOC's efforts  to reduce its backlog of charges while simultaneously trying to collect  vital data relevant to the enforcement of civil rights laws.   The enforcement of civil rights laws would be best served if we in  Congress would fully fund both the EEOC and the Office of Federal  Contract Compliance so that they both can do the vital work of securing  the right to work in a place free of harassment, retaliation, and other  forms of discrimination.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 186 Offered by Mr. Ellison    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 186  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, we know that there are a lot of  contractors who have significant wage violations. It should be a  privilege to contract with the Federal Government. Taxpayers should not  be asked to subsidize companies that engage in willful and repeated  wage theft.   This amendment only applies to contractors with repeated willful  violations, not technical violations that could result from good faith  difference in interpretation of rules and regulations--willful and  repeated.   Awarding contracts to those kind of contractors is not only unfair to  workers, it is unfair to law-abiding contractors who play by the rules  but are forced to compete on an unlevel playing field with those who  cut corners.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Civil Liberties Union.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2017.  Vote YES on Amendments No. 113, No. 184, and No. 186 to H.R. 3354, the        Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union and our more than two million members and       supporters, we urge you to support the following amendments       that may be offered during floor consideration of H.R. 3354,       the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act,       2018:    1. Amendment No. 113 (preserving funding for the EEOC/EEO-1 equal pay                              data collection)         In July, the House Appropriations Committee adopted the       Harris Amendment to defund implementation of the Equal       Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) revised Employer       Information Report (EEO-1). Amendment No. 113, offered by       Representatives DeLauro, Frankel, and Scott to the FY18 CJS       appropriations bill, would preserve funding for that critical       equal pay initiative.        The data collection at issue, through the EEO-1 that       employers already must use to document the demographics of       their workforces, is a critical tool to lift the cloak of       secrecy that shrouds pay decisions in this country. Without       such transparency, the pernicious gender and race wage gaps,       and the discrimination that causes them, will continue to       flourish. The new EEO-1 revision was adopted after extensive       public comment and would have deterred intentional pay       disparities, facilitated employers' good faith efforts to       comply with equal pay laws, and identified appropriate       targets for federal enforcement of nondiscrimination law.        Instead of supporting this measured approach to eliminate       the pay gap, the EEO-1 has been undermined by members of       Congress and the Trump Administration's Office of Management       and Budget, which recently halted implementation of the EEO-1       equal pay data collection. Because OMB has ordered a review       and requested that the EEOC undertake a new effort, the       Harris amendment could unnecessarily tie the agency's hands.       Members should vote in favor of the DeLauro-Frankel-Scott       amendment in order to preserve the ability of the EEOC to       continue to make meaningful progress on equal pay. A vote       against this amendment is a vote against equal pay.   2. Amendment No. 184 (no funding to eliminate OFCCP and transfer duties                                  to EEOC)         The Trump administration's FY2018 budget submission to       Congress recommended the elimination of the Department of       Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs       (OFCCP) and the transfer of its functions to the EEOC. This       amendment, offered by Representatives Conyers and Scott to       the FY18 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, would       withhold federal funding in order to prevent implementation       of this ill-advised proposal.        These vital and distinct agencies have different missions       and different areas of expertise. The EEOC seeks to remedy       complaints of discrimination in employment. The OFCCP more       broadly oversees the employment practices of federal       contractors who are required to proactively monitor workplace       diversity and pay equity, make meaningful efforts to recruit       qualified applicants from under-represented groups, and       eliminate barriers to equal opportunity for various       disadvantaged groups, including veterans and individuals with       disabilities. The administration's proposal would jeopardize       the uniquely important missions of each agency and weakens       our government's ability to effectively enforce our nation's       civil rights laws. It would also place an extraordinary       burden on the EEOC which already has an excessive workload       and a well-known backlog. Finally, numerous organizations       that work with these agencies--from civil rights, women's       rights, and workers' rights groups along with business groups       such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--oppose the       administration's proposal.        For these reasons, we urge members of the House to support       Amendment No. 184 that would prevent the elimination of       OFCCP.   3. Amendment No. 186 (no funding to federal contractors who repeatedly                        and willfully violate FLSA)         This amendment, offered by Representatives Ellison,       Grijalva and Pocan to the FY18 Labor-HHS-Education       appropriations bill, would ensure that no federal contracts       are entered into with entities that willfully and repeatedly       violate the Fair Labor Standards Act.        Employers that have the privilege of doing business with       the federal government also have a responsibility to comply       with our laws. This amendment would provide a strong       protection against our government doing business with       employers that commit labor violations.        Should you have any questions, please contact Vania       Leveille.            Sincerely,  [[Page H7309]]       Faiz Shakir,        Director, Washington Legislative Office.      Vania Leveille,        Senior Legislative Counsel.     Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I  urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which blocks  OSHA's ability to improve tracking of injuries and illnesses in  workplaces across the country.   One of the problems we have is that Federal OSHA and State OSHA plans  have less than 2,000 inspectors to cover 8 million workplaces  nationally. If you do the arithmetic, each Federal OSHA inspector can  inspect a workplace about once every 159 years. State OSHA might be  able to do it once a century. So the fact that you have something on  site that is there for them to see if they ever get there, the problem  is they never get there.   We need to make sure they have the information to know which ones to  go to, which ones are the dangerous sites. The scarce resources that  OSHA needs to precisely target those resources is a result of these  reports. For large employers, and each illness with summary information  from smaller employers, that is how they figure out where to visit.    This rule also protects workers against discrimination if they report  injuries. GAO has found that workers fear reporting injuries,  especially where employers impose sanctions or reduce bonuses for work- related injuries.   This amendment would upend this important rule which allows OSHA to  target their resources to inspect those that really need inspecting.  This amendment would upend the rule and compromise its transparency and  worker protections.   The information is not individually identifiable. People are  protected. But  [[Page H7310]]  the courts have said that this information is not confidential.   This amendment would rig the system against worker safety by  depriving OSHA of the information they need to target the workplaces,  so I request a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
