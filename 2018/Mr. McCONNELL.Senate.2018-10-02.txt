 Madam President, if you stop and listen, you can  practically hear the Democrats trying to move the goalposts on Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Remember, before Judge  Kavanaugh was even named, several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  indicated they would oppose whoever the nominee might turn out to be.   The junior Senator from California, for example, explained on  television that whomever President Trump chose would bring about ``the  destruction of the Constitution of the United States as far as I can  tell.'' That was, incredibly enough, from a member of the Judiciary  Committee.   Of course, mere hours after Judge Kavanaugh was announced, my friend,  the Democratic leader, made the announcement that has now become  famous. ``I will oppose him with everything I've got,'' he said.   Not long after that, another Democrat on the Judiciary Committee  proclaimed that anyone supporting Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation was-- listen to this--``complicit in the evil.''   These statements are the context for every action the Democrats have  taken during this entire process. These statements remind us: Democrats  may be trying to move the goalposts every 5 minutes, but their goal has  not moved an inch. They will not be satisfied unless they have brought  down Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   It started with straightforward political maneuvering. None of it  worked, of course, but there were whatever issues they could find to  delay, delay, delay.   First, back in June, the Democrats tried to argue that the Senate  shouldn't confirm a Supreme Court Justice in any even-numbered year.  Then they were reminded that Justices Kagan, Breyer, and Souter were  all confirmed during midterm election years, and that argument  evaporated.   Next, the Democrats said the process should be delayed because too  few documents were available from Judge Kavanaugh's past public  service. Well, then they received the most pages of documents ever  produced for a Supreme Court nomination. So guess what came next. The  goalposts moved down the field, and the Democrats called for a delay  because there were too many documents for them to read.   I wish this fight could have remained in the realm of normalcy, but  when none of these tactics worked--when Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated  his widely acknowledged brilliance, openmindedness, and collegiality at  his confirmation hearings--some chose a darker road. The politics of  personal destruction were willfully unleashed.   I have spoken at length about the underhanded way the Democrats have  treated Dr. Ford and her allegation. In brief, for 6 weeks, Dr. Ford's  confidential account passed from one Democratic Member of Congress to  the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee, to the Washington, DC,  lawyers whom the Senate Democrats handpicked for her. Then, well after  Judge Kavanaugh's hearings had wrapped up,  [[Page S6418]]  the supposedly confidential letter found its way into the press-- shoving aside proper procedure, shoving aside the accuser's plea for  privacy.   This is not politics as usual because let us not forget that Dr.  Ford's allegation is not the only uncorroborated allegation that has  been breathlessly paraded around. Oh, no. Shortly after Dr. Ford's  confidential letter made its way into the press, the floodgates of mud  and muck opened entirely on Brett Kavanaugh and his family. Out of the  woodwork came one uncorroborated allegation after another, each  seemingly more outlandish than the last.   A tabloid lawyer organized a red carpet rollout for someone who  wanted to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of masterminding some kind of high  school drug and serial sexual assault ring--of hosting one wild party  after another, filled with sexual violence, for which there  conveniently happen to be zero witnesses but plenty of people to refute  the claims. This didn't stay in the tabloids, by the way. This  fantastic story was effectively read into the record of the Judiciary  Committee by the ranking member, who decided it deserved a mention in  her remarks during last Thursday's hearing. Then every Democratic  member of the Judiciary Committee seized on this outlandish tale in a  formal letter in which they called on Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw his  name from consideration.   This is how desperate some became for any way to stop this stunningly  qualified nominee. I guess upholding any standards of any kind was just  too much to ask.   We heard of another anonymous, unattributed, and now thoroughly  debunked account--this time of an anonymous accusation from Colorado  that alleged physical abuse 20 years ago. A sitting Federal district  court judge quickly stepped up to bat down that anonymous smear.   We heard that Judge Kavanaugh was supposedly responsible for a sexual  assault on a boat in Newport, RI, until the accuser recanted the story  completely, but it was not before many in the media had begun eating it  up.   In short, the Democrats' mishandling of Dr. Ford's letter opened the  floodgates for this deluge of uncorroborated, unbelievable mud, and the  mudslide was cheered on and capitalized on at every turn by the far  left, which has been so eager to stop this nomination.   Just politics? I don't think so.   On the other extreme, some of the other lines of attack have been  completely trivial. Last night, the New York Times unleashed this  ``major'' story. Get this--Judge Kavanaugh may have been accused of  throwing some ice across a college bar in the mid-1980s. Talk about a  bombshell. One can only imagine what new bombshell might be published  today or tomorrow.   Here is what we know--one thing for sure: The Senate will vote on  Judge Kavanaugh here on this floor this week.   Our Democratic friends will try to move the goalposts yet again. Just  yesterday, they submitted a list of 24 people whom they want the FBI to  interview. So I am confident we will hear that even the very same  supplemental FBI investigation the Democrats had so loudly demanded  will now, magically, no longer be sufficient.   Well, after the FBI shares what it has found, Senators will have the  opportunity to vote. We will have the opportunity to vote no on the  politics of personal destruction. We will have the opportunity to vote  yes on this fine nominee.                                  Tax Reform    Madam President, on an entirely different matter, the U.S. economy  continues to deliver very good news. My home State of Kentucky is,  certainly, no exception.   Yesterday morning, I had the opportunity to take part in the  announcement of a major new investment in my hometown of Louisville. GE  Appliances unveiled its plan to create 400 new jobs and to invest more  than $200 million in Kentucky. It is expanding its laundry and  dishwasher production facilities and is upgrading its capacity for  innovation.   GE's Appliance Park--where nearly 6,000 currently work--has been a  manufacturing landmark in Louisville for more than six decades. The  facility has meant a great deal to my community. At its height, it  employed some 20,000 workers. However, following the sluggish economy  of the last decade, the workforce has shrunk to just one-fifth of its  previous strength. So yesterday's announcement marked a step in a very  new direction--aggressive expansion, doubling down on American workers.  It is the same story that is being written all over America by job  creators, large and small.   Where did the new direction come from? What changed? Well, for one  thing, the policy climate here in Washington changed.   GE Appliances' President and CEO Kevin Nolan said, ``The changes in  rates and favorable tax treatment of investments in machinery and  equipment play a big role in our expansion plans''--more jobs for  Kentuckians, more prosperity for local communities.   I would like to ask the men and women who will get one of these new  jobs what they make of the fact that every single Democrat in Congress  voted to block the tax reform that is helping this happen.   The Republicans got it done anyway. We delivered sweeping tax cuts  for workers and families. Now, thanks in part to our policies, the  economy is thriving. Just last month, consumer confidence reached its  highest level in 18 years. In other words, American families are  feeling better about spending and investing in their communities than  they have felt since September of 2000.   In September of 2000, the Senate pages serving here on the floor  hadn't even been born yet, but as these young folks continue their  studies and enter the workforce, they will be participating in an  American economy with more opportunities, where workers keep more of  their hard-earned paychecks. That is the economy Republicans had in  mind when we voted to enact generational tax reform and to lift the  regulatory burden on investors and job creators. It is the economy we  are continuing to work for every day.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, October 3; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal  of proceedings and the Executive Journal be approved to date, and the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day;  further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, all time postcloture on the  House message to accompany H.R. 302 be considered expired at 12 noon.    Mr. President, if there is no business to come before  the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:35 p.m., recessed until 10  a.m. Wednesday, October 3, 2018.
