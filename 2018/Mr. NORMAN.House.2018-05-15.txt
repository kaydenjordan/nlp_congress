 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. John  Wilkerson, Jr., who died on May 9, 2018. He was born in Hickory Grove,  South Carolina, and remained a South Carolina local throughout his  life.   As a young man, he served in the United States Navy and graduated  from Clemson College with a degree in physics. After graduation, Mr.  Wilkerson went on to lead a very successful business career. He was the  owner of Wilkerson Oil Company, along with his brother, Merritt, and he  later became the owner of River Hills Realty.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 15, 2018, on page H3959, the following appeared: He was the  owner of Wilkerson Oil Company, along with his brother, Merritt,  and he later became the owner of River Hills Reality.      The online version has been corrected to read: He was the owner  of Wilkerson Oil Company, along with his brother, Merritt, and he  later became the owner of River Hills Realty.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Mr. Wilkerson was also an active member in his community as a member  of the River Hills Community Church, River Hills Lions Club, and the  Lake Wylie Chamber of Commerce.
