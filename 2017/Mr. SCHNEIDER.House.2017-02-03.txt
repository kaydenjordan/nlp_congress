 Mr. Speaker, too many of our veterans struggle to find  a job despite their unique leadership abilities and proven skill sets.   At the same time, I hear from small businesses that our economy  skills gap is widening. Manufacturers want to hire, but positions sit  unfilled because they cannot find qualified workers.   That is why I am proud to introduce, this week, the GI Internship  Program Act. The bill brings together these two sides, veterans and our  small businesses, to bridge the skills gap and expand the job  opportunities available to those who served our Nation.   Since 1944, we have committed to providing our returning military men  and women a quality education, but not every lesson is best learned in  the classroom. This legislation allows veterans to receive their post- 9/11 GI Bill benefit as a stipend while participating in a qualifying  6-month to 1-year internship or apprenticeship, at no additional cost  to taxpayers.   I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with my colleague from  Florida, Congressman Ted Yoho. I encourage our colleagues to join us in  support of our veterans and manufacturers on this win-win commonsense  legislation.                            ____________________
