 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Lyudmila  Alexeyeva, a true giant for human rights in Russia and around the  world. Ms. Alexeyeva passed away over the weekend in Moscow and left  behind children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, but that was  just her immediate family. Lyudmila's leadership and fearlessness  inspired a generation of human rights and democracy activists in  Russia; she was the grandmother of human rights in the country, and her  stalwart leadership in the face of repression will truly be missed.  Today is International Human Rights Day, a fitting moment to pay  tribute this incredible leader.   In thinking about Lyudmila's legacy, three words come to mind:  vision, tenacity, and courage.   Starting from her days drafting a Samizdat journal called the  Chronicle of Current Events that scrutinized the Khrushchev regime,  Lyudmila had the vision of a Soviet Union in which all of its citizens  played a role in ensuring accountable governance and democratic  principles. She saw the opportunity to fulfill this vision in the 1975  Helsinki Accords, especially those tenets which enshrined the critical  notion that signatory countries' respect for human rights inside their  borders was integral to security in the transatlantic region. The  Brezhnev government at the time had no intention of honoring those  elements of Helsinki, but Lyudmila worked together with her compatriots  to set up the Moscow Helsinki Group to monitor implementation of the  Accords. The Moscow Helsinki Group inspired the proliferation of sister  organizations in other countries whose governments had committed to  Helsinki principles, including here in Congress with the Commission for  Security and Cooperation in Europe. This platform inside of the Soviet  Union and across the transatlantic space was critically important to  build those bonds of international solidarity among so many likeminded  democrats and human rights defenders. She was indeed a true visionary  for open, democratic societies, and the bonds she built with and among  activists who shared that vision stand strong to this day.   Second, tenacity--Lyudmila faced so many obstacles during the Soviet  period and the Putin era. After starting Moscow Helsinki, the pressure  from the Soviet regime grew so great that she had to seek exile in the  United States for 16 years. During that time, she became an American  citizen, a proud moment for us here in this country. While in exile,  she remained committed to  [[Page S7384]]  her vision. She advocated for international support for the plight of  dissidents and human rights activists suffering repression in the  Soviet Bloc. In the tradition of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Lyudmila wrote  extensively on her country, publishing two important works: ``The Thaw  Generation. Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era'' and ``Soviet  Dissent.'' She also worked for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty during  this period.   Once she was able to return to Russia after the fall of the Soviet  Union, Lyudmila dove right back into her work, scrutinizing the human  rights record of Boris Yeltsin and resisting the sharp turn away from  democracy under Vladimir Putin. As the space for civil society voices  contracted inside Russia, Lyudmila was a clear and dogged advocate for  freedom, a voice for the universal declaration of human rights and a  voice for a better Russia. Despite this closing space, she expended  enormous energy on mentoring and organizing a new generation of Russian  human rights defenders to carry the torch. During this period, she  would travel to Washington and was a true force of nature. She always  had a few young activists in tow to make sure they were connected with  key policymakers in DC. By doing so, she made clear to us in Washington  that not all was lost inside Russia, that a tenacious new generation of  activists was willing to take this baton of freedom and run the next  leg of the race, and that they deserved our respect, attention, and  support.   Finally, courage--Lyudmila did not have to do this work. This calling  subjected her and her family to pressure and repression by different  regimes over the years. It subjected her to 16 years in exile from her  homeland. After so much hard work during the Soviet era, she could have  settled into retirement, leaving the toils of civil society development  and human rights defense to a new generation, but as repression grew  under Putin, Lyudmila would continue the work undaunted. Well into her  70s and 80s, she would continue to organize. She would continue to  travel to foreign capitals, only to face increased scrutiny at home.  She would attend rallies in Moscow, sometimes in the dead of winter,  under great physical threat. She would be arrested. She faced these  challenges with remarkable composure and grace. Those images of  Lyudmila during a Moscow street protest one New Years' Eve, dressed as  a Russian holiday character, the Snow Maiden, in a powder blue coat as  she stood up to thuggish Russian Government security forces, was a  sight to behold. Her undaunted courage during this later period of her  life was a true inspiration to so many of us around the world.   It is tragic that Lyudmila did not live to see her vision for Russia  realized. It is tragic that the Russian people have been robbed of the  opportunity to live in a democratic country. It is tragic that the  Putin regime continues to impose corruption and repression on a people  who deserve so much better. Lyudmila understood what that ``better''  looks like and had a vision for her country: a governing system with  true checks and balances; a country with a responsive government, held  accountable to the people; a country where a strong civil society  understood that it had a very important role and stake in the country's  well-being. In her own way, Lyudmila symbolized that check and balance.  She symbolized what a vibrant civil society in Russia could be if only  taken to scale. She symbolized a place where Russia lived up to  international human rights commitments, not as an answer to a foreign  power, but because she saw fulfillment of these commitments as good for  the citizenry and the country.   Our world is better because Lyudmila was here. Our world is better  due to her vision, courage, and tenacity. We all have an obligation to  carry on her work, not only in support for human rights in Russia, but  in all those dark corners of the world where people are repressed by  their governments. In the coming days, tributes like this will be heard  around the world, extolling Lyudmila's many efforts and accomplishments  in defense of liberty and human rights.   Lyudmila was a shining example to us all. Let us take this charge and  be the embodiment of her life's work.   Rest in peace, Lyudmila.                            ____________________
