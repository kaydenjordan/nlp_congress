 Madam Speaker, during this Women's History Month, let us  celebrate the women who truly make our Nation and world run.   This month, we honor remarkable women who build families and  communities; who lead governments; who serve and protect their fellow  citizens; and who break new ground in industry, science, technology,  literature, medicine, and so much more.   Their work often goes unrecognized, but their work anchors, guides,  and uplifts our society and the world.   Let me pay special tribute to historic women from the five counties  of Ohio's Ninth District that I am privileged to represent:  Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, the first African-American woman  elected to Congress from Ohio, and poetess Toni Morrison from Lorain  County, Ohio.   In Erie County, it is probably important for us to remember that the  first all-female jury was seated on August 26, 1920. Can you imagine  that? From Erie County, we remember the able and totally dedicated  United Way director, Christine Galvin.   From Lucas County, we remember two public servants, Eleanor Kahle,  who was elected to city council after she went on Social Security, and  Senator Edna Brown, who sadly just passed and was a comet--as was  Shirley Chisholm at the national level--in Ohio as an African-American  woman senator seated in Columbus but from northwest Ohio.   The lives of these women inspire us all, and the legacies they leave  are an inspiration to those who follow in their footsteps.   During this Women's History Month, we give thanks to them for the  barriers that each of them broke and also for their solid  accomplishments that they left behind.   We all look forward with anticipation to the accomplishments of the  next generations of American women to come because, indeed, they lead  the world.                            ____________________
