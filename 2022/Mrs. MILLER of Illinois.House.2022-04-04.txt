 Mr. Speaker, this month, Americans all over  the country are celebrating April as Faith Month. I rise in support of  this effort and call on all people of faith to join in prayer and  celebration.   As a Member of Congress, I am happy to reaffirm my commitment to our  Judeo-Christian values and freedom of religion for all that this  country was founded on.   Religious organizations in America have a rich history of charitable  engagement, helping the sick, poor, and afflicted. They should be  celebrated for their contributions to our way of life.                            ____________________
