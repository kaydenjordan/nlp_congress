 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize Jack  and Diana Berger, who are being inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture  Hall of Fame. Every year since 1992, Wyoming has recognized individuals  who have made substantial contributions to agriculture in our great  State. I am proud to say that Jack and Diana Berger more than meet  these qualifications and are well deserving of this honor.   Natives of Saratoga, WY, Jack and Diana Berger remain committed to  Wyoming's agriculture industry and the Saratoga community. Jack is  currently serving as president of the Wyoming Natural Resource  Foundation, which is dedicated to conserving Wyoming's natural  resources, heritage, and culture. He has been instrumental in providing  the necessary support to fund a variety of water quality initiatives  and rangeland and wildlife habitat improvement projects. Jack is also  the past president of the Carbon County Stock Growers. Diana was  elected to serve on Carbon County School District No. 2 for two terms.  In 2018, she was appointed by then-Wyoming Governor Matt Mead to serve  on the Wyoming State Fair Advisory Board and elected to serve as chair  in 2019. As a member of the Wyoming Stock Growers Environmental  Stewardship Committee, Diana played an intricate role in selecting  members of the Wyoming agricultural community who exhibit outstanding  stewardship ethics. These are just a few of the organizations Jack and  Diana have dedicated their time to.   Perhaps more inspirational than their achievements, however, is the  Bergers' commitment to the Saratoga community. Jack and Diana have a  passion for the agriculture industry and their fellow producers, and  want to see these people succeed right alongside them. They genuinely  enjoy ranching and making a living off of the land. The Bergers also  firmly believe, like myself, that the most effective policy decisions  are made at the State and local level, especially when concerning  critical industries like agriculture. Like most folks in the great  State of Wyoming, the Bergers know that hard work, proper stewardship  of the land, and a commitment to your neighbor go a long way in  ensuring a strong agriculture industry and happy and healthy  communities.   Fortunately for Wyoming, the Bergers also truly understand the  importance of passing their knowledge on to the next generation of  Wyomingites. They continue to share their passion for agriculture with  their children Jace, Aubrey, Kyle, and Kirby. Jack and Diana remain  active in the Carbon County Fair with 4-H and FFA. It is truly  inspiring to see Wyomingites who understand the importance of passing  their knowledge on to those who come next, so they too can have a  positive impact on Wyoming's agriculture industry like Jack and Diana  have.  [[Page S4503]]    The Bergers' values, dedication, and work ethic exemplify the Wyoming  way of life. I want to extend my congratulations to them and thank them  for their service and years of hard work. Jack and Diana Berger truly  live the Cowboy way of life, and I am proud to have the opportunity to  recognize their achievements as inductees into the Wyoming Agriculture  Hall of Fame. Wyoming is well served by their lasting and continuing  contributions to our great State.                            ____________________
