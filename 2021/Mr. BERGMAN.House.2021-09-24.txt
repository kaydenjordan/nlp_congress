 Madam Speaker, I rise today in intensely strong  opposition to efforts to remove longstanding pro-life protections and  potentially even the ban on taxpayer funding for abortions as evidenced  by the bill Democrats want us to pass in a few hours.   With a single move, this legislation would eliminate 40 years of  bipartisan consensus in Washington in State capitals across the country  to protect the health of pregnant women and the unborn.   In addition to allowing elective late-term abortions and hampering  access to proper care at abortion clinics in the case of emergencies,  this bill would preempt any State laws that prevent sex-based or  disability status-based abortion decisions. Medical professionals could  also be forced to conduct abortions, despite moral objections.   Our Nation faces a host of crises, most of which are self-inflicted.  I implore my colleagues to reject this bill and get back to the  people's work.                            ____________________
