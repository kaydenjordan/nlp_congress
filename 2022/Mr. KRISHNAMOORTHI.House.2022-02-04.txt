 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  amendment 260 and in support of the America COMPETES Act.   My amendment 260 contains the bipartisan College Transparency Act,  which creates an extremely secure privacy-protected system to finally  allow students to shop for college and other postsecondary educational  opportunities, like community college and trade and technical schools.   Today, unfortunately, the system is shrouded in darkness. There is no  transparency and people can't shop. When students have access to  transparent data, they can shop and make informed decisions, avoiding  excess debt and realizing their full potential.   My colleague and dear friend, Dr. Foxx, says that this data will be  tracked for adults through a person's lifetime. That is wrong. She also  says that the Biden administration is going to treat this data like the  Chinese Communist Party. That is wrong.   Madam Speaker, the choice is clear. Either choose transparency and  allow parents and families to finally shop for college or keep the  status quo, which nobody likes.   Madam Speaker, this bill is supported by everyone from the American  Federation of Teachers to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and I urge its  support.
