 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the National  Police Week in honor of the men and women who serve and protect our  communities. The individuals called to uphold the rule of law do so in  times of crisis, and they serve their families, friends, and neighbors  at a moment's notice. They are selfless public servants who  courageously face danger head-on.   Law enforcement officers respond to calls for help while not knowing  what challenges they will face. We are in a unique time right now and  experiencing unprecedented challenges in our country. Law enforcement  officers are working to protect citizens while also safeguarding  themselves against the unseen enemy of COVID-19.   The disease has forced departments in Arkansas and all over the  country to change protocols in order to prevent the spread of the  disease, but that hasn't stopped the resolve, the determination, and  the passion of officers to defend the community. Despite this new  challenge, they continue to serve with the same level of  professionalism and integrity.   We are working to provide departments and agencies with additional  resources to safeguard these public safety officers. I am pleased the  Department of Justice recently awarded Arkansas near $7 million so we  can better serve the safety needs of officers in the State and get them  personal protective equipment--gloves, masks, and sanitizer--that they  need in order to perform their job safely. This funding is vital as the  calls for assistance keep coming and police officers continue to  respond to these emergencies.   I want to thank our law enforcement officers for their bravery today  and always. It takes a special person to put their life on the line  every day to protect our communities. We are fortunate to have some of  the very best in Arkansas.   National Police Week is a time that we honor the sacrifices of  individuals who selflessly serve their community and give their lives,  if necessary, while in the line of duty. We preserve their legacies by  adding their names to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in  Washington, DC, to serve as a reminder of their sacrifices.   This year, the names of 307 fallen officers will be added to the  memorial, including five Arkansans. The names of Game Warden Ollie  Mitts, Deputy Sheriff George Rogers, Deputy Sheriff Ulyss Baldwin,  Fayetteville Police Officer Stephen Carr, and Stone County Sergeant  Michael Stephen, Sr. are new to the memorial. We will remember forever  them as heroes.   I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate resolution marking National  Police Week because we must always remember the brave officers whose  lives were cut short because of their public duty and recognize those  who continue to selfishly serve to keep us safe.   I am proud to honor the individuals who are called to serve and  protect and will advocate for policies that provide our communities and  officers with the resources they need to protect themselves.   Thank you to the officers in Arkansas and those all across the  country for upholding the law, protecting the community, and saving  lives.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of  Crossett, AR, Mayor Scott McCormick. Mayor McCormick passed away on  April 16, 2020.   Mayor McCormick spent his life serving his community. He was a proud  member of the Crossett Police Department who joined the force in 1978.  In the two decades that followed, he honorably performed numerous roles  including working as a criminal investigator. He earned the rank of  captain before he left the department in 1998 after 20 years of  protecting the citizens of Crossett.   Mayor McCormick was dedicated to his community and continued working  for the people. Shortly after hanging up his badge, he was elected  mayor of Crossett, and the public went on to place its trust in his  leadership five additional times.   He was certainly beloved. The citizens of Crossett appreciated his  commitment and hands-on approach which he demonstrated by attending  numerous events throughout the years, being available to citizens and  revealing a willingness to listen.   His leadership was also valuable to organizations across the State.  He was a member of the Arkansas Municipal League's Executive Council,  First Class Cities Advisory Council, and the Public Safety Advisory  Council, in addition to other groups.   He inspired the people of Crossett to work together in support of the  community and encouraged respect for all citizens.   I am grateful for Mayor McCormick's decades of public service and for  the way he devoted his life to his faith, family, and community. I pray  God will bless the McCormick family and the people of Crossett as they  cope with this loss and celebrate the life of Mayor Scott  McCormick.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Hot Springs Village, AR.   On April 20, 1970, developer John Cooper founded Hot Springs Village  as a premier retirement destination. In the decades since residents  first moved in, it has grown into one of the largest private gated  communities in the country.   To recognize this milestone, the community organized a year-long  celebration spearheaded by the 50th Anniversary Planning Committee.  Committee  [[Page S2342]]  members began laying the groundwork for the activities months ago,  engaging with the chamber of commerce as well as local businesses,  churches, and civic clubs to make this a year to remember.   The enthusiasm from community members is demonstrated by the special  logo created to commemorate this occasion that features the phrase  ``Proud Past and Strong Future.''   Hot Springs Village continues to welcome new residents including  young professionals. Numerous outdoor opportunities which include  nature trails, tennis courts and golf courses provide avenues to  maintain a healthy lifestyle, build camaraderie among folks who enjoy  the same activities and the opportunity to learn new skills.   The men and women who call Hot Springs Village home have a lot to be  grateful for. They have helped shape the city and made it an attractive  destination for events and for future residents.   Congratulations to the 50th Anniversary Planning Committee members  for their hard work and preparation. I am excited for the community as  it comes together to recognize and commemorate this historic milestone  and wish all the very best as celebrations take place throughout the  year.                            ____________________
