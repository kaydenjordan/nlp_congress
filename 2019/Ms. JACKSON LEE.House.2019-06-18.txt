 Mr. Speaker, I rise to enthusiastically support H.R.  3253 and to particularly congratulate, for their leadership,  Congresswoman Dingell and Congressman Guthrie and indicate that the  underlying reason for my enthusiastic support is what I believe every  Member knows, and that is the frail among us are the most vulnerable.  Those individuals may be our seniors, as I am dealing with a person who  is seeking to get outpatient rehabilitation, and they need extra  support in getting that care.   In this instance, the extension of 4\1/2\ years to be able to have  the protection of the legislation that deals with abuse in Medicaid  home and community-based services is vital because the person receiving  the services is least able to speak about the abuse.                                time  1500    I believe the extension will help in determining the level of abuse  and also remedies for such abuse.   It is clear that if someone is in Medicaid home-based programs, they  are as equally in need as those who are in institutionalized programs.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Congresswoman. I would say that in  impoverished communities and communities of color, the Medicaid-based  program is the basis of their healthcare, and they are the most  vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3253, the Empowering Beneficiaries,  Ensuring Access, and Strengthening Accountability Act of 2019, for its  very vital and important element of extending this review for 4.5  years.   We have to get it right. We have to protect these people. We have to  give them the quality of life that they deserve. ``Abuse'' should not  be in their vocabulary.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation.    Madam Chair, let me thank the chair of the Defense  Subcommittee and ranking member of the subcommittee as well.   I am delighted that my amendment No. 12 has been made in order and  that we will have an opportunity to save and improve the lives of many  women around the world.   My amendment provides flexibility for the Secretary of Defense to  allocate resources needed to provide technical assistance by U.S.  military women to military women in other countries combating violence  as a weapon of war, terrorism, human trafficking, and narcotics  trafficking to ameliorate their impact on women and girls around the  globe.   Madam Chair, the most vulnerable people in vulnerable nation-states  are women and girls and women and children. That is both in terms of  sexual violence and domestic violence, and also in terms of the denial  of access to education.   As the co-chair of the Congressional Afghanistan Caucus, I am  reminded of the aftermath of the Afghan war. As we began to write the  constitution, we thought we had made progress. But the Taliban, after a  period of time, began to burn the schools that were designated for  girls only.   This amendment allows women in the military of these respective  countries that are prone to hostilities, violence, and disparate  treatment of women and girls to be able to work with our women in the  United States military and be able to be trained on the issues of  fighting terrorism, human trafficking, and narcotics trafficking.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture, and human trafficking by  terrorist and militant groups have been employed as a weapon of war  affecting over 20,000 women and girls, and those numbers are going up.   My amendment will curb terrorism abroad by making available American  technical and military expertise to militaries in other countries, like  Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists. Boko Haram, of course,  was at the center of taking the Chibok girls, and it is important to be  able to utilize these activities.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record ``U.S. Special Operations  Command's HEROs Combat Human Trafficking'' and ``The Role of the  Military in Combating Human Trafficking: A South African Perspective.''                       [From DoD News, Jan. 4, 2018]      U.S. Special Operations Command's Heros Combat Human Trafficking                            (By Shannon Collins)         Washington.--January is National Slavery and Human       Trafficking Prevention Month, and the Defense Department has       teams who work year-round to combat these crimes worldwide.        The Human Exploitation Rescue Operative, or HERO, Child-      Rescue Corps is a program developed by U.S. Special       Operations Command, Warrior Care Program-Career Transition,       the National Association to Protect Children and U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Army Col. Kimberly       Moros, chief of SOCOM's career transition initiatives.        ``The HERO Child-Rescue Corps Program is designed for       wounded, injured and ill transitioning service members and       veterans who receive training in high-tech computer forensics       and law enforcement skills to assist federal agents in the       fight against online child sexual exploitation,'' she said.       ``Upon successful completion of the program, HERO interns       will have the knowledge, skills and experience to apply for       careers with federal, state and local police agencies and       other organizations in the field of computer forensics.''  [[Page H4712]]         Since 2013, more than 130 veterans and transitioning       service members have entered the HERO program. Of the       successful graduates, 74 have been offered careers in federal       law enforcement and another 31 are in internships, Moros       said.        ``HEROs and HERO interns now make up over 25 percent of the       Homeland Security computer forensics workforce,'' said Robert       Kurtz, unit chief for HERO at Homeland Security       Investigations.                              Human Trafficking         ``Human trafficking includes using force, fraud or coercion       to compel a person to provide labor, services or sex. It's a       violation of basic human rights,'' said Linda Dixon, DOD       Combating Trafficking in Persons Office Program Manager.       ``Combating trafficking in persons is a duty that DOD takes       seriously as we do in other situations that bring harm to our       nation. It is a global concern, and our goal is to educate       every member of DOD on how to recognize and report human       trafficking in the U.S. as well as around the world.''        The three most common forms of trafficking, according to       DOD's Combating Trafficking in Persons office, are forced       labor, sex trafficking, and child soldiering.        Moros said the idea behind the HERO Corps is a simple one.        ``When it comes to hunting those who prey on the innocent,       who better than our nation's most highly trained military       veterans?'' she said. ``Much of today's human trafficking and       child sexual exploitation is technology facilitated.       Offenders utilize the internet and digital technologies to       coordinate their activity, advertise, share information and       hide evidence. HEROs receive training in counter-child       exploitation as well as digital forensics and victim       identification. And they are then embedded with federal law       enforcement.''        She said the HERO Child-Rescue Corps saves children in       several ways. ``As law enforcement first responders, they are       at every crime scene, searching for critical clues that might       provide evidence for an arrest or to find a victim,'' Moros       said.        Back at the forensic lab, the HERO is the lead digital       investigator, searching out clues that can lead to organized       criminal rings, evidence of sexual assault or production of       child abuse imagery, she said.        ``In many cases, it has been the relentless focus and       military mindset that has allowed HEROs to go beyond the       digging that might be done in traditional law enforcement to       find a victim,'' she added.        Kurtz said federal law enforcement is just beginning to       track rescues. In 2016, Homeland Security Investigations       identified and rescued 820 known child victims from sexual       exploitation.        ``But the real number is undoubtedly many times greater,''       Moros said. ``As a major segment of the digital forensic       workforce, and one especially dedicated to combating child       sexual exploitation and trafficking, they [HEROs] have been       instrumental in working hundreds of those cases.''                                      ____                                         The Role of the Military in Combating Human Trafficking: A South                            African Perspective               (By Nina Mollema, University of South Africa)                                   Abstract         Human trafficking is a complex and diverse crime affecting       both individuals and countries across the world. As a       significant facet of transnational organised crime and one of       the most lucrative criminal enterprises globally, human       trafficking was ranked as the second most profitable crime       around the world in 2015, making it the fastest-growing       source of revenue for organised criminal operations       internationally. In 2015, South Africa implemented       comprehensive antitrafficking legislation. Before such       legislation was enacted, the South African government also       ratified several international and regional human rights       instruments in terms of which specific duties are imposed       upon the state to combat and punish the crime effectively,       including the protection of the rights of victims. The focus       of the study on which this article reports, is the desired       role of the military in combating human trafficking in South       Africa. In 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation       (NATO) adopted a policy on combating trafficking in human       beings. The policy sets out various strategies for ensuring       regional cooperation in combating human trafficking. It is       suggested that the South African National Defence Force       (SANDF) take the initiative in formulating a similar policy       in order to effect better co-operation amongst nation states       in Africa, especially in the southern region of Africa, to       combat human trafficking. In order to address the role of the       SANDF in the fight against human trafficking meaningfully and       to develop evidence-based strategies and policies, regional       coordination in combating trafficking is paramount. The       article examines current legislation, instruments and       strategies as regards human trafficking in order to make       recommendations for counter-trafficking policy standards and       best practices for the SANDF.                                 Introduction         Although not a novel phenomenon, the crime of human       trafficking is complex, diverse, and constantly evolving as       traffickers develop new tactics to trade in human beings.       Human trafficking affects not only individuals, but also       countries across the world. It has been estimated by various       international organisations that millions of victims are       trapped in trafficking. Although both international entities       and domestic jurisdictions have proposed various strategies       to combat the rapidly growing problem of human trafficking,       the combating of this criminal activity remains a challenge       for all branches of law enforcement, including the military.       The primary international instrument, the United Nations (UN)       Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in       Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the       United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised       Crime of 2000 (Trafficking Protocol) is already 17 years old;       yet, regional and national efforts to combat trafficking have       produced minimal positive results. South Africa is no       exception in this regard. Since the end of apartheid, the       jurisdiction has been experiencing an increase of illegal       immigrants from all over Africa, as well as other foreign       countries. It has further been acknowledged that since 1994,       the trafficking of men, women, and children into various       exploitative sectors, such as labour trafficking and       involuntary sex work, amongst others, have also escalated in       South Africa.        This multi-dimensional illicit modern-day slavery industry       must be fought at national, regional and international level       with an integrated, multi-sectoral approach. In this respect,       the SANDF also has a role to play, and can learn a great deal       from NATO, amongst others, for guidelines and best practices.       The Policy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings of 2004       of this intergovernmental military alliance recognises that       human trafficking feeds on corruption and organised crime,       and has ``the potential to destabilise fragile governments''.       As no such policy currently exists in the SANDF, it is       proposed that the Defence Force evaluate and develop       policies, strategies and force design through the       implementation of specific evidence-based codes of conduct or       strategic plans to combat this offence.        Apart from the violation of the fundamental human rights of       persons being trafficked, trafficking is a substantial source       of revenue for criminal organisations whose activities may       destabilise legitimate governments and undermine the mission       of the military. The crime may become a security issue and       undercut military operations. However, as known from previous       experiences, military troops themselves can create or       increase the demand for trafficked women.        This article is structured as follows: it is first       necessary to explain which conduct falls under human       trafficking in South African and international law. Second,       the measures government have taken to combat this crime in       South Africa are considered. Next, the role of the military       in South Africa in combating human trafficking is considered       and compared with international and regional efforts.       Recommendations are then finally made for steps to be taken       by the military to play a more significant role in combating       human trafficking.               Background to human trafficking in South Africa         Although people have heard of human trafficking, very few       people really know what it entails and the role it plays in       international organised crime. As a significant facet of       transnational organised crime and one of the most lucrative       criminal enterprises globally, human trafficking was ranked       as the second most profitable crime around the world in 2015,       making it the fastest-growing source of revenue for organised       criminal operations internationally.        In order to combat the trade in human cargo, legal       jurisdictions have adopted a range of international standards       and obligations, of which the UN's Trafficking Protocol is       the most significant. Following the prototype of the       Trafficking Protocol, governments around the world have also       committed themselves to enact national human trafficking       legislation to address modern-day slavery. In Africa, where       the scourge of trafficking is widespread, South Africa is one       of the few nations that actively pursue the punishment of       human trafficking. This is vital as South Africa with its       viable and developing economy has become a magnet for illegal       migrants and human traffickers, attracting people from the       whole continent fleeing from political and economic upheaval,       armed conflict.'' the HIV/AIDS pandemic, food insecurity and       unemployment. The resultant poverty in especially South  Africa's regional neighbours, still grappling with the aftereffects of  colonisation and failed statehood, has furthermore caused an exodus to  South Africa for better life opportunities. Traffickers are said to  service the demand of the very lucrative human smuggling industry,  especially in conflict and postconflict areas. In many illegal  migration cases, displaced people make desperate decisions by relying  on initially `benevolent' smugglers who transform into ruthless  traffickers, keeping the illegal migrants captive as human slaves.  Trafficking in the jurisdiction is additionally complex and diverse as  it consists of culturally unique trafficking types such as ukuthwala.  The country has been listed as a human trafficking source, transit, and  destination country for men, women  [[Page H4713]]  and children to, from and within South Africa for mainly labour and sex  trafficking.         South Africa has the highest number of asylum seekers in       the world. Although South Africa supports large numbers of       refugees and asylum seekers, the jurisdiction is also home to       an estimated five million illegal immigrants, including some       three million Zimbabweans. In response to the dynamics of       supply and demand, migration (which has always been endemic       in Africa) to South Africa is aided by the porous nature of       the country's borders and coast lines, as well as ineffective       monitoring of land, rail and sea transportation modes.       Trafficked people are indistinguishable amongst these flows.        In order to tackle the multi-dimensional crime of human       trafficking in the country, South Africa became a signatory       to the Trafficking Protocol in 2000, and ratified the       instrument in 2004. As a result, the jurisdiction became       subject to international obligations in terms of which       specific duties were imposed upon the state to combat and       punish the crime effectively and to protect the rights of       victims. The need to enact domestic anti-trafficking       legislation was prioritised, and on 29 July 2013, the       Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of       2013 (Trafficking Act) was signed into law but only became       operational on 9 August 2015. The Act introduces a       universally acceptable but still country-specific definition       of human trafficking:        `Trafficking' includes the delivery, recruitment,       procurement, capture, removal, transportation, transfer,       harbouring, sale, exchange, lease, disposal or receiving of a       person, or the adoption of a child facilitated or secured       through legal or illegal means, within or across the borders       of the Republic, of a person trafficked or an immediate       family member of the person trafficked, by means of:        (a) a threat of harm;        (b) the threat or use of force, intimidation or other forms       of coercion;        (c) the abuse of vulnerability;        (d) fraud;        (e) deception or false pretences;        (f) debt bondage;        (g) abduction;        (h) kidnapping;        (i) the abuse of power;        (j) the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to       obtain the consent of a person having control or authority       over another person; or        (k) the giving or receiving of payments, compensation,       rewards, benefits or any other advantage,        for the purpose of any form or manner of exploitation,       sexual grooming or abuse of such person, including the       commission of any sexual offence or any offence of a sexual       nature in any other law against such person or performing any       sexual act with such person, whether committed in or outside       the borders of the Republic.        In essence, this definition holds that persons are       trafficked if they have been moved within a country or to       another country, as a result of force, fraud or manipulation       and are exploited or compelled to work under threat of       violence for no pay, beyond subsistence. The definition is       very broad, and except for the requirement that a person be       removed, transported, or transferred from one place to       another, other acts such as the mere harbouring of a person       through a threat of intimidation with the intent to exploit       the person are sufficient for the crime to be committed. With       regard to the role of the military, the moving of a person       from one country to another, or within the country, through       deceptive or violent means for any type of exploitative       purpose is of particular significance. The exploitative       purposes may include forced labour, involuntary sex work,       begging, stealing, drug running, forced marriage and the sale       of body parts, amongst others.        Amongst other requirements, the Trafficking Protocol       obliges member states to criminalise trafficking, and to       investigate and prosecute traffickers. The Trafficking       Protocol also instructs that states must adopt or strengthen       legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that       fosters all forms of exploitation of persons that lead to       trafficking. States are to determine which measures to take       in accordance with the domestic legislation and policies of       each state as well as in accordance with the financial and       human resource capabilities of the state.        Another important condition that the Protocol stipulates       for signatory states is to undertake border control measures.       Border management is one of the roles the SANDF is expected       to play in South Africa, along with other secondary functions       such as peacekeeping and humanitarian support. However, very       few joint efforts have been made with neighbouring countries       to deal multilaterally with border issues and crimes such as       human trafficking and human smuggling. Co-operation between       South Africa and its neighbours in this regard is usually not       of a preventative nature, but only takes place after the       occurrence of smuggling or trafficking has been discovered.    Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of Chairman Visclosky's En Bloc  Amendment, which includes Jackson Lee #12.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman Visclosky and Ranking Member Calvert for their  hard work in bringing Division C, the Defense portion of this omnibus  appropriations legislative package, to the floor and for their devotion  to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep  our nation safe and their work in ensuring that they have resources  needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest fighting force for peace  on earth.   Madam Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the  national goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on  earth.   The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment #12, which is identical to the  amendment adopted twice in the last Congress, is to provide the  Secretary of Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to  provide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women  in other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism,  human trafficking, narcotics trafficking.   Madam Chair, the United States is committed to combating violent  extremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of  terrorism.   The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and  technological capability that will aid not only in combating and  defeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent  persons, especially women, girls, and the elderly.   But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary  technical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very  quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or  norms of morality and decency.   Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant  terrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai  Peninsula which poses a threat to Egypt.   Jackson Lee Amendment #12 help provide the Department of Defense with  the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries on  innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources  that promote the security of the American people and allied nation  states.   Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact  on women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on  us all.   According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by  terrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war,  affecting over twenty thousand women and girls.   Looking at the history of terrorism highlights the importance of  providing technical assistance through our military might, as this  enables us to combat terrorism which now can plague us here in the  United States.   Jackson Lee Amendment #12 will help curb terrorism abroad by making  available American technical military expertise to military in other  countries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their  country and to keep those terrorists out of our country.   Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of  terrorists.   These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care  providers, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the  diplomatic corps and the Armed Services.   This is why the technical assistance offered by our military  personnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local  forces to combat terrorism.   Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and  cannot not be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to  our national security and the security of the world.   Madam Chair, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and  the Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of  highest national priorities.   Collectively, helping our neighbors and their military build capacity  to combat terrorism, eradicate human trafficking, stop narcotics  trafficking and negate their impact on women and girls across the globe  serves our national interest.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support Jackson Lee  Amendment #12 by voting for the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment to  Division C of RCP 116-17.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the underlying amendment.
