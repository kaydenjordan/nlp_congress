 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of  our community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who was recently honored  as a Red Cross hero.   Last New Year's Eve, Vincent Gonzalez of Levittown sprang into action  following a serious accident in which an impaired driver crashed his  vehicle into the home of his neighbors Jim and Mary Albright.   Vincent provided immediate assistance to Jim, who was seriously  injured and was bleeding heavily from a sustained head wound.   For the rest of that night, Vincent comforted Mary, who had to face  the devastating reality of an injured husband, a damaged home, and the  death of the family's beloved yellow lab because of this horrific  incident.   Today, Jim, who is fully recovered, refers to Vincent as his and  Mary's ``guardian angel.'' I would like to honor Vincent for his quick  thinking and selfless actions. I encourage all of my constituents to  follow his lead and to look out for each other in times of crisis.                          Recognizing Logan Killeen     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize a heroic young  man who is already teaching our community in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, the values of respect and compassion.   Logan Killeen of Fairless Hills was born with Treacher Collins  syndrome, a rare disorder which affects facial bones and structure.  Recently, Logan has undergone several surgeries to alleviate his  condition, and he often wears a headband to assist with his hearing.   In the fall, Logan will be starting kindergarten at Oxford Valley  Elementary School. That school recently held an assembly in his honor  to teach fellow students that, even though Logan may look different  than they do, he is just like them.   I commend Logan for his bravery, and I also commend Oxford Valley  Elementary School as well. I want to commend both for their willingness  to spread kindness to their peers and to our community.   I would also like to recognize Logan's parents, Matt and Nicole  Killeen, for raising such a fine young man and for all that they do for  individuals facing this challenge.                            ____________________
