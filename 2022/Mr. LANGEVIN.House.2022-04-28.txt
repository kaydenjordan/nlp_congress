 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 107th  anniversary of the Armenian genocide.   On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a genocidal  campaign to wipe out more than 1.5 million innocent Armenians. For too  long, the world denied the Armenians' plight. But thankfully, leaders  like President Biden and this House of Representative have recognized  the Armenian genocide for the tragedy that we all know to be true.   My home State of Rhode Island boasts one of the largest Armenian  communities in the country, and I have been proud to represent them for  the last 22 years.   Yet, as Winston Churchill famously said, ``Those who fail to learn  from history are condemned to repeat it.''   Mr. Speaker, another genocide is unfolding before our eyes in  Ukraine. The scenes from Bucha, Mariupol, and the villages across the  country are heartbreaking and haunting. But like the Armenian people,  Ukrainians are strong, and they have shown their unmatched bravery to  the world.   I strongly reiterate my harsh condemnation of Vladimir Putin's war  crimes. We must do all that we can to support the Ukrainian people in  their battle for freedom. The consequences of failure are far too  dreadful to imagine.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Ukraine Democracy  Defense Lend-Lease Act.   In the spring of 1941, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act, which  allowed the United States to rapidly deliver weapons and military  supplies to Allies like Great Britain, assisting their heroic fight  against Adolph Hitler. Once dead set on creating a global empire, he  failed.   In the spring of 2022, another murderous dictator has emerged,  committed to destroying a sovereign democracy and reconstituting old  borders of the USSR. We must ensure that Putin also fails.  [[Page H4588]]    Since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Biden  administration has made impressive progress in the delivery of crucial  security assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. And yet, it is  time to cut through the remaining bureaucratic red tape and accelerate  the delivery of critical equipment to the brave warfighters on the  ground in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, they deserve nothing less than our swift and unwavering  support. Freedom and democracy are at stake.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and pass the  Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. We must stand with the  Ukrainian people in their fight for their democracy, for their freedom,  and for their homeland.
