 Madam President, Idaho small businesses have shown  immense resilience in the face of labor shortages, supply chain  disruptions, and rising costs. These small businesses deserve to be  celebrated for their great work in preserving the values unique to our  communities. I am proud to relaunch Support Local Gems, a statewide  initiative, on May 6, to encourage Idahoans to support the small  businesses that make the Gem State special. As a member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Poppy and Pout located in Idaho  Falls as one of Idaho's Small Businesses of the Month for May 2022.   In 2014, Derek Cooper founded Poppy and Pout and began to sell his  unique, untinted lip balm out of his kitchen while studying at Brigham  Young University-Idaho. Aware of the growing environmentally conscious  market, Derek created a 100-percent recyclable cardboard tube and  packaging for his product. Since then, Poppy and Pout's business has  taken off and garnered national recognition, including Oprah Winfrey  adding the company to her most recent ``Favorite Things List.''   To keep up with their growing local and national following, Derek  opened a brick-and-mortar store and production facility in downtown  Idaho Falls in July 2021. The boutique features a variety of his  signature, hand-made lip balm, as well as clothing, gifts, and other  beauty products. Today, Poppy and Pout's 40 employees supply their all- natural lip balm to boutiques, salons, and stores worldwide, giving  everyone a little taste of Idaho.   Congratulations to Derek Cooper and all of the employees at Poppy and  Pout for being selected as an Idaho Small Business of the Month for May  2022. You are an outstanding example of what it means to be one of  Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State proud, and I look forward  to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Madam President, Idaho small businesses have shown  immense resilience in the face of labor shortages, supply chain  disruptions, and rising costs.

As a member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Twin Falls Sandwich Company and  Koto Brewing Company located in Twin Falls as one of Idaho's Small  Businesses of the Month for May 2022.   Fifteen years ago, Twin Falls Sandwich Company owner Shane Cook  visited the Magic Valley and fell deeply in love with the community. He  believed the downtown area had the potential to be a lively gathering  place for the people of Twin Falls. Shane took his restaurant expertise  and vision to restore a Main Avenue building to its original rustic red  brick and customized a menu almost entirely sourced from local farmers  and producers. Thanks to their 10 years of business, the Sandwich  Company has become a mainstay for many in the Magic Valley.   Take a short stroll down Main Avenue, and you will find another  passion of Shane's at Koto Brewing Company. Named after Tojiro ``Tom''  Koto, a Japanese immigrant who built the building in 1920, Koto Brewing  Co. has been serving gourmet pub food, a full dinner menu, and an  eclectic beer list since 2018. Shane and his business partner, Twin  Falls native and brewmaster Pierre Tusow, spent a year and a half  exposing the building's original brick and wood flooring and adding  tabletops made from Twin Falls High School's old gym floor. Shane and  Pierre also pride themselves on donating $10 from every barrel of beer  brewed to local charities. The local touches along with live music from  local artists and a good laugh from comedians from all over the country  make Koto Brewing Co. the gathering place Shane envisioned 15 years  ago.   Congratulations to Shane Cook and all of the employees at Twin Falls  Sandwich Company and Koto Brewing Company for being selected as an  Idaho Small Business of the Month for May 2022. You are an outstanding  example of what it means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our  great State  [[Page S2272]]  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
