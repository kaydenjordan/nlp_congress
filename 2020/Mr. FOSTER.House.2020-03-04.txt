 Mr. Speaker, I am a scientist, and if a scientist stands  up and says something that they know is not true, it is a career-ending  action. The reason for this is that science always operates at the edge  of what is known, so we cannot tolerate liars.   The world is now facing scientific uncertainty in the spread and the  severity of the coronavirus. And when the leadership of China  confronted the reality of the pandemic, they chose to suppress  scientific truth and lie to their people. That cost China and the world  the opportunity to slow down and perhaps contain this outbreak.   In the U.S., we were recently exposed to the spectacle of our  country's leader making self-serving pronouncements about the  coronavirus outbreak that had no basis in scientific fact and that were  immediately contradicted by his scientific experts.   As our Nation faces the serious threat of coronavirus, the American  people deserve to know that they can trust the information coming from  their government, and that the public officials that they elected are  putting science ahead of politics or deranged conspiracy theories.   Unfortunately, after 3 years of consistently undermining scientific  research and scientific fact, this administration is dangerously  deficient in credibility, and that is directly putting the health and  well-being of millions of Americans at risk with an opaque and chaotic  response to this outbreak.   Just a few weeks ago, the Trump administration presented a budget  that would slash almost $700 million from the Centers for Disease  Control, cutting a vital resource that is at the front lines of this  public health emergency.   This administration has left critical positions vacant at Homeland  Security and the National Security Council, including positions  responsible for managing pandemics.   Americans need their elected leaders to spend less time tweeting and  more time making sure that government resources are coordinated and  fully funded and ready to combat this outbreak.   Soon, the House will move forward to provide emergency funding that  matches the scale and the threat of the coronavirus. We must make sure  that the President and the administration uses these funds for what  they are intended, a comprehensive and aggressive response to managing  the coronavirus outbreak and making sure that any future vaccines or  treatments are affordable and available to all who need them.   We also must hold the President and his administration accountable  for the information they share with the American people. Three years of  keeping science and facts at arm's length have rightly made people  suspicious of what comes out of the White House. And now, as Americans  worry for the health of themselves and their loved ones, they  unfortunately must also worry about whether the information coming from  the people that they expect to manage this crisis will be distorted for  the President's political purposes.   When a leader lies to the public about important scientific facts, it  is not acceptable. It is not cute. It is not just Trump being Trump. It  is a dangerous act that puts our public health and our democracy at  risk.                            ____________________
