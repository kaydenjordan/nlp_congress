 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I commend the Judiciary  Committee for its tremendous work in bringing this bill to the floor.  They have put forth tremendous effort and tried every way they could  think of to compromise.   But notwithstanding the effort, I find myself not in a position to  vote in favor of the bill. One of the reasons is that many of the  organizations and groups with whom I have worked over the years are in  opposition. They are people who are on the ground floor of criminal  justice reform. They recognize that, if we are going to provide an  opportunity to seriously reduce mass incarceration, we have to make  provisions for individuals to regain some sense of reality regarding  what got them into prison in the first place.   I appreciate all of the efforts. I think we have got too much  authority being given to the Attorney General. I wish we had been able  to get closer to what people I work with daily would be in agreement  with. Unfortunately, we did not.   Unfortunately, I do not support passage of the bill, but I support  continuing to work to find the real, hard-nosed solutions that we need.
