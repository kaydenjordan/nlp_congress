 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, a really sad milestone of,  really, failure on day 18 of a partial government shutdown that is  affecting 25 percent of the Federal Government.   I am rising today to share some of the real-life stories of some of  my constituents in eastern Connecticut who are affected by this  shutdown, which, again, today, we are now officially 1 day past the  length of the 2013 shutdown of 17 days. On Sunday, if this is not fixed  and ended, it will actually be the longest shutdown in American  history, surpassing the 1994 shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, today, I got a letter from James of Waterford,  Connecticut:         I am a State Department employee assigned to the U.S.       Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. I have been a DOS employee       since 2003.        I live and work every day in a dangerous environment in       support of U.S. foreign policy. In Herat, Afghanistan, in       2013, I was shot at and blown up in an attack by the Taliban       on the U.S. Consulate. In Belgrade, Serbia, in 2008, I was       trapped in the burning U.S. Embassy during protests       against Kosovo independence while I protected and       destroyed classified information.        I support our government's policies in difficult       environments, and I expect my government to meet their       commitment to me and my family.    Jeremy of Colchester, Connecticut, who works for the Coast Guard:         Please work to pass a bill to fund the government,       including employees' salaries of the Coast Guard, which are,       again, part of the Department of Homeland Security. My  [[Page H232]]       family cannot go indefinitely without pay, nor should they       have to.    And he is absolutely right.   Kate of Chester, Connecticut:         I am a U.S. Department of Agriculture employee. I have been       an employee of the USDA for 15 years at the Plum Island       Animal Disease Center.    That is off the coast of Long Island Sound, where they do amazing  research in terms of animal health and public health.         If there is not a resolution and end to this shutdown soon,       my financial situation will force me to choose which bills to       pay.    Robert of Stafford Springs, Connecticut, who actually works for a  regional craft brewery:         I depend on the ATF, the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, to       approve license applications, formulas and labels for beers--      delicious beers, by the way--that we brew and sell. Every day       that this passes without a shutdown ending is another       potential day of lost sales.    Ethan of Niantic, Connecticut, who works at the Coast Guard Academy,  where they are building the leaders of tomorrow for this country. He  has been part of the faculty for the last 11 years.         Personally, without earning a paycheck, we will find paying       for groceries, mortgage, utilities, childcare, and other       essentials, nearly impossible. As the government shutdown       lingers on, I become increasingly concerned how it will       impact my family.    Brian Krampovitas, I met with him this morning in my office. He is  one of the air traffic controllers at Bradley Field in Hartford,  Connecticut. They have 40 employees who are working without pay, 10- hour shifts, making sure that the planes take off and land safely. And  again, the stress level, because they have no support staff, is growing  more and more intense for people who are doing incredibly important  work, guaranteeing the safety of this country.   Again, just as a way of a recap, last week the new Congress was sworn  in. Within 2 hours, we passed H.R. 21, which fully funded the American  Government, which would have ended this shutdown last week, again, not  with a wild spending bill but one that had already passed in the U.S.  Senate with Republican votes.   All Mitch McConnell has to do is bring up that bill, which they have  already passed, send it to the President, and with the stroke of a pen,  this would end today; and these people who, again, are doing the  important work of the American people would not have to be going  through the stress and aggravation while they are doing great work to  protect our public safety, to represent our country overseas, and to  make sure that we have leaders of the future through institutions like  the Coast Guard Academy.   Again, we are going to hear a speech tonight. This thing apparently  is going to continue to go on. It is unnecessary, it is pointless, and  it is hurting the American economy and the American people.   Mr. President, sign H.R. 21.   We can have a debate about border security. There are some things  that both sides will agree on in terms of making sure that we get more  immigration judges to eliminate the asylum case backlog, to boost  enforcement of port of entry where fentanyl and dangerous drugs are  coming through; and we can have a serious debate about whether or not  it is sensors and drones, boots on the ground to make sure that those  areas that are more remote get more protection, but lengthening this  shutdown and hurting people who have absolutely nothing to do with the  southern border is pointless and hurting people and hurting the U.S.  economy.                            ____________________
