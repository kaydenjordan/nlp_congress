 Mr. Speaker, for years, the Department of Veterans  Affairs has seen many of its medical personnel leave to pursue  opportunities outside of the VA healthcare system, resulting in fewer  healthcare providers and, ultimately, less access to care for our  veterans. In the First District of Michigan, which I represent, we are  largely a rural district, and our district and our veterans have  suffered more than most on this.   The GOOD Act utilizes a two-pronged approach to address VA's  continuing struggles in recruiting and retaining their physician  assistant workforce. This bill creates a pilot program to provide that  pathway for veterans to receive the education necessary to become a PA  while, simultaneously, requiring the VA to establish a national  strategic plan to recruit and retain a robust and long-term medical  staff.   Our veterans have given so much for our country at exceptional costs,  and they deserve access to timely and high-quality healthcare from  skilled professionals. I am proud to join Ranking Member Kuster from  our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in supporting this  bipartisan legislation on behalf of our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, H.R.  3262.
