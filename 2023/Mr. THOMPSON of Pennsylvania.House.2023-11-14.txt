 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Martene Firestine and her outstanding work with the Pennsylvania  Livestock Association.   For more than 18 years, Martene has worked tirelessly to raise money  to support youth education scholarships. Her efforts have led to the  awarding of 106 scholarships totaling more than $111,000.   These scholarships are given to young individuals who have  outstanding leadership skills and a keen interest in the livestock  industry and who are involved in the Keystone International Livestock  Expo, known as the KILE farm show, among other traits.   Students who receive the scholarships use the funds to further their  education in any degree or field.   Mr. Speaker, Martene's efforts to support the next generation of  leaders are impressive. She remains dedicated to helping others, and it  is an honor to recognize her important work.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Martene on this much-deserved  recognition. The Pennsylvania Livestock Association is blessed to have  such a dedicated member.                            ____________________
