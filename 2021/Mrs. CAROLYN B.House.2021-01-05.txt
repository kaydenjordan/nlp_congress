MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I thank Representatives Connolly and Comer for working on this  important bipartisan issue.   A version of this bill passed the House in the last Congress, and it  has been improved after receiving technical assistance from the General  Services Administration. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management  Program Authorization Act would codify and improve the existing FedRAMP  in the General Services Administration.   First established in 2011, FedRAMP is an important program that  certifies cloud service providers who wish to offer services and  products to the Federal Government.   The FedRAMP certification process outlined in this bill is  comprehensive,  [[Page H61]]  facilitates easier agency adoption, promotes agency reuse, and  encourages savings. The FedRAMP process uses a risk-based approach to  ensure the reliability of any cloud platform that hosts unclassified  government data.   A significant provision of this bill is the Federal Secure Cloud  Advisory Committee. This committee would be tasked with key  responsibilities, including providing technical expertise on cloud  products and services and identifying ways to reduce costs associated  with FedRAMP certification.   The Director of the Office of Management and Budget would be required  to issue regulations pertaining to FedRAMP and would ensure that  agencies are not using cloud service providers without authorizations.  This bill supports a critical effort to keep our Nation's information  secure in cloud environments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, to require the budget  justifications and appropriation requests of agencies be made publicly  available.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the Congressional Budget  Justification Transparency Act, is a commonsense, good-government  measure every Member should support.   It would require the congressional budget justification documents  that agencies prepare for congressional committees to be posted online  in a centralized, searchable database. This would make these detailed,  plain-language explanations of how agencies plan to spend taxpayer  dollars more accessible to the public.   I thank Representative   Mike Quigley for his work on this bill. He  has a long  [[Page H63]]  history as a strong advocate of transparency in the operations of the  Federal Government.   This bill builds on the work of the committee to improve government  transparency by allowing the public to more easily learn how Federal  agencies spend their taxpayer dollars.

PRESIDENTIAL EXPLANATION OF FAILURE TO NOMINATE AN                     INSPECTOR GENERAL.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Inspector General Protection Act was introduced by  Representatives Ted Lieu and Jody Hice. An identical measure passed the  House in the last Congress.   I am proud to support this bipartisan measure, which would improve  the independence of inspectors general. The bill would also address the  disturbingly slow nomination of IGs that has been the norm across  multiple administrations.   The bill would require notification of Congress 30 days prior to an  IG being placed on leave. Such notification is already required prior  to an IG being removed from duty.   The bill also would require the President to report to Congress if he  has not nominated an IG after 210 days of a vacancy occurring. This  report must include the reasons for failing to make the nomination and  a target date for doing so. The requirement will hopefully prod the  executive branch to nominate IGs in a more timely manner.   IGs provide critical oversight and accountability within Federal  agencies, and the positions need to be filled more quickly than is  currently the case.   I urge Members to support this bipartisan bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  [[Page H69]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Comer and Khanna for their work  on this bipartisan bill, and I thank Senators Portman and Peters for  their work on last year's Senate companion.   This measure would correct a provision of the Consolidated  Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2021 that was incorrectly inserted  into the law.   The language of this bill had been carefully crafted by the House  Oversight and Reform Committee and the Senate Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs over many months prior to the  agreement to include it in last year's Consolidated Appropriations Act.  The bill you see before you today honors that agreement and resolves  the drafting error.   The bill would prohibit the use of reverse auctions for the  procurement of complex, specialized, or substantial design and  construction services procured by the Federal Government.   Such services would include site planning, architectural and  engineering services, interior design, construction or substantial  alteration of public buildings or public works, and substantial  construction work for facility, infrastructure, and environmental  restoration projects.   Reverse auctions are generally a valuable tool to ensure the  responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars through the acquisition  process.                                time  1245    In a reverse auction, a buyer seeking a good or service--in this case  the Federal Government--solicits bids. Multiple sellers offer bids and  the seller with the lowest bid wins the competition.   However, in the specific instance of complex, specialized, or  substantial design and construction services, the use of reverse  auctions can be problematic. While the lowest price is often the goal  for standardized goods and services, it is not the only factor that  should be considered for these unique projects.   Quality is also an important evaluation factor, especially for  complex services, like design-build contracts for major public  buildings or works.   This bill would not prevent contracting officers from considering  price in evaluating proposals for complex construction services, just  the use of reverse auctions designed to achieve the lowest price  without regard to quality.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 26, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 27) to amend chapter 3 of title 5,  United States Code, to require the publication of settlement  agreements, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 27         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure  before us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this commonsense measure, and I thank  Representatives Palmer and Cooper for their hard work on it.   The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act would create a  database of settlement agreements entered into by Federal agencies that  relate to alleged violations of Federal, civil, or criminal law. The  Office of Management and Budget would manage this database and set  deadlines for submission.   The heads of executive agencies would be required to submit details  about the types of settlement agreements, the parties involved in the  settlements, specific violations, and the  [[Page H71]]  dates on which the settlement agreements were agreed to.   The information about the settlement agreements would remain public  until 5 years after the termination of the agreements. The information  in the agreements would remain subject to the Freedom of Information  Act; but if the head of the agency decided to keep an entire agreement  confidential, he or she would be required to provide an explanation of  that action.   This bill would improve the transparency surrounding settlement  agreements, which in the past have been difficult for the public to  access.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  has no further speakers, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of  H.R. 27. I am strongly in support of this bipartisan legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
