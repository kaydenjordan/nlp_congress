 Mr. President, this week I rise to recognize Mike  and Tari Conroy for their impact on Ravalli County and the surrounding  areas. Through their work as bluegrass musicians, the Conroys have  brought delight to the hearts of their Montanan listeners.   The Conroys' devotion to bluegrass extends beyond their respective  playing of the banjo, guitar, and other traditional bluegrass  instruments. The events the Conroys take part in, such as celebrating  the birthday of a 90-year-old U.S. Army veteran or the closing of an  essential Missoula landmark, represent the very best of Montana. It is  no surprise that Mr. Conroy is the president of the Montana Bluegrass  Association.   Additionally, the Conroys have worked tirelessly to share their love  of bluegrass music with their fellow Montanans by organizing the annual  Hardtimes Bluegrass Festival, which takes place just south of Hamilton,  MT. This festival brings numerous bluegrass bands from the Northwestern  United States to perform in Montana. Despite the financial and  logistical hurdles, the Conroys are committed to sharing their passion  with their fellow Montanans. As the festival enters its 11th year, it  has truly become a cultural staple of the Bitterroot.  [[Page S4803]]    I applaud Mike and Tari Conroy for their work promoting and spreading  the joy of bluegrass music across the State of Montana. As the Conroys  prepare for the next festival, I wish them all the best.                            ____________________
