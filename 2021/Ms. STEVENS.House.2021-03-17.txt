 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan bill  to protect Americans from violence and abuse and to ensure that  survivors of domestic abuse have access to the services they need.   I rise in support of a single mom hiding in a shelter with her two  children. I rise in support of a mother looking to flee an abusive  marriage with her children covered in disinfectant chemicals. These are  the conversations I have had with women in my district, in Michigan 11.   The Violence Against Women Act reauthorizes funding for a variety of  critical grant programs, including for victim services, prevention,  training, education, enforcement, economic stability, and on.   Two years ago, Mr. Speaker, I walked with my colleagues over to the  Senate majority leader's office to demand a vote on this  reauthorization, and he refused to see us. He refused to even allow a  vote.   Today, Mr. Speaker, as I rise, I look forward to working with a new  Senate majority leader and a new President who will commit to  protecting all Americans from violence in the household.                            ____________________
