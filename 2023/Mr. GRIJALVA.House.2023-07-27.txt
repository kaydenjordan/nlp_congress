 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to this resolution. There  was a lot I could say and thought about saying about this resolution  and the one that we will see after it. I could talk about  [[Page H4045]]  how badly these two measures undermine conservation efforts for species  that are endangered and threatened across our Nation and across the  globe.   I could talk about how these resolutions give industry and not  science the upper hand in making decisions about our endangered  species.   I could talk about how this latest offering from team extreme takes  the GOP's vendetta against the Endangered Species Act to a level that  should offend us all.   Nevertheless, as I thought about it, I realized that what is more  offensive than these resolutions themselves is the fact that these  resolutions are on the floor right now today.   We are about to leave the House for 6 weeks. By the time we come  back, summer will be nearly over. If the current temperatures stay on  track, it will have been one of the most brutal summers in this  country's recorded history.   In my home State of Arizona, Phoenix has now broken records with what  is now a 27-day streak of more than 110-degree heat. In Florida, the  ocean heat wave has warmed the waters to 5 to 7 degrees above normal.  That level of heat is a disaster for corals, marine life, and all the  local businesses and economies that depend on them.   Tragically, last month a heat wave in Texas was so oppressive it  claimed 13 lives. That also happened to be the same month that was  awarded the grim honor of being the hottest June ever on record. July  isn't looking any different.   Climate change isn't about some distant warning about melting ice  caps in the far-off future. The climate crisis is here. It is now.  People are suffering, and people are dying, and the GOP isn't doing  anything about it.   This year, in the Natural Resources Committee, the Republican  majority has had zero hearings on climate change. They have introduced  zero bills to seriously address climate change. They have introduced  zero bills to help communities being hurt by climate change, and they  have accepted zero Democratic amendments to include climate change in  any of their legislation.   Today, Republicans have decided that the most important thing they  could do before we leave for 6 weeks would be a couple of resolutions  to kill off the lesser prairie-chicken and the northern long-eared bat.   We are about to go back to our districts where our constituents will  have questions about what we are doing to protect their homes, their  businesses, and their livelihoods from the increasing threat of climate  change.   I have to wonder if my Republican colleagues think that bullying  chickens and bats would be a sufficient answer. I don't agree, and I am  certain our constituents won't agree either.   Fortunately for Democrats, we can assure our constituents that we  passed the country's biggest ever investment in climate and clean  energy through the Inflation Reduction Act last year and that the Biden  administration is working to get that funding out the door as quickly  and as equitably as possible against ongoing efforts in appropriations  to defund those initiatives and to dismantle, as we see today, existing  environmental protections.   Unfortunately, the Big Gas and Big Oil industry in this country is  making Americans more and more dependent on fossil fuels as their  source of energy and thus increasing the climate crisis that we are  experiencing now.   Common sense says that the new party in charge of the House would  want to keep that historic momentum going, but sometimes common sense  ain't that common.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution.  I urge my Republican colleagues to come back in September with a better  plan to help the American people than a couple of go-nowhere  resolutions that beat up on bats and chickens, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, during the markup of this particular bill, the chair of  the Natural Resources Committee agreed with the Democrats that these  CRA resolutions are extreme. He said:         The CRA process is an extreme process because it does take       that ability away from a Federal agency, and if we enact this       resolution, the agency can't take those steps again.    That was repeated right now by my colleague who spoke.   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are taking  this extreme step what their plan is. When the lesser prairie-chicken  or the northern long-eared bat slips closer to extinction, what is the  backup?   There is no backup. The CRA is permanent, and extinction then becomes  the only avenue and the only probability.   Mr. Speaker, I suggest that 99 percent of the species that have been  listed on the Endangered Species Act continue to exist. That is the  track record that should be highlighted, and that is the track record,  on this 50-year anniversary of the Endangered Species Act, that we  should all be proud of.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, oil and gas companies raked in record profits last year,  but it appears that House Republicans aren't done trying to give them  handout after handout.   This week, they are trying to give them a free pass to avoid  conserving the lesser prairie-chicken and the Endangered Species Act in  and of itself.   H.R. 1, their top priority, the polluters over people act, lays out a  blueprint on exactly how to reward the industry, how to make those  handouts permanent, how to undermine and dismantle protections and laws  that have been put in place for 50-plus years in reaction to the need  to conserve species and, more importantly, to protect the American  people and their health.   Going forward, we have to understand that while these two resolutions  we are dealing with today are part of it, there is a bigger agenda, a  bigger blueprint, that talks about turning over the public policy and  legislative arm of Congress to the oil and gas companies, to the big  corporate interests that are raking in profits, ensuring that we  continue to be dependent on their source of energy and not develop the  renewable and clean energy the American people need and want and that  is cheaper and will create jobs. That is what is on the agenda, as  well.   As we debate these two particular resolutions, let's not forget or  ignore the underlying reality of what we are talking about in terms of  energy policy, period, in this country.   Let's not forget that, during the hostage taking on the debt ceiling,  the principal point and the principal attack was against those  fundamental environmental laws, again moving us in a direction that  increases dependence on polluting industries and lessens our ability to  respond to what the American people need, and that is a safe, secure  environment for themselves and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, 1 million species globally are at risk of  extinction, and one of the main drivers is climate change. Let's stop  picking on these species and instead start addressing the real issue of  climate change.   E.O. Wilson, the father of modern biodiversity, estimated the world  is losing three species per hour. We have a biodiversity crisis on our  hands, and we have a climate crisis on our hands, but House Republicans  decided this week is a good time to legislate the extinction of a  couple of species.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with regard to rural America and the important role that  they play in this great Nation of ours, I am patiently waiting with, I  hope, good expectations that if the agriculture appropriations bill  ever gets done that it will reflect that commitment to rural America,  that electric co-ops will continue to function, that nutrition will  continue to be important in this America, that women and children will  receive the nutrition that they need, and that the loan program for  rural America's small farmers continues to be intact. Let's see.  Sometimes pronouncements that are not followed with action are just  that, political banter.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that this resolution and the  other resolution to follow will be the last items, as was predicted,  that this Congress does before it goes on recess for 6 weeks.   The agriculture appropriations legislation is not done yet, and so  rural America can hold its breath until the Republican majority  satisfies an extreme agenda on the part of their Members, and we all  wait.   However, we are going to vote on these two resolutions, resolutions  that are not necessary, minor, almost petty, while the American people  wait for some real solutions and some real actions on the part of the  Republican majority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close. To be clear, I agree that the lesser prairie-chicken is  important. All threatened and endangered species are important. We are  in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, as we speak.   What I find patently unimportant is this resolution that doesn't  respect the science, doesn't respect our imperative to protect  biodiversity and slow down climate change, and certainly doesn't  respect the important things that the American people have sent us here  to do that are not being done.   This resolution is a polluter-requested, partisan attack that my  Republican colleagues seem to be able to defend only with opinions,  anecdotes, and industry talking points. I will remind us all; it will  go nowhere. Good policy is not built solely on opinions. It is built on  science, facts, and the needs of the American people.   The fact is that climate change, not the chicken, is killing  Americans and costing us hundreds of billions of dollars each year. I  urge my colleagues to oppose S.J. Res. 9.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to the resolution, but  before I go into that part, I was thinking. Today doesn't feel like it  is a day that we are debating chickens and bats. It feels strangely  like Groundhog Day and that we are doing this over and over again.   Anyway, Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution. Like  the one we just saw, this resolution doesn't do anything the American  people have asked for.   In my 20 years in Congress, no constituent has ever asked me what we  are doing to put the northern long-eared bat on the brink of  extinction. I suspect I am not alone.    That raises a question. If the Republicans aren't answering to the  American people with these absurd resolutions, who are they answering  to?   Unfortunately, the answer is the same as it has been since the  beginning of this Congress. Nowhere is the answer clearer than on the  Natural Resources Committee, where we see countless hearings and bills  just like this one that attack the Endangered Species Act and our other  fundamental environmental protections like the National Environmental  Policy Act.   To put it simply, the GOP's environmental and energy agenda is  designed for one constituency and one constituency only--the polluting  industry.   If you have any doubts, let's just do a brief recap. Starting back in  January, after they finally finished the 15 votes it took to elect a  Speaker, the Republican majority wasted no time in getting H.R. 21,  their first and apparently last open rule bill, to the floor.   That bill was a shameless giveaway of our public lands to Big Oil.  Despite the fact that they already have millions of acres of leases and  they don't even use them, it was still the first important bill for the  Republican majority.   Next, we had H.R. 1, fittingly dubbed the polluters over people act.  Bill number ``H.R. 1`` is typically reserved for the majority party's  most important and visionary piece of legislation. In this case, it  seems the GOP's vision for America is a desperate and deliberate  attempt to give oil, gas, and mining companies every handout and every  loophole they can dream up.   H.R. 1 lowered royalty rates, repealed interest fees, reinstated  noncompetitive leasing, weakened public health and safety guardrails,  and, of course, systematically gutted NEPA.   Given the bill's unpopularity and the grim outlook anywhere beyond  this extremist House majority, Republicans decided that the only way to  pass it would be to hold the American people hostage with their MAGA- manufactured debt ceiling crisis and make the polluters over people act  part of that ransom note.   Unfortunately for all of us, that wasn't the end of their pro- polluter crusade. Industry's favorite GOP enablers have already  signaled that they are planning to use the next must-pass legislation  opportunity that they have, likely our appropriations bills, as the  next hostage situation.   I guess a policy agenda that only polluters want isn't something you  can pass through regular order in this House, which brings us back to  where we are today.   These resolutions attack the Endangered Species Act, one of the  country's most beloved and successful environmental laws. In the 50  years since it was signed into law, the ESA has protected 99 percent of  listed species from extinction.   No time is more important than now, while we are facing the  compounding  [[Page H4054]]  crisis of climate change and biodiversity loss. We should be  strengthening and supporting ESA science and implementation, not  pecking at it in order to destroy ESA.   Before we go further, we heard from Republicans in the previous  debate about how it is hurting energy and Big Oil. We have heard a lot  from my colleagues about how the lesser prairie-chicken and the  northern long-eared bat are supposedly hurting oil and gas development.   I want to take a moment to assure my Republican colleagues that they  don't need to worry about Big Oil. Last year, the top oil companies-- BP, Chevron, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies--more than  doubled their profits from 2021.   Combined, these companies raked in $219 billion in just profits. That  is not revenue; it is just profits. This windfall of cash allowed these  companies to pay out a record $110 billion in dividend buybacks to  investors and CEO bonuses.   Needless to say, Big Oil is doing okay. The chicken and the bat are  not a threat to them, and any crocodile tears about their dire  circumstances are just that. Let's remember we work for the American  people and not these industry polluters.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this week in the Rules Committee, we  heard one House Republican say: Long-eared bats? I hope the white-nose  syndrome wipes them all out and we don't have to worry about it.   A vote for this resolution is a vote for the extinction of the  northern long-eared bat.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Neguse), the ranking member on the Federal Lands Subcommittee of the  Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, supporters of this resolution, my  Republican colleagues claim that protecting these species will upend  timber industries and forest management and a list of economic  activities. That is simply not true.   What specifically about forest management practice would be altered  by the rule, especially given the preemptive consultations that the  southern and eastern forest service regions completed last year.   Last year, in anticipation of these new listing statuses, the U.S.  Forest Service preemptively completed consultation on thousands of  permits to ensure that they faced no delays in ongoing or previously  approved projects with the new listing status.   In addition, my colleagues and I secured over $1 billion in funding  last year for Federal agencies to hire staff and expedite Federal  permitting, but Republicans voted against that effort and are now  pushing extreme CRAs to worsen the dire state of America's wildlife.   It should be noted that bats are critically important to U.S.  agriculture and timber industries. Bats have provided up to $53 billion  yearly in pest control services to the U.S. agricultural industry. The  northern long-eared bat provides these services throughout the 37  States that it inhabits.  [[Page H4056]]    We keep seeing the signs about modernizing the Endangered Species  Act. Republicans keep saying that they just want to modernize the  Endangered Species Act, but this giveaway to dirty oil and gas looks  like they want to monetize the Endangered Species Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, a comprehensive review of all 88,000- plus ESA consultations from 2008 to 2015 found that no project was  stopped or extensively altered as a result of Fish and Wildlife finding  jeopardy or adverse modification during this period, and that the  medium consultation duration is far lower than the maximum allowed by  the Act.   Setting the record straight on that, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as we end this debate on this particular issue, I had  mentioned in the previous debate that let's not forget the underlying  issue here. It is about energy policy. It is about energy development  policy, and it is about a transition of dealing with the climate crisis  and making the transition to renewable and clean energy across this  country that is cheaper and is provided equitably. That is the goal.  That is where we need to be.   The effort on the part of Republican majority is to continue to grow  the dependency on fossil fuels and polluting industries that have  contributed significantly to this climate crisis that we are involved  with.   We see it around us every day. We are all going to go home to our  States and our districts to deal with the issues of heat, drought,  wildfires, et cetera, lack of water availability and nutrition  availability.   To continue to go on a path where we reinforce the past practice by  picking at and beginning to dismantle fundamental issues like clean  air, clean water laws, Endangered Species Act that deals with  preserving biodiversity that is critical to our lives, and the public's  right to know and to participate with the National Environmental Policy  Act, that is the agenda.   To reward Big Oil and big industry one more time, to build a  dependency, maximize their profits, and then somewhere down the line,  when the crisis of the climate is so untenable for the American people,  we will deal with it. At that point it will be expensive, it will be  painful, and people will suffer while we get to that point.   At the Rules Committee hearing earlier this week, one of my  Republican colleagues admitted that he hoped the white-nose syndrome  wipes out all the northern long-eared bats so that we won't have to  worry about it. It was a pretty bold thing to admit out loud, and a  little shortsighted, I might add.   The northern long-eared bat, like every species of bat we are  fortunate that we have left, is critical to our ecosystem and the  agricultural industry. So if these bats are wiped out, I want to point  out that we actually do have to worry about it.   I also can't help but be struck by the similarities between my  Republican colleagues' let's call it unique wildlife conservation  strategy and the approach they are taking on many of the other issues  facing the American people right now, ignoring the facts, ignoring the  science, and just letting the damage ensue that has become an all-too- common GOP policy plan.   Climate change, of course, is one of the most pressing issues where  the GOP plan is all too clear.   So as we wrap up here and head back to our districts, I leave my  colleagues with some final thoughts. If the northern long-eared bat  goes extinct, we need to worry about it. If the lesser prairie-chicken  goes extinct, we need to worry about it.   If the climate crisis keeps barreling forward over these next 2  years, while our Republican colleagues refuse to do a single thing to  protect communities, local businesses, and our health, we most  certainly need to worry about that.   The issue for me is not singular to these two CRAs. It is about a  very coordinated and deliberate effort to undo protections for the  American people and for species, and to deny and to avoid dealing with  the monumental crisis that we have before us, which is climate.   If we prepare in transition now, we can make it an equitable and less  painful process. If we continue to pass resolutions like this and  continue to follow a Big Oil, Big Gas agenda that the GOP presses upon  this Congress and the American people, then that climate crisis is  going to be painful, expensive, and costly to both humans and to our  economy.  [[Page H4057]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
