 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Florida.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senators Sasse, Braun, Risch, McSally, Roberts, and Hoeven.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Rubio and the other Senators is for counsel  for the President:         How would the Framers view removing a President without an       overwhelming consensus of the American people and on the       basis of Articles of Impeachment supported by one political       party and opposed by the other?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.   Senators, Alexander Hamilton addressed that issue very directly. He  said the greatest danger of impeachment is if it turns on the votes of  one party being greater than the votes of another party in either  House. So I think they would be appalled to see an impeachment going  forward in violation of the Schumer rule and the rules of other  Congressmen that were good enough for us during the Clinton impeachment  but seemed to have changed dramatically in the current situation.   The criteria that have been set out are so lawless, they basically  paraphrase Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who said: There is no law.  Anything the House wants to do to impeach is impeachable. That is what  is happening today. That places the House of Representatives above the  law.   We have heard much about, no one is above the law. The House of  Representatives is not above the law. They may not use the Maxine  Waters--Gerald Ford made the same point, but it was about the  impeachment of a judge. Judges are different; there are many of them.  There is only one President.   But to use that criteria, that it is whatever the House says it is,  whatever the Senate says it is, turns those bodies into lawless bodies,  in violation of the intent of the Framers.   Manager Schiff confused my argument when he talked about intent and  motive.   You have said I am not a constitutional lawyer, but you admitted I am  a criminal lawyer. And I have taught criminal law for 50 years at  Harvard.   There is an enormous distinction between intent and motive. If  somebody shoots somebody, the intent is that when you pull the trigger,  you know a bullet will leave and will hit somebody and may kill them.  That is the intent to kill them. Motive can be revenge. It could be  money. It almost never is taken into consideration, except in extreme  cases. There are cases where motive counts.   But let's consider a hypothetical growing out of a situation that we  have discussed. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his  advisers that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the  Ukraine, but then he gets a call from his pollster and his political  adviser, who says: We know it is in the national interest to send  lethal weapons to the Ukraine, but we are telling you that the leftwing  of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start  selling lethal weapons and getting into a lethal war, potentially, with  Russia. Would anybody here suggest that was impeachable? Or let's  assume President Obama said: I promised to bomb Syria if they had  chemical weapons, but I am now told by my pollsters that bombing Syria  would hurt my electoral chances. Certainly not impeachable at all.   So let me apply that to the current situation. As you know, I said  previously there are three levels of possible motive.   One is, the motive is pure--only interest is in the way of what is  good for the country. In the real world, that rarely happens.   The other one is, the motive is completely corrupt--I want money,  kickback.   But then there is the third one that is so complicated and that is  often misunderstood. When you have a mixed motive--a motive in which  you think you are doing good for the country, but you are also doing  good for yourself. You are doing good for me; you are doing good for  thee. You are doing good, and you altogether put it in a bundle in  which you are satisfied that you are doing absolutely the right thing.  Let me give you a perfect example of that from the case.   The argument has been made that the President of the United States  only became interested in corruption when he learned that Joe Biden was  running for President. Let's assume hypothetically that the President  was in his second term, and he said to himself: You know, Joe Biden is  running for President. I really should now get concerned about whether  his son is corrupt because he is not only a candidate--he is not  running against me; I am finished with my term--but he could be the  President of the United States. And if he is the President of the  United States and he has a corrupt son, the fact that he has announced  his candidacy is a very good reason for upping the interest in his son.  If he wasn't running for President, he is a has-been. He is the former  Vice President of the United States. OK, big deal. But if he is running  for President, that is an enormous big deal.   So the difference--the House managers would make--is whether the  President is in his first term or in his second term, whether he is  running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they  would have to concede that, if he was not running for reelection, this  would not be a cross motive but would be a mixed motive but leaning on  the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection,  suddenly that turns it into an impeachable offense.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Minnesota.
