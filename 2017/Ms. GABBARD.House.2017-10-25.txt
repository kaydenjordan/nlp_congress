 Mr. Speaker, our country is forever grateful for the  service and sacrifice of the over 200,000 Filipino and Filipino- American soldiers who bravely served our country during World War II,  heroes like Sixto Tabay, the last living Filipino World War II veteran  on the Island of Kauai, whom I had the good fortune to meet with  recently, people like him who fought bravely and sacrificed greatly.   So many made the ultimate sacrifice alongside our American troops in  that war, yet their service for decades has gone unrecognized by our  country.   Because of legislation that we passed, today, a very special day,  these warriors were finally receiving the recognition that they earned  and deserve, joining the heroic ranks of the likes of the Tuskegee  Airmen and Hawaii's own 442nd 100th Infantry Battalion, as we honored  them in the U.S. Capitol with the Congressional Gold Medal, our  Nation's highest civilian honor.   To Major General Antonio Taguba, the Filipino Veterans Recognition  and Education Project, and all of our World War II Filipino veterans  and their families who worked so hard and were so patient in making  today a reality, ``thank you very much to all of you,'' ``maraming  salamat sa inyong lahat.''                            ____________________
