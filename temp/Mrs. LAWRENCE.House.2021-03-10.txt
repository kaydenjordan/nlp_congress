 Mr. Speaker, the scale of our relief bill must match  the scale of this crisis, and the American Rescue Plan meets this  moment.   In addition, this comprehensive plan includes much-needed relief for  our battered cities. As a former mayor, I understand the struggle and  strain of our cities right now. Congress cannot sit back as our mayors,  Democrats and Republicans, are calling for help. This is not a Democrat  or Republican issue. This pandemic is reaching every corner of our  country.   Mr. Speaker, let's answer this call and pass the American Rescue  Plan.
