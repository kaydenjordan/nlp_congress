 U.S. efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine       focus on building institutional capacity so that the       Ukrainian Government has the ability to go after corruption       and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged       criminal activities using appropriate institutional       mechanisms, that is, to create and follow the rule of law.       That means that if there are criminal nexuses for activity in       the United States, U.S. law enforcement should pursue the       case. If we think there's been a criminal act overseas that       violates U.S. law, we have the institutional mechanisms to       address that. It could be through the Justice Department and       FBI agents assigned overseas, or through treaty mechanisms,       such as a mutual legal assistance treaty.        As a general principle, I do not believe the United States       should ask other countries to engage in selective politically       associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents       of those in power because such selective actions undermine       the rule of law, regardless of the country.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So it is clear: What President Trump did when  abusing his office and demanding Ukraine open an investigation into Joe  Biden was not fighting corruption. It was not part of established U.S.  anti-corruption policy. That corrupt pressure campaign for his own,  personal political benefit in fact subverted U.S. anti-corruption  efforts in Ukraine and undercut our national security.   President Trump is not fighting to end corruption in Ukraine, as my  colleague in the House, Mr. Himes, pointed out during one of our  hearings. He was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President  Biden and our 2020 election.   Selective, politically motivated prosecutions of political opponents  undercut governance in Ukraine. President Trump's demand that Zelensky  help him do precisely what U.S. diplomats for decades advised Ukrainian  officials not to do completely undercut the credibility of efforts to  promote the rule of law there. The demand also undercut the U.S. moral  standing and authority in the eyes of a global audience.   Once again, here is George Kent.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          It is not.         In my opinion, it is not.         Because our policies, particularly in promoting       the rule of law, are designed to help countries. And in       Eastern Europe and Central Europe, that is overcoming the       legacy of communism. In the communist system in particular,       the Prosecutor General Office was used to suppress and       persecute citizens, not promote the rule of law. So, in       helping these countries reach their own aspirations to join       the Western community of nations and live lives of dignity,       helping them have the rule of law, with strong institutions,       is the purpose of our policy.         Correct. And, in fact, as a matter of policy, not       of programming, we oftentimes raise our concerns, usually in       private, with countries that we feel are engaged in selective       political prosecution and persecution of their opponents.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador Yovanovitch aptly summarized the  global consequences and harm to U.S. national security resulting from  President Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his political  opponent.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Such conduct undermines the U.S.,       exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for       autocrats like President Putin. Our leadership depends on the       power of our example and the consistency of our purpose. Both       have now been opened to question.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The issues I just covered are not a matter of  policy disagreement over foreign policy and national security. Article  I asserts that the President was engaged in no such policy at all but,  instead, sold out our policies and our national interests for his own  personal gain and to help him corrupt the next election. That is the  core conduct of an impeachable offense.   The President's abuse of power also affected our election integrity.   The Framers of our Constitution were particularly fearful that a  President might misuse or abuse the power of his office to undermine  the free and fair elections at the heart of our democracy. Sadly, that  moment has arrived. President Trump's repeated solicitation of a  Ukrainian investigation was a clear effort to leverage foreign  interference and bolster his prospects in the 2020 election; in other  words, to cheat in his election.   In our democracy, power flows from the will of the people as  manifested in free and fair elections. One person, one vote is  fundamental in our democracy.   President Trump's invitation of foreign interference in the 2020  election--for the purposes of helping him win an election--undercut the  Constitution's commitment to popular sovereignty. Americans are now  left to wonder if their vote matters or if they are simply pawns in a  system being manipulated  [[Page S542]]  by shadowy foreign forces working on behalf of the corrupt interests of  a lawless President. Over the long term, this weakens our democratic  system's capacity for self-governance by encouraging apathy and  nonparticipation.   Cynicism makes it easier for enemies to influence our politics and  undermine the national good. Indeed, this is precisely what Vladimir  Putin intended when he meddled in the 2016 election: for us to become  more cynical; for us to lose faith in the notion that the American  system of government is superior to the corrupt, autocratic model of  government that he has erected in Russia and sought to export to places  like Ukraine.   These are not the free and fair elections Americans expect or demand  if foreign powers are interfering. How can we know that our elections  are free from foreign interference, whether by disinformation or  hacking or fake investigations? We must not become numb to foreign  interference in our elections.   Our elections are sacred. If we do not act to put an end to the  solicitation of foreign interference in our election by the President  of the United States, the effect would be corrosive to our elections  and our values. Future Presidents may believe that they, too, can use  the substantial power conferred on them by the Constitution in order to  undermine our system of free and fair elections, that they, too, can  cheat to obtain power or keep it. That way lies disaster for the great  American experiment in self-governance.   As you have seen, there is powerful evidence that President Trump  will continue to betray the national interest to a foreign power and  further undermine both our security and democracy. This creates an  urgent need to remove him from office before the next election.   To explain the nature of that continuing threat, let me describe  Russia's ongoing efforts to harm our elections, the President's corrupt  refusal to condemn or defend against those attacks, his statements  confirming that he welcomes foreign interference in our elections so  long as this is meant to help him and his conduct, proving that he will  persist in seeking to corrupt elections at the expense of our security  and at the expense of those elections.   Let's start with Russia's ongoing attacks on our democracy. At the  heart of the President's Ukraine scheme is his decision to subscribe to  that dangerous conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was  responsible for interfering in 2016. President Trump and his men  pressured Ukraine into investigating this bogus piece of Russian  propaganda, and in doing so, they aided Putin's concerted plot to  undermine our security and democracy.   Special Counsel Mueller warned that Putin's plot was ongoing:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         HURD. Is this--in your investigation, did you think this       was a single attempt by Russia to get involved in our       election, or do you find evidence to suggest they'll try to       do this again?        MUELLER. Oh, it wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it       as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next       campaign.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Not a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit  here, and they expect to do it in the next campaign.   That was Special Counsel Mueller's stark warning. And we now know  that Director Mueller was right. Just the other week, we saw public  reporting that Russian hackers may be using phishing emails to attack  Ukrainian gas company Burisma, presumably in search of dirt on Joe  Biden. Those are the same tactics deployed by the same adversary,  Russia, that the special counsel warned about in the last election. It  may be Russia once again attempting to sway our election for one  candidate, this time through Ukraine.   Indeed, President Trump, to this very day, refuses to accept the  unanimous assessment of our intelligence community and law enforcement  professionals that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign and poses a  threat to the 2020 Presidential election. Instead, he views it from his  own personal lens--whether it is an attack on the legitimacy of his  2016 electoral victory.   Special Counsel Mueller's testimony on July 24, 2019, the day before  the President's call with President Zelensky, contradicted President  Trump's claim that his was ``a clean campaign.'' Mueller found that  individuals associated with the 2016 campaign of the President welcomed  Russia's offers of assistance and adjusted their political strategy so  that then-Candidate Donald Trump might benefit from Russia's  assistance.   When they were subsequently asked by U.S. law enforcement about their  activities, President Trump's advisers repeatedly lied. In Helsinki in  July of 2018, however, President Trump refused to acknowledge the  Russian threat to our elections. When a reporter explicitly asked  whether he believed Putin or the U.S. intelligence agencies on the  issue of foreign interference in the 2016 election, President Trump  said: ``I don't see any reason why it would be''--Russia--and talked  about the DNC server.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. So let me just say that we have two       thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI       never took the server. Why haven't they taken the server? Why       was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic       National Committee? I've been wondering that. I've been       asking that for months and months, and I've been tweeting it       out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server?       I want to know, where is the server? And what is the server       saying?        With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My       people came to me--Dan Coats came to me and some others--they       said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just       said it's not Russia.        I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be,       but I really do want to see the server. But I have--I have       confidence in both parties. I really believe that this will       probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on       without finding out what happened to the server. What       happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that       worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing.       Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton's emails?       Thirty-three thousand emails gone--just gone. I think, in       Russia, they wouldn't be gone so easily. I think it's a       disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 emails.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I am sure you remember this. It was, I think,  unforgettable for every American. But I am sure it was equally  unforgettable for Vladimir Putin. I mean, there he is, the President of  Russia, standing next to the President of the United States and hearing  his own Kremlin propaganda talking points coming from the President of  the United States. Now, if that is not a propaganda coup, I don't know  what is.   It is the most extraordinary thing. It is the most extraordinary  thing: the President of the United States standing next to the  President of Russia, our adversary, saying he doesn't believe his own  intelligence agencies. He doesn't believe them. He is promoting this  kooky, crazy server theory cooked up by the Kremlin, right next to the  guy who cooked it up. It is a breathtaking success of Russian  intelligence. I don't know if there has ever been a greater success of  Russian intelligence. Whatever profile Russia did of our President,  boy, did they have him spot-on. Flattery and propaganda. Flattery and  propaganda is all Russia needed.   As to Ukraine, well, they needed to deliver a political investigation  to get help from the United States. I mean, this is just the most  incredible propaganda coup. As I said yesterday, it is not just that  the President of the United States, standing next to Vladimir Putin, is  reading Kremlin talking points; he will not read his own national  security staff talking points, but he will read the Kremlin ones. It is  not just that he adopts the Kremlin talking points. That would be bad  enough. It is not bad enough, it is not damaging enough, it is not  dangerous enough to our national security that he is undermining our  own intelligence agencies. It is not bad enough that he undermines  those very agencies that he needs later, that we need later to have  credibility.   We just had a vigorous debate over the strikes against General  Soleimani, and the President has made his argument about what the  intelligence says and supports. How do you make those arguments when  you say the U.S. intelligence community can't be believed?   Now, we have had a vigorous debate about what that intelligence has  to say. That is not the issue here. The issue here is you undermine the  credibility of your own intelligence agency--you weaken the country-- for when you need to rely on them, for when you need to persuade your  friends and your allies that ``you can trust us when we  [[Page S543]]  tell you this is what the intelligence shows.'' How do you make that  argument, as the President of the United States, when you have just  told the world you trust the Russians more than your own people? You  trust Rudy Giuliani more than Christopher Wray. How do you make that  case? And if you can't make that case, what does that mean to our  security?   But that is not the end of it. It is not just the propaganda coup. It  is not just the undermining of our agencies. It is also that the buy-in  to that propaganda meant that Ukraine wasn't going to get money to  fight the Russians.   I mean, that is one hell of a Russian intelligence coup. They got the  President of the United States to provide cover for their own  interference with our election. They got the President of the United  States to discredit his own intelligence agencies. They got the  President of the United States to drive a wedge between the United  States and Ukraine. They got the President of the United States to  withhold aid from Ukraine in a war with Russia, in a war that is  claiming Ukrainian lives every week.   Has there ever been such a coup? I would submit to you, in the entire  length of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no such success--no such  success. And why? Because a former mayor of New York persuaded a  President of the United States to sacrifice all of that for a cheap  shot at his political opponent, for a smear against his political  opponent. Was it worth it? I hope it was worth it. I hope it was worth  it for the President because it certainly wasn't worth it for the  United States.   Now, you can see President Trump did not blame Vladimir Putin and the  Russian intelligence agencies who interfered in our election for the  questions surrounding his victory. He did not blame the people who  worked for his campaign and were subsequently convicted of lying to our  law enforcement agencies. No. He blamed the investigators--Special  Counsel Mueller, the man in charge of getting to the bottom of Russia's  interference in 2016. And he chose to believe Vladimir Putin, a former  Russian intelligence officer, rather than his own intelligence  agencies.   We can see a pattern here. President Trump solicited interference  from Russia as a candidate in 2016, and then his campaign welcomed  Russian interference in the election.   In Helsinki, President Trump chose to believe Putin over his own  agencies: ``I don't see any reason why it would be''--referring to  Russia. Instead of denouncing Russia's interference, he denounced those  investigating Russia's interference, and he raised that now-familiar  DNC CrowdStrike server thing: ``I really do want to see the server. I  don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the  server.''   That is the exact same server that President Trump demanded Ukraine  investigate during his July 25 call with President Zelensky.   When the President talked about the DNC server in Helsinki, with  Vladimir Putin standing by his side, he was referencing the same  discredited conspiracy theory about the Ukraine interference in 2016  that Putin repeatedly promoted.   Let's look at this Washington Post article from July 2018.         In the end, Trump's performance alongside Putin in the       Finnish capital seemed like a tour through his most       controversial conspiracy theories, tweets and off-the-cuff       musings on Russia--except he did it all while abroad,       standing just feet from Putin, the leader of one of America's       greatest geopolitical foes.        The spectacle in Helsinki also underscored Trump's       eagerness to disregard his own advisers, his willingness to       flout the conclusions of his own intelligence community--that       Russia interfered in the 2016 elections--and his apparent       fear that pressing Putin on the subject might cast doubt on       his electoral victory.    White House officials told the Washington Post that President Trump's  remarks in Helsinki were ``very much counter to the plan.''   That is another understatement of the century. If that sounds  familiar, it is because the witnesses who testified before the House as  part of the impeachment inquiry all said the same thing about the July  25th phone call. The President ignored vital national security issues  he was supposed to raise and instead raised disproven conspiracies  about 2016 and the DNC server--the very same Russian propaganda he  publicly endorsed in Helsinki.   Do you think it is going to stop now? Do you think if we do nothing  it is going to stop now? All of the evidence is to the contrary. You  know it is not going to stop.   The President just told one of the Members of this body he still  wants Biden investigated. It is not going to stop unless the Congress  does something about it.   President Trump's betrayal began in 2016, when he first solicited  Russian interference in our election.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Candidate TRUMP. Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're       able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That betrayal continued in Helsinki in 2018,  when, as we saw, he rejected the intelligence community's assessment  about Russian interference in that same election--when he criticized  U.S. officials investigating the Russian interference and instead  promoted Putin's conspiracy theory about Ukraine.   The betrayal continued in 2019 when he carried out a scheme to cheat  in the 2020 election by demanding that the leader of Ukraine--a U.S.  partner under military attack by Russia--announced an investigation  into the same baseless conspiracy theory about a DNC server and the  bogus allegations about Vice President Biden.   The abuse of power continues. He is still trying to cheat in the next  election, even after the scheme came to light. Even after it became the  subject of an impeachment inquiry, it continued, and the false  statements about it continued.   President Trump repeatedly asserted that he had a prerogative to urge  foreign nations to investigate U.S. citizens who dare to challenge him  politically.   Just for a minute, we should try to step into the shoes of someone  else. My father used to say, you don't understand a person until you  step in their shoes. I also thought he invented that wisdom himself  until I watched ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and found out that Atticus  Finch said it first.   Let's try to step into someone else's shoes for a moment. Let's  imagine it wasn't Joe Biden. Let's imagine it was any one of us. Let's  imagine the most powerful person in the world was asking a foreign  nation to conduct a sham investigation into one of us. What would we  think about it then? Would we think that is good U.S. policy? Would we  think he has every right to do it? Would we think that is a perfect  call?   Let's step, for a minute, into Ambassador Yovanovitch's shoes, and we  are the subject of a vicious smear campaign that no one in the  Department we work for, up to the Secretary of State, thinks has a  shred of credibility. Let's step into her shoes for a minute. We spent  our whole life devoted to public service, served in dangerous places  around the world, and we are hounded out of our post. And one day  someone releases a transcript of a call between the President of the  United States and a foreign leader, and the President says there is  going to be some things happening to you, or to you, or to you, or to  you, or to you. How would you feel about the President of the United  States? Would you think he was abusing the power of his office? If you  would, it shouldn't matter that it wasn't you. It shouldn't matter that  it was Marie Yovanovitch. It shouldn't matter that it was Joe Biden. I  will tell you something. The next time it just may be you. It just may  be you.   Do you think for a moment that any of you, no matter what your  relationship with this President, no matter how close you are to this  President--do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his best  interest he wouldn't ask you to be investigated? Do you think for a  moment that he wouldn't?   If somewhere deep down below you realize that he would, you cannot  leave a man like that in office when he has violated the Constitution.  It shouldn't matter that it was Joe Biden. It could have been any of  us. It may be any of us. It shouldn't matter that it was Marie  Yovanovitch. It will be some other diplomat tomorrow, for some other  pernicious reason.   It goes to what Mr. Jeffries said. It goes to character. You don't  realize how important character is in the highest office in the land  until you  [[Page S544]]  don't have it, until you have a President willing to use his power to  coerce an ally to help him cheat, to investigate one of our fellow  citizens--one of our fellow citizens.    Yes, he is running for President. He is still a U.S. citizen. He is  still a U.S. citizen, and he deserves better than that.   Of course, it wasn't just Ukraine. It wasn't just Russia. There is  the invitation to China to investigate the Bidens. It is not going to  stop.   On September 19, Rudy Giuliani was interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN.  You have probably all seen the clip. When asked specifically if he had  urged Ukraine to look into Vice President Biden, Mr. Giuliani replied  immediately: ``Of course I did.'' ``Of course I did.''   It shouldn't matter that it was Joe Biden. It wasn't Hunter Biden  there. It was Joe Biden. It wasn't Hunter Biden on that call. It was  Joe Biden. It shouldn't matter whether it was Hunter Biden or Joe  Biden. We are talking about American citizens. It shouldn't matter to  any of us which American citizens.   He hasn't stopped urging Ukraine to conduct these investigations. Mr.  Giuliani hasn't. Donald Trump hasn't. To the contrary and consistent  with everything we know about the President, he has done nothing but  double down.   During the first week of December, Mr. Giuliani traveled to Ukraine  and Hungary to interview the corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutors, who  had been pushing these false narratives about Vice President Biden and  this kooky conspiracy about 2016. Mr. Giuliani met with current members  of the Ukraine Parliament who have advocated for that same fraudulent  investigation.   In June of last year, President Trump told ABC News that he would  take political dirt from a foreign country if it was offered again.   If he has learned anything from the tumult of the last 3 years, it is  that he can get away with anything, can do it again. He can't be  indicted. He can't be impeached--can't, if you believe our Attorney  General, even be investigated.   Our Founders worried about a situation just like this. James Madison  put it simply: The President ``might betray his trust to foreign  powers.'' In his farewell address, George Washington warned Americans  ``to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that  foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican  government.''   John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson wrote:         You are apprehensive of foreign Interference, Intrigue,       Influence. So am I. But as often as Elections happen, the       danger of foreign influence recurs.    Or to quote the President's Chief of Staff:         Get over it. There is going to be politics in foreign       policy.    Well, I don't think that was John Adams' point, and I don't think  that was James Madison's point, and I don't think that was George  Washington's point. If it was, they would have said: ``Get over it.''  But they recognized, as I know we recognize, what a profound danger  that would be for that to become the new normal.   Another election is upon us. In 10 months, voters will undertake  their most important duty as citizens by going to the polls and voting  for their leader. And so we must ask: What role will foreign powers  play in trying to influence the outcome? And if they take the  President's side, who will protect our franchise if the President will  not?   As charged in the first Article of Impeachment, President Trump has  demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the  Constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner  grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law.   Based on the abuse of power for which he was impeached and his  ongoing powers to solicit foreign influence, both directly and through  Mr. Giuliani, there can be little doubt that President Trump will  continue to invite foreign interference in our elections again and  again. That poses an imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy.   Our Founders understood that a President like Donald Trump might one  day grasp the reins of power: an unremorseful, overreaching executive,  faithful to himself only, and willing to sacrifice our democracy and  national security for his own personal advantage. His pattern of  conduct--repeatedly soliciting foreign interference in our elections  for his own benefit--confirms that he will stop at nothing to retain  his power. He willfully chose to place his own personal interests above  the country's and the integrity of our elections.   There is every reason to believe that will continue. He has  stonewalled Congress and ordered executive branch agencies-- organizations that work for the American people, not for the  President--to join in his obstruction. He deployed Mr. Giuliani to  Ukraine to continue advancing a scheme that serves no other purpose  than advancing his 2020 reelection prospects. He attacked witnesses,  public servants, patriots, who stayed true to their oath and leveled  with the American people about the grave national injury that resulted  from the President's misconduct. And he continued to urge foreign  nations to investigate American citizens that he views as a threat. The  threat that he will continue to abuse his power and cause grave harm to  the Nation over the course of the next year, until a new President is  sworn in or until he would be reelected is not a hypothetical. Merely  exposing the President's scheme has not stopped him from continuing  this destructive pattern of behavior that has brought us to this somber  moment. He is who he is. That will not change, nor will the danger  associated with him. Every piece of evidence supports the terrible  conclusion that the President of the United States will abuse his power  again, that he will continue to solicit foreign interference to help  corruptly secure his reelection. He has shown neither remorse nor  acknowledgement of wrongdoing. If you can believe that July 25 was a  perfect call, that asking for investigations of your political  opponents and using the power of your office to make it so is perfectly  fine, then, there is nothing that would stop you from doing it again.    President Trump has abused the power of his office and must be  removed from that office.   Mr. McConnell, I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                   Recess Subject To The Call Of The Chair
