 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 767,  the SOAR to Health and Wellness Act of 2018.   This bill establishes a training program for healthcare and social  service providers in order to better identify potential victims of  human trafficking when they come into contact with healthcare or social  services professionals. The bill provides grants to appropriate  entities to help train these providers on how to identify and  appropriately treat potential victims of human trafficking.   Nearly 21 million people worldwide are victims of human trafficking,  forced labor, or sexual exploitation. At some point, many of these  unidentified victims will come into contact with a healthcare provider  or social services professional. It is critical for these providers to  know how best to care for these individuals and how to ensure they can  coordinate their treatment with other providers in a way that is  culturally relevant, trauma informed, and patient centered. Helping  healthcare professionals better recognize the signs of trafficking and  improve their ability to intervene can truly be the difference between  life and death.   Mr. Speaker, the House passed H.R. 767 on February 26 of this year,  and we are now considering the amendment to the bill that the Senate  agreed to yesterday. These changes reflect bipartisan efforts to  streamline the text of the legislation, while maintaining the bill's  intent and scope as originally passed in the House.   I want to thank Congressman Cohen for sponsoring this important piece  of legislation and for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I have no  further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
