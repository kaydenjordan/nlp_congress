 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Tipton, for  yielding, and it is such a great pleasure that I address the House  tonight as we talk about the Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration Act,  which we will be voting on later this evening.   This is actually a great time, and it is a very fitting time, to give  the late President Sadat this much-deserved recognition. Just last  Monday marked the 40th anniversary of the Camp David Accords,  something, of course, which he is very responsible for. Additionally,  this year is the centennial of his birth.   President Sadat's historic visit to Israel in 1977 was the first ever  by an Arab leader and the foundation of lasting peace between Egypt and  Israel. This visit was all the more courageous given the fierce  opposition and outrage he faced at the time.   President Sadat fought for peace and paid the ultimate price. In  honoring Mr. Sadat, we honor a man who truly embodied the statesmanship  and fortitude necessary to bring peace to the Middle East, virtues that  are as important today as they were then.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), the Sadat Gold Medal Commission,  and the Anwar Sadat Committee for their hard work on this bill.   President Anwar Sadat's shining example of putting aside our  differences and working towards peace is just as important today as it  was during his tenure as President of Egypt. It is my sincere hope that  we can reflect on the dream and the bravery of this visionary man and  work as he did for peace, even when it seemed impossible.
