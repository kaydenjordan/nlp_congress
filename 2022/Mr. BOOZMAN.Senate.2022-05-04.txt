 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Jose Romero for his service as Secretary of the Arkansas Department of  Health. He has led the ADH with a strong resolve and determination  throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and his medical expertise has helped  Arkansans navigate and establish commonsense health solutions during  this unprecedented time.   Dr. Romero launched his career at the Arkansas Department of Health  when he served as chief medical officer, and he was later appointed  interim Secretary of Health in May of 2020 by Governor Asa Hutchinson.  Dr. Romero proved he was more than up to the task; he excelled in this  position and was quickly elevated to Secretary in August of the same  year. The governor has said of his time working with Dr. Romero, ``He's  supported me. He's supported our state. He's understood the political  dynamics as well as the epidemiology of dealing with this pandemic, and  while it's a great loss to Arkansas, he's developed a very, very strong  team at the Department of Health that I know will be able to continue  with great vigor and continued leadership.''   Dr. Romero has years of experience and an impressive educational  background that prepared him to serve the people of Arkansas in the  critical role he has filled over the last several years. He served as  the chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which provided national  guidance on the prioritization and distribution of the COVID-19  vaccine. He has also recently been appointed to the American Academy of  Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases and has consistently  showed his ability to expertly inform and protect public health for the  entire country.   Dr. Romero has a passion for not only serving others but teaching as  well. He is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Arkansas for  Medical Sciences and has board certification in pediatrics and  pediatric infectious diseases. He was also the section chief of  pediatric infectious diseases at the Arkansas Children's Hospital from  2008 through 2020, where he was involved with numerous studies across  his field that have contributed immensely to medical sciences. I am so  grateful Arkansans have had such a dedicated civil servant looking out  for us for so long.   Dr. Romero has continuously shown his incredible commitment to the  betterment of our Nation through his work improving the health of  Americans and educating the next generation of healthcare  professionals. Throughout his time as Secretary of Health, Dr. Romero  has bravely navigated the COVID-19 pandemic and helped the Natural  State stay safe and healthy while continuing to thrive.   He has become a familiar face across Arkansas standing beside  Governor Hutchinson during daily press conferences regarding the virus,  making him a trusted source for many Arkansans with questions and  concerns about the pandemic and medicine generally. As a member of the  Governor's cabinet, Dr. Romero worked diligently alongside the  Governor's team to provide senior scientific and executive leadership  for the agency, and his commitment to the health and well-being of  Arkansans has been clear throughout his career. Dr. Romero has shown  his dedication for providing quality information to all Arkansans  during his tenure, and we have benefited from his expertise.   It is evident Dr. Romero's passion for service and selfless  dedication to public health has made an incredibly positive impact in  every project he has been a part of and helped our State and all its  citizens throughout the pandemic. Dr. Romero has devoted his life to  protecting the public and educating others. I appreciate the  opportunity to work with Dr. Romero and thank him for his commitment to  improving the health and wellness of Arkansans. As he transitions to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Arkansas is full of  gratitude for Dr. Romero and his dedication to our State.                            ____________________
