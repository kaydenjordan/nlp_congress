 Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from  Washington and the question posed because it is exactly part of the  concern we have. I was home in Nevada just recently, and I am very  proud Nevada is a pro-choice State.    Our providers are concerned. There is a chilling effect when they are  hearing other States that are literally criminalizing--looking to pass  laws to criminalize providers for providing healthcare and a woman  traveling across State lines.   What I hear from my providers is we want to help women. We want them  to come to our State, but if their State is going to pursue legislation  or criminalize or penalize or prosecute us or a private citizen can  come after us from that State, then we are having second thoughts about  this because they do not want to be embroiled in some sort of  litigation. That is part of this.   I think it is so important. Thank you for the question because that  is exactly what their intent is.   These anti-choice States--individuals who are taking away the liberty  and freedom of women are also utilizing this chilling effect, this  threat, this scare tactic for providers, employers, and anyone else who  wants to help women to get to States where they can seek this  healthcare that they need. That is the challenge we see. That is why  this law is so important because it is having an impact on our  providers in these legitimate choice States like ours who want to  provide this healthcare.    I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10  minutes prior to the scheduled vote.    Mr. President, I rise today, along with my  colleagues, and I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Murray,  Whitehouse, and Gillibrand, for their good work with me on the  legislation we are talking about today, which is the Freedom to Travel  for Healthcare Act.   As you have heard from my colleagues and as we know in the past few  months, we have seen women's right to choose taken away in States  around the country overnight.   Less than 3 weeks ago, the Supreme Court explicitly overturned Roe v.  Wade, depriving women of a right they held for 50 years. When the Court  decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, it repeatedly  insisted that its holding would, ``return the issue of abortion to the  people's elected representatives'' in the States. Forget women, forget  women's rights, but let's give it to the politicians.   As a result, in 18 States, abortion is either effectively banned or  will be within 30 days. Ultimately, around half of States are expected  to get rid of most or all abortion services within their borders.   In the face of these profound restrictions on reproductive health  services, American women, who are able to do so, have had to travel to  States, like mine, that still protect the women's right to choose.   Thanks to a 1990 referendum, Nevada has enshrined the right to choose  in statute in my State. That is why we are already seeing women make  their way to Nevada to get the healthcare that they need and they  deserve.   But radical anti-choice policymakers have been emboldened by the  Supreme Court decision and its discord and its shocking disregard for  precedent. Yet they are not satisfied with a country where abortion is  only banned in half the States.   We know now they are working to introduce legislation in Congress to  ban abortion nationwide. And until they can pass it, they want to stop  women from traveling for critical care and to punish people who support  these women.   Anti-choice State legislators in Missouri, Texas, and Arkansas have  said they want to pass bills to fine or prosecute women who travel for  healthcare and do the same to providers who offer abortion services and  the many employers who have said they will support their employees who  need to seek reproductive care in another State.   Let me be specific about this because this is devastating already to  so many, including in my State.   In Missouri, a State legislator has repeatedly introduced legislation  that would allow private citizens to sue those who help Missouri  citizens receive out-of-State abortion services.   In Texas, State legislators have said they will introduce legislation  to ban businesses that help employees travel  [[Page S3295]]  to receive abortions. They have also written cease-and-desist letters  to companies like Lyft, Citigroup, and even law firms to tell them to  stop helping employees who seek abortion out of State.   In Arkansas, a State senator has called for a law targeting  businesses helping employees travel for care.   Let's not forget South Dakota because the Governor of South Dakota  refused in an interview to rule out laws that target women who travel  for abortion.   But we are not done yet because we also know that some anti-choice  groups are actively pushing for such bans. The Thomas More Society, an  extremist anti-choice group, is working on draft legislation. Its vice  president told the Washington Post:         Just because you jump across a state line doesn't mean your       home state doesn't have jurisdiction. It's not a free       abortion card when you drive across the state line.    The National Association of Christian Lawmakers, an anti-abortion  organization led by Republican State legislators, is also reported to  be working on similar legislation modeled after the Texas law.   There is no doubt in my mind that some States are going to continue  to move forward with these kinds of legislation.   I want to note that, quite frankly, some of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have tried to have it both ways for years,  insisting that the right to choose was safe--in my State, they have  done it--at the same time they supported increasingly extreme limits to  it. We even heard nominees testify that they would follow Supreme Court  precedent, including Roe and Casey. Yet now we all know those  reassurances were all false. We have seen women's reproductive rights  eroded steadily for decades, and we know that anti-choice activists  won't stop. This is a form of gaslighting, to keep insisting that  American women will be able to get care when we know that anti-choice  legislators and groups are working to stop them from doing so.   What legislators are doing across the country to restrict women from  traveling is just blatantly unconstitutional. They constrain the  fundamental constitutional right to travel, they are anti-woman, they  are anti-business, and they are anti-provider.   Let me just say, merely proposing this legislation, merely talking  about civil action or prosecuting a woman or a provider or even an  employer who helps a woman to travel, is having a chilling effect.   In my State, they are already seeing that these proposals are having  a chilling effect on my providers, who are worried about offering  quality abortion care in the face of potential lawsuits. In Montana,  reproductive health clinics are even limiting care to instate residents  only. Imagine traveling hundreds of miles for essential healthcare,  only to be turned away for fear of a lawsuit.   That is why I and my colleagues have introduced this bill to make it  crystal clear: States cannot and must not prosecute women who travel  across State lines for critical reproductive care.   Our legislation also protects healthcare providers in destination  States and anyone who helps women travel for the care they deserve,  from businesses to taxi drivers, to doctors.   Today, we are calling to pass this legislation. If my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle believe in States' rights and the liberty  of freedom for women in this country, they should support this bill. If  they believe in the fundamental right of all Americans to travel, they  should support this bill. If they fail to protect women who travel for  healthcare and those who support them, then they need to go on record  for the American people to explain why.   I will tell you what. It is not enough to stand there and say that  somehow this legislation is a fly-in abortionist legislation. My  colleague from Montana failed to read this legislation. And  fearmongering at this point in time when women's fundamental rights are  being eroded in this country is not the answer that women and so many  Americans in this country now need.   What we need is for people to recommend and support and identify with  the freedoms that this country brings to all of us, whether you are a  woman or a man in this country. This is about the right to choose and  make those decisions for women. It is a fundamental right. It is an  important right. It is our healthcare and our decision. We are 50  percent of this population, and we deserve to be treated equally.   With that, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that  the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  4504 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I would ask for 5 minutes to  respond.    Mr. President, I do appreciate my colleague from  Oklahoma coming here to talk. I disagree with his argument, but I do  appreciate his profound belief in what he is saying.   I think it is ironic that the issue here before us is really a States  right issue. It is exactly what Justice Alito did in the Dobbs case and  referred this issue to the States to make that decision, and all my  legislation says is, respect my State. We are a choice State. We have  made that decision as a State, and if women want to travel to my State  to seek services and my providers want to provide those services and  employers want to help women travel, then let the States do that. We  shouldn't be impeding on those decisions.    So it is kind of ironic. I hear my colleagues talking about, in this  case, let's take the emotion out of it, except when they want to put  emotion into the issue, or let's take the emotion out of it when it is  not convenient for the arguments they are making.   Let me also address a couple of things because now I have learned  from some of my colleagues, really, the argument they are going to  start making is that somehow this legislation is flying in abortions,  which it absolutely is not. It is a States rights issue. And nobody is  flying into my State to provide healthcare. The actual healthcare is  already there.   The other thing I have heard, which is actually very offensive to me  and I think to so many, is that somehow this is trafficking women.  Well, let me tell you about trafficking. I know trafficking. I wrote  the law to prevent sex trafficking and sexual exploitation in the State  of Nevada for so many who were being sexually exploited across this  country, to hold predators accountable, to make sure that they can  become survivors. This is not trafficking. And for anyone to stand up  and say that it is has a complete misunderstanding. And quite honestly,  I will welcome you to the fight about human trafficking in this country  and sexual exploitation of women and children across the country. That  is so offensive. But I am not surprised because in this day and age,  unfortunately, some of these radical ideas coming out of this Congress  miss what is happening across this country.   A majority of Americans in this country support the right of women to  choose because you know why? I don't know what it is like to step in  their shoes and walk in their shoes and nor do you, nor does anyone  here. I shouldn't impose my beliefs, my religion, my ideas on what they  should do for their lives. None of us should. That is the freedom in  this country. That is who we are when we stand for freedoms and  liberties. It doesn't mean we get to pick and choose those freedoms and  take away the rights of the very individual because we believe  differently or our religion thinks that we should do differently. That  is what we do when we come into this Congress and we all work together  to the benefit of everyone and not erode their rights and their future  and their opportunities. That is what this is about.   This legislation is very simple. Let's protect those freedoms. Let's  make sure we protect those States rights and allow women, healthcare  providers, and employers to actually support and help one another in  this country. That is what this legislation does. To say otherwise is  misconstruing, it is fearmongering, and a continuing erosion of the  debate of the constitutional rights and the American rights in this  country right now. And that is the problem with Congress.   I yield the floor.
