 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of  John Fleming to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic  Development.   The Assistant Secretary serves as the Administrator of the Economic  Development Administration, the EDA. It is the only Federal Agency  focused exclusively on economic development. It works directly with  communities in regions to help them build capacity for economic  development based on local business conditions as well as needs.   As a physician, entrepreneur, businessman, military veteran, and  four-term Member of Congress, Dr. Fleming is incredibly well qualified  to lead the EDA. Dr. Fleming has launched several companies, which  today employ over 500 people in Louisiana. Dr. Fleming's nomination has  drawn praise from numerous political, educational, and economic  development leaders in his home State of Louisiana.   Don Pierson, the Secretary of Louisiana Economic Development, wrote:         Dr. Fleming has been instrumental in the development and       execution of projects, which have taken root in Northwest       Louisiana and spread across the United States.    He goes on to say:         His experience in public policy, business and his military       background serve as the right attributes for leading economic       development efforts.    The Environment and Public Works Committee reported Dr. Fleming's  nomination favorably to the Senate with a substantial bipartisan  majority, and we have done it twice, first on October 1, 2018, during  the 115th Congress, and then next on February 5 of this year, after he  was renominated this Congress. Under normal circumstances, Dr. Fleming  would have been confirmed and in office last fall. Instead, our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have blocked his nomination  ever since it was first placed on the Senate Executive Calendar more  than 155 days ago. Now, we had to file cloture and go through repeated  delays on a well-qualified nominee who was twice reported by a  substantial majority of the Environment and Public Works Committee.   Dr. Fleming's treatment by our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle is similar to the obstruction of John Ryder, whom we finally  confirmed last week to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of  the Tennessee Valley Authority. He had waited an unconscionable 388  days for a vote on the Senate floor.   In a column last Friday, the Wall Street Journal's Kimberley Strassel  noted that 388 days is ``100 days longer than it takes a new human  being to come into the world.'' She continued:         Even at the last, Democrats were stringing out the process,       refusing unanimous consent to a floor vote, requiring       Republicans to file for cloture, which entails more delay.    Then she points out that ``after all that, [Mr. Ryder] was  confirmed--by a voice vote with no audible dissent.''   Let's not delay any longer. Let's stop this spectacle of obstructing  well-qualified nominees solely for obstruction's sake. I urge my  colleagues to vote with me in support of the nomination of John Fleming  to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development  and Administrator of the EDA.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
