 Madam Speaker, I am grateful that the  Democratic Presidential debate was last night in my birthplace, the  holy city of Charleston, where they would see firsthand the successes  of the economic policies of Donald Trump creating jobs.   When President Trump visits North Charleston Friday, the facts are  clear. The Post and Courier, on February 7, by David Wren, reported  ``SC Extends Global Reach.''   ``By air and sea, South Carolina boosted the dollar amount of goods  exported to foreign countries to a record of $41.5 billion in 2019-- nearly 20 percent better than the previous year, despite the threat of  tariffs.   ``Dreamliner jets built at Boeing Co.'s North Charleston plant and  vehicles manufactured by BMW in the Upstate and Volvo cars in the  Lowcountry combined for more than half of the total, or roughly $24.4  billion . . . . `'   ``The dollar amount of outbound goods has swelled by 68 percent since  2011, and South Carolina now accounts for 35 percent of all U.S. tire  exports and 16 percent of all U.S. vehicle exports.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Best wishes to Zach Caldwell on his visit to Washington.                            ____________________
