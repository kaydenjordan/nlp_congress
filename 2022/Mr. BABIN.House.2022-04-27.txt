 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and neighbor from  Louisiana. I represent the 36th District in East Texas. I thank the  gentleman for having this.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden and his followers here in Congress seem  to believe that their policies cannot cause inflation, or cause  shortages of food, or even shortages of baby formula now.   Instead of accepting their well-deserved blame and providing a  sensible path forward for the American people, they deflect; they blame  President Trump, who has been out of office for more than 15 months  now; or they blame Russia or Ukraine, even though gas and grocery  prices were skyrocketing well before that conflict even began.   As polling shows, the majority of Americans are well aware of the  President's mishandling of our economy. And while I believe that in  November in those elections, they will show President Biden exactly  what the American people are thinking about his policies, I don't  believe that he will actually change course.   As long as he occupies the Oval Office, it is his duty to serve the  American people, and I call on President Biden to immediately get with  the program, Mr. President.   President Biden, please worry less about who is in charge of Twitter,  or whether schoolchildren are wearing masks, and stop trying to force  socialist woke policies on to a public that does not want them. Uphold  your oath of office, the rule of law, and do your job.
