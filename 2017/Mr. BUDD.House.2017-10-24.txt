 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Representative  Barr's bill, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act.   Mr. Speaker, how is it that a tiny, isolated country like North Korea  has the ability to fund and develop a nuclear weapons program with the  capability to strike American soil?   The answer to that question is found in part through correspondent  and payable-through accounts, which are tools used by North Korea to  bypass the existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions against them.   Non-North Korean actors use these accounts to fund the government  through shell and front companies. While these sanctions are  implemented in good faith, it is time to acknowledge that sometimes  they just don't work.   There is some good news, Mr. Speaker. If enacted, this bill requires  the Treasury Secretary to impose strict conditions on those who  knowingly do business with North Korea through those accounts.   We have also seen the United Nations take action recently by banning  North Korea's export of iron ore, which is another legitimate step in  stopping the continued development of their nuclear weapons program.   Finally, the Trump administration's executive orders will help us  more easily target companies that do business with North Korea.   These actions, plus the enactment of this legislation, will create  the most debilitating sanctions package Pyongyang and their financial  surrogates have ever seen.   Of all the positive things in this bill, though, I am most excited by  the language amending the Bretton Woods Agreement Act to instruct U.S.  executive directors at international financial institutions, like the  IMF and the World Bank, to use our ``voice and vote'' to oppose  financial assistance to governments that knowingly support the Kim  regime.                                time  1445    The United States has long used its economic influence, a more  aggressive element of soft power, to advance an agenda that liberates  the oppressed in the darkest corners of the world like North Korea.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for introducing this  bill, and I urge its adoption.
