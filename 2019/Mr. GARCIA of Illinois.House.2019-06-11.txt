 Mr. Speaker, I am joined today by my  colleagues to show our country the inhumane conditions of migrant  detention facilities.   As a grandfather and an immigrant, my heart breaks every time another  child dies in U.S. custody.   Migrants are escaping some of the harshest political and economic  turmoil in Central America, only to have their children die once they  arrive here. Like 1-year-old Mariee Juarez and her mother who fled  domestic abuse in Guatemala, then she died in a U.S. hospital after  receiving inadequate care.   We don't allow prisoners to die. How are we allowing children to die  in Federal custody?   Last week, the inspector general of DHS confirmed what we already  knew: Conditions are dangerous and unsanitary.   This is cruel and un-American. This cannot be the new normal. What  the President is doing is anything but normal.   When Attorney General Sessions initiated this, it was a bad way to  move forward.   Is this the message that President Trump wants to send the world,  that the U.S. is where children come to die?   How many children must die before this administration acts?                            ____________________
