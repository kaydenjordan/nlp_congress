 Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize and  honor Dr. Sally Rockey, the inaugural executive director of the  Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, and a pioneer in Federal  research, on the occasion of her well-earned retirement.   Dr. Rockey's career has improved countless people's lives through  research, and she continues this mission today. She has been a leader  in the advancement of research programs in both agriculture and  biomedicine. She spent almost 20 years with the U.S. Department of  Agriculture managing competitive research grant programs, and she was  with the National Institutes of Health--NIH--for 11 years as the NIH  Deputy Director for Extramural Research, where she led the operations  of the world's largest extramural research program.   Together with Senator Pat Roberts, I established the Foundation for  Food and Agriculture Research in the 2014  [[Page S835]]  farm bill. Under Dr. Rockey's leadership, the foundation has become a  significant force in the agriculture research community by developing  innovative private-public partnerships to fund rigorous food and  agriculture research. During Dr. Rockey's 6 years at the helm, the  foundation awarded more than 250 grants in collaboration with over 550  partners. Her engagement with a broad swath of partners helps leverage  $1.40 for every dollar allocated by Congress. To put this into  perspective, with Congress' investment of $385 million over 10 years,  along with the matching funds, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture  Research is on track to invest nearly a billion dollars in agriculture  research, an impressive feat for a new initiative and a testament to  Dr. Rockey's leadership.   Dr. Rockey's legacy is not only audacious research--and the lives  that are impacted by this research--but also the invaluable support the  foundation provides to the next generation of scientists. During her  tenure, the foundation established several programs that specifically  prepare today's young scientists to address the food and agriculture  challenges of tomorrow.   Dr. Rockey's future-focused perspective has led the foundation to  create AgMission. Founded in partnership with U.S. Farmers and Ranchers  in Action and World Farmers Organization, AgMission is an unprecedented  global collaboration of farmers, ranchers, and scientists co-creating  and rapidly expanding innovation, adaptation, and the adoption of  climate-smart technologies. AgMission embodies our shared vision that  agriculture can be mobilized to address the climate crisis.   I want to personally congratulate Dr. Rockey on the conclusion of her  spectacular career in public service and wish her the best of luck on  the start of the next chapter of her life.   We wish you well, Sally.                            ____________________
