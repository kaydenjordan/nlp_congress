 Mr. Chairman, I will start by saying that  despite the objections of many of the folks on the other side of the  aisle regarding this National Defense Authorization Act, which I  consider to be an outstanding bill that I am aggressively and  enthusiastically supporting, and despite the objections on the other  side of the aisle, most of the controversial amendments in this  amendment do nothing but return us to the initial and the long-time  combat readiness attitude that the military has always had and focuses  all of our efforts on that particular goal.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this en bloc amendment. This en bloc  includes an amendment of mine which will prohibit cadets or midshipmen  from being punished for not receiving the COVID vaccine.   An adverse action documented in a member's service record can have a  devastating impact, potentially ending a rising military career before  it even has an opportunity to begin.   Last year, here on the floor of the House, Ranking Member Smith told  us that another vaccine mandate could be implemented in the future if  the Biden administration decided to do so.   I refuse to sit on the sidelines and let the Biden administration's  politically motivated efforts to appease the radical left cost young  men and women their futures.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge support of the overall NDAA.
