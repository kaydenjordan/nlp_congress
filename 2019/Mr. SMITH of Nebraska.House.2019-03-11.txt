 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight several  efforts in my Nebraska congressional district which prepare Nebraskans  to join the workforce and encourage entrepreneurship.   I visited the New Heavy Equipment Operator Training program at the  Hastings Campus of Central Community College. It provides both training  and hands-on experience with heavy construction equipment.   Grand Island Public Schools actually has partnered with the Career  Pathways Institute to offer courses on subjects ranging from business  and marketing to human services and health science.   Arnold High School's only School House Graphic Products teaches  students about technology, design, and business, with the opportunity  to earn college credit through Mid-Plains Community College.   And Scottsbluff High School recently launched its career academies,  including agriculture, business, and technical sciences.   These are just a few of the homegrown initiatives from across the  State of Nebraska which are making a difference in the lives of  Nebraskans, strengthening our workforce, and growing the economy.                            ____________________
