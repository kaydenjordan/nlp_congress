 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, too often, Americans are cynical about  our political system when all they see is legislative gridlock. Yet  Iowans were able to set themselves apart by working together on law  enforcement reforms in the wake of George Floyd's murder.   Every step of the way, the Iowa process was fueled by input from the  grassroots, including those who demonstrated peacefully. The  Republican-led statehouse and senate partnered with the Democrats to  unanimously pass reforms in our State--some of them historic reforms.  Governor Reynolds signed House File 2647 to bring additional  accountability to Iowa's law enforcement officers.   These are some of the things that they did: created stronger  restrictions on the use of choke holds by law enforcement officers;  improved the law enforcement decertification process to ensure that  those who have been fired or who resign after serious misconduct do not  work in our State; strengthened the authority of the Iowa attorney  general to prosecute officers whose actions result in the death of  another; established annual anti-bias and deescalation training  requirements for officers.   We are working on some of these very same policies here on the  Federal level. Washington should follow Iowa's example and pass  legislation to help correct wrongs and inspire positive change in our  communities across the country. Senator Lindsey Graham will be leading  hearings today on this issue before the Committee on the Judiciary.  Hopefully, we can act.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
