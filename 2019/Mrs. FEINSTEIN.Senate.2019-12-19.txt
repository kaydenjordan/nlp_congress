 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the resolution that  Senator McSally and I introduced to declare January as ``National One  Health Awareness Month.''   ``One Health'' is a term used by health experts--including those at  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--to focus on the  connections between human, animal, and environmental health.   Our resolution will help raise awareness for the ``One Health''  approach and promote efforts that simultaneously improve the health of  people, animals, plants, and the environment.   By using the One Health approach, global health problems including  antibiotic resistance, infectious disease spread, and sequestered  medical knowledge can be addressed.   Antibiotic resistance is of grave concern for both people and  animals. Public health specialists are working with physicians and  veterinarians to minimize inappropriate antibiotic usage in their  patients.   By 2050, according to the United Kingdom's 2014 Review on  Antimicrobial Resistance, experts expect that more people will die from  antibiotic resistant microbes than die from cancer today. The best way  to solve this growing problem is for specialists across a variety of  disciplines to collaborate to reduce antibiotic use by promoting good  sanitation and developing alternatives for antibiotics.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 75  percent of new or emerging infectious diseases in people are spread by  animals. Examples include Ebola, Zika, Rabies, Tuberculosis, and  Plague. By destroying natural animal habitats through deforestation,  natural disasters, and climate change, we are forcing animals and  insects to migrate to new areas, thereby exposing humans to new  diseases.   In 2013, a two-year-old boy was the first victim of the Ebola  epidemic in Western Africa. In his small village, deforestation forced  the bats suspected of carrying the Ebola virus to move closer to  people.   Collaboration between physicians, nurses, physician assistants,  nurse's aids, veterinarians, hygienists, anthropologists,  epidemiologists, community engagement specialists, and military workers  helped end the Ebola epidemic by attacking it from different angles.  This was an example of One Health in action. Today, a similar  collaborative approach is working to end the current Ebola epidemic in  Central Africa.   In the United States, diseases such as Lyme disease, Anaplasma,  Bartonella, and Zika carried by ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes,  respectively, are also spreading to new areas.   In 2015, an 11-year-old Louisiana boy was accidently scratched by a  kitten with fleas. He was misdiagnosed by more than thirty doctors and  he became wheelchairbound. However, a ``One Health'' approach saved his  life. The boy was finally correctly diagnosed with a bacterial disease  acquired by the kitten's scratch once he met with a medical team that  included both a physician and a veterinarian. The veterinarian  understood that fleas can give cats bacteria and the physician  understood that a cat's scratch can transmit the bacteria to humans.  The boy was prescribed the antibiotics he needed, and he can now walk  again.   It is time that everybody understands the importance of One Health.  With diminishing resources in the environment and a growing human  population, now more than ever, fighting problems with a One Health  approach must be encouraged.   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
