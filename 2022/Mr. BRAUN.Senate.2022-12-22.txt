 I call up my amendment at the desk, which has to do with  the Cassidy bill that we are going to hear next.   In 1794, Congress passed the 11th amendment, and it was ratified a  year later. This constitutional amendment prohibits--   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. We do not have order. The Senators will  suspend. The Senator is entitled to be heard. We have order in the  Chamber.    This constitutional amendment prohibits Federal courts  from hearing certain lawsuits against States. A State can waive  immunity if it wants to, and States do so now and then.   There is a proven process for eliminating or changing the protections  of a clear constitutional language. It is not the role of the Senate to  repeal constitutional rights through legislation, which is what the  Cassidy bill does before us. This bill would nullify the 11th  amendment, opening public sector entities in States to more Federal  compliance issues and litigations.   Hoosiers did not elect me to roll back constitutional protections for  Indiana. This is why I am offering this amendment to strike section 6  of this bill.   I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays are ordered.   The Senator from Pennsylvania has time reserved.
