 Mr. Speaker, no Member of this body ever wants to come to  this dais and say what I am about to say.   This morning, a train derailed as it crossed Interstate 5 near  DuPont, Washington, in the heart of my district, sending railcars to  the roadway below.   Lives were lost and families were shattered. Loved ones are severely  injured, including a family member of one of my staffers. All this, of  course, right in the middle of the holiday season.   Right now, many questions beg for answers. We need to determine what  went wrong, and the NTSB will be investigating. But, for now, I am  grateful for our first responders and the community for stepping up. So  many set aside their grief and reported for duty, including many first  responders who came in on their day off.   Our hearts go out to the families impacted by this horrific tragedy,  and we ask for everyone's prayers for the victims to continue to  recover.                            ____________________
