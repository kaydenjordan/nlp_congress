 Mr. Speaker, the Russian cloud over this White  House and over our democracy is darkening. I rise today to call on this  body to come together to create a bipartisan, independent commission to  investigate the full extent of Russia's influence on the Trump  administration and our democracy.   Mr. Putin wants to weaken America and our allies, and he views  democracy and human rights as obstacles to Russia's reemergence as a  global power.   After Russia maliciously hacked emails and distributed false  information to influence our elections for their favorite candidate,  they have turned their eye to Germany and France. They want to sow  disunity and weakness among Western democracies and undermine the  transatlantic alliance.   Mr. Speaker, we must know the full truth of the Trump  administration's ties to Putin and the Kremlin. There are too many  unanswered questions about financial ties, personal ties, and political  ties. Every new tie we discover is followed by another distorted fact  from the administration.   The American people are demanding answers now. This House cannot  become an accomplice to the administration's desperate efforts to  divert attention from this investigation. An independent commission is  now the only way to find out what happened and ensure it never happens  again.   Mr. Speaker, we must follow the facts. We can't let ourselves be  attacked this way ever again.                            ____________________
