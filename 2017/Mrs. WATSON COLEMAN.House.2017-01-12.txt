 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening representing  the Congressional Progressive Caucus in this Special Order hour, and I  will be joined by colleagues as we will examine what our future appears  to look like as we plan for the transition which is taking place. We  are 8 days away from a new President and administration that continues  to refuse to put Americans first and complicit with Republican- controlled Congress that will help them execute that mission.   At 1 a.m. this morning, 51 Republican Senators voted to repeal the  Affordable Care Act with no replacement. After 6 years of hollow  grandstanding, Republicans now know that their plan to repeal the ACA  would dump massive costs on families, businesses, and the Federal  budget. The facts are clear, Mr. Speaker.   Republicans' repeal of the ACA would result in the loss of 2.6  million jobs and more than 250 billion--that is billion, B--of gross  State products in 2019 alone. Family budgets and State budgets alike  would be rocked by the reverberations of the repeal. And we cannot  forget about our healthcare providers.   The repeal of the ACA will crumble our critical healthcare  infrastructure, decimating hospitals' and healthcare systems' ability  to provide services, weaken local economies that hospitals help sustain  and grow, and result in massive job losses of healthcare professionals.  While Republicans claim to champion reducing the deficit, OMB  calculates that the Republican budget  [[Page H461]]  resolution and repealing of ACA would lead to significantly larger  deficits in each year and add more than $2 trillion in debt over the  next decade.   Taking away 30 million Americans' health care, blowing a hole in our  budget, and saddling future generations with debt is the height of  irresponsibility. It is important to note that just 20 percent of  Americans support this repeal and delay plan.   In fact, the American people want Congress to focus on raising wages  and creating good-paying jobs for everyone everywhere in America. The  American people want to be assured that their Federal Government is  working for all of their interests. That is what I want to do as well.  I stand ready to work with anyone who is serious about these  priorities.   Mr. Speaker, the nominees that this President-elect has put forth are  focused on everything but the true interests of the American people.  Maybe they are focused on the personal interests of the President- elect. Today, the nominee to lead the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, Dr. Ben Carson, could not even promise that not one  decision or dollar would go to benefit the President-elect or his  family. This is a problem.   Maybe they are focused on rolling back hard fought freedoms or  protections. Yesterday, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker reminded us that  the nominee for the Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions, has not  demonstrated a commitment to the central requirement of the job, that  is to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights,  equal rights, and justice for all. This, Mr. Speaker, is a problem.   Perhaps maybe they are not even interested in siphoning money from  children and public schools. Nominee Betsy DeVos, the nominee for the  Secretary of Education, has made a career of advocating for the  shutdown of public schools and supporting legislation that has reduced  oversight and accountability in Michigan charter schools. Her life work  is the very antithesis of everything that the Department of Education  represents.   This is a problem, and to speak to this problem I would like to yield  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), who has experience in  standing up for public education for our children.    I want to thank my colleague for coming and  taking the time and speaking on behalf of public education and students  everywhere. We talked about it before, and I am happy to announce that  we will be working as part of the House Public Education Caucus and  looking very closely at those issues that are being brought forth and  those plans that are being offered.   I know if you look at my district in my State of New Jersey, you see  some of the finest public schools in the country. At the same time,  just 12 miles away, you see some of the most challenging. I know in my  district that, if Elizabeth DeVos would take a look at what is  happening in my district, she would see schoolteachers anxious to teach  but have textbooks in what is considered advanced placement classes  that don't even have the cover on the top of the book that those  children are using. I know this because I have seen it for myself.   So higher education is, indeed, that issue, that opportunity, that  difference between living a life of poverty and being able to educate  yourself and prepare yourself for a future that we must stand up for,  and we will. I thank the gentleman for the time that he has given us.    By nominating Tom Price as the Secretary of  Health and Human Services, President-elect Trump will continue his  assault on the health of Americans. The HHS nominee has made a career  on lining the pockets of insurance companies at the expense of the  sick, on behalf of the rich, and his unwavering support of cuts to  Medicaid and Medicare are forever known.   This signals yet another broken promise by the incoming President to  pledge to leave the essential Federal programs alone, and he is doing  the opposite. This is, indeed, a problem.   Defending the sanctity of American democracy is more important than  any  [[Page H462]]  partisan consideration. Yet, after reports of Russia's attack on our  democracy were confirmed, Rex Tillerson, nominee for Secretary of  State, wouldn't say if he would support sanctions against the country.  In fact, Mr. Tillerson admitted that he had not yet spoken with the  President-elect about the conflict. This is a huge problem, not the  least of which is one whether or not we can believe it.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a champion  for all progressive needs and for all families.    I thank the Congresswoman. It is true. As we see  the unfolding of some of the drama that is taking place, including that  which affects us and is associated with Russia, it is even more  important than ever that the President show us that he is not hiding  anything regarding his relationships that potentially present a  contradiction of his first and foremost responsibility to us and show  us his tax returns.   I thank the gentlewoman from California very much for being here.   I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).    I thank my colleague for sharing his insights  and his experience with us. We have a lot of work to do, and we are  ready to do it.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to those that my colleague has mentioned, I  would like to bring attention to some of the other nominees that we  should be considering here.                                time  1930    We haven't mentioned the Department of Energy and the nominee,  Governor Rick Perry, who disregarded this agency so much that he  couldn't even remember that he wanted to eliminate it when he was  running for President, or even Linda McMahon, who is the wife of a  billionaire. It seems to me that this litany of nominees belongs to the  millionaire-billionaire club. They know each other well, and the one  thing that they are committed to is ensuring that their interests and  the interests of this President-elect, in his private life, are  advanced. I think that the people in this country need to understand  how troublesome this is.   I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke), the co-chair  of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls and a fighter for the rights of  all working families and all vulnerable families.    I thank my friend and my colleague.   Mr. Speaker, defending the sanctity of American democracy is more  important than any partisan consideration. We are at a juncture at  which we will experience a President-elect who has displayed  breathtaking ignorance about the powers and the basic functions of  government and who has identified the nominees for these cabinet  positions who, if confirmed, will dismantle equality, equity, and  opportunity at every turn, capped off by a Republican-controlled  Congress that would rather make good on divisive rhetoric instead of  working in the best interests of Americans.   There is just so much at stake as we go forth in the next couple of  weeks and as the President-elect identifies and puts forth his  nominees. Whether it is in the Department of State or in the Department  of Education or in Energy or in HUD or in Health and Human Services or  in Justice or in the Environmental Protection Agency--where a nominee,  as Attorney General, spends his time dismantling and litigating against  the Environmental Protection Agency--or whether it is Labor, where the  Labor Secretary doesn't seem to care about working individuals and  protecting workers' rights, or whether it is an SBA administrator who  doesn't have any idea what it is to be a part of a working class or a  middle class, or whether it is even the Treasurer of the country, who  comes from massive wealth and Big Business, each of these  illustrations, in combination with there being the decisions already to  dismantle--to take health care away from millions of families, to  create the loss of jobs as a result of dismantling the Affordable Care  Act without placing anything in its place--represent the dismantling of  the democracy that we have fought so hard to sustain.   If we are going to watch these serious attacks on the equality and  opportunity for all people, then we must make sure that the people in  this country see these things. I have a question for all of us to  answer. As we look toward all of these issues, either individually or  collectively, at what point do we conclude with the question: Is what  is happening in America un-American?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
