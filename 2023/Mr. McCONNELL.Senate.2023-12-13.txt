 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, Senate Republicans are still  working in good faith on border policy changes that will allow the  Senate to pass a national security supplemental. I am hopeful that  Democrats, both here and at the White House, are beginning to recognize  how committed we are to addressing the crisis at our southern border. I  am hopeful that we can reach an agreement and address two national  security priorities.   Meanwhile, the challenges we are facing at home and abroad are not  stopping themselves. As of today, U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria have  faced at least 92 attacks from Iran-backed terrorists since October,  including just last week against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.   Meanwhile, Iran's Houthi proxies are escalating their threats against  shipping vessels in one of the busiest choke points of international  maritime commerce. Iran and its terrorist network are not deterred.  They believe they can try to kill Americans with impunity.   Yet, last week, leading Senate Democrats joined a failed effort to  withdraw America's presence in Syria. Three Members of the Democratic  caucus leadership cast votes to retreat--to retreat--in the face of an  emboldened terrorist threat. So did the chair of the Foreign Relations  subcommittee that deals with the Middle East.   It is time for our colleagues to get serious about the threats that  we face. Fortunately, the Senate is on track to pass the long-awaited  National Defense Authorization Act. I am grateful to Ranking Member  Wicker and Chairman Reed for the extensive work required to bring this  must-pass legislation across the goal line.   This year, the Armed Services Committee considered 445 amendments,  and  [[Page S5929]]  another 121 were adopted here on the floor. Thanks to the dedicated  efforts of many of our colleagues on this side of the aisle, the bill  they produced asserts the Senate's priorities on a host of national  security issues where the Biden administration's approach continues to  fall short.   This year's NDAA recognizes the need to strengthen America's position  in strategic competition with China through targeted improvements to  critical capabilities--from long-range fires and anti-ship weapons to  modernizing our nuclear triad.   It will authorize further investments in the defense industrial base  and expand efficiency and accountability of the lethal assistance  degrading Russia's military in Ukraine.   It will turbocharge cooperation with Israel on future missile defense  technologies and ensure our closest ally in the Middle East can access  the U.S. capabilities it needs when it needs them.   It will give America's men and women in uniform a pay raise.   It will focus the Pentagon more squarely on tackling national  security challenges instead of creating new ones with partisan social  policies.   In my home State of Kentucky, it will advance important initiatives  to expand production at Bluegrass Army Depot and reduce U.S. reliance  on competitors for materials critical to our defense.   Of course, Congress can't fix the Biden administration's weakness on  the world stage by ourselves. We can equip a global superpower, but we  still need a Commander in Chief who recognizes that he is leading one.   President Biden should be focused on restoring real deterrence  against Iran-backed terrorists, not interfering with the internal  politics of the democratic ally they are attacking. Israel is a modern,  mature, and independent democracy. I imagine that neither Israel's  leaders, nor its citizens appreciate President Biden's punditry to  Democratic donors about their wartime coalition government. In fact,  foreign influence in our own politics used to be something Washington  Democrats loved to condemn.   So I would recommend that the President focus on the task at hand:  imposing meaningful consequences in Iran and giving Israel the time,  the space, and the support it needs to defeat Hamas.   This week, the Senate will move the National Defense Authorization  Act one step closer to becoming law. I hope that will mark the first  step toward giving the national security challenges America faces the  urgent attention they require. But it will still fall to Congress to  pass supplemental national security appropriations and full-year  defense funding to ensure the investments we authorize this week  deliver real progress in making America stronger and more secure.                                 Nominations    On another matter, this morning, the Judiciary Committee is examining  another slate of President Biden's nominees to join the Federal bench.   Over the past 3 years, our colleagues on the committee have met and  considered an alarming parade of nominees whose conduct or lack of  legal qualifications make them so wildly unfit for confirmation that  they had to be withdrawn, from the First Circuit nominee known best for  helping defend an elite prep school against a victim of sexual assault  to the Kansas District nominee whom the American Bar Association was  expected to find ``not qualified'' for judicial service.   Unfortunately, today's nominees include yet another head-spinning  example of the Biden administration's radical approach to filling the  Federal bench.   Adeel Mangi is the President's nominee to serve as circuit judge for  the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Since graduating from Harvard Law,  he has spent his career in private practice, but for years, he also  served on the board of a Rutgers student organization that facilitates  and amplifies grotesque, anti-Semitic activism. For example, on the  20th anniversary of September 11, the Center for Security, Race and  Rights at Rutgers Law School hosted speaking engagements for a  ringleader of recent calls for an intifada in the United States and a  convicted supporter of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.    For those who need reminding, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas are  holding hostages, including Americans, in Gaza as we speak.   American Jews are facing a historic wave of anti-Semitic hate, and  this wave is emanating from campus organizations across the country  like the one Mr. Mangi guided and supported at Rutgers. Is the Biden  administration really asking the Senate to give life tenure on the  court of appeals to a nominee with an extensive record of condoning  terrorist propaganda?   I would urge our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to take a  closer look at Mr. Mangi's nomination and reject it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
