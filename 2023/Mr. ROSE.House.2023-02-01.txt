 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 139, the SHOW  UP Act, which was introduced by my good friend from Kentucky, the  Chairman of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, Mr. Comer.   Millions of Tennesseans show up to work every day. However, more than  half of federal government workers, who are expected to serve the  American people, still aren't showing up for work. This has led to  extremely long wait times and delays in services.   Veterans who showed up to work and served our country can't get their  proper VA benefits. Families are waiting months for their passports.  And in my district, a father waited for more than 8 months to receive  his tax return. The entire time, he was left in the dark by the IRS.   Tennesseans deserve better, Mr. Speaker. The pandemic is over, and  it's time to get back to work. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the  SHOW UP Act.
