 That sounds correct, yes.        Attorney GOLDMAN. What did Ambassador Sondland tell you       that President Trump said to him?         If I recall this conversation correctly, this       was where Ambassador Sondland related that there was no quid       pro quo but President Zelensky had to make the statement and       that he had to want to do it.        Attorney GOLDMAN. And by that point, did you understand       that the statement related to Biden and the 2016       investigations?         I think I did, yes.        Attorney GOLDMAN. And that that was essentially a condition       for the security assistance to be released?         I understood that that's what Ambassador       Sondland believed.        Attorney GOLDMAN. After speaking with President Trump?         That's what he represented.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I ask you to bear in mind that when Mr. Morrison  said that is what he represented, that we asked Mr. Morrison about the  President's calls with Ambassador Sondland, and he testified that every  time he checked to see did Ambassador Sondland in fact talk to the  President when he said that he did, that, yes, in fact, he talked with  the President. Every time he checked, he was able to confirm it.   Now, let's let this sink in for a minute. According to Mr. Morrison's  testimony--former Republican staffer on the Armed Services Committee-- he speaks with Sondland on September 7, and Sondland says he has just  gotten off the phone with Trump, OK? So this is contemporaneous. Just  got off the phone with him. Call is fresh in everybody's mind. And what  was said? Morrison says Ambassador Sondland related there was no quid  pro quo but President Zelensky had to make the statement and he had to  want to do it. No quid pro quo, but there is a quid pro quo.   Now, there are notes that show this. There is a written record of  this. There is a written record of what President Trump told Ambassador  Sondland right after that call. Would you like to see that written  record? It is called Mr. Morrison's notes. It is right there for the  asking.   These fine lawyers over here want to persuade you that call didn't  happen or it wasn't said or all he said was no quid pro quo; he never  said, but you have to go to the mic and you have to want to do it.  Well, there is a good way to find out what happened on that call  because it is in writing.   Is there any question why they are withholding this from Congress? Is  there any question about that? Did it claim--well, Mr. Morrison didn't  claim absolute immunity. Mr. Sondland didn't claim absolute immunity.  There is no absolute immunity over these notes, no executive privilege  over these notes. The notes have already been described. The  conversation has already been released. There is no even plausible,  arguable, invented, even, excuse for withholding these notes. Would you  like to see them? I will tell you, in any courtroom in America you  would get to see them. This should be no different. It wouldn't be any  different in a fair trial anywhere in America.   Morrison again informed Ambassador Bolton of this September 7  conversation, and guess what Ambassador Bolton said? I think you can  probably figure this out by now: Go talk to the lawyers. Go talk to the  lawyers. And yet again, for the third time, Morrison went to talk to  the lawyers about this conversation with Ambassador Sondland.    Morrison also called Ambassador Taylor to inform him about the  conversation, and we have the testimony from Ambassador Taylor about  their conversation, which is also based on his contemporaneous notes.   Let's look at the conversation now between Mr. Morrison and  Ambassador Taylor.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. According to Mr. Morrison, President       Trump told Ambassador Sondland he was not asking for a quid       pro quo. President Trump did insist that President Zelensky       go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of       Biden and 2016 election interference and that President       Zelensky should want to do this himself.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. OK, so here we have two witnesses taking  contemporaneous notes, both reflecting the same conversation--a  conversation between Sondland and the President in which the President  says, ``No quid pro quo,'' but quid pro quo. There are documents that  prove this--documents that prove this that are yours for the asking.   The following day, September 8, Sondland texts Taylor and Volker to  bring them up to speed on the conversations with President Trump and,  subsequently, President Zelensky, whom he spoke to after President  Trump: ``Guys, multiple conversations with Z,'' meaning Zelensky.  ``POTUS. Let's talk.''   Sondland spoke to Taylor shortly after this text, according to  Ambassador Taylor. He testified again on his real time notes. Let's  hear what he said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. The following day on September 8,       Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the phone, and he       confirmed he had talked with President Trump, as I suggested       a week earlier, but President Trump was adamant that       President Zelensky himself had to clean things up and do it       in public. President Trump said it was not a quid pro quo.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is all very consistent here, what the  President said. No quid pro quo, but Zelensky must announce the  investigations publicly, was what he was telling Sondland--no quid pro  quo except for the quid pro quo.   The President's attorneys would like you to remember the first half  of that sentence and would like to forget the second half ever  happened, but we don't have to leave our common sense at the door, and  we don't have to rely on an incomplete description of that call. We  have instead the detailed notes of Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor.   We also know what President Trump told Sondland because Sondland  relayed that message to President Zelensky. During the same September 8  conversation with Taylor, Sondland described his conversation with  President Zelensky.   Here is Ambassador Taylor's account of it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. Ambassador Sondland also said that he       had talked with President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had       told them that although this was not a quid pro quo, if       President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we       would be at a stalemate. I understood a stalemate to mean       that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military       assistance.        Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded       with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement       in an interview on CNN.    So not only did Ambassador Sondland relate this conversation to Mr.  Morrison and Mr. Taylor, not only did Ambassador Taylor and Mr.  Morrison talk about it, but Sondland said he  [[Page S479]]  relayed this conversation to Zelensky himself. Everyone was now in the  loop on the military aid being withheld for the political  investigations.   Taylor continued recalling the startling analogy Ambassador Sondland  used to describe President Trump's approach to Ukraine:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. During our meeting--during our call on       September 8, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that       President Trump was a businessman, and when a businessman is       about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the       business man asks that person to pay up before signing the       check. Ambassador Volker used the same language several days       later while we were together at the Yalta European strategy       conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no       sense. Ukrainians did not owe President Trump anything.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador Taylor testified that at the end of  the Sondland-Zelensky conversation, President Zelensky said that he had  relented and had agreed to do a CNN interview to announce the  investigations.   So there was a breakthrough after all. The promised meeting wasn't  enough. The withheld security assistance broke the logjam. Zelensky was  going to go on CNN and announce the investigations.   Taylor, though, remained concerned that even if the Ukrainian leader  did as President Trump required, President Trump might continue to  withhold the vital U.S. security assistance in any event. Ambassador  Taylor texted his concerns to Ambassador Volker and Sondland stating:         Ambassador TAYLOR. The nightmare is they give the interview       and don't get the security assistance. The Russians love it.       (And I quit.)    That is quite telling, too.   What is Ambassador Taylor is worried about? He is worried the  Ukrainians are finally going to agree to do it. They are going to make  the announcement, and they are still going to get stiffed on the aid.   In his deposition, Ambassador Taylor elaborated:         Ambassador TAYLOR. ``The nightmare'' is the scenario where       President Zelensky goes out in public, makes an announcement       that he's going to investigate Burisma and the interference       in the 2016 election, maybe among other things. He might put       that in some series of investigations. But . . . the       nightmare was he would mention those two, take all the heat       from that, get himself in big trouble in this country--    Meaning the United States--         and probably in his country as well, and the security       assistance would not be released. That was the nightmare.    If it were to happen, Taylor has testified, he would quit.   Early in the morning in Europe on September 9, which was 12:47 a.m.  in Washington, DC, Ambassador Taylor reiterated his concerns about the  President's quid pro quo for security assistance in another series of  text messages with Ambassadors Volker and Sondland.   Here are the September 9 text messages. Taylor texts to Sondland:         The messages from the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send       with the decision on security assistance is key. With the       hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my       nightmare scenario.    Taylor goes on and says:         Counting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon.    Meaning, if they do it, you darn well better come through with the  military aid.   And Sondland says:         Bill, I never said I was ``right.'' I said we are where we       are and believe we have identified the best pathway forward.       Let's hope it works.    Taylor said:         As I said on the phone, I think it is crazy to withhold       security assistance for help with a political campaign.    Ambassador Taylor testified what he meant. He said that to withhold  that assistance for no good reason other than to help with a political  campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we were  trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was  crazy.   In response to Ambassador Taylor's text message, Sondland replies at  about 5 a.m. in Washington. So the message from Taylor goes out at  12:47 a.m. The message back from Sondland comes at 5 a.m. So it looks  like it might be 5 hours later.   So Taylor has texted at 12:47 a.m.:         As I said on the phone, I think it is crazy to hold       security assistance for help with a political campaign.    There he is again, putting it in writing, for crying out loud. Hadn't  Sondland said to call him about this stuff?   So 5 hours later, you get this really interesting message from  Sondland:         Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's       intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro       quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate       whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt transparency reforms       that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I       suggest we stop the back and forth by text.    In other words, can you please stop putting this in writing? Congress  may read this one day.         If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna       or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.    As you can see Ambassador Sondland's subsequent testimony reveals  that this text and other denials of a quid pro quo were intentionally  false and simply designed to provide a written record of a false  explanation that could later be used to conceal wrongdoing.   The text message said there were no quid pro quos of any kind, but  you have seen his testimony. He swore under oath. He was crystal clear  when he said there was a quid pro quo for the White House meeting, and  he subsequently testified there was a quid pro quo for the security  assistance, as well, as confirmed by President Trump's direction to him  on September 7.   Sondland's recollection of this conversation with President Trump, as  I mentioned, has evolved over time. Initially, in his deposition, he  testified that the conversation with the President occurred between  Taylor's text of September 9th at 12:47, Washington time, and his  response at 5 a.m. He recalled very little of the conversation at that  time other than his belief that his text message reflected President  Trump's response.   Subsequently, though--and again, this is one of the reasons why you  do depositions in closed session. Subsequently, after the opening  statements of the testimony of Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison were  released, which described in overlapping and painful detail Sondland's  conversation with President Trump on September 7, Ambassador Sondland  submitted an addendum to his deposition testimony, which in relevant  part said this:         Finally, as of this writing, I cannot specifically recall       if I had one or two phone calls with President Trump in the       September 6-9 time frame. Despite repeated requests to the       White House and the State Department, I have not been granted       access to all the phone records, and I would like to review       those phone records along with any other notes and other       documents that may exist to determine if I can provide a more       complete testimony to assist Congress. However, although I       have no specific recollection of phone calls during this       period with Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, I have no       reason to question the substance of their recollections about       my September 1 conversation with Mr. Yermak.    During his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland purported to  remember more of his conversation with President Trump, although he  still maintained he couldn't remember if it was on September 7 or  September 9.   According to his testimony, President Trump did not specifically say  there was a quid pro quo. But when Sondland simply asked the President  what he wanted from Ukraine, President Trump immediately brought up a  quid pro quo. According to Sondland, President Trump said:         I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to       do the right thing.        And I said: What does that mean?        And he said: I want him to do what he ran on.    In his subsequent testimony, Ambassador Sondland explained that  Trump's reference to what he ran on was a nod to rooting out  corruption. Here, however, corruption, like Burisma, has become code  for the investigations that President Trump has sought.   So you have got Ambassador Sondland's emerging recollection. What you  got is actually written notes taken at the time that he does not  contest, written notes from Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, notes  which I believe will reflect quite clearly the understanding of ``dirt  for dollars'' that was confirmed by this telephone call to President  Trump.
