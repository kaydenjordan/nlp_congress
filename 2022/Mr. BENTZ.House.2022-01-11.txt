 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S. 192, the so- called River Democracy Act.   This bill, contrary to what the title implies, has nothing to do with  democracy.   Instead, it would, if passed, label some 4,700 miles of Oregon's  rivers, creeks, and streams as ``wild and scenic.'' A more appropriate  phrase would be just waiting to be burned and ruined.   However, this is not your typical wild and scenic river bill. This  bill would designate a mile-wide corridor running the length of every  inch of those 4,700 miles of waterways as wild and scenic. This mile is  double the half-mile-wide corridor normal for such designations. This  means that under this act, 4,700 square miles--an area about the size  of Connecticut--would be locked up and left to the high probability of  burning up.   Many of the miles of streams, creeks, and gullies to which the bill  would apply are within the 20 counties making up my district. Many of  those miles run through Oregon's most important watersheds, which are  absolutely essential to the life of my communities, particularly in  times of drought. Given the damaging impact of such designations to  activities necessary to protect these streams, it is no wonder this  bill is deeply unpopular, something that has been made crystal clear to  me by the overwhelming majority of my 62 county commissioners. They  have serious and unanswered concerns about the dangers the act  presents.   Chief among them is that this designation will prevent what needs to  be done to protect these watersheds, placing them in a bureaucratic  wasteland where it will take years, if not decades, to initiate and  then complete plans which may or may not allow the treatment activities  needed right now.   Also, a top-down approach to land management is wrong because it  completely ignores the interests of well-informed local people,  businesses, and stakeholders.   The approach the bill's sponsors used in developing this bill was  seriously flawed because the river and stream nominations were  solicited from various groups and the general public without any clear  legal or scientific analysis to identify those rivers, streams, and  creeks that would qualify as scenic. If a scientific or legal analysis  exists, the sponsors should share it.   Additionally, the public deserves to know which special interest  groups crafted the bill, provided the unofficial maps of the streams  affected, and conducted the outreach to the public.   It is absolutely clear, whatever the process was, that local  stakeholders, elected officials, county commissioners, landowners,  users, and experts should have been consulted, and they were not.   Let me explain why so many who truly want to protect our public lands  are so outraged by this bill.   So far this year, over half a million acres of forests and other  lands have burned up in my district. Last year it was even worse with  over a million acres laid to waste by fire.   Inexplicably, the bill focuses upon only one method of protecting  this 4,700-square-mile proposed area from fire, and that is by what are  called ``prescribed burns.'' I cannot emphasize how dangerous it is to  prescribe prescribed burns in overgrown, densely packed, dry forests  without thinning the forest first. Prescribed burning before thinning  puts at extreme risk the very rivers and watersheds this designation is  supposed to protect. It is like dropping a match in a tinderbox. It is  impossible to contain these types of fires once they start.   The River Democracy Act, if passed, would threaten watersheds, homes,  businesses, ranches, livestock, and most importantly, human lives.   The bill contains provisions throughout that leave the door wide open  for frivolous litigation by far-left special interest groups, who have  profited for years from lucrative sue-and-settle tactics.   The bill contains no explicit protections for the current multiple  uses of the land, including sustainable timber harvests, hunting,  grazing, fishing, and mining.   Regardless of legislative intent, the applicable agencies will have  broad authorities to restrict these activities.   To date, no official maps have been provided. Oregonians need to have  access to clear official maps to see just how much land is affected by  this bill. I believe no further action should be taken with regard to  this bill until the questions I have raised today and necessary maps  are made available to the public so that Oregonians know exactly what  this bill would do.                            ____________________
