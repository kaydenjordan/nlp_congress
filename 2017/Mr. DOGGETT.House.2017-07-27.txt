 Mr. Speaker, for our Nation of immigrants, a wall  rejects our very history. A wall is not about America leading the  world. A wall is about trying to shut off the rest of the world.   Ignored today, of course, is the history of how poorly laws have  worked to stop desperate people. Most all of those who are coming to  America--risking their lives, suffocating in the back of a truck, going  over a perilous desert--are not here to cause us harm; they are not  here to do wrong and mooch off of our social services. They are trying  to escape violence or provide a little hope to their family. And they  do it by taking the dirtiest, toughest jobs in our society, as  immigrants have done since the very founding of our Nation. A wall only  makes their path more perilous without offering us more security.   Last year, Trump's most famous and oft repeated claim was that he  would build a wall that Mexico would pay for. But, this year, we just  have one broken Trump campaign promise after another.   Today, we have confirmation that Trump is just putting taxpayers on  the hook to pay for another section of a wall--yes, a wall of broken  campaign promises. Instead of a wall, we ought to be building  opportunity. As Austin Mayor Steve Adler said, ``bridges make money,  and walls cost money.''   Building Trump's boondoggle in the desert, at the same time he says  we can't afford medical research or educational opportunity or job  training, just shows how backward these priorities are. Let's oppose a  wall of ignorance, a wall of prejudice, and create a bridge of  opportunity. To achieve both true security and economic growth, we need  to reject this narrow-minded approach in favor of comprehensive  immigration reform.
