 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to bring attention to the  Land and Water Conservation Fund, otherwise known as the LWCF.   Families across the Lowcountry are turning to green spaces to cope  during  [[Page H2290]]  this pandemic, and it is clear that we need more parks and trails where  folks can get outside with social distancing. That is what LWCF does  for communities.   Our region relies on tourism and outdoor recreation, sectors that are  taking a major hit these days. That is why I am standing with the  businesses that make up the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable in calling on  Congress to pass the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act to fully  fund LWCF and restore our parks.   Whether it is our seafood, our beaches, the opportunities to hunt and  fish, access to nature is one reason the Lowcountry is so special.  Let's keep it that way by investing in conservation that supports our  health and our economy.                            ____________________
