 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, recently, the State of Oregon  passed a transportation package that included a provision to establish  tolls on the State line between Washington and Oregon. Since that time,  there has been a lot of concern in my district that tolls could be  established on the bridges on the Washington border, I-205 and I-5 on  the Washington side.   So far, that is not an unreasonable idea if those tolls are going to  be used on that stretch of roadway. But here is the kicker, Mr.  Chairman: my constituents do use those bridges overwhelmingly. Upwards  of 50,000 people a day commute into Portland to work. The problem is  that the proposal, this scheme, would be used to pay for projects well  south of Portland and a structure of roadways my constituents don't  overwhelmingly use. So they would be paying a toll, and that money  would be used elsewhere in the State for improvements. That is  fundamentally unjust, Mr. Chairman.   I am not opposing the concept of tolls, but that creates a real  problem in terms of how the money is used and I think would break faith  with really the American people. So I am opposing that. That is what my  amendment would do, is stop this practice in this area.   It is not that I oppose the concepts of a fee paid by the users of a  resource. Let me be clear about that. The issue is that that fee then  needs to be allocated towards the construction or the maintenance or  upkeep of that resource. There needs to be that nexus there.   Honestly, we have issues on those two bridges that need to be  addressed, and if those tolls were then diverted for use elsewhere,  then we are going to have some major problems.   So I am opposing this. My amendment would oppose this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to the speaker's point, I do  understand, but Interstate 5 and Interstate 205 are highways with  significant Federal interests. They are Federal highways. These are not  backwoods roads. These are not even State routes. These are Federal  highways. The I-5 corridor is over 13,050 miles with an average daily  traffic of 71,000 and a maximum of 300,000 vehicles. So it is a pretty  major Federal investment.   Here is the thing: levying tolls is one thing. That is something this  body does. I think user fees are fundamentally a fair concept, but we  need to apply them fairly. Any attempt to levy tolls on I-205 or I-5 at  the Washington  [[Page H7059]]  State line, the lion's share would be paid by Washington commuters to  pay for infrastructure improvements that these commuters then wouldn't  benefit from. This is where I feel like this is unfair in the extreme.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2130     Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire as to the  time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I will make this brief.   I think a lot of the points the gentleman from Oregon made are valid,  and I don't reject them at all. I think we need to come up with  solutions to pay for these things. We need to fix the congestion issue.  We are one region, and we need to work together.   I completely agree with all of that, which is why the scheme that was  put together to tax one portion, essentially charge a toll on  Washington commuters who are paying into the Portland and Oregon  economy through their income taxes already and using that money  collected from those tolls not on the bridge, not on the Columbia River  crossing, the area where we all agree we need to find a solution, but  using it elsewhere in the State is fundamentally unfair. He made my  point. That is the problem.   It is not that I oppose the idea of tolls. We are going to have to  bring something to the table. I am not afraid to advocate for that.  That is not the issue here. Even within this commission, they are going  to be looking at other ways to fund their projects throughout the  State. That is great.   It is fundamentally unfair to pick the pocket of working people who  don't even have a right to redress Oregon's government. They don't get  to vote. So to take their money because you can smacks of really being  a bully. That is what I am against; that is what is unfair; that is  what I won't stand for; and that is why I am offering this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
