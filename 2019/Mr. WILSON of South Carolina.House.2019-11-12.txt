 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, we marked the  30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. This momentous day  marks a turning point in history.   I am thankful for the leadership of President Ronald Reagan with Pope  John Paul II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for this triumph.   Veterans worked to put their vision of democracy into action with  victory over communism by peace through strength. U.S. military  veterans can cite that we have more countries today living in freedom  and democracy than in the history of the world.   Yesterday, we observed Veterans Day, an opportunity to recognize  freedom is not free. From tearing down the Berlin Wall 30 years ago to  the recent operation in Syria to remove the murderous leader of ISIS,  the continued resolve our servicemembers have to protect American  families is steadfast. We will honor these sacrifices and veterans and  military families, and they shall always be appreciated.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
