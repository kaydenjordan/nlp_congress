 Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about an important issue  affecting families across our country, including in my home State of  California.   I am a single mom, and I know firsthand that we have a childcare  crisis in this country. Two years ago, I spent $16,000 on childcare for  my daughter Betsy to attend the U.C. Irvine-Verano Preschool. That is  more than it would have been for an entire year of tuition for her to  be an undergraduate at U.C. Irvine.   I was able to keep $5,000 of the money that I earned pretax to go  toward those childcare expenses in a flexible spending account, but  that didn't go very far to cover childcare for Betsy, never mind my  other two children. The $5,000 doesn't even get me to tax day. This is  the reality of raising a family in Orange County and in so many places  across the country.   In only one State is childcare considered affordable. Let that sink  in. In every State but one, the majority of families have to spend more  than 7 percent of their income on childcare.   My constituents in the 45th Congressional District have asked me to  help them make childcare affordable.   Jennifer, who works in my district, has two children under the age of  3. She and her husband will spend 23 percent of their gross income on  childcare next year. That is not affordable.   In Irvine, Erica and her husband spend $1,350 each month for  childcare for their 3-year-old son. They have access to a flexible  spending account through their employer, but the $5,000 that current  law allows only covers 31 percent of their annual childcare cost.   Even for those with school-age children, the most affordable city- sponsored camps so parents can work during the summer and spring break,  exceed $5,000. And the cost of eldercare is equally out of proportion  to the current $5,000 limit on the Dependent Care Flexible Spending  Account.   That is why I am introducing the bipartisan Family Savings for Kids  and Seniors Act. This bill will allow families to keep more of their  own paychecks, pretax, to use for the care for kids, grandparents, and  other family members that they incur so that they can work. The bill  does this by adjusting the limit that Americans can put into their  Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts, or FSAs. Families use this  pretax benefit to help pay for preschool, camps, adult daycare, and  childcare.   The $5,000 limit under current law has not changed since it was  enacted in 1986, but childcare costs have certainly risen with the cost  of inflation. There is no reason why a family's ability to save for  dependent care shouldn't have increased with time as well.   If my bill were in effect now, families would be able to put $11,300  in their flexible savings accounts. That is about the average cost of  childcare for one child in this country.   The Family Savings for Kids and Seniors Act offers families a way to  keep more of what they earn to pay for the childcare and eldercare that  allows them to work. The work that parents do adds to the vitality and  the strength of our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting  America's working families.                            ____________________
