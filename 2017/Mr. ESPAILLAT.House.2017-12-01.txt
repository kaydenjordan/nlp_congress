 Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax plan is more than a bad deal  for most working class and middle class Americans. It is a tax scam.   Many families that will be hit the hardest by this tax plan are New  Yorkers. It will cost New Yorkers a total of $17 billion, and they are  my constituents. Repealing the State and local tax deduction, also  known as SALT, is an assault on my constituents.   My district will have the highest tax increases in the Nation without  SALT. Mr. Speaker, repealing SALT means that 760,000 New Yorkers  residing across the State will have their taxes increased.   This is a bad deal for them and all Americans. This will mean an  average of almost $5,000 for middle class families. Investing in  education, firefighters, police services, and many other essential  services keep our cities running. They are not an option. City services  are not a luxury, and we should not be punishing taxpayers who pay for  them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this tax scam and  negotiate a better deal.  [[Page H9587]]                                ____________________
