 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Allen Nicholas who is retiring as forest supervisor for  [[Page S5510]]  the National Forests in North Carolina. Mr. Nicholas has served for  over 30 years and has been a living embodiment of the National Forest  Service's motto, ``Caring for the Land and Serving People.''   Mr. Nicholas was born in Magnolia, MS, and graduated from Mississippi  State University with a bachelor's degree in forest resource management  and then with a master's degree in business administration. He began  his career as a silvicultural technician in the Daniel Boone National  Forest and went on to serve in numerous natural resource and leadership  positions throughout the southern and eastern United States.   When he arrived to his first forest supervisor position on the  Shawnee National Forest, equestrian use across the forest was rampant.  Mr. Nicholas led a multiyear effort to reduce the impact of trail use  on natural resources while also supporting an equestrian-based tourism  economy.   As forest supervisor, Mr. Nicholas oversaw North Carolina's four  National Forests. The Croatan, the Nantahala, the Pisgah, and the  Uwharrie National Forests contain more than 1.25 million acres of land  that stretches from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Coast.  All together, the forests welcome more than 7 million visitors each  year. Mr. Nicholas led a team to reduce the number of accidental  visitor deaths in National Forests in the southern region. Under his  leadership, the team recommended a set of actions that are now being  implemented to track data, improve communication to visitors, and  provide more official presence through volunteers and partners. Mr.  Nicholas demonstrates an impressive talent for balancing the safety of  visitors with responsible stewardship of our Nation's natural  resources.   All who interact with Allen Nicholas--and countless more past,  present, and future visitors--benefit greatly from his service. His  commitment to the betterment of others is reflected in his lasting  relationships with Forest Service employees and the public. His words  inspire and empower, and he leads by example with his actions. Quite  simply, he is a natural mentor to others and a wonderful example of a  public servant.   Please join me in congratulating Allen Nicholas, his wife Debra,  daughters and sons-in-law, Anna Lisa and Taylor Roberts, and Kelsey and  Garrett Dismukes, and his grandchildren Gracie and Charlie on his  distinguished public service career and retirement. I wish him and his  family the best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
