 Mr. Speaker, this week, a Louisiana legend  turned 102 years old. Dr. Attorney Johnnie Jones, Sr., has lived a  lifetime fulfilling every day with service, activism, and love for  family and country.   Born in 1919, he was one of eight children in a successful family who  leased land in eastern Louisiana. He attended Southern University until  being drafted into the Army in 1942 during World War II where he was  the first-ever African-American warrant officer in United States Army  history.   Jones was injured in the battle at Normandy on D-day 77 years ago.  Before landing on the beach, his ship hit a mine, and he flew from the  second deck down to the first. As he described it, he flew like a  bullet, but he survived, coming ashore on Omaha Beach, facing off with  German snipers. Later in the war, he was hit with shrapnel during a  bomber attack and finished his military service in the Battle of the  Bulge. These nightmarish memories have remained with Mr. Jones until  today.   Much of his paperwork and records of service were lost during  Hurricane Katrina, so it was earlier this year, at the age of 101, that  Dr. Attorney Jones finally received the Purple Heart award in  recognition of his battle injuries.   Through all that he endured, he persisted. He returned home to  Louisiana, where he began to serve in a different capacity, this time  as a lawyer. Just 15 days out of Southern University's law school in  1953, the Reverend T.J. Jemison recruited him to organize the United  Defense League's 8-day bus boycott in Baton Rouge and defend the  participants.   After the Baton Rouge City Council revoked the licenses of Black- owned transportation companies, many African Americans were forced to  ride segregated buses and sit in the back of the bus or stand.   When hundreds of patrons boycotted riding in protest, some positive  changes were made, though segregation still remained the law of the  land. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King used the Baton Rouge protest  as a model for his bus boycott in Montgomery 2 years later.   Dr. Jones defended students in drugstore sit-ins and other actions as  civil rights protests spread throughout the South. During these  efforts, his car was bombed twice. Immediately after his return from  war, he was beaten by a White officer on his way to a doctor's  appointment.   ``Things weren't right,'' said Dr. Jones. ``I wanted to fight and  make it better.''   Here is a man who has been through so much, who has tasted the evils  of the world and has every reason to be bitter, but he isn't. However,  he has insisted on focusing his life on sharing love for our State and  fighting for equality.   Jones was the first African-American member of the Baton Rouge Bar  Association. He served in the Louisiana House of Representatives.  Throughout his career as a lawyer, he successfully sought pay equity  for teachers and sued to desegregate parks and communities in  Louisiana.  [[Page H6719]]    He also represented student protesters at Southern University during  the civil rights movement and countless indigent defendants, and he  challenged voter discrimination practices throughout the South.   I was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with Dr. Attorney  Johnnie Jones on Veterans Day to thank him for his incredible service  to our people in America.   On his birthday, he celebrated with friends, family, and good  Louisiana seafood. Today, let's all thank Dr. Jones for his great  advice that he shares with us, which is: ``You have to deal with the  past, and you have to deal with the history. You have to read and  understand so we don't repeat the past.''    Let's build better. Let's build a future for everyone.   Please join me in wishing Dr. Attorney Johnnie Jones, Sr., a happy  102nd birthday.                            ____________________
