 Madam Speaker, for many generations, the idea  of the American Dream has been homeownership. Yet the goal for many  Americans of owning the place they call home is more distant than ever  before. It doesn't just require savings and a good credit score  anymore--but also a strong financial plan to ensure that you can hold  on to it for the years to follow.   That is why I am proud today to support H.R. 1395, the Housing  Financial Literacy Act of 2021. This bill, introduced by my good friend  and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty  of Ohio, provides a financial incentive for first-time homebuyers who  choose to take a financial literacy course by providing a discount on  mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).   This bill would greatly benefit first-time homebuyers by not just  saving them money during the homebuying process, but also providing  them the tools needed to build a strong financial plan. I urge all my  colleagues to support this legislation and hope the Senate will swiftly  pass this bill so that first-time homebuyers are able to benefit from  this opportunity as soon as possible.
