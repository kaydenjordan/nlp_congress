 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for his  allowing me to have the opportunity to be here and speak on this issue.   Today, I rise, Mr. Speaker, because our country is in crisis. Despite  promises to the contrary, President Biden's policies are crushing small  businesses and hurting hardworking Americans.   The simple fact is that we should be cruising into an economic  recovery thanks to the Trump administration's advancements. Instead, we  are drowning in Democrats' reckless spending packages that have led to  a greater increase in inflation rates than we have seen since the 2008  economic crisis.   As a result, Americans are paying more for everything. Gasoline is  over 50 percent more expensive today than it was 12 months ago.  Transportation services are up 11 percent since last May. Food and  energy prices have seen a combined price increase of nearly 4 percent,  a dramatic increase that we haven't seen since 1992.   The average American simply cannot afford this, and it is time that  we prioritize American paychecks over wasteful government spending.
