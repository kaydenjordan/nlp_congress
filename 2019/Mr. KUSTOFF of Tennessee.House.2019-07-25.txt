 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for yielding.   H.R. 336, the Strengthening America's Security Act in the Middle East  Act, is the House companion to S. 1. This bill was so important that  the United States Senate made it their top legislative priority and  passed it with overwhelming bipartisan support.   H.R. 336, a bill introduced by Ranking Member McCaul, combines four  various policy initiatives that deal with the United States-Israel  relationship. This legislation authorizes assistance in weapons  transfers to Israel; extends defense cooperation with Jordan;  establishes additional sanctions on individuals supporting the Syrian  Government; and, most importantly, allows States to divest from  entities that are boycotting Israel.   Just this week, the House passed, with bipartisan support, a  resolution opposing the anti-Israel, anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment,  and Sanctions movement, also known as BDS. That resolution was a great  stepping stone, but we need to do more. Now we must pass legislation  with some teeth.   There is no doubt that Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle  East. It is the only Jewish state. Since her birth 71 years ago, the  U.S.-Israel relationship has continued to grow stronger as we find new  means for cooperation and ensure the safety of her and her people.   It is time for the Democrat leadership to bring this crucial bill to  the House floor for a vote. It is vital for all of us to come together  and show our support for Israel. It is not solely Republican and not  solely Democrat. We must continue to come together as a unified body to  stamp out anti-Semitism and hate towards the only Jewish state, Israel.
