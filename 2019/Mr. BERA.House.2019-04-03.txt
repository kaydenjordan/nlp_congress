 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1585,  the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.   My amendment is simple. It would increase the authorized funding  level for grants that support the development of culturally specific  services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and abuse.   Domestic violence is a devastating reality for many women, and this  is particularly the case in our AAPI communities. A survey done in 2015  estimated that 40 to 60 percent of AAPI women experience physical or  sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.   However, the unfortunate stigma of these events within the AAPI  community means that a lot of these survivors do not seek help  afterwards or even report these incidents in the first place.                                time  1815    Yet when I think about my own community, the South Asian community  and Native American community, we have had some devastating cases.   You have generational divides here where there is an older generation  that doesn't allow folks to talk about this. You have arranged  marriages where a bride may travel thousands of miles and have no  family resources, have no ability to talk about it.   We have got to address this issue. We have got to make it okay for  folks to come out of the shadows.   That is why, while it is important to expand access to these  services, it is just as critical that the person can feel comfortable  seeking out these services. Often, that means they are able to get help  from someone who looks like them and understands their cultural  background.   Providing these resources in a culturally appropriate context can  help survivors feel supported and heard.   My amendment would increase the funding for grants that support  organizations that provide critical services and resources to  communities of color.   Lastly, I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Karen Bass, for  her work on this reauthorization. I am pleased that we have the  opportunity to strengthen these programs.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and support  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.   My amendment would increase support for communities of color who face  domestic and sexual violence in our country and allow them to access  critical support services in a culturally appropriate context.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
