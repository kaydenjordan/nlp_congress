 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  11 a.m. vote today, the Senate recess until 1 p.m.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator  Whitehouse to pay tribute to a legendary police officer, Vincent  Vespia, Jr., whose distinguished career in Rhode Island law enforcement  spanned 57 years, from a young State trooper, to a top organized crime  investigator, to chief of police.   Vin passed away suddenly on January 24, 2023, at the age of 84, and  we wanted to take a moment to honor this great hero--a police officer  who was so beloved and respected by all, who practiced and taught the  art of community policing, and who truly made a positive difference in  the lives of countless Rhode Islanders.   Vin was a dear friend, and I will always remember with great fondness  the time we spent together, especially when he came down to Washington  [[Page S279]]  with his fellow chiefs of police. I deeply admired the chief, not just  as a police officer but as a person with wisdom like no other.   In 2012, Chief Vespia, who was still actively serving as South  Kingstown's police chief, was honored as the first-ever inductee into  the Rhode Island Criminal Justice Hall of Fame.   At that time, he was well known for fearlessly pursuing  investigations into organized crime and corruption and had already  served 30 years as the chief of the South Kingstown Police Department.  And he continued in that role for another 4 years.   Vin's courage and integrity made him, quite deservedly, one of the  most respected and revered members of the State's not only law  enforcement community but of the State overall.   As Stephen Pare, the former commissioner for public safety for the  city of Providence put it, Vespia was ``relentless and honest, and as  strong as you can be as a police officer.'' He described him as a ``no- nonsense chief'' who was comfortable talking with anyone on the force.  ``He commanded respect because he gave respect,'' Pare said.   And that is an apt description and high praise, indeed, but well  deserved.   Vincent Vespia grew up on Federal Hill and then the East Side of  Providence. He served in the Army for 2 years and worked at the then  ``new'' Bostitch factory in East Greenwich before finding his true  calling in law enforcement.   Beginning as a motorcycle trooper in 1959, he served in the elite  Rhode Island State Police for two decades before becoming chief of  police of South Kingstown.   During his 21 years with the Rhode Island State Police Intelligence  Unit, he focused on combating organized crime. Throughout the 1960s and  seventies, Vin Vespia helped coordinate State and local efforts to  successfully track, disrupt, and dismantle organized crime.   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mike Stanton chronicled some of  those stories noting that, in his words:         Vespia grew up playing in the street with some of the wise       guys he would later pursue as a cop.    Stanton tells the story of how, as a young trooper, Vespia arrested a  former playmate from his old neighborhood with a truckload of stolen  furs. Recognizing his childhood friend, the perpetrator asked Vespia:         How can you arrest me? We played kick the can together.    Vespia replied:         You went one way, I went another.    Indeed, he took the high road in everything he did.   In one of his most notable cases, Vin Vespia worked for years to gain  the trust of a known hit man in order to collect evidence leading to  the arrest and prosecution of notorious organized crime leader Raymond  Patriarca, the head of organized crime in New England.   In addition to being an outstanding police officer, Vin Vespia was an  incredible mentor. He taught generations of law enforcement officers  the finer points of police work and leadership.   Toward the end of his career, a local television station asked the  chief about his legacy, and he replied:         Forget about what I've done, what my rank was, where I've       worked, and the cases I've made . . . forget about all that .       . . if somebody would remember me as . . . a guy who tried to       be a good cop, [then] I'm happy.    Mr. President, Vin Vespia was not only a guy who tried to be a good  cop, he was a great cop.   And when he finally hung up holster and badge, the Providence Journal  proclaimed:         Hail to the chief: Vincent Vespia, Jr., ``most admired law       enforcement officer'' in R.I., retires after 35 years as       town's top cop.    Along with Senator Whitehouse, I want to express our condolences and  gratitude to Chief Vespia's beloved wife and partner Judy. A police  officer's family makes sacrifices so that their loved one may serve,  and that is certainly true for Vin's beloved family.    And I want to recognize his children, including Renee Caouette and  her husband Ron, Robin Vespia, and the late Rhonda Vespia.   Chief Vespia was also a doting and devoted grandfather to his  grandchildren: Dylan, Tyler, Dante, and the late Chad O'Brien.   And I also salute his dear brothers, Jay and the late Robert Vespia.   And now, I yield to someone who worked closely with Chief Vespia in a  variety of capacities--as the attorney general of the State of Rhode  Island, as a Federal attorney for the District of Rhode Island, as one  of the most successful, effective attorneys and Federal officers, as  well as State officers, in the history of our State--my colleague  Senator Whitehouse.   With that, I yield to Senator Whitehouse.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the following to  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              United States Senate Committee on Armed Services                      Rules of Procedure, 118th Congress         1.

Witnesses testifying on behalf of the       Administration shall furnish an additional 50 copies of their       statement to the Committee.

(h) Witnesses providing unsworn testimony to the Committee       may be given a transcript of such testimony for the purpose       of making minor grammatical corrections.

(b) Unless otherwise ordered, measures referred to the       Committee shall be referred by the clerk of the Committee to       the appropriate department or agency of the Government for       reports thereon.        14. Except as otherwise specified herein, the Standing       Rules of the Senate shall govern the actions of the       Committee.
