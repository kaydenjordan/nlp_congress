 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  amendment.   You know, I have seen thousands of amendments during my time here in  Congress, but this is the most dangerous I have ever seen. It is far  more restrictive than the War Powers Resolution, and it is historic in  that it handcuffs the President in advance by  [[Page H721]]  undermining his ability to protect American citizens whom Iran  continues to try to harm.   No Member of Congress wants to be at war with Iran, if given the  chance, but deterrence is achieved through credible strength, not by  publicly tying the hands of the Commander in Chief in advance.   While no American wants to be at war with Iran, Iran believes it is  certainly at war with America.                                time  0945    Now this amendment gives Iran's terrorist forces freedom of movement  throughout the region, allowing them to plan and prepare attacks on the  U.S. Forces with impunity.   The rulers of Iran are an evil regime and have been for a long time.  They were designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, after  killing 241 marines in Beirut. Today, it is the source of chaos in the  Middle East, fostering conflict throughout the region and fueling wars  in Yemen and Syria which have caused death and suffering on an  apocalyptic scale, and yet this amendment would require the President  to wait until after our troops have been attacked to use force against  the terrorist forces of Iran.   And that is not all. Then he has to wait until Congress gets its act  together to authorize a response. He could only use force to defend our  troops, under the language of this amendment, ``if Congress enacts  specific statutory authorization for such use of force.''   Our troops conducting counter-ISIS missions in Iraq and Syria will be  proactively prevented from taking action against Iranian forces or  proxy forces to stop an imminent attack.   So passage of this amendment rewards the Iranian regime's growing  aggression and it emboldens the IRGC, a designated terrorist  organization, and their proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, granting  legitimacy and freedom of movement to the world's number one state  sponsor of terrorism.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this historically ill-advised  and dangerous amendment.
