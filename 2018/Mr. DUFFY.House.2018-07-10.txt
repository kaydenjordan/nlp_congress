 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan,  who is also a very good friend of mine, for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 4537, the International Insurance Standards  Act. I first want to start with thanking the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Heck) for the countless hours and effort that he put in, in a  bipartisan effort, crafting this bill that would allow us to get an  incredibly wonderful bipartisan vote.   On top of that, we had some jurisdictional issues, so we had two  chairmen from Texas, of the Ways and Means and Rules Committees,  Chairman Brady and Chairman Sessions, who also worked with us to  navigate those jurisdictional issues.   I also want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Waters, for working with  both Mr. Heck and me to navigate some of the issues that she had with  this bill to allow us to craft a piece of legislation that could get  bipartisan support. I know at a time when a lot of people don't think  that bipartisanship necessarily happens in this Chamber or in this  town, because it doesn't make great news, it happens. People work  together; they compromise; and they find a pathway forward. I think  this is a  [[Page H6010]]  great example of that, and I want to thank the ranking member for her  help in this effort and for her support. Again, it passed out of  committee 56-4.   In essence, what we are doing here is saying that we have had a  State-based model in America that has served this country very well for  150 years. We have been focusing on policyholder protection and  solvency protection. Our insurance industry has been pretty resilient,  and we are proud of it.   But we also recognize that the world is changing. It has become a far  smaller world. We have different standards in different countries, and  we have to be able to navigate those differences. As Americans, we have  to be able to engage with the rest of the world. That is a good thing.  But as we engage, we also want to make sure that we don't sell our  State-based American model for some other model in some other country.   If we want to change an insurance model of regulation in America,  that is our job in this Chamber. We shouldn't have some executive  appointee negotiate a trade deal that undermines our State-based model.  So that was the vision of what we are trying to accomplish.   In essence, we provide parameters to U.S. negotiators to prevent  Federal U.S. negotiators from entering into an international insurance  agreement unless it is consistent and reflective of the existing U.S.  system of insurance regulation. So, again, it has to be consistent and  reflective of our model.   It creates more transparency in the international insurance  negotiation process, as U.S. negotiators have to regularly inform  Congress as to the state and content of the negotiations that are being  undertaken. It also ensures that our State insurance regulators are  closely consulted in a process of the international insurance standards  setting.   So this is a well-crafted bill that took in concerns that both sides  of the aisle had.   I would like to note, as a Member of this body, and I think both  sides feel this way, and whether it was President Clinton or President  Bush or President Obama or now President Trump, we have a role in this  Chamber, and, oftentimes, we cede power to the executive. I think it is  important for us to exert some authority here to say that, if we are  going to change the rules, then you just can't do it without us and  through international negotiations.   I think this is a look to that point that, again, we have a great  model. If we are going to change it, we need to be a part of it. We  need to be consulted.   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, and I  want to thank Mr. Heck and the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan  for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5793, the Housing Choice  Voucher Mobility Demonstration Act.   I want to thank Mr. Cleaver. We have worked together on a number of  different pieces of legislation.                                time  1615    This is just another example of two like-minded people seeing a  problem. This isn't earth-shattering, earthquakes and lightning aren't  happening, but this is a small demonstration project that can modify a  program that can have a true impact on people's lives.   The insight that Mr. Cleaver, the gentleman from Missouri, brings to  this issue was incredibly helpful. I just want to thank him for his  friendship and his help in working on this bill.   We should evaluate Federal programs and look at how successful they  are. What are the results of the programs that we implement?   I strongly believe that, as we evaluate these programs, we should  focus on supporting the programs and ideas that lead people away from  dependency on the government and bring people toward self-sufficiency.  Money is a component. How much we spend to help people is relevant.   But how much we spend on Federal Government programs isn't the end- all, be-all. It is the actual success of the program and the money that  we spend and the leading people out of poverty and dependency into  self-sufficiency and opportunities.   We have to give families the opportunity to pick themselves up so  they can find a better job, they can live in a safer environment, and  they can better provide for their children. H.R. 5793 moves toward  those goals by authorizing the HUD Secretary to carry out a housing  choice voucher demonstration program designed to help those receiving  housing vouchers move to areas of lower poverty and to opportunity,  helping them better their lives.   So, currently, the housing choice voucher program works with around  2,200 public housing authorities to administer 2.2 million vouchers  across the Nation. While you would think that a lot of the PHAs would  translate into more people being helped, it actually creates some  complexity and inefficiency.   In some cases, not all cases, PHAs are fighting to keep as many  vouchers and government resources as possible. They are trying to keep  those resources to themselves when operating in the same general  region.   When that happens, when someone might want to take that voucher and  go somewhere else, there are roadblocks and barriers put it place that  make it more challenging. So, instead of cooperating, the PHAs compete  and put up barriers that prevent individuals from moving to a different  area and actually bettering their lives.   This bill would allow HUD to implement a plan to regionalize various  PHAs in one area to allow for portability and movement to higher  opportunity areas.   The gentleman from Michigan mentioned this. We know that low-income  children whose families move to areas of lower poverty have higher  earnings as adults. We must eliminate the cycle of poverty that keeps  generations of families living within the same area with a limited  amount of opportunity. Helping people move to better opportunities will  increase the chances for them to achieve academic success and reduce  intergenerational poverty.   I think, as we look around the country, we have help wanted signs  everywhere. Everyone is looking for help. Different regions have  different starting wages. So, if you live in one area and you might not  have as much opportunity or as great of wages, you don't have the money  to go to a different part of town or a different area of your State and  you can't take advantage of a better paying job.   What we are saying is let people go. Give them the voucher and let  them move. Let them get that great job. That mobility that we give them  helps them actually start climbing the economic ladder and, hopefully,  get off dependence of the Federal Government. What that does is, again,  launch them on their economic career, but it frees up resources to help  somebody else out. This is a win-win deal.   So, again, it is a demonstration project. I think it is going to  work. I know Mr. Cleaver and the ranking member do as well. Again, this  is just another sign of parties working together to help people. We  don't always agree on everything, but this was, again, a commonsense  proposal that can make HUD work better and help more people out.   I want to thank both the ranking member and Mr. Cleaver for working  so diligently on this effort and allowing this to go under suspension.
