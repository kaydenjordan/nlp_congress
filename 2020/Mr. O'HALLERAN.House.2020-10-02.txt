 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green) for hosting this important Special Order hour.   I did used to be a Republican. I am no longer.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as Domestic Violence  Awareness Month.   As a former law enforcement officer, some of the very first calls I  responded to involved domestic violence. I have seen firsthand the  damage this uniquely hideous kind of violence can do to families and  survivors.   When you come to a situation like this and you look around the room,  you can see it in the children's eyes, the fear that they have; you can  see a family in turmoil; you can clearly identify the tension that is  in the room; and too many times, sadly, you can also identify the  damage that has been done through violence in that same room.   As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I am  proud to cosponsor and recognize the month of October as Domestic  Violence Awareness Month.   Together, as one body, we must commit to working to secure justice  for survivors both in and out of the courtroom. The courtroom is an  important aspect, but it is not the only aspect of this. It is  important and we have to get there.   If we can resolve these issues before that by having appropriate help  for that family, appropriate services for that family, the process of  identifying the underlying causes that occurred in that family, then  hopefully courtrooms will not have to be used.   This Congress, I reintroduced my Help End Abusive Living Situations,  or HEALS, Act legislation to assist the survivors of domestic violence  to rapidly secure safe housing situations.   No person experiencing domestic violence should be forced to stay in  a dangerous situation because they do not have housing elsewhere.   It is great to have family, but many of our victims don't have family  nearby. We need to make sure that our victims are able to seek safety.   In Arizona, when I was in the legislature, there was a shortage of  domestic violence facilities to be able to house families. We overcame  some of that, but it is still true today, and it is true in Arizona and  many other States across this land. We must be able to stop that.                                time  1315    Mr. Green clearly identified the amount of terrible and tragic deaths  that occur every day. It also tears apart families. We need to help  mend those families back to where they need to be in order to make sure  that those children may have the potential to have a normal life. But  if not that, we have to provide the necessary help.   As the Representative of Arizona's First Congressional District, I am  humbled to represent 12 sovereign Tribal nations. Federal data  indicates that 55 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women  have experienced physical violence by their intimate partners.   I know for a fact that on many Tribal nations, help may not arrive  for hours. On the Navajo reservation, in the last few years, three  officers have died, not by answering a call for a bank robbery, or the  fact that they have to go and address a burglary issue or help somebody  else. They died because they had to be alone going there because there  are no other police nearby. And they are dead today because of that,  and their families are suffering still.   I joined my colleagues to introduce the SURVIVE Act, a bill that  would provide legal, medical, and counseling resources to women and  children in Tribal communities who are survivors of domestic violence.  It would also help those officers who have to respond to that scene and  also the children of that family.   Let's use Navajo as an example. Navajo is the size of West Virginia.  It takes in parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Most of it is in  Arizona. There are only about 220 officers for 3 shifts, sick leave,  and everything else, to respond to domestic violence in areas far away  from many of the towns nearby.   To those experiencing domestic violence, and those who have lost a  loved one to this hideous and deeply personal form of violence, I know  that we cannot pretend to understand your pain, but we will keep  fighting for change at every level.   Another example, I had the sad responsibility to be a homicide  investigator for 6 years. Many, many of those cases involved domestic  violence. I also investigated the aftereffects of domestic violence  without death.   I can tell you, because I followed those families through court, time  and time again, saw them year after year, the changes that occurred  within that family because of the death of a loved one, because of the  trauma that occurred, because of the sadness they still had in their  hearts.   Let's keep that in mind as we look down the path on how to address  these types of issues and understand that it is a comprehensive  approach. It is not just sending the police to a location and saying to  a couple, ``Let's all go our different ways,'' and then leave. Society  has to understand that we need to do more.
