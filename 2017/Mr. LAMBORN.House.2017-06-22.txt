 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, the House meets for the second day in a row to consider  another infrastructure bill that has come from the House Natural  Resources Committee and its Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans,  of which I have the honor of chairing. My subcommittee has a strong  infrastructure agenda, already hearing testimony on a number of bills  aimed at improving our Nation's infrastructure and advancing an all-of- the-above energy and water strategy.   Many of our bills, including H.R. 1654, which we are considering  today, apply simple solutions to expedite maintenance or construction  of water and power infrastructure throughout the Nation. It is vital to  rebuild our Nation's infrastructure, and one of the biggest roadblocks  is the excess of regulatory red tape that applicants have to wade  through before they can even move one shovel of dirt.   In Colorado, where I live, a water project was recently completed  where water owned by the city of Colorado Springs was taken from a  reservoir 60 miles to the south to the city of Colorado Springs for  treatment and distribution. The project took 6 years to build. But  before that could happen, there were over 200 permits and applications  that had to be granted, any one of which could have stopped the whole  thing, and that cost $160 million in application fees, lawyers' time,  and mitigation. That took 8 years. That took longer than the project  itself.   Congressman Tom McClintock's Water Supply Permitting Coordination  [[Page H5083]]  Act seeks to cut regulatory red tape by creating a one-stop-shop  permitting process to the Bureau of Reclamation in order to streamline  the current multiagency permitting processes for new or expanded non- Federal surface storage facilities.   However, this bill is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Mr.  McClintock's bill allows water storage project sponsors the flexibility  to opt out of this process and, instead, choose the agency and process  that works best for them.   While the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act will allow for  much-needed relief in the sponsor's State of California, this bill will  benefit States throughout the West, including my own State of Colorado.   Mr. McClintock's bill goes hand-in-hand with language in the WIIN  Act, which was signed into law last year, that supports additional  water storage capacity across the West.   I commend my colleague, Mr. McClintock, for bringing up this  commonsense piece of legislation that simply looks to cut regulatory  red tape for water storage projects that are essential to survival in  the West.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my House colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from the great State of California (Mr. McCarthy), our  majority leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the Centennial State of Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Gosar), who is also a subcommittee chairman on the  Committee on Natural Resources.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I close, I do want to point out a bit of circular reasoning that  my friend from California is using. He says that it is not the  environmental regulations or the red tape that slows down the  construction of dams, it is the high cost. But what he doesn't  recognize or is not willing to admit is that the high cost is caused by  all the red tape and environmental regulations. So that is arguing in  circles, and I don't accept that.   Again, I commend the bill's sponsor for this bill that looks to  promote additional and much-needed water storage throughout the West.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    We support the amendment. It improves the bill by  expanding opportunities for increased water storage across the West. I  urge its adoption.
