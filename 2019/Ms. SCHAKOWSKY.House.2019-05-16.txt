 Mr. Chairman, the real political grandstanding that  we are hearing today is from the Republican side of the aisle, which  for nearly 10 years has been fighting against the Affordable Care Act.   Over 60 times, they voted against the Affordable Care Act. Maybe it  is because some people call it ObamaCare. We know that millions and  millions of people have gotten healthcare because of it.   It is time to stop and to say let's work together to make the  Affordable Care Act even better and extend access. The fact is that the  Affordable Care Act and affordable prescription drugs are two pillars  of healthcare access. They really cannot be separated.   I am proud that we have an opportunity today to do what was  impossible while the Republicans were in charge of the Congress. Today,  we are voting on making impactful, lasting change in lowering the cost  of healthcare, including prescription drugs, for Americans nationwide.   Democrats are at the table and ready to pass this legislation.                                time  1300    We are ready to improve all aspects of healthcare from healthcare  affordability, to prescription drug affordability. Instead of offering  amendments in bad faith, we need to pass this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to reject the amendment by Mr.  Bucshon and support the passage of H.R. 987 in its entirety.
