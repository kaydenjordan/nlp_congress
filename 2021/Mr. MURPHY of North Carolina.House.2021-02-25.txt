 Madam Speaker, ever since President  Biden has taken office, he has been laser-focused on overturning every  great initiative from the previous administration, regardless of how  good it was for the American people.   Today, I want to shed light on President Biden's tragic reversal of  Operation Talon. Operation Talon was a program run by U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement to capture illegal alien sex offenders in  America and deport them.   Sex offenders commit some of the most unspeakable and despicable  crimes imaginable. We monitor where they are in the United States when  those individuals are here legally. Now we have no idea where they are  when they are here illegally.   Biden's misguided reversal threatens the physical and mental health  of American children and their families.   Even setting aside the debate about illegal immigration, we should  all be able to agree that sex offenders who are in this country  illegally should be deported.   Of all things that are common sense and bipartisan, we should agree  that sex offenders are criminals and are a risk to our citizens. To not  deport these individuals just because the present administration wants  to erase the last administration is unconscionable.   I strongly urge President Biden's reversal of Operation Talon and  urge him to reinstate it immediately.                            ____________________
