 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to uplift our student  veterans and call attention to a great need.   Many of our veterans go on to use their GI Bill benefits to go to  school or to seek training. That is part of our commitment to veterans.  Sadly, those GI Bill benefits can be seen as money targets by predatory  institutions. If a school commits an act of fraud, there is no across- the-board mechanism in place for student veterans to restore their GI  Bill benefits.   We can change that, which is exactly what my bill, H.R. 1767, the  Student Veteran Benefit Restoration Act, will do.   I am honored to introduce my first piece of legislation and to do so  with the support of my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs'  Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, Congressman   Mike Levin.   It has taken many people's dedicated advocacy over many years to get  us here, and it is a critical opportunity to better deliver on our  commitment to our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome all of my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________
