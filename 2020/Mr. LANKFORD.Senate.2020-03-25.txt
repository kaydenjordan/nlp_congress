 Madam President, this morning, Technical Sergeant  Marshal Roberts of Oklahoma came home. It was a dignified transfer in  Tulsa, OK, early this morning. There were a lot of people who wanted to  be there but, because of COVID-19, could not. A lot of other folks  were.   Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts was killed in Iraq Wednesday,  March 11, when his unit was engaged by direct enemy fire while they  were sleeping. He was 17 miles north of Baghdad.   He was deployed by the 219th Engineering Installation Squadron, the  subordinate unit of the 138th, out of Tulsa, OK. He was in the process  of building communications infrastructure as part of the fight against  ISIS. The operation that Roberts served in, Operation Inherent Resolve,  has been a vital part of protecting our Nation and bringing stability  to the region.   Roberts enlisted in the Oklahoma Air National Guard in May of 2014.  He was killed in action as the first Oklahoma Air National Guardsman  who has died but the 20th Oklahoma National Guardsman who has died  since September 11, 2001.   The perpetual comment that I heard from the folks to whom I spoke  about Tech Sergeant Roberts was that he was one of the good guys; he  was always known for having a smile on his face; he was selfless; and  he served others all the way to the end.   The night of the attack, there was a truck launcher that fired off 30  Katyusha rockets at their camp as folks were sleeping. Eighteen of  those rockets landed inside the camp facility.   As the noise happened around them, Sergeant Roberts told his fellow  airmen to get up, get going, and get their body armor on. As he stepped  away to go warn other people to do the same, the rocket came. But he  saved the lives of some of the people standing right there whom he had  told to get their body armor on.    He was posthumously promoted to technical sergeant.   He was born January 29, 1992, in Tulsa, OK. Marshal's parents, Sally  and Randy, raised him in Owasso, OK, where he graduated from Owasso  High School.   He has a beautiful daughter, Paityn, who has been the love of his  life. On November 15, 2018, Marshall was married to Krissy Harris. She  was also in the 138th. They met and started dating, both being part of  the Air National Guard.   Their deep love for God, their deep love for their country, and their  obvious love for each other was a significant part of the 138th.  Everyone who knew them, knew what they were like and were glad to be  called their friends.   He was a brother, he was a son, he was a father, and he was a  husband. Our State and our Nation grieves him today coming home.   A fun story about him and Krissy, though, is that they met and  started dating, as I mentioned, while they were both serving in the  138th. She had been in the 138th for 15 years. So she had actually been  there longer. They dated  [[Page S2032]]  for 4 years before they got married in 2018. They had been married just  less than 2 years.   They were both avid football fans, but there was a major problem.  Krissy is a Kansas City Chiefs fan, and Marshal was a Pittsburgh  Steelers fan. That is a problem--definitely. But he fixed that by  proposing to Krissy at the Steelers-Chiefs game.   I have to tell you that for the family, for the folks who stood there  today in Tulsa as he came home, they found a way to love each other and  found a way to serve each other. And to the very end, they are still  sacrificing for the country. Because of the COVID-19 that is happening  right now, they have chosen not to have a public memorial service--in a  close time for the family--and they are delaying that time until it is  safer for all of the family and for all of the community to be able to  participate. Literally, their family continues the grief and the  weight--one more sacrifice for their country and for their community.   Today, all of Oklahoma is using a hashtag to share messages with the  family--a simple hashtag: ``#TSGT Marshal Roberts''; that is, hashtag  Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts, if you want all of the  abbreviations on it--to share a message of support and love for the  family.   Our Nation is grateful, and we grieve with you for the loss today.  Thank you to him and to his family for wearing the cloth of our country  and for doing everything our Nation asked of him to the very end. Our  Nation lives in freedom because of folks like Marshal Roberts, and we  will continue to stand with Krissy and Paityn and with their family.   With that, I yield.    Mr. President, we are in the process of passing a very  large economic package to help stabilize our economy through the middle  of all that is happening with COVID-19 globally and in the United  States. The heart of the package we are passing today is almost  identical to what we brought Sunday night, which was a bipartisan  proposal, which ranking members and chairmen of all the major  committees had worked together to get done. The key elements of it are  still there. It has unemployment insurance for Americans, including a  $600 plus-up to go through the process. There is support for small  businesses that will pay the payroll. We don't want individuals to end  up on unemployment insurance. It is better if they stay connected to  their same company. It has a unique new proposal that is built in to  say a small business can go to any bank rapidly to get a loan there,  which will convert into a grant if they maintain their current employee  numbers. That keeps people connected to their business and keeps people  assured of a job at the end of all this when it finishes out.   It has a grant program for larger businesses that is designed to say:  If you are a very large company, you are not going to get a grant; you  are going to get a loan in this process. At the moment you get a loan  and, if you don't have capital and you don't have access to it right  now because of all that is going on, you could get that.   This also has a feature built in where individuals will receive a  check for $1,200. Every adult does. That is built in to get immediate  economic support to all those folks across the country.   All of those features were already in the bill through Sunday night.  There have been some tweaks that some folks have brought up that some  of our Democratic colleagues wanted to engage in. Many of those changes  have been heard and been added, and to some we have said: Absolutely  not, it is not connected to COVID-19 at all. There are things that some  of our Democratic colleagues wanted to make sure got in. Through all  the negotiations, some of these things were changed. For instance, they  wanted to make sure that energy companies couldn't get any support. So  they fought hard to make sure there is no additional money for the  President buying additional oil to put in the strategic petroleum  reserve at this lowest price now. So it will actually cost us more  money in the future. But it was their intention to say that we don't  want oil companies to get any support in this downturn.   They also wanted to make sure there was great transparency because  they didn't trust the Trump administration. So they built in an  inspector general and additional people to watch the Treasury through  the process. They put in a neat little feature they demanded, which was  that no son or daughter or family member or any individual that works  with the Presidency, Vice Presidency, or the Congress could get any  of--not the grant programs--the loan programs. In fact, the language  they demanded was interesting: No son-in-law could get that. I wonder:  Who could that be targeted toward? A particular son-in-law that might  be there.   Literally, a lot of this fight we have had over the last 3 days is  because they were demanding that there was no way the President or any  of his family could get any kind of loan or benefit from this program  at all. We spent 3 days--3 days of delay--because they had some  additional demands for some things they wanted to do, significantly  targeted to a lot of the President and his family. I understand they  don't like the President. I get that. We want to do everything we can  to protect the workers. That is why we had all of these programs in  place already and why we had done a lot of bipartisan work to get it  done. It is done now. Let's get it going.   Our encouragement is to have the House finish this up as quickly as  possible and to get the support to the American people.   What has been interesting, though, is in the speeches that I have  heard on the floor today from my colleagues and from many individuals  in releases I have seen, folks have mentioned their prayer. They have  mentioned: With God's help, we are going to get through this. They have  mentioned the struggle we are going through as a nation and how we are  praying for each other.   It keeps reminding me of something. It is a very old psalm of ascent,  Psalm 121. When the Jews would come into Jerusalem for the different  feasts, they would sing these psalms of ascent as they came off the  eastern hills and would start rising up toward Jerusalem. The song they  would sing, I think, is pertinent for our time right now. Psalm 121  reads:       I lift up my eyes to the mountains.      Where does my help come from?    Remember that the mountains here are the capital city Jerusalem. It  is the seat of government for them and the center of worship. But it is  the seat of government for them.   They would sing:       I lift up my eyes to the mountains      Where does my help come from?      My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of Heaven and Earth.      He will not let your foot slip.      He who watches over you will not slumber.      Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor             sleep.      The Lord watches over you.      The Lord is your shade at your right hand.      The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.      The Lord will keep you from harm.      He will watch over your life.      The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and             forevermore.    It is interesting to me that the people would come in marching into  Jerusalem, the seat of government, singing the song:       I lift up my eyes to the mountains.      [But] where does my help come from?      My help comes from the Lord.    Of all the things that are going on in Washington, DC, right now, you  will hear people repeating over and over: Our hope is not in  government; our hope is not in how much money we can spend.   We understand full well, when we lift up our eyes to the mountain--to  this hill. We understand full well where our help comes from, and it is  not from all the folks in this room. Our help comes from the Lord, and  we are grateful that He neither slumbers nor sleeps.   With that, I yield the floor.
