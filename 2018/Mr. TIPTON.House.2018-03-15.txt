 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity today to be  able to advance an important piece of bipartisan legislation. The  Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act seeks to  bring fairness to the Federal financial regulators' examination appeals  process by instituting a uniform framework free from examination  retaliation.   Our community banks and credit unions currently have no independent  recourse in the appeals process of examination decisions. These  institutions often lack the experience, capacity, and resources needed  to effectively resolve challenges to Federal financial regulators'  examination determinations as each regulator has its own different  rules and standards for the appeals process.   Under the current examination appeals framework, appeals of material  supervisory determinations, which are decisions of significant  consequence that can have serious impact on the financial institution's  future, run through the agency that handed down the decision in the  first place.                                time  1330    Mr. Speaker, that is like asking an arresting police officer to also  be the judge and the jury when a case goes to trial.   Put simply, this legislation will move away from that framework and  establish an independent office of review to address appeals of serious  consequence, and harmonize and consolidate the appeals process across  the various Federal regulators so that the review process is fair and  predictable.   One banker in Colorado put it to me this way: ``The Dodd-Frank Act  has added complexity and uncertainty to the entire exam process and to  the bank's ability to serve its customers confidently and in full  compliance of regulations.''   He continues: ``For instance, overlap between the OCC and CFPB is an  ongoing issue. The OCC lost regulatory oversight with the Dodd-Frank  Act and the foundation of the CFPB, especially in the fair lending  world. When the CFPB made it clear they were not going to examine the  banks over $10 billion on fair lending the way that the OCC had  historically done it, the OCC started expanding the way that they  assessed a bank's Compliance Management Program to add questions about  fair lending, including transaction sampling and testing. It creates a  very burdensome environment as well as duplication and the risk of  double jeopardy.''   Mr. Speaker, an examination environment that runs the risk of  duplication and double jeopardy between agencies isn't tenable and puts  our community institutions at risk of being examined into extinction.   This environment is further complicated by the reality that,  currently, institutions that want to appeal double jeopardy examination  results would have to appeal through two regulators who likely aren't  communicating with one another about the other's exam determinations.   The Examination Fairness bill before the House today would solve this  problem by establishing an Office of Independent Examination Review,  which would function as a consolidated, sober judge of the examination  appeals process. This newly created office under the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council would provide a community bank or  credit union an avenue  [[Page H1628]]  for independent recourse to appeal a material supervisory determination  where fairness, transparency, and timeliness are paramount. Because  this new review process only applies to material supervisory  determinations, the new process is limited in scope and reserved only  for the most serious appeals.   This legislation is also careful not to constrain the power of the  regulators to pursue enforcement actions or to prevent them from  issuing a further material supervisory determination. In fact,  enforcement actions resulting from a determination would continue to be  enforced under this new appeals process until the independent office  either agrees with the finding of the regulator or overturns a  determination of the regulator.   Mr. Speaker, by creating consistency; instituting timeline  expectations of examinations and appeals; increasing transparency; and  adding independent, sober review of appeals to the rights of the  financial institutions, H.R. 4545 will go a long way to usher in a new  environment of fairness in the examination appeals process for small  banks and credit unions. Giving these institutions independent recourse  in the appeals process will create greater certainty that they won't  have to reduce their financial service product offerings because of an  unfair or untimely review.   Mr. Speaker, that translates to greater assurances for communities  across the country that their small banks and credit unions will be  able to provide a mortgage for their home, a loan for their car, and  capital for their small businesses to be able to grow.   This measure passed out of the Financial Services Committee with  strong bipartisan support, with a majority of our Democrat colleagues  joining with us to be able to support exam fairness. I would like to  thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), for her  support of this measure's consideration here today.
