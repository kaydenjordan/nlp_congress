 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 2022 Football  Championship Subdivision national champions, the North Dakota State  University Bison.   This past weekend, North Dakotans once again filled Toyota Stadium in  Frisco, TX, where the NDSU Bison seized their 17th NCAA championship,  earning victory over the Montana State University Bobcats by a score of  38 to 10.   I had the opportunity to join Bison Nation in Frisco to cheer on the  team, and, as always, the fans created an overwhelming atmosphere of  support and team spirit.   At the same time, the Bobcats should come away from the game with  pride, having capped off a successful season. The Bison have now won 9  of the past 11 FCS championships--an achievement that goes unmatched in  modern collegiate football history.   Further, this victory followed a strong season for the Bison, where  they had a 14-win and 1-loss record--a continuation of a decades' worth  of excellence and skill. Since 2011, the NDSU Bison have had 149 wins  to only 12 losses, which includes a streak of 39 consecutive wins. Such  a record stands as a testament to the hard work and dedication of the  players and staff, including Head Coach Matt Entz.   Accordingly, I am joining with my colleague Senator Cramer to  introduce a resolution honoring the NDSU Bison's achievements. We  congratulate all of the players, coaches, and university leadership,  including Athletic Director Matt Larsen, NDSU President Dean Bresciani,  and others, on building this tremendously successful program. We  recognize the important support of Bison Nation, which helps drive this  team to victory year after year.   The NDSU Bison are the pride of North Dakota. Their accomplishments,  character, and work ethic represent the very best of our State. We say  congratulations again to the national champions, and, as always, we  say: Go Bison.   I ask unanimous consent to have the resolution printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 Resolution         Congratulating the North Dakota State University Bison       football team for winning the 2022 National Collegiate       Athletic Association Division I Football Championship       Subdivision title.        Whereas, the North Dakota State University (referred to in       this preamble as ``NDSU'') Bison football team won the 2022       National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this       preamble as the ``NCAA'') Division I Football Championship       Subdivision (referred to in this preamble as the ``FCS'')       title game 1n Frisco, TX, on January 8, 2022, in a well-      fought victory over the Montana State University Bobcats by a       score of 38 to 10;        Whereas, including the 2022 NCAA Division I FCS title, the       NDSU Bison football team has won 17 national football       championships;        Whereas, the NDSU Bison football team has won 9 of the last       11 NCAA Division I FCS titles, an achievement that continues       to be unmatched in modern collegiate football history;        Whereas, the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous       resilience and skill since 2011, with 149 wins to only 12       losses, including a streak of 39 consecutive wins;        Whereas, head coach Matt Entz and his staff led the NDSU       Bison football team to a dominant season and a second       championship in his 3 years as head coach at NDSU, continuing       the NDSU Bison football program's culture of excellence;        Whereas, thousands of Bison fans once again attended the       championship game in Frisco, TX, reflecting the tremendous       pride and dedication of Bison Nation, which has supported and       helped drive the achievement of the NDSU Bison football team;       and        Whereas, the 2022 NCAA Division I FCS title was a victory       for both the NDSU Bison football team and the entire State of       North Dakota: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) congratulates the North Dakota State University Bison       football team for winning the 2022 National Collegiate       Athletic Association Division I FCS title;        (2) commends the players, coaches, and staff of the North       Dakota State University Bison football team for--        (A) their tireless work and dedication; and        (B) fostering a continued tradition of excellence;        (3) congratulates North Dakota State University President       Dean Bresciani, North Dakota State University Athletic       Director Matt Larsen, and all the faculty and staff of North       Dakota State University for creating an environment that       emphasizes excellence in both academics and athletics; and        (4) recognizes the students, alumni, fans, and all of Bison       Nation for supporting the North Dakota State University Bison       football team so well during its successful quest to bring       home yet another NCAA Division I FCS trophy for North Dakota       State University.     Mr. President, before I turn to my colleague Senator  Cramer, I want to mention that I was at the national championship game.  It was just fantastic.   As I say, Bison Nation, which is all our Bison fans from North Dakota  and across the country, and the coaches, the staff, President  Bresciani, and, of course, these great student athletes who had such a  wonderful game--it was a great show. They turned out in force in  Frisco, TX. We are starting to call Frisco Fargo South, which is  actually the name of one of the high schools up in Fargo, which is kind  of fun. But our fans travelled down there so well, filled the stadium,  and they did once again. It was just a wonderful atmosphere. It was on  national television, so they performed on a national stage, and people  from across the country got to watch a wonderful game.   But leading up to that game, in the semifinals, they played James  Madison University, which has a tremendous football program as well.  That was on a Friday night, and it was the Friday night where we were  last here several weeks ago voting until about 2 o'clock in the  morning.   The reason I bring up the story is because we must have had--you were  there, Mr. President--we must have had like north of 20 votes at least.  So we started early in the evening and went until 2 in the morning or  thereabouts.   But the semifinal game between the North Dakota State University  Bison and the James Madison Dukes was on television that Friday  evening, so between votes, we were going into the cloakroom, and we had  it on television there. So between votes, all the Senators--at least in  the Republican cloakroom--we had it on, and we were watching the game.   It was a lot of fun and helped, you know, with the long evening, but  it really demonstrated how this program has done so much in terms of  for the State and NDSU and really providing an awareness nationwide of  these great student athletes we have, because all of our colleagues got  to see them, and they commented on not just the caliber of the football  that our team played--it was a hard-fought game. James Madison has a  wonderful program as well; again, really just a class operation. So the  Bison won in a hard-fought game.   But the other thing that was fun--we have a dome. We call it the  Bison Dome. Go figure. And remember that Bison is B-I-S-O-N, but it is  a Z, not an S, when you say it properly. But they showed all the fans  having fun and the noise in the dome, which makes it so hard to come up  and play North Dakota State on our home field in our dome. Everybody,  of course, is dressed in green and gold. But what an incredible sports  atmosphere.   For anyone who likes collegiate athletics, this is one of the most  iconic, greatest venues in the country. Again, it is Bison Nation. It  is the fans. It is everybody--the coaching staff, President Bresciani,  his whole team, the staff and faculty, and, of course, most of all, the  student athletes.   I know the Presiding Officer, coming from Michigan, knows what great  sports teams are all about.   Their commitment, their hard work, their passion, their support of  Bison Nation--all these things just make it a joyous and wonderful  thing.   I can't say enough about these young people, the commitment they made  and the hard work that they do. Many of them may actually end up in the  professional ranks. So they are playing at an extremely high level.  They are just wonderful young people, and I can't say enough great  things about them.   Once again, now 9 out of the last 11 years, national champs--again,  congratulations and go, Bison.   With that, I would like to turn to my colleague Senator Cramer.  [[Page S148]]     Mr. President, I thank Senator Cramer for his comments  and wonderful commentary on these great student athletes, but there is  one other point I want to make that goes to the excellence of this  program.   In the last national championship they won, the quarterback was a  wonderful player by the name of Trey Lance. He played for 1 year as a  redshirt freshman. So he easily could have been playing this year,  which would have been probably his sophomore or, maybe, junior year. It  is a little hard to say with the COVID spring season, but I think it  would have been his sophomore year.   The reason he wasn't able to quarterback the team is that he was  quarterbacking the San Francisco 49ers to a win in the NFL. So they  bring in another redshirt freshman quarterback who platoons with some  other players, who is another wonderful quarterback, Cam Miller. So  they win it with another player.   Again, it just shows, even as they lose some of these players-- sometimes in the transfer portal and sometimes to the NFL, as Senator  Cramer said--they keep bringing in just excellent athletes, and he  mentioned a number of them. It is not just that they are excellent  athletes; they are student athletes. Again, that goes to the quality  and the character of the program.   So we commend all of them--Senator Cramer, thanks for joining me--and  also with Kelly Armstrong in the House in recognizing a wonderful group  that truly deserves it--all the Bison nation.   Anything else from Senator Cramer? All right.   I yield the floor.
