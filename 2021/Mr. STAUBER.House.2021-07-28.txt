 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Nancy Norr for the  incredible work she has done on behalf of northern Minnesota, and to  congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement.   In addition to the 30-plus years that Nancy has spent at Minnesota  Power, she has taken leadership roles in a variety of organizations  throughout the Northland.   Most notably, Nancy led Jobs for Minnesotans, a group that advocates  [[Page H4095]]  for job creation and investment in our State.   In Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, we have rich deposits  of critical minerals, along with other great projects, like the Line 3  Replacement Project.   Nancy has long understood what these opportunities could mean for our  region and spearheaded this locally-driven movement to fight for good- paying mining and energy jobs. Through her exceptional work and  advocacy, Nancy has helped to make great progress in our local  communities.   Since arriving in Congress, it has been my pleasure to work alongside  Nancy to unleash the economic engine in Minnesota's Eighth  Congressional District.   She has served as an incredible resource to me, and while I will miss  her expertise and leadership, I wish her nothing but the best in this  next chapter of her life.                            ____________________
