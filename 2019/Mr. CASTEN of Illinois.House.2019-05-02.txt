 Mr. Speaker, I rise to praise this body for  passing H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, of which I am a proud  cosponsor.   Climate change is the greatest existential threat to our species. It  is also an unequivocal economic opportunity. Replacing the need to  extract and burn fossil fuels with renewable and clean energy saves  money.   This White House is failing to seize this domestic opportunity while  simultaneously walking away from our international partners and  competitors that are committed to this challenge.   Of all the misguided decisions of this administration, few have been  as reckless as announcing our withdrawal from the Paris climate  agreement. It is environmentally foolish; it is economically naive; and  it cedes leadership to China and others on the defining challenge of  our time. That is foolhardy.   H.R. 9 is a reclamation of that mantle. It is a demonstration that  Americans are determined to lead, even if the White House is refusing  to do so.   I am proud to be a part of this effort, not because it is enough, but  because it is the kind of leadership into the breach that has long  defined true American greatness.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 50 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, May 3, 2019, at 2:30 p.m.                            ____________________
