 Mr. Speaker, I thank Delegate Norton for her leadership,  and I thank Ranking Member Comer for his leadership on the bill and, of  course, Representative Mace, who has been a colleague and helped craft  this.   Everyone recognizes that our country faces cyberattacks. In the  private sector, we don't silo cybersecurity officials. You don't say,  ``You just work in one department.'' They rotate through a company. We  shouldn't have separate silos in the Federal Government.   This bill is just common sense. It says that we need to have a  rotational system in the Federal Government so that you can have  expertise from all the different agencies, and we can have a  comprehensive response. It helps us get talent. And it is bipartisan.   We should give credit to the previous administration for having, as  was pointed out, the executive order. I worked with Matt Lira at the  previous White House. There is nothing that is partisan about making  sure that America isn't attacked with cybercrimes and cyberattacks.  That is a bipartisan initiative, and this does build on the work they  did. It makes it stronger, and we put, ultimately, resources toward it.   But I am proud of the work. I am proud of working with Representative  Mace on it. Frankly, I think we ought to be doing more things in this  body in a bipartisan way that strengthen American security.
