 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical  Education Caucus, I rise to recognize National Apprenticeship Week.   In recent years, we have heard too often about the tremendous skills  gap that we have in our country, where too many jobs at companies in  our districts go unfilled because workers don't have the skills to do  those jobs that are available. Well, apprenticeships provide valuable  on-the-job training for students of all ages. By combining practical  and theoretical instruction, they allow students to earn while they  learn, preparing them for high-skilled, high-paying jobs.   I have seen the promise of these programs back home. In Rhode Island,  Electric Boat has partnered with the Community College of Rhode Island  to offer an apprenticeship program at Quonset Point in maritime pipe  and structural trades. Apprentices will finish the program with a  certificate and an associate's degree, ready for rewarding careers in  high-demand industries.   Apprenticeships offer affordable education for students, powerful  productivity enhancements for businesses, and big economic returns for  our communities. As the number of skilled job openings continues to  grow and the workforce continues to age, apprenticeship programs will  become even more critical.                            ____________________
