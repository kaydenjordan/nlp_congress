 Mr. Speaker, since 1960, Congress has raised and extended  the debt limit 78 times over a 63-year period.   Let's put this in perspective: 49 times under Republican  administrations, 29 times under Democratic Presidents. Sixty-three  years we have raised the debt ceiling 78 times.   We are one of only two democratic nations with a statutory debt  ceiling and the only one, because of the magnificent extent of our  country, the U.S. dollar being the common currency of the world that  can threaten a global economic crisis--think about that--by playing  around with the debt ceiling.   The debt ceiling has no impact on government spending. Why? Because  it only commences to pay the bills that we have already committed  ourselves to. Both Republicans and Democrats have passed legislation  that has created debt, that requires us to pay Social Security, that  requires us to pay other mandatory programs in which there has been  bipartisan support for.   Instead, this debt ceiling restricts the Treasury, if, in fact, we do  not lift the debt ceiling, from paying those bills. That is why for  over 63 years, 78 times, the Congress has chosen to raise the debt  ceiling. Why? Because we don't want to put the liability of the world's  economy, let alone the U.S. economy, at risk.   We don't want to be deadbeats, right? I think most Americans feel  they  [[Page H516]]  ought to pay their bills. My colleagues on the other side want to hold  the debt ceiling hostage, leaving Social Security recipients and  veterans potentially without their pensions or benefits.   Does that make any sense? If we default on our debt, over 6 million  jobs could be diminished. Seniors may not get their benefits for a  period of time. Costs will skyrocket. Some economists indicate we could  put $12 trillion of American savings at risk if it were extended in  this gamesmanship, this attempt to stare each other down, on whether or  not we lift the debt ceiling.   That makes no sense. That is risky business. We ought to raise our  debt ceiling and pay our bills, and I think there is common agreement  that we ought to get our debt under control.   As a Blue Dog, our focus and purpose of being is in the area of  fiscal responsibility. As a matter of fact, the last American President  that balanced the budget was President Bill Clinton. That was a while  ago.   I think that there is common bipartisan agreement to focus on waste,  on fraud, and abuse. I mean, those are the buzzwords, right? If we  could only focus on waste, fraud, and abuse. But no one wants to  highlight, well, how will that impact Social Security? How will that  impact other mandatory spending that we have all committed to on a  bipartisan basis?   The way to do this is for Republicans and Democrats to come together,  separate from raising the debt ceiling, and agree to focus on two  things that cause debt--expenditures and revenues.   If we can get an agreement on what we think the Nation's  responsibility to be on our priorities for expenditures and the  necessary revenues to pay for them, then, only then, would we get our  deficit under control, which is what, by the way, President Bill  Clinton was able to do a while ago on a bipartisan basis.   So let's get real. Let's not hold the American people hostage, our  economy, or the global economy as we play fast and loose with this talk  and notion of whether or not to lift the debt ceiling. We must lift the  debt ceiling because it is the responsible thing to do.   I ask my colleagues on the other side: Let's come together, let's  work on fiscal responsibility in a bipartisan fashion because we  should. It is obviously an important, critical issue as we move  forward. Let's not play fast and loose with whether or not we are going  to be deadbeats and whether or not we are going to pay our bills. That  is putting the American economy at risk. It is something we should not  do.                            ____________________
