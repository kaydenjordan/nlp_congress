 Mr. Speaker, across the country, communities are  struggling with an epidemic of opioid addiction, abuse, and overdose;  and across party lines, we all agree something must be done to address  this crisis.   But the repeal-and-replace plan proposed by my Republican colleagues  adds fuel to the fire. The bill eliminates the Affordable Care Act's  requirement that Medicaid cover basic mental health and addiction  services.   Economists estimate 1.3 million Americans receive treatment for  substance abuse and other mental health disorders through the Medicaid  extension.   Across the States that have expanded Medicaid, like Illinois, the  program is used for 27 percent of all addiction treatment.   We are not going to arrest our way out of this epidemic; instead, we  need to treat addiction like the disease that it is. Removing the  mental health coverage requirement pulls the rug out from more than a  quarter of all those seeking help from opioid addiction.   Mr. Speaker, opioids now kill more Americans than car accidents. The  Affordable Care Act offers hope and is saving lives. The Republican  efforts to repeal the ACA is a bleak step backwards. I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote against this legislation.                            ____________________
