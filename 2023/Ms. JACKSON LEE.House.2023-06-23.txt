 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak against H.R. 3564, a  harmful bill which seeks to cancel recent changes made by the Federal  Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to the single-family mortgages'  framework.   First, I'd like to applaud the FHFA for their bold and courageous  actions that aim to ensure equity and fairness in the mortgage pricing  framework.   The title of H.R. 3564 contradicts its content, because in reality,  it makes mortgages more expensive for many middle-class American  families.  [[Page H3120]]    Escalating housing prices in recent years have put many families and  hardworking Americans out of the bid for homeownership.   The median U.S. home sales price stands at about $455,800 dollars as  of the first quarter of 2023 representing a whopping 32 percent  increase from 2020, just two years ago.   In the last 2 to 3 years however, the average American has neither  become 32 percent richer nor gained wage increase of 32 percent.   Increasing amounts of homes owned by private equity and Wall Street  firms, accompanied by high inflation and rising demand have contributed  to these price increases.   Rising rents make it even more difficult for first-time home buyers  to save for a down payment.   At an average cost of $455,800 for a home, middle-income American  families would need to save roughly $87,500 dollars, an amount which  most families simply do not have.   Rather than rescinding their bold and courageous action, we should  rather applaud and commend the FHFA in its rightful steps toward making  mortgages more affordable for first-time homeowners and many  creditworthy borrowers who simply cannot afford a 20 percent down  payment.   The eliminated loan level price adjustment fees would actually help  these borrowers to save for their monthly mortgage payments.   The upward adjustments in vacation home and investment property  mortgages also help to ensure balance, equity, and fairness in the  federal housing finance and pricing framework.   The FHFA's actions are in the right direction and help to ensure a  more equitable mortgage pricing framework that prioritizes middle class  home buyers over investors and second-home owners.   H.R. 3564 is an attempt to rescind the FHFA's more equitable pricing  framework and instead require increased fees for many first-time home  buyers and those who do not have a 20 percent down payment.   H.R. 3564 will raise the cost of homeownership and make it more  expensive for first-time homebuyers and borrowers of color seeking  conventional loan.   The FHFA's actions are a step toward remedying this inequity and  achieving fairness and equal opportunity.   It is not Congress' job to set mortgage pricing fees for loans  purchased by the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs).   This is the role of the government regulator, the Federal Housing  Finance Agency.    Mr. Speaker, as we move toward the Fourth of July,  after celebrating and commemorating Juneteenth, I want to talk a bit  about freedom.   I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my legislation, the  STOP Fentanyl Now Act, to prevent the rise in the criminal selling of  fentanyl and the death that comes to our children and to stop the  online sales. Join me in stating to America that we will not give up on  the fight against eliminating fentanyl in our streets and in our homes.   Then, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to take note that a Member  stood on the floor and utilized the Constitution about impeaching the  President of the United States, Joe Biden. There is no basis in this  Constitution for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Isn't it interesting that border crossings are down, but because they  disagree with immigration policies that they have helped contribute to,  they want to impeach him?   Finally, happy Pride Month and happy understanding that we all are  created equal. The LGBTQ+ community stands tall as Americans in this  Nation. Happy Pride.                            ____________________
