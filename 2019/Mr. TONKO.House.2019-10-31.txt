 Madam Speaker, this month marked the painful anniversary  of one fateful afternoon in Schoharie, New York, when 20 precious souls  were lost in the preventable crash of a limousine that should never  have been allowed on the road.   The families of those lost--many from my hometown of Amsterdam, New  York--the families of eight young people devastated by the Cutchogue  crash on Long Island in 2015, and countless others touched by these  preventable tragedies have raised their voices to demand action.   Last week we introduced bipartisan legislation that answers their  call. It is important, I believe, to respond to that call and to that  request. The SAFE Limos Act, the Take Unsafe Limos Off the Road Act,  and the End the Limo Loophole Act have responded to them with great  sensitivity.   I thank my friend, Antonio Delgado, for joining me in sponsoring this  lifesaving legislation, and I thank our colleagues on both sides of the  aisle who have signed on in support. These commonsense measures will  save lives and ensure that this never happens to another family.   Madam Speaker, I urge this body to raise our Nation's limousine  safety standards without delay.                            ____________________
