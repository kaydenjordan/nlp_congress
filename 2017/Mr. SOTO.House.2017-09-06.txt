 Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Juan, who obtained a  master's degree from our Florida State University and works in digital  advocacy.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase funding for the  Small Starts program by $48 million. This is the amount that SunRail, a  constituent passenger train system in my district, would need to begin  phase 3 of construction. Phase 3 would connect the commuter rail system  to the Orlando International Airport.   Currently, the Orlando Intermodal Terminal is under construction at  the airport that would connect two transportation systems, both  Brightline and SunRail, which were only really divided by a few miles,  and Federal funding will eventually be key to connect this intermodal  system and SunRail.   Central Florida needs to be more mobile, and I urge in the future  that we look as we go forward with phase 3, and stand ready to help.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and I withdraw my  amendment.
