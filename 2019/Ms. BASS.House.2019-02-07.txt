 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 450) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide an  additional tool to prevent certain frauds against veterans, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 450         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Crimes Against       Veterans Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL TOOL TO PREVENT CERTAIN FRAUDS AGAINST                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 1352. Fraud regarding veterans' benefits         ``(a) Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute,       any scheme or artifice to defraud an individual of veterans'       benefits, or in connection with obtaining veteran's benefits       for that individual, shall be fined under this title,       imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.        ``(b) In this section--        ``(1) the term `veteran' has the meaning given that term in       section 101 of title 38; and        ``(2) the term `veterans' benefits' means any benefit       provided by Federal law for a veteran or a dependent or       survivor of a veteran.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following new item:  ``1352. Fraud regarding veterans' benefits.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 450, the Preventing Crimes  Against Veterans Act of 2019, as amended, which would make it a crime  to knowingly engage in any scheme to defraud a veteran of his or her  veterans benefits.   This legislation provides an important, additional tool for Federal  prosecutors to use to combat veterans benefits fraud.   Because we honor their service and because of the sacrifices our  veterans have made for us, it is particularly important that we protect  them from fraud and ensure the integrity of the system of benefits we  provide for them.   Currently, there are about 21 million veterans of the U.S. military,  men and women who selfishly serve our Nation. Unfortunately, many of  our veterans, as a result of their service, have been scarred, whether  physically, mentally, or both. Often, it is the scars that we cannot  visually see that are the hardest to address.   There are well over 1 million American veterans with service- connected disabilities.   The suicide rate among veterans is 300 percent above the national  average, and it is estimated that about 30 percent of all Vietnam  veterans and 20 percent of veterans of the recent Middle East conflicts  suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder in a given year.   In addition, veterans are more likely than nonveterans to become  homeless. They comprise 17 percent of our homeless population. On any  given night, an estimated 50,000 veterans are sleeping on American  streets. That is just not right.  [[Page H1407]]    In recognition of the extreme sacrifice by our veterans and the  hardships many of them continue to face after their military service,  it is our duty to provide, to the best of our ability, an appropriate  measure of compensation for them, particularly those in need.   This is the least we can do, and it is still not enough. There  continue to be issues with the medical care we provide our veterans and  problems about some benefits never being processed and paid because of  the loss of claims by the Veterans Benefits Administration.   That is why we must prohibit any schemes that would defraud a veteran  of their benefits. Under H.R. 450, anyone convicted of such crime could  be fined, imprisoned, or subject to both penalties.   This bill is important because it fills in a gap in enforcement for  the protection of veterans. Under current law, the VA allows agents or  attorneys to assess a nominal fee to assist claimants who are appealing  different aspects of their benefits.   It is illegal for a nonattorney or a person not registered as an  agent to assist such claimants. However, if an unauthorized individual  offers a veteran assistance in person, they cannot be prosecuted under  current Federal law. The wire fraud statutes do not extend to such in- person contact.   Because of this, fraudsters routinely take advantage of this  loophole. I am aware of at least one specific instance in which a bad  actor visited an assisted living facility in Florida and asked the  staff to round up all veterans for a seminar. He could not be  prosecuted under the law as it stands today. This is unconscionable. We  need this bill, because the example I just gave is not an isolated  incident.   More broadly, those who defraud veterans or their surviving spouses  or dependents endanger our system of veterans benefits not only by  harming the victims, but also by diminishing resources required to pay  the claims and fund the programs that are needed to help those who have  served our country.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the bill's sponsors, Mr. Deutch and Mr.  Meadows, for their hard work and bipartisan efforts to address this  critical problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, we should do everything we can to protect our  veterans who have given so much of themselves to our Nation.   Our veterans have laid their lives on the line. We owe them much, and  we should repay our gratitude whenever we can. Certainly, helping to  ensure that their veterans benefits are protected against fraud, as  H.R. 450 would do, is one way of expressing our appreciation, and it is  the right and the just thing to do. For these reasons, I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 507) to direct the Attorney General to study issues relating to  human trafficking, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 507         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Put Trafficking Victims       First Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. TRAINING FOR PROSECUTIONS OF TRAFFICKERS AND SUPPORT                     FOR STATE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.         It is the sense of Congress that a portion of the funds       available for training and technical assistance under section       107(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence       Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7105(b)(2)(B)(ii)) should       be devoted to advancing the following goals:        (1) Increasing the personal safety of victim service       providers, who may face intimidation or retaliation for their       activities.        (2) Promoting a trauma-informed, evidence-based, and       victim-centered approach to the provision of services for       victims of trafficking.        (3) Ensuring that law enforcement officers and prosecutors       make every attempt to determine whether an individual is a       victim of human trafficking before arresting the individual       for, or charging the individual with, an offense that is a       direct result of the victimization of the individual.        (4) Effectively prosecuting traffickers and individuals who       patronize or solicit children for sex, and facilitating       access for child victims of commercial sex trafficking to the       services and protections afforded to other victims of sexual       violence.        (5) Encouraging States to improve efforts to identify and       meet the needs of human trafficking victims, including       through internet outreach and other methods that are       responsive to the needs of victims in their communities.        (6) Ensure victims of trafficking, including United States       citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals       are eligible for services.       SEC. 3. WORKING TO DEVELOP METHODOLOGIES TO ASSESS PREVALENCE                     OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.         (a) Working Group.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation       with other Federal entities engaged in efforts to combat       human trafficking, shall establish an expert working group,       which shall include survivors of human trafficking, experts       on sex and labor trafficking, representatives from       organizations collecting data on human trafficking, and law       enforcement officers. The working group shall, utilizing, to       the extent practicable, existing efforts of agencies, task       forces, States, localities, tribes, research institutions,       and organizations--        (A) identify barriers to the collection of data on the       incidence of sex and labor trafficking; and        (B) recommend practices to promote better data collection       and analysis.        (2) Pilot testing.--Not later than 3 years after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall       implement a pilot project to test promising methodologies       studied under paragraph (1).        (b) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation       with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and       Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the       Director of the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, shall       submit to Congress a report on--        (A) Federal efforts to estimate the prevalence of human       trafficking at the national and regional levels;        (B) the effectiveness of current policies and procedures to       address the needs of victims of trafficking; and        (C) an analysis of demographic characteristics of victims       of trafficking in different regions of the United States and       recommendations for how to address the unique vulnerabilities       of different victims.        (2) Input from relevant parties.--In developing the report       under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall seek input       from the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking,       victims of trafficking, human trafficking survivor advocates,       service providers for victims of sex and labor trafficking,       and the President's Interagency Task Force on Human       Trafficking.        (c) Survey.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, in coordination       with Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments, and       private organizations, including victim service providers and       expert researchers, shall develop and execute a survey of       survivors seeking and receiving victim assistance services       for the purpose of improving the provision of services to       human trafficking victims and victim identification in the       United States. Survey results shall be made publicly       available on the website of the Department of Justice.        (d) No Additional Funds.--No additional funds are       authorized to carry out this section.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON PROSECUTORS SEEKING RESTITUTION IN                     TRAFFICKING CASES.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Attorney General, in consultation with the       Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall       submit to Congress a report on efforts to increase       restitution to victims of human trafficking.       SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ENCOURAGING STATES TO ADOPT                     PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.         Congress recognizes and applauds the State legislative       bodies that have taken tremendous steps to adopt protections       and services for victims of trafficking. Congress encourages       States to--        (1) uphold the dignity of human trafficking survivors;        (2) ensure the safety, confidentiality, and well-being of       victims of trafficking, while recognizing symptoms of trauma       and coping mechanisms that may impact victims' interactions       with law enforcement, the justice system, and service       providers;        (3) implement screening mechanisms to identify and extend       appropriate services to children in the custody of child       protective services agencies, the juvenile justice system, or       the criminal justice system who are victims of trafficking;        (4) promote greater access to child welfare services for,       rather than criminalization of, child victims of sex       trafficking;        (5) develop a 24-hour emergency response plan by which       victims of human trafficking may receive immediate       protection, shelter, and support from a victim assistance       coordinator when those victims are first identified;        (6) adopt protections for adult victims of trafficking,       such as protection if the victim's safety is at risk,       comprehensive trauma-informed, long-term, culturally       competent care and healing services, mental health services       to relieve traumatic stress, housing, education (including,       where appropriate, vocational training and employment       assistance), mentoring, language assistance, drug and       substance abuse services, and legal services;        (7) ensure that child sex trafficking victims are treated       as children in need of child protective services and receive       appropriate care in the child welfare, rather than juvenile       justice, system;        (8) encourage the adoption of procedures for human       trafficking victims that are consistent with those afforded       to victims of sexual assault, rape, child sexual abuse, or       incest to allow human trafficking victim to clear records,       expunge convictions, and vacate adjudications related to       prostitution and nonviolent offenses that arose as a direct       result of being trafficked, including protections for foreign       nationals who are being removed and those who are losing or       determined to be inadmissible for immigration benefits as a       result of the aforementioned human trafficking victim related       conviction or arrest; and        (9) ensure victims of trafficking, including United States       citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals       are eligible for services.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H1410]]    Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 507, the Put Trafficking Victims First  Act, with my colleague, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).   I thank Mrs. Wagner for her hard work over the years on this  important legislation. We are here today because of her dedication and  willingness to work in a bipartisan manner to address the problems  faced by victims of trafficking. We both recognize that Congress must  do more to combat this heinous crime.   H.R. 507 is designed to ensure that survivors of human trafficking do  not go unnoticed. First, it expresses the sense of Congress that law  enforcement set aside a portion of the funds they receive for combating  human trafficking to ensure that victims receive support that is trauma  informed and victim centered. This will provide victims with a better  chance of recovering from their experiences.   Second, this legislation addresses the tremendous need for expanded  victim services, improved data gathering on the prevalence and trends  in human trafficking, and effective mechanisms to identify and work  with victims in an effective and respectful manner.   It directs the Attorney General to form a broadly representative  working group to assess the status of the collection of data on human  trafficking and recommend best practices, conduct a survey of providers  regarding the provision of services to them, as well as prepare a  report to Congress on Federal efforts to estimate the prevalence of  human trafficking, the effectiveness of current policies addressing  victims' needs, and analyzing the demographic characteristics of  trafficking victims, and recommendations on how to address their unique  vulnerabilities.   The bill also directs the Attorney General to implement a pilot  project testing the methodologies identified by the working group and  requires the Attorney General to report on efforts to increase  restitution to victims of human trafficking.   With this type of information in hand, Congress can provide  appropriate oversight of efforts to combat human trafficking; and  researchers, advocates, and law enforcement agencies will all have a  shared resource as they continue to develop innovative approaches to  stop traffickers.   Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that States should  implement trauma-informed, victim-centered care for all trafficking  victims.   Forced labor and human trafficking are among the world's fastest  growing enterprises. Globally, these inhumane practices generate an  estimated $150 billion a year in profit. That is three times the amount  that the top Fortune 500 companies made in 2016.   Criminals are profiting from the systematic abuse of vulnerable  people around the globe. Sadly, women and girls represent approximately  71 percent of these victims.   The U.S. State Department estimates that between 14,000 and 17,000  people are trafficked into our country from other nations every year.  These victims are part of the estimated hundreds of thousands of  victims of trafficking currently living within our communities.   My home State of California has the ninth largest economy in the  world. It is also one of the Nation's top four destinations for human  traffickers, especially for child sex trafficking.   In 2018, of the 5,000 reports to the National Human Trafficking  Hotline, 760 of them were from California. As the founder of the  Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I am very aware of the risks to  vulnerable youth. Foster youth, along with runaways and homeless youth,  are at the highest risk of being sex-trafficked.   Experts agree that the foster care system is yielding a  disproportionate number of human trafficking victims. Nearly 60 percent  of all child sex trafficking victims have histories in the child  welfare system. We cannot allow this to continue.   Washington, D.C., is home to the most powerful government in the  world, yet even in D.C., women and girls are being trafficked.   Organizations like Courtney's House are working to improve the  outcome of trafficking survivors.   H.R. 507 will improve the implementation of the Justice for Victims  of Trafficking Act of 2015.   Trafficking victims face many challenges, even after they are freed  from trafficking rings, ranging from access to social services and  utilizing assistance programs. Survivors face difficulties navigating  social services and assistance programs.   A component of H.R. 507 encourages law enforcement and prosecuting  agencies to make every attempt to determine whether an individual has  been a victim of human trafficking before charging them with offenses  that are the result of their victimization. This is of particular  concern to communities of color.   Mr. Speaker, Congress' intent is clear. Protecting victims from the  heinous crime of human trafficking is of the utmost concern. I am proud  to have worked across the aisle with Congresswoman Wagner on this  important legislation, and I urge our colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas, (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Organizations like Courtney's House are working to improve the  outcomes for sex trafficking survivors. Tina Frundt, the director of  Courtney's House right here in D.C., asserts that African American and  Latino communities are not immune to human trafficking. Her  organization provides trauma-informed services to sex trafficking  survivors between the ages of 12 and 19.   Tina is also a child sex trafficking survivor. As a 9-year-old girl  in foster care, she was sex trafficked. By the time Tina was 14, she  became one of 2 million children who run away from home each year.  Nearly 200,000 of them will be sex trafficked.   In Tina's case, her adult abuser was more than twice her age, and  forced her to become a child sex worker. It took her years to escape.  Now Tina helps children like her recent client, a 12-year-old girl  whose 25-year-old abuser called himself her boyfriend rather than her  trafficker.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 507 supports efforts to stop human trafficking. We  are making progress in protecting those who have been caught up in this  horrific criminal activity, and this bill is a great example of what we  can accomplish when we focus on helping the most vulnerable among us.   We have an obligation not only to end human trafficking, but to  support people who undergo horrific experiences like these. This bill  is yet another step in the right direction.   Once again, I would like to thank Congresswoman Wagner and  Congresswoman Jackson Lee for all of their efforts in this regard. I  was very pleased to team up with Congresswoman Wagner again on this  legislation, and hope that we can continue to work on these issues in  the future.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
