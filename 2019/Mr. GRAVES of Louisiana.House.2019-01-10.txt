 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the career of  Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley.   Sheriff Wiley joined the Marine Corps in 1970. He became a sheriff's  deputy in 1974. He served in patrol, then detective, and then went on  to the school board, where he served as director of student services  from 1980 to 1988.   He came back to the sheriff's office and ultimately was elected  sheriff in 1996, reelected for five terms. His career, perhaps, is  marked best by some of the recognition: the recognition of Outstanding  Man of Gonzales, the Outstanding Educator, the Louisiana Justice Hall  of Fame, and the president of Louisiana Sheriffs' Association.  [[Page H373]]    He also spent much time creating programs for kids: the Junior Deputy  Program, substance abuse programs, D.A.R.E. program, and a narcotics  unit.   But perhaps his most important accomplishment is evolving this rural  sheriff's office to a modern law enforcement agency in one of the  fastest growing parishes in the State of Louisiana.   With five decades of service, he has maintained the immaturity of a  teenager. I am proud to call him a friend. I want to honor his service  to our State and our Nation, and I commend his daughters, Sara and  Erin, and recognize the 40 years of marriage to his wife, Linda.                            ____________________
