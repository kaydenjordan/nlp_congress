 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chair, the reality is that Ukraine needs these munitions. Until  the West can meet the full demands of the war in Ukraine, these  munitions will fill the gaps and ensure a successful Ukrainian  counteroffensive and ensure that the Ukrainians are not defenseless.   The goal is to give Ukraine the tools it needs to end this war  quickly. A protracted war will cost more lives and allow Putin to  commit more war crimes.   Mr. Chair, I was in Bucha and stood where some of these crimes were  committed. Ultimately, this amendment was not introduced out of concern  for civilians. No. This amendment exists because a very few Members  across the aisle don't seem to mind if the Russians win, and then we  would see democracy fall and authoritarianism rise.   To ensure a Ukrainian victory, we must continue to make these very  tough decisions that will end this war and ultimately save lives.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Chair, we hear a lot about humanity here. Let's put  the facts in front of that. The Ukrainians are firing as many artillery  shells in 2 days as we produce in a month. They will run out. They will  be defenseless.   If you are now suddenly worried about civilians, Mr. Chair, watch  what Putin has already done: raped, murdered, and tortured innocent  civilians, targeted civilians. If there are no artillery shells to  defend them, then he will go unabated. Then you will see inhumanity  that we have not seen since the Second World War.   Mr. Chair, vote against this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
