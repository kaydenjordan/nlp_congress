 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 23, 2018, on page H4594, the following appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN  asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act is one of the  most  [[Page H4595]]  important items Congress considers. It is among the few authorizing  bills we take up, and the only authorizing bill considered by the House  every year.   It is legislation designed to meet some of our most important  obligations: increasing our military's readiness, supporting our  troops, and safeguarding our national security.   But as critical as this measure is, the base bill is rarely perfect.  That is why hundreds of amendments are submitted to the Rules Committee  every year by Members on both sides of the aisle. Our meetings on this  bill are usually the longest the committee holds all year because so  many Members bring forward so many ideas.   That is how the committee is supposed to function. And debating those  ideas on this floor, even amendments we disagree with, is how the House  of Representatives is supposed to work. That kind of process should not  be the exception. It should be the norm.   I know this may seem like a radical idea to the majority, but the  world's greatest deliberative body should regularly debate.   Instead, this majority has developed a pattern: Every now and then  they make a bunch of amendments in order on larger bills like this. But  most of the time, they don't allow any amendments on most bills.   Roughly 55 percent of all the rules that the majority has implemented  this Congress have been closed. So Members cannot do their job offering  amendments here on the House floor to address the biggest issues we  face.   Under a closed rule, I will remind my colleagues, you can't even fix  a typo in a bill.   Now, I know my Republican friends want to be congratulated for not  considering this bill under yet another closed rule. After all, they  broke their own record for closed rules this week, a sad milestone that  makes this Congress the most closed Congress in history.   This is the most closed Congress ever in the history of the United  States of America.   In fact, Speaker Ryan is the only Speaker in the history of our  country to never have a truly open rule.   But I think the American people hold the majority of this House to a  higher standard. Just consider what Republicans have blocked from even  getting a debate under this rule.   The majority on the Rules Committee decided to block the bipartisan  McGovern-Jones-Lee-Garamendi-Kildee-Welch amendment. Now, this is a  straightforward measure. It says that if the President and the Pentagon  want to escalate the number of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan in  the next fiscal year, they need to send a report to Congress. We would  then have 30 days to either disapprove of this escalation or allow it  to move forward.   It is simple, because all it asks is for this Congress to do its job,  to stop abdicating its responsibility. It has been 17 years since  Congress last passed an AUMF. We have been told year after year,  Congress after Congress, that this is not the time to debate our role  abroad.   Well, Mr. Speaker, when is the time?   We submitted this amendment to the Rules Committee last year during  the FY 2018 defense authorization. But rather than making it in order,  the majority moved forward with an alternative amendment that called  for a report from the administration on our Afghanistan policy.   The President signed that NDAA into law with that amendment. And  guess what? Congress never got the report. It is more than 70 days past  due.   Clearly, asking for a study isn't working. In fact, the President is  ignoring it altogether. And over the last year, the administration  decided to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by more  than 4,000 additional servicemembers. That is on top of the more than  8,400 troops that are already there. The response from this majority  has either been silence or to ask for a study.   Mr. Speaker, I don't need some study to tell me that this Congress  needs to do its job. Issues of war and peace are among the toughest we  consider, but we must take them up all the same. It is why we were sent  here and it is what our men and women in uniform expect.   Why is the majority afraid of a fair fight? Let's debate whether  President Trump should increase our engagement in Afghanistan even  further.                                time  1245    I am tired of being told that this is not the time for that vote  because I believe it is past time. I have stood here year after year,  Congress after Congress, as Speaker after Speaker told us to hurry up  and wait.   I remember when Speaker Boehner said it wasn't right for the 113th  Congress to be voting on an AUMF. We are now in the 115th Congress and  another Speaker has told us the same thing. But again this year, a vote  on an AUMF has been blocked.   The majority also blocked debating amendments under this rule on  other important issues, like striking the provision in this bill  allowing for the transfer of machine guns between contractors and a  separate measure to strike the provision here giving the President  leeway to avoid implementing Russian sanctions.   That is disappointing, and it is a disservice to this institution and  to the people we represent. For all of the talk from the majority about  how many amendments are included here, let's not forget what is being  blocked.   This bill is incredibly important. It authorizes money for more than  half of the Nation's discretionary budget. That is about 54 cents of  every tax dollar that pays for government programs other than  entitlements. We should be having a robust debate on these issues here  and now.   Yes, we appreciate quantity; that is important. We want a lot of  amendments made in order, but we would like quantity and quality. So  substantive amendments like the issues that I just mentioned ought to  be made in order.   When it comes to our national defense, when it comes to debating the  issues that are important to the American people, I want to let my  colleagues know we Democrats aren't cheap dates. We want to have our  ideas presented and debated. And the American people aren't cheap dates  either. They can't understand for the life of themselves why on issues  of war and peace, on issues like our involvement in Afghanistan, which  is now the longest war in history, why we don't think it is important  enough to debate that issue. We have men and women deployed in harm's  way, but we can't be bothered on the House floor.   We have roadblocks thrown in front of us so we can't bring these  amendments to the floor. We have a thousand excuses about why we can't  deal with some of these issues, why this is not the time. Enough. I  mean, this is what we are here for. If you don't want to talk about  these issues, if you don't want to debate these issues, leave, go into  another business, but don't take up space here in Congress spending all  of your time trying to block these amendments from being brought to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I know a more open process is a foreign concept to the  majority, but they should try it once in a while. This is the most  closed Congress ever. Let's let the sunlight in. Let's have a process  that is more accommodating.   And on this defense bill, yes, there are a lot of amendments that  have been made in order, but there were a lot of important, vital  amendments that have been blocked, and I find that very disappointing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleague from Alabama, I appreciate  the fact that he wants to defend what I think is indefensible, this  process that the Republicans have implemented to run this House. I  would be embarrassed to, but I know he has a job to do, and that is  what he is doing.   He talks about all of these amendments that were made in order. What  he doesn't tell you about is the over 2,000 amendments that they have  blocked this session already, including a lot of Republican amendments  that have been blocked, as well.   It is always puzzling to me that the Republicans just kind of go  along to get along, and they get shut out of the amendment process and  they still vote for a rule. Maybe the day that they stop voting for  these rules is a day that maybe we will see some changes.   I also want to point out, and I don't think he really appreciates  this point and this is why this has become the most closed Congress in  the history of the United States of America, that the majority of bills  that have been brought to the floor are unamendable. They are totally  closed. I can't even offer an amendment to put a punctuation mark in a  bill. I can't change a comma. I can't change the spelling of a word.   The majority of bills have been totally closed, shut out to  everybody. If that is the process that this majority wants to embrace,  fine. I think that is the kind of process that we want to move away  from because that is the kind of process that we see in authoritarian  regimes, not in deliberative bodies like the United States Congress,  not in the United States of America.   The gentleman talks about that he trusts the administration on  Afghanistan. Well, I don't trust this President on anything, to be  honest with you. I don't know if he has ever been to Afghanistan, but I  have, and the troops that I talked to in Afghanistan and those who are  returning ask me the same thing over and over, and that is: What the  hell are we doing? What is our mission?   Now, if you think the mission is on target and everything is great,  fine. Then vote to increase the number of troops there. But we ought to  have a debate here on the floor on whether that is the right thing to  do.   On AUMFs, I am happy that the gentleman is cosponsoring a number of  AUMFs. He says it is not appropriate to talk about it here in a defense  authorization bill or a Defense Appropriations bill; that is a Foreign  Affairs Committee bill, and we ought to deal with it there.   When is the last time we have had a Foreign Affairs Committee bill  that has been brought before us that we could amend to do an AUMF on? I  don't know.   Maybe the gentleman may know when this AUMF is coming out of the  Foreign Affairs Committee. I haven't seen it. I have been waiting for  years. They are in charge. They run this place. They control  everything.   So that is just another excuse, and it really is insulting to the men  and women who put their lives on the line for this country. I mean,  there is always an excuse why we can't debate something.   This has to stop, and I hope it stops soon. If not, maybe the  elections will result in a change of leadership here. I hope that, if  we have the privilege to take over, you see a much more accommodating  process and, certainly, a process where important issues like this get  to be debated.   Mr. Speaker, the protests by thousands of teachers across the Nation  have exposed not just low wages, but also severely dilapidated  facilities. The 2016 State of Our Schools report determined that there  is an annual State and local spending gap of $46 billion on school  facilities. These facilities pose significant health and safety threats  to more than 50 million students.   In the richest country in the world, it is absolutely shameful that  we allow our children to attend schools without heat and with dangerous  mold, not to mention the thousands of schools lacking access to the  connectivity necessary for digital learning.   For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Education and the Workforce Committee  member Bobby Scott's bill, H.R. 2475, the Rebuild America's Schools  Act. This legislation would provide the necessary funding to address  critical physical and digital infrastructure needs in our schools,  creating over 1.9 million jobs in the process.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my Rules Committee  colleague that I agree with her that this place is pretty  dysfunctional. But I just want to point out, in case she has forgotten,  that the White House is controlled by Republicans, the House is  controlled by Republicans, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans.  So the gentlewoman can blame everybody she wants, but the Republicans  are in charge of everything.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee) to respond to Mr. Byrne.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a May 22 letter signed by 32  former Republican and Democratic defense and foreign policy officials  rejecting the building and use of low-yield nuclear warheads and  opposing their authorization and their funding.                                                       May 22, 2018.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McGovern: We write to respectfully       request that Congress reject the Trump administration's       request for new, more usable, ``low-yield'' nuclear warheads       for Trident missiles. There is no need for such weapons and       building them would make the United States less safe. These       so-called ``low-yield'' weapons are a gateway to nuclear       catastrophe and should not be pursued.        To justify this dangerous proposal, the Trump       administration is promoting a false narrative that the United       States has a ``gap'' in its ability to deter the use of       nuclear weapons by Russia. Officials allege that Moscow       believes that an American president would not respond to       Russian use of ``tactical,'' or lower yield, nuclear weapons       if his only options include ``strategic,'' or high-yield,       ones. The president, they argue, would be ``self-deterred.''        To plug this supposed ``deterrence gap,'' the Trump       administration wants to develop and deploy new low-yield       nuclear warheads on Trident II D5 missiles on Ohio-class       submarines. The administration is asking Congress for $88       million in FY2019 for this new warhead, in a program that       would be completed in that fiscal year under the aegis of the       W76 Life Extension Program. Yet this justification for new       Trident warheads fails on many levels:        1. There is no ``deterrence gap.'' The United States has a       massive nuclear arsenal of some 4,000 warheads, half of which       are deployed on land-based missiles, submarines, and bombers.       The administration is in the process of rebuilding this       arsenal at an estimated cost of $1.7 trillion, with       inflation, over the next 30 years. While this immense program       is excessive, adds to a new arms race with Russia, and should       be scaled back, Russia cannot doubt that the United States is       serious about maintaining an unambiguously strong nuclear       deterrent.        2. The United States already has many low-yield nuclear       weapons. As part of that massive arsenal, the United States       already has about 1,000 nuclear weapons with low-yield       options, which are being modernized at great expense. If the       president ever needed to use a low-yield nuclear weapon, he       has many options.        3. Nuclear war cannot be controlled. Perhaps the biggest       fallacy in the whole argument is the mistaken and dangerous       belief that a ``small'' nuclear war would remain small. There       is no basis for the dubious theory that, if Russia used a       ``low-yield'' nuclear weapon and the United States responded       in kind, the conflict could stay at that level.        Indeed, it is unlikely that there is such a thing as a       limited nuclear war; preparing for one is folly. As George       Shultz, Secretary of State for President Ronald Reagan,       recently noted, ``A nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. You       use a small one, then you go to a bigger one. I think nuclear       weapons are nuclear weapons and we need to draw the line       there.'' Secretary of Defense James Mattis similarly       declared, ``I don't think there's any such thing as a       tactical nuclear weapon. Any  [[Page H4600]]       nuclear weapon used at any time is a strategic game       changer.''        Ultimately, the greatest concern about the proposed low-      yield Trident warhead is that the president might feel less       restrained about using it in a crisis. When it comes to using       a nuclear weapon, restraint is a good thing. The proposed       ``low-yield'' Trident warhead is dangerous, unjustified, and       redundant. Congress has the power to stop the administration       from starting down this slippery slope to nuclear war. We       call on Congress to exercise that authority without delay.

Mr. Speaker, as the letter states, ``there is no such thing as a  limited nuclear war and preparing for one is folly.''   George Shultz, Secretary of State for President Ronald Reagan,  recently noted: ``A nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. You use a small  one, then you go to a bigger one.''   Secretary of Defense James Mattis also recently declared: ``I don't  think there's any such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any nuclear  weapon used at any time is a strategic game changer.''   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill, for all of its many positive  developments, is seriously deficient in this particular area. It  authorizes funding for new low-yield nuclear weapons.   The U.S. already possesses low-yield nuclear weapons. If these  weapons are not effective deterrents, we should examine why before  building and deploying a new generation of weapons.   We should listen to our seasoned elder statesmen and -women and stop  walking down a road that begins a nuclear war that can rapidly  escalate. Any use of a nuclear weapon is a catastrophe. We should be  destroying nuclear weapons, not building new ones.   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together  and make sure this funding is not included in the final version of the  FY19 NDAA.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would say to the gentleman that we already have low-yield nuclear  weapons. I don't know why we need more.   We heard the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), talk about the  amendment he would like to see made in order to help reinforce our  schools. I think most people watching also appreciate the fact that our  national defense includes things like the quality of life for people  here in this country, including the quality of our schools, whether  people have jobs, whether people have good healthcare.   We are shortchanging all these domestic investments, and I think the  concern we have is when you start investing in more nuclear weapons,  not only is it not a good use of our taxpayer dollars, but it also  increases insecurity for the people of this country.   Mr. Speaker, this is the most closed Congress in the history of the  United States of America. Let me repeat that. This is the most closed  Congress in the history of the United States of America.   The majority is very proud of this rule. They have made a bunch of  amendments in order on a handful of bills to run up their numbers, but  let's remember one thing: On most bills, the majority of the  legislation that comes to this floor, they do not allow a single  amendment. Not one. On most bills that come to the floor, no Member of  this House, Democratic or Republican, can offer an amendment.   This rule before us today is not closed, but let me highlight a few  germane amendments from the 281 amendments that this rule blocks.   Several bipartisan amendments were blocked, such as an amendment by  Representatives Denham, Foster, Curbelo, and Panetta which allows  Dreamers who grew up in the United States to gain legal status,  provided that they serve out the terms of their enlistment honorably.   So we are talking about rewarding people who served in our military.  That was the amendment. That was brought before the Rules Committee.  That was blocked.   There was another bipartisan amendment from 25 Members, including  myself, that expresses the sense of Congress that the lessons of past  genocides should be applied to help prevent future war crimes, crimes  against humanity, and genocide.   I say to my colleagues: When did a sense of Congress on the  atrocities of genocide become such a controversial topic? But that was  blocked.   This rule blocks an amendment by Representative Keating to test ticks  for an increased number of tick-borne diseases. When did fighting tick- borne diseases become too sensitive for the House to debate?   This rule, once again, blocks us from having one of the most  important debates we could have. It prevents us  [[Page H4601]]  from debating whether or not to send our sons and daughters into harm's  way.   The bipartisan amendment by Representatives Lee, Jones, and Ellison  would repeal the 2001 AUMF after 240 days of enactment of the act,  giving Congress ample time to debate a new AUMF.   The Constitution of the United States says the Congress has the power  to declare war. This is our job, Mr. Speaker. And I appreciate the  gentleman from Alabama saying: Well, the Foreign Affairs Committee  deals with that, not us. We hear that every year. Every year that goes  by, we don't see any bill from the Foreign Affairs Committee dealing  with these topics.    The bottom line, let's be honest, is we don't deal with it because  Members in the majority don't want to deal with this difficult issue. I  have always said that our failure to act on an AUMF, our failure to  debate these issues, represents moral cowardice.   What about our workers? Representatives Ellison, Pocan, and Grijalva  had an amendment blocked that would have prohibited Federal contracts  with companies that have repeated and willful wage theft violations.  Why would we knowingly reward companies that hurt our workers?   The list goes on:   An amendment by Representative Lieu to require a public report on all  DOD expenditures to support Presidential visits to entities owned or  significantly controlled by the President or a member of his immediate  family.   The American people deserve to know if the President and his family  are directly profiting off of this Presidency. Blocked. Blocked.   An amendment by Representative Veasey that would prohibit the  deportation of family members of servicemembers on Active Duty. How can  we, with a good conscience, deport the family members of brave young  men and women putting their lives on the line for all of us and  fighting for our safety everyday? Blocked.   An amendment by Representative Torres, a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee, that would have prevented DOD in helping the  Department of Homeland Security from deporting spouses, parents, and  sons and daughters of certain military personnel, veterans, and  enlistees.   Mr. Speaker, I could spend the rest of the week describing the  thousands of amendments that this Republican leadership has blocked,  but I would much prefer to be debating the ideas that Members from both  parties have put forward in good faith.   This is the most closed Congress in history. Dana Milbank recently  described it as the most authoritarian Congress in history.   You know, 180 Democratic Members have had an amendment blocked in  this Congress alone. That is 180 elected Members.   I would like my Republican friends to listen closely to my next  point. This Congress, 180 Republican Members have also had their  amendments blocked this Congress. You are all voting to block your own  ideas. Stop it. Read the rules that you are voting on.   The vast majority of Republican Members have had their proposals  blocked from even getting a vote. I don't understand why you keep  voting to block proposals that you supposedly believe in. Hundreds of  Republican amendments have been blocked by the Rules Committee. Most  Republicans voted to block them. They are your amendments. I don't  understand why it is such a radical idea to debate any of the  amendments I just spoke about. We can do so much better.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of amendments that have been made in  order. There is a lot of quantity. But a lot of the amendments that  really shine in quality and that are important in terms of substance  have been blocked. This is nothing new.   Again, the majority of bills that come to this floor are under closed  rules. You can't amend them. Nobody can. Take it or leave it. The  majority of bills that come to this floor are closed.   I know it is uncomfortable for my Republican friends to hear that  they have presided over this closed process, but my hope is they will  be so embarrassed and so ashamed that they will want to change things.  They can still redeem themselves. We are only in May. They have a long  way to go. Whether it is on the defense bill, on an education bill, or  whatever bill it is, there are good ideas that are being brought  forward.   I will close with this. I met with a group of young students who were  engaged in the nationwide protest asking Congress to do something on  gun violence. And the most frustrating thing they said to them is the  fact that when they were lobbying Members of Congress, it's not even  about telling them how to vote on an issue; they are frustrated because  you can't get a vote on any of the issues that are related to gun  violence. We won't let anything come to the floor. It is wrong.   I just say to my friends, in closing, if this place becomes more  accommodating, if the Speaker decides to live up to the words that he  enunciated when he became Speaker of the House, to have a more open  process, to respect all ideas, let me tell you something; you are going  to see a decrease in polarization. You are going to see more bills  passed a bipartisan way. You are going to see more good bills going  forward. Legislation will be better. If you have a lousy process, you  end up with a lousy bill.   Again, I respect all the time and energy that went into crafting this  NDAA. I respect the chairman and the ranking member, Democrats and  Republicans alike, but there are a lot of important amendments here  that are being blocked that are really important and that most of our  constituents would believe deserve a debate and a vote on this floor.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. Vote  ``no'' on the rule. And I plead with them, let's bring some  accomodation and some respect to differing ideas and just regular order  to this House, because this is certainly not what I think any of us  could possibly believe is the way our government should be run.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that I am offering  along with my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer). I want to thank him  for his leadership on this issue.   Our amendment would very simply create a service medal to be awarded  to atomic veterans or their surviving family members in honor of their  service and sacrifice to our Nation.   Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces  participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. Now known as atomic  veterans, these GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were  constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in  performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even  talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation.   Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized  the atomic veterans' valiant service and acted to provide specialized  care and compensation for their harrowing duty.   In 2007, our allies Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia,  enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to  honor their atomic veterans who served with the United States.   Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of  our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service  of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr.  Chairman, this is a pitiful excuse.   Tragically, more than 75 percent of atomic veterans have already  passed  [[Page H4661]]  away, never having received this recognition. They served honorably and  kept a code of silence that most certainly led to many of these  veterans passing away prematurely.   Past administrations and Congresses have dealt with thornier issues  of legality and compensation. What remains is recognizing these  veterans' duty, honor, and faithful service to our Nation.   I want to thank my colleagues in the House for unanimously voting  favorably last year by a vote of 424-0. I was shocked when the Service  Medal was not included in the conference report. So I am urging my  colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment again. Let us send a  message to the Senate that this is important and that we are not going  to give up. Together we can show them that we are serious about  honoring this brave and distinguished group of patriotic Americans.   We owe it to our atomic veterans to recognize them for their selfless  service to our Nation.   Mr. Chairman, let me close by saying, our veterans who are now known  as atomic veterans served this country with great distinction. When  they left the service they raised our families, they worked in our  factories, and they contributed to our communities. They are getting  older. Let us not wait until there are no surviving atomic veterans  before we do the right thing.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring our atomic veterans. This  is the right thing to do. It is shameful that we have not been able to  do this sooner. I am confident that maybe this is the moment where we  will do the right thing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
