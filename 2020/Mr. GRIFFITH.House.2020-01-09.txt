 Madam Speaker, I rise for a parliamentary inquiry or a  series thereof.    Madam Speaker, am I correct that H. Res. 755 was passed  by vote of the House on December 18, 2019?    A measure not currently pending.   Additional parliamentary inquiry, please.    Madam Speaker, since H. Res. 755 passed on December 18,  2019, and the motion to reconsider H. Res. 755 was laid on the table on  that same date, December 18, 2019, is there any action the House of  Representatives can now take on H. Res. 755?    It is not a hypothetical.    Additional parliamentary inquiry.    I am not inquiring hypothetically. I may wish to take  action. Is there any action currently available to a Member of the  House in regard to H. Res. 755?    All right. Further parliamentary inquiry.    Is H. Res. 755 currently within the bosom of the U.S.  House?    I thank the Speaker.   Additional parliamentary inquiry.    Since 21 calendar days, 12 working days, and seven  legislative days have gone by since H. Res. 755 passed the House and  the Speaker of the House has not been physically able to deliver H.  Res. 755 to the United States Senate, does clause 8(b)(3)(C) of rule I  of the House rules automatically cause a vacancy in the Office of the  Speaker, or what action does the House need to take since the Speaker  has not been able to physically do an essential part of her  administrative duties as the Speaker of the House?    I thank the Chair.   Additional parliamentary inquiry.    Reviewing its parliamentary history, I would ask the  Chair, is there any precedent, other than incapacity, of a Speaker not  timely transmitting action of the House to the United States Senate?    Additional parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, clause 8(b)(3)(C) says that a physical  incapacity to do the job of Speaker causes or may cause a vacancy. I am  asking if there is any precedent related to that rule that the Chair  can direct me to, having found none on my own?    I respectfully disagree that it is an advisory opinion  and thank the Chair for her indulgence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, once a resolution passes the House, it  goes to the Senate. Once all action is done, the Speaker is a mere  functionary in transmitting the will of the House to the Senate.   It has been 21 calendar days, 12 working days, and 7 legislative days  since the impeachment resolution was passed by this House. Since the  resolution has not yet been delivered to the Senate, clause 8(b)(3)(C)  of House rule I says that a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker may  exist if the Speaker cannot do her job. She has not done her job.   America, I submit a vacancy exists in the Office of the Speaker of  the United States House.                            ____________________
