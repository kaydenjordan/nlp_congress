 Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee for the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Allred).    Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer and speak in support of  the amendment by my colleagues, Congressman Allred from Texas and  Congresswoman Torres from California.   Our amendment directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify  veterans of the expanded, cost-free childcare services in this bill,  and perform outreach to veterans and their families.   Each of us have heard from the women and men who have served and  sacrificed in uniform about the challenges that come from seeking  access to the benefits that veterans have earned.   Last year, at a veterans' roundtable in Woodland Park, I heard from  women veterans that it is not enough for Congress to enact a new  provision and think our job is done. We must direct the VA to find the  veterans who need help and make sure they know and fully utilize these  services.   This straightforward amendment requires the VA Secretary to provide  public notification on VA.gov about the program, and to perform  outreach to inform eligible veterans. The VA has significant and  specialized resources for our veterans. Veterans in my district rely on  services at the Morristown VA Outpatient Clinic as well as nearby Lyons  and East Orange facilities.   I had the opportunity to visit the Morristown Clinic last week and  speak with caregivers and patients at the facility.   I want every veteran, including the more than 25,000 veterans in New  Jersey's 11th Congressional District to know that these VA facilities  are there for them. These specialized treatment facilities are part of  systems worth strengthening and saving.   Mr. Chairman, we must make sure that childcare resources reach their  intended recipients as we work to improve care for our veteran  community. Only then will we see veterans coming forward to seek  counseling and other medical services, secure in the knowledge that  their children have a safe place during their appointment.   Simply put, this important childcare program will not work as  intended or have the reach that it could without informing our  servicemen and -women that it exists in the first place.   I thank the gentleman from Texas for this amendment, and I wish him  and his wife--who is from Montclair, New Jersey--well as they welcome  their first child.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  [[Page H1470]]  California (Mr. Takano), the chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to add that I hope that  the VA will do outreach with groups like Welcome Home Vets of New  Jersey.   I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have the amendment at the desk made in  order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer the 19th amendment to the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act.   The pilot program Congress authorized in 2010 to provide childcare at  VA medical centers and clinics around the country is incredibly popular  with the veteran community. It provides a safe, reliable option for  parents who need to access VA healthcare. This bill will expand the  program so that all caretakers, including parents and grandparents, can  access this service.   The amendment I am introducing this morning ensures that caretakers  have a safe and secure environment for their children at a VA center.  It bars employment of individuals convicted of a sex crime, an offense  involving a child victim, a violent crime, a drug felony, or other  offense the Secretary of Veterans Affairs deems appropriate. It also  ensures that the bill will not weaken State or local laws that enforce  rigorous hiring guidelines.   As a working mom, I know all too well how important it is to know  that your children have a safe and healthy environment while away from  home. Mr. Chair, ensuring our veterans have access to childcare at VA  facilities is the least we can do for the men and women who have stood  up to serve our country.   Over 6 million veteran households have children. In my own community,  I have heard from the new generation of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans,  many with young families, on the need for VA to modernize services in  line with their needs.                                time  1000    This includes local veterans I have spoken to at our American Legion  in Woodland Park, who are working parents with small children. They  have remarked that the extension of this program could be a significant  benefit to the veteran community in New Jersey. This bill means less  stress for our veterans who would need to otherwise arrange for  childcare to make an appointment. They have also told me that this bill  will help veterans make and attend appointments because they wouldn't  have to worry about arranging childcare. This acknowledges both the  needs of our veterans and creates a support network for them.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H1475]]         Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, which will specifically include  military sexual trauma counseling and care services in the definition  of services eligible for childcare at a VA center clinic.   We ask our servicemembers to risk their lives and their health on  behalf of our country. They take care of us, and it is our duty to take  care of them, especially after they leave the military.   Over the summer, I spoke to veterans in my district in New Jersey  about the inadequacies they see in VA services for this generation of  returning servicemembers.   I heard from female servicemembers about the need for better  counseling services for victims of military sexual trauma, or MST.  Several of the female veterans at a roundtable I held this summer  remarked on the fact that their voices were not heard in either the  planning of services or implementation of services.   Many of their fellow veterans did not make important appointments due  to lack of access to childcare. Certainly, as a mother, I would not  feel comfortable attending counseling and relating a story of sexual  assault to a counselor in front of my children.   This amendment is just one step in what must be an ongoing effort in  this Congress to address military sexual assault trauma. The Department  of Defense estimates that in 2016, 14,900 Active Duty servicemembers,  men and women, experience a sexual assault.   While this number is much lower than the 34,000 Active Duty  servicemembers who are believed to have experienced a sexual assault in  2006, the armed services still has a long way to go to address military  sexual assault in the ranks.   The female veterans in my community have remarked that because of the  trauma of military sexual trauma, women often do not report it, and,  therefore, the number of veterans who have been sexually assaulted is  woefully underreported.   These are the invisible wounds of war--invisible trauma that we  cannot see as our servicemembers return home. I am particularly  concerned that victims of sexual trauma, which is prevalent in military  and civilian populations, are not getting the services that they need.   This amendment will ensure survivors are treated with the dignity and  respect they deserve when trying to access care at the VA without  worrying about the cost or availability of childcare.   I take this opportunity to thank some of the veteran service groups  in our district, like Welcome Home Vets and SOS Stakeholders, who  support our veterans, give feedback to the VA on the needs of our  servicemembers, and work tirelessly to connect service providers with  veterans.   I also thank Congresswoman Kuster and Congresswoman Moore for  cosponsoring this amendment and their tireless advocacy for our  veterans.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
