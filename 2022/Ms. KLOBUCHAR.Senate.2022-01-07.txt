 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  support of legislation that is critical to our democracy, the Freedom  to Vote Act, which I introduced this year with many Senators who worked  together through the summer to come up with a bill that would make a  difference for our country, with input from secretaries of state across  our country, election experts, in order to give the people of this  country the right to vote, to protect the right to vote, and to make  sure that they understood that they can vote anywhere from any ZIP Code  in a safe way because right now, sadly, that is simply not the case in  many States in our country.   If you are in North Carolina right now and you want to cast a mail-in  ballot and you have COVID or you are in the hospital, you have to get a  notary public to sign off on your ballot.   If you are in Georgia, and you don't register, you are a new resident  there, you have moved there from another State, and you are in a big  election, and you think, well, I am going to vote in the final place,  you are no longer allowed to register in the last month as you were in  the past during the runoff election.   As we saw in the last election in 2020 in Houston, in that county--5  million people--there was only one drop-off box in the entire county;  Harris County, 5 million people, only one drop-off box.   There are places in States where you wait in line, 8, 10 hours in the  hot Sun just to exercise your right to vote.  [[Page S84]]  That is why, through the year, we worked together with, of course,  Leader Schumer, who brought us together, and Senators Manchin, Merkley,  Padilla, King, Kaine, Tester, and Warnock--different Senators coming  from different parts of the country with different political views on  certain issues, but we came together and cosponsored this bill, which  is supported by every Member of the Democratic caucus.   I want to thank all of them for their ongoing hard work to get the  bill passed and also to thank Senators Schumer, Durbin, Kaine, and  Merkley for joining me on the floor today in support of this bill.   The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms, which is  why we called it the Freedom to Vote Act. It ensures that people are  part of a franchise and that government is accountable to the people,  but, today, this fundamental right that is the very foundation of our  system of government is under attack.   Since the 2020 election, we have seen a persistent and coordinated  assault on the freedom to vote in States across the country. I just  used a few examples of the laws that have changed, the attempts that  have been made in nearly every State, with over 400 bills, to change  those laws.   But then there have been direct threats. Local election officials,  many secretaries of state have told me that they are having trouble now  recruiting people to run their election-day and election-month  facilities. Why? Because there are threats. There have been polls and  studies that have shown that election officials in inordinate numbers  are the victims of these threats.   One Republican commissioner in Philadelphia, election commissioner  who recently left his job, they actually put his family's names, young  kids' names, a picture of his house, and his address on the internet so  that people can target his very family.   The emails, the voice messages left, the one left for Katie Hobbs,  the secretary of state for Arizona: We will hunt you down, Katie. We  will hunt you down.   These attacks on our local election officials and also Members of  Congress of both parties--a record number 9,600 in the last year, which  is double or triple what it has ever been. You cannot look at the  incident of January 6, of that insurrection, on its own. These threats  of violence have continued into the year.   And why is that? Well, we know there is this enormous lack of trust  right now in our election system. We know that people have wrongly been  told, have been given misinformation, have been motivated, as we saw,  as those people marched down the Mall on January 6, to believe that  somehow our democracy and our voting system is a fraud.   Now, we know that is not right because we hear it from Republican and  Democratic local officials all the time. President Trump's own Homeland  Security election head, after the last election, said it was the most  secure in the history of America. That was President Trump's appointee.  Former Attorney General Barr made it very clear that there was not  widespread fraud in the last election of any kind. But yet this lie  continues, and people, sadly, continue to believe it.   And what is the most sad is that elected leaders in States--a number  of States, not just one or two, multiple States--are passing laws with  the false tenet of fraud and literally taking away people's right to  vote, kicking them off of voting rolls.   People who for years have gone to one polling location now can't  figure out where they are supposed to vote; people in Georgia who  suddenly have been told--after the last election did it differently-- that they have to write their birthday on the outside of an envelope.  Anyone who is asked to write a date on an envelope for a ballot, one  would assume it is the date that you are putting your ballot in the  mail. But, no, it is your birthday. That is the kind of thing we are  seeing across the country.    As one court in North Carolina once said about previous efforts to  suppress the law, it is discrimination with surgical precision, State  by State by State.   These attacks on our democracy demand a federalist response. Just as  we saw in the 1960s with civil rights legislation, at some point, the  Federal Government had to step in. And, in fact, our own Founding  Fathers actually anticipated that this might be necessary because right  in the Constitution, it says that Congress can ``make or alter'' the  laws regarding Federal elections--as clear as can be, ``make or alter''  the laws regarding Federal elections.   So what we are talking about here are some minimum standards in place  for how you do early voting, for the fact that you can register, for  the fact that you can have drop-off boxes, ``make or alter'' the rules  for Federal elections.   When you have States, certain States messing around to the extent  that they are, with the clear intent that they have, this is the moment  that we look to the Constitution for guidance, and it is right there.   This is why the need for action could not be more serious. This is  why, as Leader Schumer has announced, we will be moving to advance the  Freedom to Vote Act next week.   With State legislatures beginning to convene for their 2022  legislative sessions this week, with plans to pass more bills that will  restrict voting and with primaries for the 2022 election just around  the corner, we cannot wait another moment.   Yesterday, we gathered in this Chamber to mark 1 year since the  violent mob of insurrectionists stormed into this Capitol. I can see  everything like it was in technicolor--when we came back into this  Chamber, to our desks, everyone looking in their desks to see if  anything had been taken; the videos we saw, which only a few hours  before people had invaded this Chamber; and the walk that Senator Blunt  and the Vice President and I took through the broken glass, spray- painted statues, with the young staff members with the mahogany boxes  containing the last of the electoral ballots.   As I said 2 weeks later at the inauguration, this is the moment when  our democracy brushes itself off, stands straight, moves forward, ``one  nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''   You just said that pledge, I say to the Presiding Officer, in this  very Chamber. The pages said that pledge in this very Chamber. To me,  those are not just empty words; they are a pledge that we must keep.   Election officials, as I noted, across the country have been targeted  by an overwhelming increase in the number of threats. We cannot keep  that pledge, ``for liberty and justice for all,'' and a democracy if we  can't have fair elections and literally people who are just doing their  jobs, whether in this building or out in Mississippi or out in  Pennsylvania or in Arizona, getting threatened just for counting votes.  We actually even heard from the Republican Kentucky secretary of state  recently in a hearing that Senator Blunt and I had about how difficult  it is to fill those jobs.   So in light of all of this, let's talk some basics about what the  Freedom to Vote Act does.   It strengthens protections for election workers by making it a  Federal crime to ``intimidate, threaten, or coerce'' election workers.  It protects election officials from improper removal by partisan  actors. It puts a standard in place. So you can't just throw them out  because you don't like what the results were, what their votes were  that they counted; it establishes a statutory right to vote, to have  their votes counted; and it protects against sham audits, like the one  we saw in Arizona and the ones being advanced in Wisconsin, Michigan,  Texas, and Pennsylvania.   It is worth noting that even though these so-called audits aren't  using reliable methods in Arizona, that sham audit actually found  President Biden had a larger margin of victory, and the first round of  findings in Texas found nothing that could have changed the outcome in  the election.   A few weeks ago, we gathered for the funeral of a great man who  served many years in this Chamber, Senator Dole. President Biden  reminded us of something he had once said when the debates in this  Chamber--when there were actual debates--were raging about civil rights  legislation. Bob Dole said this:         No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class       citizens.   [[Page S85]]     ``No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class  citizens.''   We are a first-class democracy. Yet, as I know, 19 States have passed  34 bills that include provisions to restrict voting, and State  legislatures are looking at even more. The need for Federal action is  urgent.   But as we have seen in States like Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Montana,  and Texas, we are up against a coordinated attack aimed at limiting the  freedom to vote. Examples--I have used a few already, and I am going to  keep using them throughout the weeks ahead.   The new law in Georgia shortens runoffs by 5 weeks and prevents new  voters from registering to vote during runoff elections.   In Iowa, a new law cut the days of early voting by 9 days and closes  the polls an hour early. That was after the State, in the words of its  own Republican secretary of state, shattered its voter turnout record  last year. If that shattered the voter turnout record, Senator Kaine,  to have an hour extra, why would you then take the hour away?   A new law in Montana says you can no longer register to vote on  election day. Yet that same-day registration--I know because my State  is proud of our same-day registration, and we have the highest voter  turnout in the country in nearly every single election--for 15 years  that was in place in Montana--15 years. Don't tell me it was some new  thing that they weren't used to--15 years. And as part of this  coordinated national attack on voting, they took it away.   In 2020, the Texas Governor, as I noted, also limited counties,  including Harris County, which has as many people as nearly my entire  State, to that one ballot dropoff box.   We cannot hold free and fair elections with laws and procedures like  these. And, yes, there is the issue--the horrendous issue--of messing  around with how the votes are counted and getting rid of the  nonpartisan boards and allowing partisan legislatures to count and sham  audits.   All of that is covered by our bill, and it is a big problem. But if  you rig the elections before the votes are even counted by making it  impossible for certain people to vote--in the words of our great  colleague Reverend Warnock, ``Some people don't want some people to  vote''--does it even matter if you count them if they are not allowed  to vote in the first place?   That is why Americans need the Freedom to Vote Act, which builds on  the framework put forward by my colleague and former West Virginia  secretary of state Senator Manchin last summer. As I note, it reflected  the work--hard work--of many, many Senators, including ones in this  room today: the Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley; the Senator from  Virginia, Senator Kaine.   We can't just sit back and allow for 5 weeks to be cut from the  Georgia runoff period--during which over 1.3 million people voted in  2021--or allow for people to be prevented from registering to vote for  runoff elections when nearly 70,000 Georgians registered to vote during  that time.   Protecting elections against subversion also won't bring back same- day registration on election day in Montana unless we do the work from  the beginning, which nearly 8,200 Montanans used in 2020 to register or  update their registration. That is a lot of people in Montana.   It won't ensure that over 16 million registered voters in Texas have  access to drop boxes. It simply is not enough to just focus on counting  the votes if you want to protect things that matter to people.   The best of the best is what the American people want. They want to  be able to vote in the safest way possible that works for them. One  poll found that 78 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of  Republicans--this is from April 2021, Pew--support making early in- person voting available for at least 2 weeks before election day. That  is exactly what this bill does.   Sixty-eight percent of Americans, including 59 percent of  Republicans, support making election day a national holiday--Pew poll,  April 2021. That is what this bill does.   Sixty-one percent of Americans support automatic voter registration-- Pew, April 2021. That is what this bill does. If you go in and get your  driver's license--huh?--why would you have to then, when the State has  all of your information, have to go in and register again?   So while Senate Republicans claim that this bill isn't popular, there  are people in their own party, time and time again, who have supported  these provisions.   How about, for instance, Utah, where nearly the entire State has  mail-in balloting, but yet in other States--like I just mentioned in  North Carolina--you can't cast your mail-in ballot without getting a  notary public?   That is why the Constitution says that, for Federal elections,  Congress can make or alter the rules regarding Federal elections.   For decades, we know voting rights has been a bipartisan issue. In  2006, the Voting Rights Act--I know Senator Durbin, the author of this  bill, has worked so hard on this--was reauthorized. The Voting Rights  Act was reauthorized by a vote of 98 to 0. But right now, when we look  at changes to the Voting Rights Act in response to a court case out of  the Supreme Court, it is so necessary to update that bill right now.  Only one Republican, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, voted to even advance  that bill to allow for debate. Only one was willing to debate it.   Let's be clear. When article I, section 4 of the Constitution  empowers Congress to make or alter rules for Federal elections at any  time--at any time--I believe it is in there for a reason. I don't think  they just put that in there for, ``Oh, let's just throw this in,'' in  the very few words of a Constitution for the greatest democracy the  world has ever known. No, it was in there for a reason. This is the  reason.   We get to one more thing--and then I will turn it over to my  colleagues--and that is the need to look at the Senate rules for  voting. So I would argue that maybe for the people of this country--the  hundreds of millions of people of this country--their voting rules  might be just a little, tiny bit more important than our voting rules  in this Chamber.    But, nevertheless, acknowledging that, our voting rules have changed  many, many times. Since the beginning of the Senate, the rules  governing debate have changed, as I said, multiple times. Throughout  history, there have been over 160 exceptions to the 60-vote cloture  threshold, including nominees, reconciliation, and disapproval of arms  sales. Even the number of votes needed to end debate has changed.   I am very interested in making this place work. I don't think people  would spend all this time getting elected just to come here and stop  bills from happening and then go home, but that is pretty much what is  going on right now in this Chamber.   I look at those pages. I think about that they came here to watch  these grand debates in what is supposed to be the greatest deliberative  body of all time, and instead we basically have an empty room.   This is the moment to protect voting rights. And yes, we acknowledge  that to do it--because, sadly, we don't have the bipartisan support  that we have had in the past for voting rights and for protecting  people's rights--we have to do it this way. And there is nothing  magical about the rules as they are now. If there were, there wouldn't  be 160 exceptions and they wouldn't have been changed multiple times.   I will end with this. Protecting the freedom to vote has never been  easy. Throughout our country's 245-year history, we have had to course- correct to ensure that our democracy--for the people, by the people-- always lived up to our ideals.   Last year, when speaking in Philadelphia, President Biden called the  fight to protect voting rights the test of our time. We owe it to  ourselves and future generations of Americans to ensure that our  democracy is protected.   With that, I thank you, Mr. President, and I turn it over to my  colleagues.   I yield the floor.
