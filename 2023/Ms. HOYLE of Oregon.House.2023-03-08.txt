 Madam Speaker, in my district, the average per  capita income is $32,000 a year. That is six counties from Lincoln  County, down the coast of Oregon, to Curry County and the California  border.   Over 160,000 seniors in my district rely on Social Security for  retirement.   My colleagues across the aisle are approaching Social Security as if  it is an unearned handout, and that is beyond offensive. This is not  what it was meant to do. This is not what it was meant to be. People  have paid into this system for their whole lives. They should be able  to get their contributions back. That is the promise of our Social  Security program.   Right now, we only tax income up to $160,000 a year to fund Social  Security. Millionaires and billionaires who get their income from  investments instead of earning a paycheck through hard work are not  paying their fair share into Social Security at all, and we must change  that system.   By finally requiring that the wealthiest Americans pay into Social  Security at the same rate as hardworking nurses and firefighters across  this country, we can expand benefits and not cut them.   My bill, the Social Security Expansion Act, which I introduced with  Representative Jan Schakowsky and Senator Bernie Sanders, would allow  us to increase the Social Security benefits for everyone by $200 a  month and help account for the inflation that has impacted many seniors  in my district and across this country.   This bill would also extend the solvency of this critical program for  the next 75 years.   I am not in Congress to protect billionaires. I am here to make sure  those people who have paid into this system for their whole lives, who  have worked so hard, including our fishermen, electricians, and  schoolteachers can retire with dignity. We can welcome a new generation  of the workforce as they retire.   It is our responsibility to make sure that Social Security can be  successful into the future, and I am proud to have a bill that helps  protect that.                            ____________________
