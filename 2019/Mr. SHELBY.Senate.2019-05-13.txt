 Mr. President, today I wish to commend Dr. Robert  Altenkirch for his leadership at the University of Alabama in  Huntsville. Dr. Altenkirch led the university as president from 2011 to  2019. While serving in this capacity, he implemented many strategic  growth initiatives and promoted economic development throughout the  campus and the city of Huntsville, AL.   Under Dr. Altenkirch's leadership, UAH provided assistance in  recruiting numerous corporations to north Alabama. Those corporations  include Blue Origin, Aerojet, Rocketdyne, GE Aviation, and Polaris. He  also spearheaded the purchase of a 58-acre business park that is  adjacent to the campus and serves as a town center for the students and  faculty.   Continuing to add to his legacy, Dr. Altenkirch established the D.S.  Davidson Invention to Innovation business incubator. This regional  initiative fosters, promotes, and accelerates the commercialization of  technology-based ventures through incubation, co-working, mentorship,  funding, and strategic support.   Not only did Dr. Altenkirch expand the university physically and  economically, but he also contributed to the university's growth in  total enrollment over the past 5 years. By the fall of 2019, the  enrollment at UAH skyrocketed by more than 10,000 students. The average  ACT score for incoming freshman reached an alltime record high at the  university under Dr. Altenkirch. By fall 2018, the average score was  28.5, which is the highest among the State of Alabama's public  universities.   Studying mechanical engineering, Dr. Altenkirch earned a B.S. from  Purdue University, an M.S. from the University of California, Berkley,  and a Ph.D. from Purdue. He was recognized as one of the 101 Most  Influential People in the State of New Jersey in 2009, as Dr.  Altenkirch served as the president of New Jersey Institute of  Technology for 9 years prior to his tenure at UAH.   Dr. Altenkirch deserves the highest recognition for his outstanding  leadership at the University of Alabama in  [[Page S2786]]  Huntsville. He helped shape a more prosperous future for the  university, the city of Huntsville, and the State of Alabama. The  impact he has made on UAH and the entire north Alabama community will  not be forgotten.                            ____________________
