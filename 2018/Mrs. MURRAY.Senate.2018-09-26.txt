 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues  in lifting up the voices of women across the country who, right now,  are being ignored, swept aside, and attacked, and in calling on our  Republican colleagues to join us and do everything we can to make sure  women are heard, listened to, and respected as we debate and deliberate  over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.   Recently, I was back home in Washington State to talk to my  constituents about the Supreme Court nomination, and I met a woman  named Caitlin, who bravely told me and others about her experience of  being sexually assaulted.  [[Page S6315]]    She shared her story. It was July 2016. She had gone to a concert  that evening, and she was sexually assaulted that night, but it was how  she explained what happened after that I want to share today.   She said:         As a sexual assault survivor, I know firsthand that these       experiences have a lasting impact and the pain can't be       overstated. In the aftermath of sexual violence, it's common       to feel humiliated and to blame ourselves; to just want to       forget it ever happened. I didn't want to admit that I'd       ``allowed'' this to happen to me, so I tried to convince       myself that the attack had never occurred. For these reasons       and so many others, it's common to wait months or . . . years       before confiding in anyone, even those closest to us.    Those were Caitlin's words to me. She went on, and she said:         Going public with our stories, opens us up to criticism       ranging from victim blaming to accusations that we're liars       and attention-seekers, in addition to far uglier insults that       I won't repeat right now. I know that coming forward and       forever tying our names to one of the most terrifying,       degrading experiences of our lives isn't a decision to be       taken lightly.    Sadly, Caitlin is not alone--far from it. She shared her story with  me so her story can help others and so I can lift it up, make sure it  is being heard, and help her make a difference.   So this brings me to the question I want to ask today: What is this  really about, right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate? There is a  whole lot of confusion, a whole lot of mud being kicked up, and a whole  lot of distractions, but what is this moment, right now, really about?   It is not the question of this confirmation, although that is clearly  important. It is not whether we think Judge Kavanaugh would make a good  Supreme Court Justice or whether we can trust him, despite the lies we  have already heard on issue after issue. Those are, of course, critical  questions too. It is not even whether my colleagues will believe the  allegations brought against him are true once all the evidence is  weighed and all investigations are complete--although, of course, for  many of us, that question must be dug into--but to me and millions of  people across the country, this moment right now is about the answer to  a few simple questions.   Is the Senate a place where women are listened to, heard, and  respected or is it still just one more place where women's voices are  swept under the rug, where our voices are ignored, attacked, and  undermined, right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate, while the  President of the United States is saying a woman can't be trusted  because ``she was drunk''; while he was tweeting that Dr. Ford can't be  trusted because if it were really as bad as she said, she would have  reported it back when she was 15 when it happened; while Republican  leaders are saying they will ``plow right through'' this; while they  are desperately trying to distract people by pointing to the process  and the timing--anything but the substance; while they hire a woman  they are calling their ``female assistant''--the lawyer they found to  ask Dr. Ford the questions they can't trust the Republican men on the  Judiciary Committee to ask; while they are already sweeping past this  hearing and scrambling to line up a committee vote right away; while  they are planning to stay through the weekend to rush to a vote on the  Senate floor that their leader says is ``confident'' they ``will  win''--before Dr. Ford has even had a chance to be heard and a vote  that doesn't need to be rushed for any good reason?   Right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate, these are the  questions: Will women be heard or will women be ignored? Will women who  are bravely coming forward to share the most horrific experience of  their lives be trusted or will they be treated like liars? Will women,  such as Caitlin, Dr. Ford, and Ms. Ramirez be respected, listened to,  and heard or will they be pushed aside, put in their places, and told  to remain quiet?   Right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate, what kind of message  will we send to women and girls across the country who are watching,  who are looking to see how Dr. Ford is being treated; whether Ms.  Ramirez, who is reportedly willing to testify to the committee under  oath--whether her story will be taken seriously or even be  investigated. They are grappling with what may be one of the toughest  decisions of their lives: Should they report a sexual assault? Should  they try to bring a perpetrator to justice and make sure he faces the  consequences he deserves or should they keep it to themselves, worried  about the ways they may be attacked or ignored or disbelieved,  interrogated about what they drank or wore, whom they told and when?   Right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate, what kind of message  will we send to men and boys across the country who are watching right  now, who will see whether women are empowered to share their  experience, men facing the consequences of their actions, and a message  sent that this is not acceptable behavior in high school, in college,  or anywhere else, or who will, once again, hear that women can be  attacked and abused and disrespected and used and then ignored and  attacked all over again when they share their stories?   I decided to run for the U.S. Senate after I saw Senators get those  questions wrong in the Anita Hill hearings in 1991. I ran to be a voice  for the women and men across the country who thought it was absolutely  wrong for her to be ignored, attacked, swept aside, and disbelieved. I  ran for, right here, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate, to make sure  we never allow that to happen again. I ran for my daughter who sat by  my side as we watched that all-male Judiciary Committee grill Anita  Hill, for her daughters--my granddaughters--who are not quite old  enough to understand what will happen on Thursday but who will grow up  in a world that will treat them better or worse depending on how women  are treated this week, for Caitlin and the women like her who shared  their stories with me--some out loud in front of crowds, some in  whispered voices after everyone else has left--and for the women we  don't know who have buried their experiences deep down inside, who have  kept their secret for decades because they have been too scared or  intimidated to come forward and who are watching right now to see what  happens here, right now, in this moment, in the U.S. Senate.   I am proud to bring their voices to the floor today, and I am truly  hopeful enough Republicans stand with them and that we can do the right  thing.   Republican leaders need to listen--truly listen--to the women coming  forward to share their experiences. Republican leaders need to  investigate--truly investigate--the allegations they are making and the  inconsistencies in Judge Kavanaugh's statements on so many issues.  Republican leaders need to end this scramble and rush. They need to  slow it down and do this right.   Women and men are watching. They are paying attention, and they are  not going to forget.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
