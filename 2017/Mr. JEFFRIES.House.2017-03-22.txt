 Mr. Speaker, under the Republican healthcare plan,  TrumpCare, hardworking Americans will pay more and get less. Your  premiums will increase. Your copays will increase. Your deductibles  will increase. Your out-of-pocket costs will increase. But the quality  of your health care will go down.   Tens of millions of Americans under TrumpCare will also lose their  entire health coverage. And under the Republican healthcare plan, it  will impose a draconian age tax on people between 50 and 64, some of  whom will be forced to pay approximately $14,000 per year.   Trump has said he is going to do health care in three phases. I have  finally figured it out. Phase one, disease. Phase two, disaster. Phase  three, destruction. Vote ``no'' against this reckless plan.                            ____________________
