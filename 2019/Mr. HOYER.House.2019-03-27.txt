 Mr. Speaker, I rise out of a deep concern for our country  and its ability to sustain investments in growing our economy and  making opportunities available for our people.   Our country suffered the longest government shutdown in its history  just a few months ago. For 35 days, 800,000 Federal employees and their  families were forced to go without paychecks. Our economy was burdened  by uncertainty and a lack of confidence in our leaders.   That shutdown was the direct result of the Trump administration's  confrontational approach to governing and its irresponsible decision to  insist on a position that Congress had already rejected.   I would have hoped that they learned from that experience, but it  appears that that is not the case. Now President Trump and Mick  Mulvaney--a former colleague of ours who voted not only to shut down  the government, but against the wishes of the Republican Speaker, voted  against opening government up--have sent to Congress a budget proposal  that ramps up confrontation and sets up an even more difficult impasse.   Their budget proposal rejects 6 years of governing consensus  enshrined in three 2-year budget agreements to raise the caps put in  place by the Budget Control Act in a bipartisan way and according to  the principles of parity, fairness, and equality.   Adhering to that path and working together to raise the caps  responsibly and at the same rate for defense and nondefense investments  would be, in my view, the best way to ensure that appropriations for  next year proceed on a bipartisan basis so that we can do the job of  funding the government and avert another unnecessary, dangerous, and  harmful shutdown in October.   The administration's proposal of using the overseas contingency  operations account to avoid negotiating with Congress on responsibly  dealing with the BCA caps and hiding increases in defense funding is a  massive gimmick.   Who said that? The Republican majority said that a number of years  ago.   It is more than just an accounting sleight of hand, with real  implications for our national security planning and long-term strategy.   The OCO account, again, overseas contingency operations account, was  created to fund imminent defense priorities outside of the normal  Pentagon budget planning cycle.   Now Mr. Mulvaney wants to use OCO at the rate of some $175 billion- plus as if Afghanistan, in which we have been involved for some 17  years, is a contingency. It is not a contingency. It is an operating  expense.   If OCO were used in the way the administration intends, it could  cripple multiyear planning by our military by calling into question  every penny shifted into that account in future years.   It is also disingenuous for them to demand that Congress pour money  into defense through what Mr. Mulvaney himself has called a ``backdoor  slush fund.'' That is what he called OCO in 2015 when he was a Member  of Congress.   And now that same Mr. Mulvaney, the Acting Chief of Staff and,  frankly, I believe, also, the Acting OMB Director, proposes to use what  he called a backdoor slush fund without acknowledging the need to  compromise elsewhere on the ledger.                                time  1015    This is fiscal irresponsibility at its worst, because it is a veneer  of concern  [[Page H2833]]  for fiscal discipline used to hide the ugly truth of fiscal  recklessness and brinksmanship. The Trump-Mulvaney budget is, to put it  bluntly, a fraud.   It is the Congress' job to move ahead with good faith efforts to  agree on raising the caps. We have a procedure called sequester that,  if we do not amend the caps, will go into effect 15 days after we  adjourn this session and cut to levels that no Member of Congress, in  my view, believes is reasonable, rational, or responsible. It would  automatically occur if we do not pass a caps bill.   That is indicative that there is bipartisan agreement, which has  happened over the last 6 years in 2-year cycles, that the caps required  by the sequester bill were irrational. I think there is a consensus.  So, as opposed to confrontation, and to avoid a shutdown in October, we  ought to come to an agreement. The President, of course, needs to be  part of that agreement, because he would need to sign legislation  amending the sequester act.   Appropriators need guidance, also, to begin the hard work of writing  funding bills. They need to know what the agreed spending level will  be. We call it a 302(a). What it really means is: How much money are  you going to spend on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense  objectives?   Now, I am an appropriator. I haven't served on the committee for some  years, because I am in the leadership, but I am on leave. I understand  as well as anyone how important it is to have agreed-upon top-line  numbers in order for the committee to do its work effectively on a  bipartisan basis.   I will tell my Republican colleagues, as I have told my Democratic  colleagues, it is my intention, as majority of the House of  Representatives, to provide for the passage of the appropriations bills  through the House of Representatives by the end of June.   The Budget Act requires us to do it by June 30. We have never done  it. We haven't done it on our side; the Republicans haven't done it on  their side. What inevitably happens is we don't get our work done, and  we had a shutdown last year and this year of historic proportions and  of historic cost and of historic undermining of confidence in the  United States of America here and around the world.   We need to get to work; we need to get to work together; and we need  to get this job done. Let's strive to achieve that which I know is  achievable.   I have talked to Ms. Granger. I have talked to the ranking member of  the Budget Committee here in the House,   Steve Womack, a good friend  of mine. I have talked to Senator Enzi, the chairman in the Senate. And  I have talked to Senator McConnell. I haven't heard from anybody who  doesn't think we need to get caps established so that we can do our  work for the American people and reestablish confidence in the rational  operations of the Congress. It won't be easy, but it is necessary.   Let us not delude ourselves into believing, just a few weeks removed  from the longest government shutdown in our history, that the  administration's shortsighted approach will lead to anything but  another shutdown at the end of the fiscal year. Divided government need  not be confrontational government.   I tell people on a regular basis that the Congress is less than the  sum of its parts. What do I mean by that? I mean the individual Members  have integrity and a willingness to work together, but, as a body, we  have found ourselves unable or unwilling to do just that. We are less  than the sum of our parts, less than the sum of our Members' intellect  and willingness to act responsibly.   We can disagree on details, but we must try to reach agreement on the  caps in order to assist appropriators, promote fiscal responsibility,  reduce uncertainty, and protect the ability of our military to plan its  budget over the long term with confidence.   If OCO is relied upon, in terms of billions of dollars, they cannot  do that. It is undermining our national security, as well as  undermining the ability to meet our domestic needs.   The Trump-Mulvaney budget proposal was, sadly, a missed opportunity  and more of a fiscally irresponsible charade.   I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle: Let us strive to not  miss our own opportunity to meet in good faith and produce a budget  caps agreement that promotes fiscal sanity, upholds the principle of  parity, and allows us to invest in a better future for our country.  Certainly, we ought to expect no less of ourselves, and, certainly,  that is what our constituents expect of us.   Then, let us proceed to achieve a realistic, fiscally responsible  path toward a real, sustainable budget agreement worthy of our duty to  our country and constituents and to future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to come together, to reason  together, and to establish a plan to proceed, not just for this year,  but for a decade to come, that is fiscally responsible, meets the  challenges that we have, and seizes the opportunities that are in front  of us.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I wanted  to speak during general debate, but I will take this time to speak on  behalf of this legislation and also to rise in support of the  gentleman's amendment.  [[Page H2869]]    Mr. Chairman, the American people entrusted Democrats with the  majority in part because we pledged to work hard on the issues they  care about most, issues affecting their everyday lives.   I am the father of three daughters. They are all extraordinary  people. I want them all treated based upon the content of their  character, their performance, and the duties that they perform, not on  the fact that they happen to be daughters and not sons.   One of the issues we pledged to address was raising wages, and that  includes addressing the gender pay gap, which keeps women from earning  their fair share and hurts families, children, and all people.   The last time I was the majority leader, which was from 2007 to 2011,  we enacted the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make it easier for women  who have faced discriminatory pay and benefits to seek justice.   Lilly Ledbetter had worked hard, and she did not know that she was  being paid less than her counterparts doing exactly the same thing she  was doing, with exactly the same responsibility and exactly the same  expectations. There was no justice in that, but she didn't know it. The  Supreme Court said, well, you didn't raise the issue quickly enough.   We also passed the Paycheck Fairness Act in that same Congress, but,  unfortunately, the Senate failed to enact it as well.   Now we return to this important work of ensuring equal pay for equal  work. Who, intellectually, can oppose that concept? Who, with any sense  of fairness and fair play, could oppose that concept and precept?   It is shameful, Mr. Chairman, that, in 2019, 56 years after President  Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, we are here fighting for equal pay. A  half century later, women still earn, on average, 80 cents to a man's  dollar, and, very frankly, minority women earn less than that. That gap  is even worse for minorities. Two-thirds of women are now either the  primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in their households.   Make no mistake, this is an economic concern for families across our  country. This is not a woman's issue. It is a fairness issue. It is an  every family, every person issue.   Democrats ran on a platform of raising wages, as I said. We are  focused on making sure that more working families can make it in  America. That is what this bill will help achieve.   I am proud that every member of the Democratic Caucus--let me repeat  that, every member--234 members of the Democratic Caucus have signed on  as cosponsors of this bill because we believe it is fair; because we  believe it is right; because we believe it is good for families; and,  yes, because we believe it is good for the American economy.   Rosa DeLauro is on the floor, and I want to thank the gentlewoman. We  hear the phrase, ``Keep the faith.'' Rosa DeLauro has kept the faith  year after year, not only with women of America, but with the families  and children of America who rely on women's wages for the quality of  their lives, and their partners', and their spouses'.   I thank the gentlewoman, Rosa DeLauro, for all that she has done for  our country in keeping the faith.   I also thank my dear friend and my colleague from my neighboring  State of Virginia, Chairman  Bobby Scott, for his faithfulness, for his  focus, and for his bringing this bill to the floor so early in our  session.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to observe April 2, which is Equal  Pay Day. It is a day symbolizing how far into the year women must work  to earn what men earned in the previous year--essentially, 3 months of  free labor. Not in this body, because we are all paid the same in this  body. We comply with this bill. That is the good news.   The bad news is, women, on average, have to work not 12 months but 15  months to earn what men earn in 12 months. That is what that language  meant.   I urge my colleagues to vote today to make this the last Equal Pay  Day and pass this bill to ensure the promise of economic equality for  all.   We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all--drop the ``men''-- that all are created equal. That view maybe self-evident, but it is not  self-executing. Let us act upon it today.
