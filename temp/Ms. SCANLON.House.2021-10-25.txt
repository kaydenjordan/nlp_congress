 Madam Speaker, for millions of Americans, a minor or  decades-old criminal record can pose an insurmountable barrier to full  employment, housing, and education. All too often, individuals in this  situation are unable to get a fresh start because having eligible  records sealed or expunged is so burdensome or expensive.   Bureaucratic delays and high legal fees perpetuate the cycle of  poverty and make it more difficult for people to transition back into  society successfully after being incarcerated.   That is why I was proud to join Representative   David Trone and a  bipartisan group of our colleagues from the House and the Senate to  introduce legislation last week to help these Americans get the second  chances they deserve.   The Fresh Start Act of 2021 provides Federal grants for States with  record sealing or expungement procedures to help improve their  automated record infrastructure.   As we rebound from a once-in-a-century pandemic and in the name of  fairness and equity, we need to eliminate barriers to employment and  champion opportunities for our communities to recover and thrive.                            ____________________
