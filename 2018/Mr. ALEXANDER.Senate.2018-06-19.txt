 Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from  Delaware for his customary leadership. He has been wise to come up with  this idea.   In some cases, the Corps of Engineers has completed projects under  budget. The Corps had excess non-Federal funds paid by the project's  sponsor.   His amendment, which I am happy to cosponsor, requires the Corps to  provide a list of all the projects that have been completed and have  excess non-Federal funds that have not been returned to the project  sponsor put on that list. It also requires the Corps to provide a final  accounting for each project and the status of the Corps' plan to return  the excess non-Federal funds. It does not increase Federal spending. It  is intended to ensure that the Corps returns excess non-Federal funds  to project sponsors in a timely manner.   Let me thank the Republican and Democratic staffs for working with us  through the morning in the customary smooth way to get an  appropriations bill on the floor.   This is the first vote on the appropriations bills this week. We will  vote on the Coons-Gardner amendment first and then on the Carper- Alexander amendment second. We have several other amendments waiting  for consideration. Senators Thune and Durbin  [[Page S4022]]  have one that should be filed shortly; Senators Hatch and Udall, the  same. We hope to have more votes later this afternoon, hopefully in the  area of 5 o'clock. That will be up to the majority leader and the  Democratic leader, but we will let Senators know about that.   Senators Boozman, Daines, and I, and our Democratic colleagues hope  that Senators and their staff will file today any amendments they wish  to have included in these three appropriations bills.                   Amendment No. 2914 to Amendment No. 2910    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 2914  and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be  10 minutes of debate and that following the use or yielding back of  that time, the Senate vote in relation to the Gardner amendment and the  Carper amendment and that there be no second-degree amendments in order  to the amendments prior to the votes.    Mr. President, Senator Coons has already spoken.   I yield back all time on this side.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators and  staffs, the leadership staffs are talking now about the possibility of  a vote at about 4:45 this afternoon on a proposal by Senator Crapo and  Senator Whitehouse, which would be a pilot program for advanced reactor  fuel. I am saying this just for the information of Senators. The vote  is not set yet, but we are hopeful that it will be. As soon as we have  final clearance, we will let Senators know.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, we  are hoping within the next few minutes to have clearance from the  leadership to be able to move ahead on a vote this afternoon on an  amendment by Senator Crapo and Senator Whitehouse involving a pilot  program for advancing reactor fuel.   Senator Crapo would like to be recognized when I sit down in order to  briefly comment on that amendment. Following that, I ask unanimous  consent that Senator Menendez be recognized.   Hopefully, by the time Senator Menendez is finished, we will have  clearance for the vote, and we can proceed to the vote.    Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for  a moment for a scheduling announcement.    For the information of Senators, there will not be a  vote tonight on the Crapo-Whitehouse amendment. We have at least one  Senator who is still studying the bill, but we believe that will be  cleared up shortly. Our goal would be to have votes tomorrow morning at  about 10 o'clock on the Crapo-Whitehouse amendment, as well as an  amendment by Senator Baldwin. Both of those are subject to being  approved by the leadership staff. Only they can announce the scheduling  of a vote.   For the information of Senators, there will not be a vote tonight,  and there will be a vote on at least one to three amendments tomorrow  morning, hopefully, at about 10 o'clock.   Senator Crapo already has spoken about the Crapo-Whitehouse  amendment, which is a pilot program for advanced reactor fuel. It is a  very good idea. It is not reauthorizing a new program. It is not  spending any more money. It is reallocating money for a very creative  idea that Senator Whitehouse and Senator Crapo have come up with. I  fully support it. I think the Senators on both sides of the aisle will  see the wisdom of it once everyone has a chance to consider it. I am  glad Senator Whitehouse is here to talk more about it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island  for his idea. This is a creative idea on his part.   I would like to give credit to Senator Crapo and Senator Risch from  the State of Idaho. Idaho has our nuclear laboratory, among our 17  National Laboratories, and the work that we are talking about would be  done in Idaho.   The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, which was  approved almost unanimously in the Appropriations Committee a few weeks  ago, approved $10 million for the kind of work that Senator Whitehouse  just described. It is a pilot program to recycle the Navy's spent  nuclear fuel and use the recovered uranium to supply high-assay low- enriched uranium for advanced reactors. That is already in the bill.  This amendment by Senators Whitehouse, Crapo, and Risch would add an  additional $5 million to the pilot program. The additional $5 million  is being reallocated from fuel cycle research and development and does  not increase the overall spending in the bill.   In looking ahead to tomorrow, the leaders' offices are still talking,  but our expectation is that we will have at least two votes tomorrow at  about 10 o'clock. One would be on the Crapo-Whitehouse-Risch amendment,  which we have just described. The second would be on the Baldwin- Portman amendment, which has been considered. Hopefully, we will have  other appropriations amendments during the day.   I encourage Senators and their staffs to file tonight, if at all  possible, the amendments they have to these three appropriations bills,  because the majority leader has said that he would like to finish our  work this week.   While there is an opportunity for offering amendments, as Senators  know, most amendments that Senators can think of have already been  dealt with. I speak from experience on our own subcommittee, the Energy  and Water Development Subcommittee, and then on the full Appropriations  Committee, which includes 31 Senators. We have heard, in our case, from  83 different Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. We have  heard their suggestions just as in the case of Senator Whitehouse's  idea about a pilot program for advanced reactor fuels. We have already  heard from him about that and from Senator Crapo and Senator Risch, and  we have included it in the base bill. What we will do tomorrow, if we  have another vote, is to simply add $5 million to it from another  account without increasing the amount of spending.   There are a great many amendments that Senators have offered that are  already a part of the Energy and Water Development bill. That is why I  think it has such strong support on the subcommittee, the committee,  and the floor. Yet, if there are additional amendments that relate to  the bill, particularly if they are bipartisan amendments, we would like  for them to be filed tonight so they can be considered tomorrow.   It is my hope that before we close tonight, the leaders will  authorize the announcements of votes tomorrow morning on two amendments  at about 10 o'clock.   I yield the floor.   Seeing no other Senator on the floor, I suggest the absence of a  quorum.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
