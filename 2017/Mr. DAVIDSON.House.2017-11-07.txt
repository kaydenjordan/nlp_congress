 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as an Army veteran and former Army Ranger, I am proud to  join Representative Stivers, Representative Beatty, and really the Ohio  delegation in today's designation of the Veterans Memorial and Museum  in Columbus, Ohio, as the National Veterans Memorial and Museum. I am  thankful to all my colleagues and the work of the committee to do this  not just as something for Ohio, but something for our Nation and for  our Nation's veterans.   This museum is squarely focused on telling the personal stories of  those who have served, including those who have lost their lives  serving our country. The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will be  the only one of its kind that uses personal belongings, letters, and  memories to bring the stories of our servicemembers and their families  to life.   In addition to world class interactive exhibits that will serve to  educate the next generation about the value of military service, this  project will also be connected to an online database featuring the  collection.   The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will also serve to honor  our men and women in uniform by providing space for celebrations, and  veterans ceremonies and reunions.   Ohio has a proud history of honoring our Nation's veterans and  supporting our current men and women in uniform. Ohio is home to  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the National Museum of the United  States Air Force, and was recently selected as the United States  Veterans Affairs National Archives. It is fitting that Ohio should be  the place for telling these stories.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan support on this bill and I  urge my colleagues to support it.
