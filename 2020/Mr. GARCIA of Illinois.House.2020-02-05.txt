 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Joyce and Chairwoman Napolitano  for their leadership on this matter. I rise today in support of the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act to protect and improve the  health of the Great Lakes and directly benefit the surrounding region.   I hail from Chicago and the Nation's gold coast along Lake Michigan.  We know how important a healthy Great Lakes system is. Lake Michigan is  not only Chicago's primary drinking water source, it is part of the  largest freshwater source in the world, our beloved Great Lakes. Lake  Michigan is a tremendous recreational resource and economic asset for  Chicago and the State of Illinois.   Longstanding concerns, like the potential of Asian carp migrating  into the lake, underscore the importance of advancing this important  legislation.   This bill will support many projects important to the region. Chicago  public schools, for example, were able to install green infrastructure  and new community space at four elementary schools. The project added  1.2 million gallons of onsite stormwater storage capacity to reduce  stormwater runoff throughout Chicago.   In Beach Park, Illinois, a project helped stabilize and protect  streambed habitat. This, in turn, reduced nutrient pollution, sediment  runoff, and increased water quality in both Bull Creek and Lake  Michigan.   This bill will provide a much-needed increase in funding for the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to support the continued restoration  of coastal wetlands, the preservation of water quality, and the control  of invasive species.   H.R. 4031 will protect the Great Lakes for future generations. I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation. I thank Chairwoman  Napolitano and Representative Joyce for advancing this important  measure.  [[Page H802]]
