 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 71, I call  up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 41) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule  submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to  ``Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers'', and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 71, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 41         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange       Commission relating to ``Disclosure of Payments by Resource       Extraction Issuers'' (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 49359 (July       27, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for  1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Financial Services.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the joint resolution under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the joint resolution under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 41,  introduced by the gentleman from Michigan, (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored  Enterprises of the Committee on Financial Services.   This resolution disapproves a burdensome and controversial Securities  and Exchange Commission rule that places an unfair burden on American  public companies that is not applied to many of their foreign  competitors.   Virtually every day we hear from many Americans about how this  economy is just not working for them. It is just not working for  working Americans like Keith from Dallas in my district who wrote me:  ``I am 53. I have a grown son who lives with me. It seems like the cost  of everything keeps going up, yet wages do not keep pace.''   The economic opportunities of Keith and millions of Americans like  him are not helped by top-down, politically driven regulations that  give many foreign companies an advantage over American public  companies.   That is exactly what this Securities and Exchange Commission  regulation that we are talking about today does. It forces American  public companies to disclose inexpensive proprietary information that  can actually be obtained by their foreign competitors, including state- owned companies in China and Russia. This is just one regulation out of  thousands and thousands that are burdening our companies, our job  creators, and are costing our households, by one estimate, over $14,000  a year, Mr. Speaker.   Even though this is a Securities and Exchange rule, section 1504 of  Dodd-Frank has nothing to do with investor protection nor anything else  we were told the Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to do. As the acting  chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, this rule  ``neither reforms Wall Street nor provides consumer protection and it  is wholly unrelated, and largely contrary, to the Commission's core  mission.''   In addition, Mr. Speaker, the SEC estimates that ongoing compliance  costs for this rule could reach as high as $591 million per year. It is  just an outrage, Mr. Speaker. That is $591 million every year that  could better be used to hire thousands more Americans in an industry  where the average pay is 50 percent higher than the U.S. average.  Literally we could be talking about 10,000 jobs on the line for this  ill-advised rule. This is significant, given that millions of  Americans, like Keith from my district, have not seen their wages  increase while our economy has been stymied under the Obama  administration.   Now, for those who claim that somehow by rolling back this rule, that  this undermines anticorruption efforts, let me remind everyone that Mr.  Huizenga's resolution, that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which  the SEC and the Department of Justice administer, already makes it  illegal to pay former government officials when it comes to winning or  maintaining business opportunities.  [[Page H849]]    To further prove the point, Mr. Speaker, just this year the SEC has  brought enforcement actions or settled four separate cases for  violations of this anticorruption law. So even without this SEC rule,  fraud will still be fraud, corruption will still be corruption, and  both will still be illegal. The SEC and the Department of Justice will  still have the authority to vigorously pursue those who break the law  and hold them accountable, as they well should. So no one, Mr. Speaker,  should fall for this false argument of our opponents.   Let's also remember that this joint resolution does not repeal  section 1504 of Dodd-Frank. I wish it did, but it doesn't. Rather, it  vacates a flawed SEC rule that mimics a previous rule that was already  struck down by a U.S. District Court. It is a rule that by the SEC's  own estimates has taken 51 employees over 20,000 hours to promulgate,  defend, and repromulgate. Fifty-one employees, 20,000 hours that could  have been directed at rooting out Ponzi schemes, that could have been  used to promote capital formation or make our capital markets more  efficient.                                time  1515    Furthermore, this rule still goes far beyond the statute passed by  Congress and mandates public specialized disclosures that cost more and  more, and is more burdensome than the law requires.   So, Mr. Speaker, for those who religiously defend the Dodd-Frank law,  they should be in vigorous support of what Mr. Huizenga brings to the  floor today because the rule flies in the face of the Dodd-Frank Act.  So when an agency exceeds its statutory authority, it is no longer  regulating, Mr. Speaker, it is legislating. And all of us, Republicans  and Democrats alike, should be able to agree that when the executive  branch acts in such a manner, Congress has a duty, a duty under article  I of the Constitution, to check this executive overreach.   As such, this House should wholeheartedly support Mr. Huizenga's  resolution. It simply tells the SEC to go back to the drawing board,  comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, and come up with a better role that  will not put American public companies at an unfair disadvantage and  cost us jobs.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   H.J. Res. 41 would roll back the SEC's rule that implemented an  important congressional mandate in Dodd-Frank requiring oil, gas, and  mining companies to publicly disclose payments made to foreign  governments for access to their natural resources.   That rule helps fight corruption in the extractive industries sector,  provides investors with crucial information on their investments, and  enables citizens to demand greater accountability from their  governments for spending that serves the public interest. It also helps  to diminish the political instability in resource-rich countries, which  is not only a threat to investment but also to our own national  security.   Specifically, the disclosure rule enables shareholders to make better  informed assessments of opportunity costs, threats to corporate  reputation, and the long-term prospects of the companies in which they  invest.   In addition, opening the extractive industries to greater public  scrutiny is key to increasing civil society participation in resource- rich countries, which are often underdeveloped countries that are  politically unstable, rife with corruption, with a history of civil  conflict fueled, in part, by natural resources.   Moreover, the SEC's rule is a reasonable disclosure and places no  limits or restrictions on who companies can pay money to, how much, or  what for. After 5 years of robust debate and input, the final rule  accommodated a number of industry concerns, providing companies with a  generous 4-year phase-in period and a case-by-case exemption process  for companies that face implementation challenges. The SEC also allowed  companies to comply with the disclosure by using a report prepared for  other substantially similar disclosure regimes, which include regimes  in the European Union and Canada.   Nevertheless, Republicans continue to claim that the SEC's rule is  harmful and puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage to  their foreign competitors.   Well, Mr. Speaker, they are entitled to their own set of opinions,  but they are not entitled to their own set of facts. I suppose these  are alternative facts.   The truth is that U.S. companies are not the only ones required to  make these disclosures. Many foreign companies must report under the  U.S. rules, including a number of state-owned oil companies, such as  China's PetroChina and Sinopec, and Brazil's Petrobras.   Also, after the SEC issued its initial rule in 2012, the rest of the  world followed our lead, establishing a global standard for the public  disclosure of extractive payments companies make to governments.   A wave of transparency laws have been adopted in foreign markets that  mirror the U.S. law. This includes legislation in the European Union,  Norway, and Canada, which are all now in force. These laws cover the  vast majority of oil, gas, and mining companies that compete with U.S.  firms.   Now, leading global oil companies like BP, Shell, and Total, as well  as Russia's state-owned companies--Gazprom, Rosneft, and Lukoil--are  entering their second year of reporting under EU rules without any  negative impact.   So contrary to Republican claims, U.S. and foreign companies already  compete on a more level playing field here and abroad. Therefore,  rolling back the SEC's disclosure rule would directly undermine the  interests of extractive companies in having a level playing field.   Worse, once the rule is nullified by this resolution, the SEC would  not be able to put another rule in place that is substantially similar.  This would create different reporting regimes directly contravening  what companies have requested from the SEC. And, the SEC final rule  accommodated industry concerns by including a generous phase-in period.  U.S.-listed companies are not required to report until 2019. The rule  also provides for case-by-case exemptions if covered companies face any  implementation issues.   Therefore, the rule does not put U.S. companies at a competitive  disadvantage, nor does it impose an unreasonable compliance burden.   I would also point out to my Republican colleagues the importance of  the SEC's disclosure rule in protecting U.S. national security and  energy security interests.   Specifically, it helps protect U.S. national security interests by  helping prevent the corruption, secrecy, and government abuse that has  catalyzed conflict, instability, and violent extremist movements in  Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.   As ISIS demonstrated, nonstate actors can benefit from trading  natural resources in order to finance their operations. Project-level  disclosures in the rule will make hiding imports from nonstate actors  more difficult, thereby limiting their ability to finance themselves  with natural resource revenues.   Corruption and mismanagement of oil revenues destabilizes regions and  leads to conflict. And, resource-rich countries like Venezuela, Iraq,  and Angola are considered to be among the top ten countries perceived  to be the most corrupt according to Transparency International.    In addition, transparency of Russian companies and its extractive  industry is critical. The SEC's rule would create transparency of Exxon  and other company payments to the Russian Government. Gazprom, Rosneft,  and Lukoil are already disclosing under the U.K. rules, and BP has  already reported payments to the Russian Government. The SEC's  disclosure rule will make a crucial contribution as Russian citizens  seek to follow the money received by their government.   A vote to roll back the SEC's resource extraction disclosures would  be a vote to abandon U.S. leadership in the fight against global  corruption.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.J.

One is a Bloomberg  article, entitled: ``Exxon Set for Early Victory As Congress to Rescind  Payments Rule.'' The other one is a Politico Magazine article that  says: ``Tillerson tried to get this rule killed. Now Congress is about  to do it for him.'' The other article is a Washington Post article:  ``One of House GOP's first targets for regulatory rollback is tops on  the oil industry's wish list.''                 [From Bloomberg Government, Jan. 30, 2017]      Exxon Set for Early Victory as Congress To Rescind Payments Rule                          (By Catherine Traywick)         For years the oil industry has appealed to the executive       branch and courts to de-fang a U.S. rule forcing Exxon Mobil       Corp., Chevron Corp. and other producers to disclose their       payments to foreign governments.        Now, the Republican takeover in Washington is handling it       for them.        The House of Representatives is set to vote this week on       killing a Securities and Exchange Commission edict that       requires publication of overseas payments by oil, natural gas       and mining companies. The industry says the rule, part of the       2010 Dodd-Frank act, gives global rivals a competitive edge.       Backers say it will help keep payments to foreign nations in       government coffers, not private pockets.        ``To roll it back would be a complete abdication of U.S.       initiative and leadership on issues of corruption,'' said       Daniel Kaufmann, president of the Natural Resource Governance       Institute, an International transparency watchdog.        The SEC rule, set to take effect next year, is one of a       series of Obama administration regulations Republican       lawmakers are trying to reverse using the Congressional       Review Act, a law that allows Congress to undo regulations       with a simple majority vote.        Congress also plans to vote this week to kill rules curbing       methane venting and mountain-top mining. To do so, both       chambers must pass a resolution disapproving the rules, which       the president would then have to sign. While President Barack       Obama would have reliably vetoed such resolutions, President       Donald Trump is likely to sign it.        Trump argues that curbing regulations is key to unleashing       investment by U.S. companies. He pledged to rescind two       existing regulations for each new one that's issued.        ``The SEC's rule forces U.S. companies to disclose       proprietary information to its competitors while foreign       entities do not. This can give some large industry players an       advantage on future business projects,'' the American       Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said in a statement.        House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged in a Wall       Street Journal op-ed, to ``take the ax'' to the SEC rule,       which he characterized as ``an unreasonable compliance       burden.''        Transparency advocates dismiss that argument, pointing out       that the European Union and U.K. already require such       disclosures from some of Exxon's biggest competitors. BP Plc,       Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell are among those that annually       report taxes, bonuses and other payments to foreign       governments.                                U.S. Advantage         Because Exxon and Chevron aren't listed on the European       exchanges, they don't have to comply with the EU disclosure       rules. That may give them an edge over other oil majors who       must report project-level payments, critics say.        In its 2015 disclosure to the UK, Rosneft reported $29.8       million in payments to the Russian Federation, Vietnam,       Brazil and Norway. In the same year, BP reported $15.2       billion in payments to 23 countries, Total disclosed $16.7       billion to 44 countries, and Shell reported $21.8 billion to       24 countries.        The idea behind the measure is simple: If foreign oil       companies disclose payments of $1 million to the government       of Country X, then the lawmakers and citizens of Country X       will know that $1 million should show up on the country's       budget. If less shows up, that means it has been diverted for       private use.        ExxonMobil and Chevron say they support financial       transparency in the oil sector. Both are members of an       advisory committee under the Interior Department that       oversees a voluntary corporate financial disclosure program.                                 sec comments         In comments to the SEC, the companies say they would       support a version of the regulation that protected company-      specific data. They argue that the current SEC rule would       make available potentially valuable company information to       state-owned competitors such as Saudi Aramco and Cnooc Ltd.,       neither of which are subject to the disclosure rules.        The American Petroleum Institute successfully challenged an       earlier version of the rule in court, forcing the SEC to       rewrite it.  [[Page H856]]       API asked the agency to consider a reporting model that       detailed payments by resource type and production method--      omitting company-specific data. But, the SEC didn't adopt       that approach.        ``The SEC largely ignored industry's comments,'' said Exxon       spokesman Bill Holbrook. While the final rule included       exemptions for acquired companies and exploratory activities,       it ``remains based on the EU's model and likely will       adversely affect the ability of publicly-traded companies to       compete globally,'' he said.        A Chevron spokesperson did not respond to a request for       comment.                             pattern of behavior         Transparency advocates say they're concerned that the       repeal effort is part of a pattern of behavior among       Republican lawmakers.        ``The GOP that tried to gut the ethics committee is trying       to gut a critical anti-corruption law,'' said Jana Morgan,       director of the advocacy group Publish What You Pay. ``It       sends a really disturbing message.''        The planned vote is generating tension among members of the       anti-corruption advisory committee on which Exxon, Chevron       and API sit. The panel, made up of representatives from       government, industry and civil society, publishes an annual       report detailing U.S. government revenues from the oil,       natural gas and mining industries, as well as voluntarily       reported payments made to the U.S. government from companies       in those sectors.        Civil society members of the committee say Exxon's       opposition to the SEC rule jeopardizes its standing on the       panel. At a meeting on Wednesday, members will discuss       whether Exxon, Chevron and API should keep their seats at       all.        ``I really have to question whether it's appropriate for       companies like Exxon and Chevron and API to continue to sit       around this table,'' said Zorka Milin, an attorney with the       anti-corruption group Global Witness, and a member of the       advisory committee.                                   ____                    [From POLITICO Magazine, Feb. 1, 2017]  Tillerson Tried To Get This Rule Killed. Now Congress Is About To Do It                                  for Him                           (By Michael Grunwald)         The leader of the world's most valuable company doesn't       typically fly to Washington to fight one obscure amendment to       a 2,300-page bill, especially a motherhood-and-apple-pie-      style amendment designed to prevent and expose corruption       abroad. But back in 2010, ExxonMobil's then-CEO, Rex       Tillerson, was deeply worried about Section 1504 of the Dodd-      Frank Wall Street reforms, a bipartisan amendment that       required drilling and mining companies to disclose any       payments they make to foreign governments. So Tillerson and       one of his lobbyists paid a half-hour visit to the       amendment's Republican co-author, then-Sen. Richard Lugar, to       try to get it killed.        Tillerson argued that forcing U.S. oil firms to reveal       corporate secrets--such as paying foreign governments--would       put them at a competitive disadvantage. He also explained       that the provision would make it especially difficult for       Exxon to do business in Russia, where, as he did not need to       explain, the government takes a rather active interest in the       oil industry. But Lugar believed greater transparency could       help alleviate the ``resource curse'' of corruption that       plagues so many mineral-rich countries, so he told Tillerson       they would have to agree to disagree. Section 1504 stayed in       the bill, the bill became law, and the disclosure requirement       became an international example: France, Canada and the       United Kingdom all went on to use it as a model for similar       rules.        Seven years later, Republicans are preparing to confirm       Tillerson today as President Donald Trump's secretary of       State, despite allegations that he's too cozy with Russia. At       the same time, the GOP is preparing to try to kill the       disclosure rule created under Section 1504, despite warnings       from international aid groups that the move would provide a       wink-and-nod blessing to hidden corporate payments to petro-      thugs. The House is expected to act Wednesday afternoon, and       since the move relies on a special mechanism for reversing       rules enacted late in a presidential term, Senate Republicans       will need a mere majority rather than a filibuster-proof 60       votes to follow suit.        So after all of Trump's promises to drain the swamp, an       anti-anti-corruption bill pushed by Big Oil and his own top       diplomat might be the first policy legislation to reach his       desk.        ``It would be a real tragedy for democracy and human       rights,'' says Lugar, the former chairman of the Senate       Foreign Relations Committee, who now leads a center in his       name focusing on global issues. ``It's hard to believe this       would be such a high priority right now.''        The so-called resource extraction rule is not one of       President Barack Obama's most prominent legacies, but one       reason getting rid of it is such a high Republican priority       is that it's one of his most vulnerable legacies. That's       because it was only finalized last June; two weeks too late       to avoid scrutiny under the Congressional Review Act, a law       allowing Congress to strike down end-of-term regulations with       simple majorities. The CRA has only been used once before,       when Congress erased a Clinton-era workplace ergonomics rule       in 2001. But now that the Republicans have control of both       houses of Congress and the White House, they hope to use the       CRA to wipe out a variety of Obama rules, starting Wednesday       with this and another measure opposed by extractive       industries, a ``stream protection'' rule restricting       discharges from mining operations.        Aside from anti-Obama politics, the other reason gutting       the Section 1504 rule is a high priority for Republicans is       that their supporters in the oil industry really hate it. In       fact, oil interests successfully sued to block an earlier       version of the rule, contributing to the delays that pushed       the final rule past the Congressional Review Act deadline.        On Tuesday, American Petroleum Institute president Jack       Gerard sent a letter to House leaders reiterating the       industry's longstanding complaints that the rule would damage       the competitiveness of U.S. firms. He noted that America       already has laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that       specifically ban U.S. firms operating abroad from making       illicit payments, describing the additional rule as       regulatory overkill. And he said the rule injected the       Securities and Exchange Commission into a ``social agenda       issue'' that had little to do with its mission of policing       fraud and protecting investors. By striking it down, Gerard       wrote, ``Congress can reclaim its authority, and in the       process protect American companies, workers, and investors.''        Tillerson alluded to those competitiveness arguments in his       written responses to Senate questions about his confirmation,       noting that since the Section 1504 rule would impose       restrictions on U.S.-based companies, part of his job as       secretary of State would be to make sure ``foreign companies       or investors do not get an unfair advantage by cheating or       keeping to a lower standard.'' But groups that specialize in       fighting global poverty and corruption argue that those       arguments make no sense now that foreign nations have adopted       similar rules; in fact, conglomerates like BP, Total and even       Russian oil majors listed in London have already filed       disclosures under those rules. A blog post on the issue on       Tuesday from Oxfam America--which sued the Obama       administration in 2014 for moving too slowly to revise the       rule after the initial effort was struck down in court--was       titled ``From Russia With Love,'' characterizing the GOP       effort as a gift to Vladimir Putin and other authoritarian       leaders of resource-rich countries.        ``Why would Congress want to take a stand for facilitating       corruption?'' asked Jana Morgan, director of Publish What You       Pay USA, a coalition of groups focused on accountability in       the extractive industries. ``Why would anyone want to help       the oil industry hide payments to kleptocracies?''        Lugar pointed out that in 2010, his amendment introducing       Section 1504 with Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin had a fair       amount of bipartisan support. But so far, no Republicans have       come out against the resolutions to strike it down, filed by       Bill Huizenga of Michigan in the House and Jim Inhofe of       Oklahoma in the Senate. If the GOP can cobble together a       majority for the resolution in the Senate, Democrats can       spend five hours of floor time delaying it, but they can't       stop it. And nobody seems to think that Trump, who had lunch       with Tillerson Wednesday, would veto it, regardless of his       fiery rhetoric about taking on special interests. The White       House did not respond to a request for comment.        Most of Obama's most important regulations, like his Clean       Power Plan to rein in greenhouse-gas emissions or other Dodd-      Frank financial rules designed to rein in Wall Street, were       completed early enough to avoid Congressional Review Act       challenges. Trump and the Republicans will have to take on       protracted legislative and judicial fights to kill those       rules. But there are plenty of less prominent late-term rules       that Republicans can take on if they're willing to devote the       floor time, on issues ranging from paid sick days for federal       contract workers to energy efficiency for ceiling fans to       carcinogenic beryllium in the workplace.        In general, the rules that are most likely to face       challenges are the rules that could cause problems for the       best-connected Republicans. And the kind of rules that       inspire impassioned lobbying campaigns by the CEOs of mega-      corporations like Exxon Mobil seem unlikely to survive in the       current Washington environment.        ``It's a tough political landscape,'' says Zorka Milin, a       senior legal adviser for the anti-corruption group Global       Witness. ``The issue of corruption ought to resonate with       both parties, but we know this won't be easy to stop.''                                   ____                   [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 2017]  One of House GOP's First Targets for Regulatory Rollback Is Tops on the                          Oil Industry's Wish List                             (By Steven Mufson)         One of the House Republicans' first targets for regulatory       rollback is torn from the oil industry's wish list:       eliminating recent Obama administration requirements that       oil, gas and mining companies divulge more information about       business payments they make to foreign governments.        A House resolution this week, which aims to scrap the       transparency rule imposed by the Securities and Exchange       Commission, is one of the first measures that seeks to use       the Congressional Review Act to undo regulations adopted       during the final months of the Obama administration.        And it comes at a potentially awkward moment for former       ExxonMobil chief executive  [[Page H857]]       Rex Tillerson, who opposed the SEC regulation and who is now       awaiting confirmation for the position of secretary of State.        The review act could be used to nullify regulations dating       back to June last year, experts on the law say.        In this case, the SEC drafted the regulation in response to       directions in the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.       The directive was in an amendment backed by Sen. Ben Cardin       (D-Md.) and then-Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.). ``Information       is power,'' Lugar said at the time. ``It is power for       shareholders and power for citizens living under oppressive       regimes.''        The SEC says that it would ``combat government corruption       through greater transparency and accountability.''        But the SEC's first version of the regulation was struck       down by a federal district court in the District of Columbia       after the American Petroleum Institute and U.S. Chamber of       Commerce filed suit in 2012. That prompted a second attempt       by the SEC. Because the final version was imposed near the       end of the Obama administration, it now falls within the time       frame that permits Congress and the president to use the       review act to undo the regulation.        The oil industry has been particularly incensed about the       regulation, complaining that the SEC rule would put them at a       competitive disadvantage to foreign firms and be unduly       expensive.        The SEC has argued that the rule would help fight       corruption not only by companies but by governments around       the world. It has also noted that global companies have begun       to provide, on a voluntary basis, more comprehensive       disclosures. In December 2015, then-commission member Luis A.       Aguilar said that at least two large resource extraction       companies were already providing payment disclosure on a       project basis, and at least one other major resource       extraction company was voluntarily providing other       disclosures.        ``Other global companies are also beginning to open their       books to permit a window into their resource extraction       payments to foreign governments,'' he said.        But Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum       Institute, said in an interview that big oil and gas       companies compete with state-owned companies that do not have       disclosure requirements and that the SEC rule would allow       those companies to win contracts after seeing what U.S. firms       pay.        ``We think it's a regulation that would have an unintended       consequence of hurting U.S. business's ability to compete,''       he said. He said the SEC's requirement that information be       provided on a project basis was particularly objectionable.        He also cited the SEC's own estimates of the cost the       regulation would impose on oil, gas and mining companies.       Gerard said compliance would cost between $96 million and       $591 million annually for the entire industry. On an       individual corporate basis, that would work out to $225,000       to $1.4 million a year, Gerard said.        ExxonMobil spokesman William F. Holbrook said ``the SEC       largely ignored industry's comments and published a notice of       a final rule that remains based on the [European Union's]       model and likely will adversely affect the ability of       publicly traded companies to compete globally.''        Other groups disagree. ``Rolling back this law will enable       the corruption President Trump told us all he would end,''       said Corinna Gilfillan, head of the U.S. office of Global       Witness, an advocacy group that targets environmental and       human rights abuses. ``The oil industry has been striking       backroom deals with dictators and tyrants for decades,       wrecking developing economies and the environment in the       process.''        She added that ``this law helps prevent it by making sure       people can see how much money is changing hands for their       resources, and who is really benefiting from those deals.''        The House resolution was introduced by Rep. Ken Buck (R-      Col.). The House might take it up as early as Wednesday or       later in the week.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely  surprised at how brazen our friends on the opposite side of the aisle  are. They come here on this floor today with this rule that they would  like to overturn. They have not been in committee. We have not had any  hearings. They have moved very, very quickly to do exactly what all of  these articles are discussing. They are concentrating on how to roll  back disclosure that the SEC had developed a rule for for the oil  industry.   And why are they trying to do this?   It is so interesting that this is happening on the same day that Mr.  Tillerson has just been voted on to be the Secretary of State for the  United States Government, the former CEO of Exxon; and I am going to  talk about that connection, which should cause a lot of people to be  concerned.   This government is not about disclosure. First of all, the President  of the United States refuses to disclose his income tax returns. I  didn't expect them to support disclosure of the oil industry to avoid  corruption.   As a matter of fact, they have the audacity to come here today and  say that it is too expensive to be honest. It costs too much money to  these huge billionaire oil companies to disclose, and somehow that is  going to prevent them from creating jobs. That is nonsense.   I would like to just show some connections here.   Both during his campaign and since his election, Donald Trump has  surrounded himself with people who have extensive ties to Vladimir  Putin and the Russian Government, and then we are going to see the  connection between Tillerson and the Russian Government. First of all,  let's look at this circle of people around him and their connection to  Russia.   Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, was a paid lobbyist  for Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian politician in Ukraine who fled  to Russia in 2014 and was subjected to U.S. sanctions related to  Russian aggression in Ukraine. Manafort has also been involved in  multimillion-dollar business deals with Russian and Ukrainian  oligarchs, which were reportedly the subject of an FBI inquiry.   The other person, Roger Stone, Trump's longtime friend, is reportedly  under investigation for possible links with Russia. He has denied ever  visiting Russia but admitted he had worked in Ukraine. Stone announced  in a speech last summer that he had spoken to WikiLeaks founder Julian  Assange, and Stone predicted that there would be additional leaked  documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.   Let's go to another person. Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security  Adviser, did a paid series of events in Moscow, including a speech and  appearance at a party for RT, a Kremlin-funded TV station, where he was  photographed sitting next to Vladimir Putin.   Trump's nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, was a  business partner of Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch and Putin  ally, in a major financial project involving the Bank of Cyprus.   Finally, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump's nominee and now  the person who has been voted by the Senate for Secretary of State,  signed a multibillion-dollar agreement with Russia in 2011 on behalf of  ExxonMobil for an oil drilling project in the Arctic. The project was  brought to a halt in 2014 as a result of the sanctions that were  imposed on Russia in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.   Putin personally awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship in 2013.  Don't forget, this President talked about lifting sanctions. Oh, you  can see the connection here.   In addition to that, I just want to point out that it comes as little  surprise that ExxonMobil is one of the leading companies in the fight  against the global initiative to enhance the transparency of extractive  industry payments made to foreign governments, given its long history  of engaging in questionable transactions with governments of oil-rich  countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, and  Chad.   The move to eviscerate the rule issued under section 1504 that we are  talking about here today makes clear that Republicans in Congress and  the Trump administration believe that profits are more important than  people and that fighting corruption is less important than enriching  oil, gas, and mining companies.   Without the SEC's extractive industry transparency rule, citizens  around the world will lose a critical tool for holding their  governments and corporations accountable for how natural resource  proceeds are used.   Let's talk about Nigeria. Just days before the Securities and  Exchange Commission issued its final rule pursuant to section 1504 of  the Dodd-Frank Act, Global Witness, a highly respected and good  governance NGO, issued a report detailing how a major oil deal, as I  referred to earlier, struck by ExxonMobil with the Nigerian Government,  was being investigated by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes  Commission, an agency charged with uncovering high-level corruption.                                time  1615    The investigation relates to a widely reported deal in which the  Nigerian Government in 2009 agreed to renew a  [[Page H858]]  40 percent share of three oil licenses from Mobil Producing Nigeria, a  wholly-owned subsidiary of ExxonMobil. This is all about the  billionaires. Just follow the dollars and you can see what this is all  about.   Little town, America, needs to know that this is not about them. This  is about these billionaires, and they will go to any extent to continue  to steal from them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Stewart). The gentleman from Texas has 3  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope that the American people are watching  this debate because it will certainly confirm their decision to deny  Democrats control of the House, to deny them control of the Senate, and  to deny them control of the White House.   Now, Mr. Speaker, their words may claim they care about jobs, but  their policies don't. That is what we are here to talk about, Mr.  Speaker, is jobs, and we are talking about a rule promulgated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission that can cost $591 million a year  and can cost us 10,000 jobs.   My friends on the other side of the aisle have been clearly tone deaf  to the pleas of the American people. They want to go back to work. They  are tired of part-time jobs. They are tired of stagnant paychecks. They  are tired of decimated savings. That is why they have turned to the  Republican Party, and that is why we are going to help give them a  healthy economy with policies, including rolling back this foolish rule  from the Securities and Exchange Commission, a rule that in a previous  iteration has already been struck down by courts.   Now, you listen to the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, and you  hear all this talk about corruption. It appears that some of my friends  on the other side of the aisle are ignorant that the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act is already in the Federal code. For those who do not  know, I have done the homework for you: 15 U.S.C. 78dd-1. Look it up  yourself.   So, Mr. Speaker, this has nothing to do with corruption. Rarely has  more of a red herring come across the House floor. Let me tell you what  this is really about, Mr. Speaker. It is about a radical, leftist, and  elitist agenda that promotes narrow special interests and has declared  war on carbon-based industry and energy and the industry and jobs that  are represented by it. That is what this is really about.   By the way, why is the Securities and Exchange Commission involved in  this? Why isn't this--listening to them--part of the Homeland Security  Department or maybe part of the Department of Defense? What will they  have the SEC do next, deliver the mail? Will they become our air  traffic controllers?   Meanwhile, there are Ponzi schemes taking place in America.  Meanwhile, we have markets that are not efficient creating the jobs  that the American people demand.   Let's vote for jobs. Let's vote to get America back to work. Let's  vote down this leftist, elitist agenda declaring war on carbon-based  jobs. Let's vote for H.J. Res. 41.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 71, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint  resolution.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third  time, and was read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on passage of H.J. Res. 41 will be followed by 5-minute  votes on passage of H.J. Res. 38, and agreeing to the Speaker's  approval of the Journal, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 235,  nays 187, not voting 10, as follows:                               [Roll No. 72]                                 YEAS--235       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Cuellar      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gonzalez (TX)      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green, Gene      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
