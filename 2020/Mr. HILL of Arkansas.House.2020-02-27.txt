 Mr. Speaker, 96 airstrikes, eight cluster bomb  attacks, 231 artillery and missile attacks--that is what the people in  Idlib, Syria, experienced yesterday from the forces of the brutal  dictator Assad and his Russian protector, Putin. These attacks hit 10  schools and one hospital, killing 26 and injuring over 100.   After nearly 10 years of death and destruction, Idlib is becoming the  greatest humanitarian disaster of this long conflict.   As I have said on this floor for nearly 3 years, the lack of a  comprehensive approach for U.S. policy in Syria has allowed the  atrocities led by Assad, Russia, and Iran to continue with impunity.   The U.S. Government must use the tools that we have at our disposal  to end the death and destruction in Syria, bring about a political  solution to the conflict, and hold those responsible for these war  crimes fully accountable.                            ____________________
