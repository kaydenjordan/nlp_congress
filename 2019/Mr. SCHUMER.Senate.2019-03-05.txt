 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, just briefly, I heard my good friend,  the Republican leader, decry H.R. 1. He called it the Democratic  protection act. Well, if making it easier for people to vote and  getting Big Money out of politics hurt the Republican Party and is good  for Democrats, what a sad commentary on the Republican Party that they  don't want to see people vote, make it easier to vote, and that they  don't want Big Money out of politics--a sad commentary on the  Republican Party to be afraid of H.R. 1.
