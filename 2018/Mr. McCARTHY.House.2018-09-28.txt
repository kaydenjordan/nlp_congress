 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of making a  scheduling announcement.   Members are advised that votes are no longer expected in the House  during the weeks of October 1 and October 8, 2018.   Now, I would also like to make another announcement. I would also  like to note that today is the 1-year anniversary of our friend, the  Majority Whip  Steve Scalise, returning to Congress after the attempt  on his life.   I will not forget the day of that shooting. Many of you may know-- Steve did not know at that moment--but Kevin Brady, Patrick, and I were  sitting with the doctor waiting for Jennifer to arrive. We celebrate  him coming back, but we didn't know that he was even going to make it.   Steve and I have been friends for more than 20 years, long before we  ever entered this floor. Steve had always had the strength and the  courage, and he is an example for a public servant and for all of us to  impart. I am just so glad that Steve is back with us.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Or the week after.    No.   I thank the gentleman for his question.   November 13, if I am correct, is the first time we will come back,  and hopefully we will come back in the same order we leave.
