 Madam Speaker, this is an important step towards the  enactment of the NO BAN Act, which would prevent overreach in a  President's authority to suspend the entry of noncitizens into the  United States under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality  Act.   As a candidate for President, Donald Trump promised to ban ``all  Muslims'' from entering the U.S., and he suggested without any evidence  that it would somehow make our country safer.   Immediately after his election and swearing in, he tried to deliver  on that promise by using section 212(f), claiming the admission of  individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries would be detrimental  to the U.S. interests.   In court, the Trump administration claimed the ban was necessary to  keep our country safe from terrorists. And yet, a bipartisan coalition  of former national security officials strongly rebuked those claims.   In addition to this ban, President Trump also relied on section  212(f) to circumvent clear statutory requirements related to asylum.  Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act specifically allows  individuals to apply for asylum ``whether or not they arrive at a  designated port of arrival.''   The law could not be clearer. But apparently unhappy with it, the  President invoked section 212(f) to categorically deny asylum to those  who cross the border between ports of entry rather than seeking to  amend the law by working with Congress.   This was an attempt to rewrite our Nation's immigration laws in  direct violation of the constitutional separation of powers. The power  to write the law is ours, not the President's.    Fortunately, this ban has now been reversed by President Biden, but  this bill is still important. It is important to take action to prevent  any future President from trying to usurp the legislative power of the  Congress.   I thank Representative Chu for her persistence in pursuing this bill,  and I think it is important to note that the President, if this bill  passes, retains ample authority to act in the national interests of the  United States to protect our security.   The bill allows the President to suspend the entry of individuals or  class of individuals if he determines that they would undermine the  security of the United States.   To be clear, under the current bill, if the President determines  there is a national security issue related to a particular country that  is so significant that it could only be addressed by suspending the  admission of all nationals of that country, the President could still  do so.   It is important that we also address the issue of children at the  border. This bill isn't about children at the border.    Madam Speaker, we can do more than one thing at once. We  need to make sure that the law is adhered to by the President. We also  need to deal with the issue of unaccompanied children at the border and  deal with the crisis in Central America that is causing it.  [[Page H2010]]         Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill that allows  individuals who have obviously valid travel documents to contact a  member of their family or counsel if they are held for an extended  period of time at a U.S. port of entry.   It has nothing to do with the inspection of contraband. It has  nothing to do with providing a lawyer at government expense. That is  prohibited. It has nothing to do with delaying the inspection. It is  only if it is practical for the CBP to allow this to occur.   The immigration laws are very complex and fact-intensive, and for  some people who are in secondary inspection for hours, providing a  piece of information to the CBP can clear things up.   Madam Speaker, I will give you an example of a researcher coming in  with a valid visa and the CBP wonders about that research: Is it true?  Being able to communicate with the president of the university where  the student is heading to can assure the CBP about the research and  would clear the matter up.   This bill does nothing to alter the existing authority of the CBP to  alter, to deny entry, or to issue an expedited removal order. It just  allows individuals to communicate with their American family, with  their employer, and with their counsel to help provide information.  There are many red herrings that have been offered about this bill, but  it is really about expediting a process that is impeded, oftentimes  because of lack of information. These are individuals who are coming  legally. It does not apply to people who are coming between ports of  entry.   The lack of communication can cause harm to American families.  Somebody who is coming to their American fiancee can be turned away.  Somebody who is coming to work for an employer who needs their  expertise could be turned away. Somebody who is coming to continue  their groundbreaking medical research could erroneously be turned away.   It is important that information be made available to the CBP, and  the way to do that is to make sure that individuals who are lawfully  attempting to enter the United States with an apparently valid visa at  a port of entry who has been held for secondary inspection have an  opportunity to communicate with their American family or with their  American boss or even a lawyer to get information that the CBP can then  consider, and if they are not persuaded it is valid, they can still  turn that individual around.   I think that the opposition is a bit overwrought.    Madam Speaker, I actually am surprised by some of the  things in the rhetoric that have been offered in opposition to what is  really just a commonsense, modest measure that will allow for  communication for people who have legal visas who have been held in  secondary inspection, so the confusion can be cleared up. It is  important, not just to the people trying to enter, but it is important  to Americans who are waiting for them--their families, their employers,  and their teachers.   Madam Speaker, I urge approval of this bill.
