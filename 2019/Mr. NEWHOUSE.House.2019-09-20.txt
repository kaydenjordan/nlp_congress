 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important  anniversary in our Nation's nuclear and military history.   At the start of the atomic age, thousands of men and women, our Cold  War patriots, moved to central Washington State to work on a top-secret  government project, building the world's first full-scale nuclear  reactor.   During World War II, Hanford, Washington, was selected as one of the  three sites for the Manhattan Project, and September 26 marks the 75th  year since the B Reactor went critical at the Hanford site.   Since then, the Tri-Cities has grown as a hub for innovation, with an  appreciation of the past and an excitement for the future, transforming  into the fastest growing economy in Washington State.   The B Reactor has been converted into the centerpiece of the  Manhattan National Historical Park, where all are welcome to experience  its history.   But the work at the Hanford site must continue as the Federal  Government has a moral and legal obligation  [[Page H7858]]  to clean up the country's largest nuclear waste site.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking the Cold War  patriots at Hanford for their important contributions to our country.                            ____________________
