 Mr. Speaker, 33 years ago today, we  lost the Space Shuttle Challenger.   I rise to remember and honor the seven crew members whose passion for  exploration has inspired generations of Americans.   On January 28, 1986, the 25th mission of the United States space  shuttle program was set to transport cargo and crew into orbit.  Tragically, the mission was cut short over the skies of Cape Canaveral.   More than three decades later, we remember the sacrifice of each crew  member: Dick Scobee, Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik,  Ronald McNair, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. Their legacy is  forever enshrined in our Nation's Capital with the Space Shuttle  Challenger Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery.   As President Reagan said in his address to the Nation: ``The  Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to  follow them.''   Mr. Speaker, may our American curiosity for space exploration never  fade, and as we continue to seek farther horizons, it is my hope that  we fuel the interest of future generations.   Today, we honor and remember the brave crew of the Space Shuttle  Challenger.                            ____________________
