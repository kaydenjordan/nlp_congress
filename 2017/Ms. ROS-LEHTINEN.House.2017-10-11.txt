 Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues' support for  the Senior Citizen Protection Act, which I introduced along with my  friend, Congressman Brad Schneider.   Seniors are valued members of our society, and we must do everything  we can to ensure that they can live with dignity and without fear of  being abused by those entrusted to care for them.   This bipartisan bill seeks to achieve that goal by creating a  national registry for those convicted of elder abuse that will be  accessible to senior care providers and families before they make a  decision on whom they hire as a caregiver for their loved ones. This  national database will bring together local and State registries in  order to prevent abusers from continuing to inflict suffering on senior  citizens by simply relocating from one community to another.   I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Schneider and me in support of this  measure that will help ensure that our parents, grandparents, and loved  ones are looked after by professional caregivers who will give them the  treatment and respect they deserve.                 Caring for Seniors During Natural Disasters     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the  Protecting Seniors During Disasters Act, which I introduced with my  colleague, Congresswoman Lois Frankel of Florida.   The horrific deaths of 14 seniors in a Florida nursing home facility  in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma made it abundantly clear that more  must be done to protect seniors during and after natural disasters.   In times of emergency, many senior citizens find themselves  disconnected from caregivers and without the treatments and resources  that they so desperately need. Our bill seeks to reconnect seniors by  requiring that Federal agencies assess how their emergency response  efforts impact the elderly. It also calls for the implementation of  standards to better protect and care for senior citizens and nursing  home residents across our Nation during and after emergency situations.   This is a commonsense, bipartisan legislative initiative that aims to  save the lives of many senior citizens and helps ensure that the  tragedy that took place in south Florida will not happen again. I urge  my colleagues to join us in support of this lifesaving measure.              Building a National Museum of the American Latino     Mr. Speaker, as we continue to celebrate Hispanic  Heritage Month and the many contributions of our vibrant community  throughout our country, I would like to bring attention to a bill that  I have sponsored that would permanently showcase the history and  stories of American Latinos.   H.R. 2911, the National Museum of the American Latino Act, will  establish a world-class educational institution on The National Mall  for the millions of visitors who come to our Nation's capital every  year eager to learn about American history.   Latinos have served our great country in every war dating back to  before the Revolutionary War and continue to proudly serve in our  military. They are small-business owners, job creators, TV stars,  athletes, and public servants.   An initiative over 20 years in the making, this museum would be a  visual representation of the difficulties that Latinos have overcome  leaving their home countries, whether to flee an oppressive communist  regime in my native homeland of Cuba, or Venezuela, or for the  opportunity to partake in the American Dream, as well as the  [[Page H7923]]  story of Hispanics who have made the U.S. their home for many  generations.   As the first Hispanic woman elected to the U.S. Congress, I am proud  to invite my colleagues to join me in this endeavor and cosponsor H.R.  2911, the National Museum of the American Latino Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my  constituent, Jesus A. Permuy, for a lifetime of service to our south  Florida community and to the cause of liberty in my native homeland of  Cuba.   Like my family and me and so many others in my congressional  district, Jesus was forced to flee Castro's brutal tyranny. Jesus  embraced his new life here in the United States and became involved in  numerous civic and community affairs while working to restore freedom  and democracy in Cuba.   In 1976, Jesus secured accreditation for the Christian Democratic  Movement of Cuba to speak before the U.N. Human Rights Commission in  Geneva.   For decades, Mr. Permuy has been involved in a number of human rights  advocacy organizations denouncing the systemic repression brought upon  the Cuban people by the evil Castro regime. Jesus founded the Center  for Human Rights in Miami. He is a dedicated husband, a proud father of  8 children, and a grandfather of 11 grandchildren. Jesus is a shining  example to us all.   Thank you, Jesus A. Permuy, for your service to our community and to  my native Cuba.                            ____________________
