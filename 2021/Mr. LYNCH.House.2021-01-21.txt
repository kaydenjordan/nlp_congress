 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 335, legislation to  allow President Biden to appoint General Lloyd J. Austin, III, as our  next Secretary of Defense. Throughout my tenure on the National  Security Subcommittee, I have had the personal opportunity to meet with  and interact with General Austin on numerous occasions in the field  during the course of several of our oversight investigations.                                time  1500    Beginning in the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom, we met  in Kabul, Afghanistan, during his deployment as commander of Combined  Joint Task Force 180. I dealt with General Austin again in the midst of  Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as during Operation New Dawn. We also  met in Baghdad during his multiple deployments as commander of the  Multinational Corps and commander of United States Forces-Iraq.   And I have personally received multiple intelligence briefings from  General Austin in his capacity as commander of U.S. Central Command. By  the way, he was the first African American to lead that critically  important combat command.   Throughout the congressional investigations into the progress of U.S.  military diplomatic and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq,  Syria, and other regional conflicts, General Austin has never failed to  provide us with direct access to the battlefield and the straight and  honest and hard facts as he saw them on the ground.   His assessment proved to be critical to our oversight mission and the  development of legislation concerning U.S. defense, national security,  and counterterrorism policies.   He always demonstrated a maximum respect for the constitutional  oversight role of the United States Congress and clearly held the  highest regard for the civilian leadership of the Department of  Defense.   Mr. Speaker, General Austin is especially qualified and deserving of  a congressional exemption that will allow President Biden his  appointment as Secretary of Defense. I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support H.R. 335.
