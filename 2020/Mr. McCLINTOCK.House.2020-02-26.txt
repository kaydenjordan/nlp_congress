 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as was just described, H.R. 560 would extend Northern  Mariana Islands-only resident status for two groups of foreign  nationals: individuals who came to Northern Mariana Islands as  transitional workers in 2015, and individuals who have resided  [[Page H1204]]  in the Northern Mariana Islands with an investor status.   These individuals were excluded from a June 2019 law that allowed  other classes of current Northern Mariana Islands workers to remain in  the territory. If signed into law, H.R. 560 would allow approximately  3,000 additional foreign nationals to remain there long term.   Now, bear in mind that the entire population of the Northern Mariana  Islands is about 55,000, so just this addition of foreign nationals  comprises about 5 percent of the entire population of the islands.   While I appreciate the majority did take this bill through regular  order, I am still disappointed that it has not been willing to work  with the Department of Homeland Security or even wait for it to  consider the impact of the bill before moving it to the floor.   As the Department of Homeland Security is charged with managing  programs that allow foreign nationals to work in the Northern Mariana  Islands and elsewhere, I believe it is critical to have their views on  something they will be charged with executing.   Further, it is my continued hope that this body remains committed to  promoting an American workforce rather than that of a foreign one.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 2427 reauthorizes appropriations at current levels for the  Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 taking us through the year 2025.   Much of the early history of our country was written on the  Chesapeake Bay. Eight recognized American Indian Tribes maintain  ancestral homes there. It is the site of Jamestown and the early  English settlements. It was a center for the great Yankee trading  ships, the birthplace of George Washington, the site of Fort McHenry,  and the main line of the Underground Railroad which took so many to  their freedom.   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network, originally  authorized through the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, set up a  network of Chesapeake Bay-related sites such as parks, wildlife  refuges, and trails. The program includes 160 sites in six States and  the District of Columbia. The National Park Service provides matching  grants for projects that enhance public education about and access to  the Chesapeake Bay.   At a time when so many are losing touch with our country's proud  heritage--or even denigrating that heritage--it is all the more  important to keep alive the memory of those great days that set the  American Nation on its path to prosperity and freedom.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This coming August 18 will mark the 100th anniversary of the  ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which, after a  century of earnest protest, extended the right to vote to all women.   Forty years before that, suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote  admiringly to Lucretia Mott. She was born in 1793 during President  Washington's administration. At the time that Elizabeth Cady Stanton  wrote to her, she was in her 88th and final year of life. Mott was a  Quaker, a major voice in the abolitionist movement, and later in the  suffragette movement. Reflecting on her leadership in these just causes  and the effect that it had on the entire Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton  said:         One who has lived 88 years, reflecting ever the sober       virtues of the true wife and mother, the earnest reformer,       the religious teacher, both in the schoolroom and Friends       Meeting, must have exerted a strong influence for good on our       young, impressionable Nation. When we remember that every       word we utter, every act we perform, in all our waking hours,       the very atmosphere, the combination all our faculties       creates have their constant effect, on everyone who comes       within the circle of our individual influence, and through       them are wafted by word, by letter and by thought, to       innumerable other circles beyond, when we try to estimate all       this, we can in a measure appreciate the elevating influence       on a nation of just one grand life.    The Every Word We Utter Monument takes those words as a testament to  the patient influence of so many who finally won adoption of the 19th  Amendment, and with it, the fulfillment of American democracy. Those  early suffragettes, like Mott and Stanton, never lived to see the  culmination of their life's work, but the Every Word We Utter Monument  will ensure that their example and achievement is memorialized in  Washington, D.C., as are all of the great men and women and all of the  great deeds that built this country, as Lincoln said, into the last  best hope of mankind on this Earth.   This memorial, which will be built without use of Federal funds, will  serve as a lasting tribute to the brave and intelligent women who  fought to secure voting rights for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The statue of Chief Standing Bear can be found in this Capitol,  honored by the State of Nebraska as one of its favorite sons.   Chief Standing Bear led the Ponca Tribe through the crisis that began  with its displacement by a flood of westward-bound settlers encouraged  by the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Tribe was pressured to abandon its most  productive lands and, essentially, made wanderers by a series of broken  promises by the United States Government. When they sought refuge on  the Omaha Reservation, Chief Standing Bear and his surviving tribesmen  were arrested and detained at Fort Omaha, with no legal recourse.   The legal case that followed established, in 1879, the legal  principle that American Indians were indeed American citizens protected  under the Constitution and accorded all the due process rights  enshrined in it. During that case, the words of Chief Standing Bear,  pleading on behalf of his Tribe, moved the entire Nation and endure to  this day.   H.R. 2490, authored by Congressman Fortenberry, directs the Secretary  of the Interior to study the feasibility of designating the Chief  Standing Bear National Historic Trail. The Chief Standing Bear Trail,  extending approximately 550 miles from Nebraska to Oklahoma, follows  the route taken by Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca people during  their forced removal.   If supported by this study, any designation of the trail would  require additional action from the Committee on Natural Resources and  the Congress.   This legislation passed the House in the 114th Congress. It is long  overdue to become law.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the author of the measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 2819 would extend the  authorization of the Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation so  that it can construct the Gold Star Mothers National Monument.   The Gold Star Mothers of our Nation have sacrificed more on the altar  of liberty than any among us. They have lost their children so that our  children can be safe and sound and free.   No words can begin to express the debt that we owe to them. While  other families are celebrating Memorial Day with barbecues and  frivolities, Gold Star families are gathered around the hallowed graves  of their loved ones.   The monument contemplated by this legislation is a small recognition  of this. We do as much as we can to honor those who fall in defense of  our country and its Constitution, and well we should. But we don't do  nearly enough to honor those who they leave behind.   Our fallen heroes come from our communities, from our high schools  and churches, but most importantly, they come from the homes of loving  families. When we as a nation lose a soldier and a patriot, these  mothers lose a child. We must remember that for the families of these  fallen heroes, every day is Memorial Day.   Time, sadly, does not heal all wounds. The grief of our Gold Star  Mothers is just as great today as the day when the casualty officer  came to their door. Their loss is a heavy burden that they carry with  them every single day of their lives. Nonetheless, they persevere to  keep alive the spirit of their brave children.   Legislation signed into law during the 112th Congress authorized the  Gold Star Mothers National Monument Foundation to erect a monument on  Federal lands in our Capital City that would honor mothers whose  children gave that last full measure of devotion defending the United  States as part of our armed services. The extended authorization will  allow more time for the foundation to ensure that the monument's  construction and completion can be brought to fruition by 2027.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It is easy to joke about the nutria, more commonly called a ``swamp  rat,'' but their proliferation in regions like California is a growing  threat to water infrastructure throughout the State.   Louisiana has suffered this invasive species since the 1930s; the  Chesapeake since the 1940s. They are now proliferating in California,  where they destroy irrigation systems, undermine dams and levees, erode  riverbanks, displace native wildlife, and lay waste to aquatic  vegetation.   This legislation amends the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of  2003 and reauthorizes funding for the program until fiscal year 2025.  Currently, Maryland and Louisiana are the only States eligible for  funding, yet the problem is national. According to estimates, there  could be nearly a quarter million of these destructive creatures in  California within 5 years if we don't take action now.   California has enough problems of its own making to deal with. It  requires the same assistance as provided to other parts of the country  to control this invasive infestation, and this bill broadens the  eligibility nationwide to do so.   During committee consideration, this measure was amended to more  closely resemble the language included in my legislation, H.R. 5217,  the Water Optimization for the West Act, which makes this a national  program rather than an earmark.   I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Madam Speaker, after the gentleman's description, I  am going to resist the temptation to comment on the unique culinary  traditions of my friends in Louisiana.   In California, we don't want to eat them. We just want to get rid of  them. That is what this bill is all about.   I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the Yucca House National Monument is a  classic example of how the Antiquities Act is supposed to work.   President Woodrow Wilson designated 9.6 acres as a national  monument--I didn't say 9.6 million acres; I said 9.6 acres--in order to  protect an ancient American Indian archaeological site, the ruins of a  sprawling 600-room pueblo.   That is the real purpose of the Antiquities Act. That is the way it  is supposed to be used. It is there to protect small archaeological  sites for study and preservation. It is not there to set aside hundreds  of square miles of land just because we can.   The site was donated to the United States Government by the landowner  and subsequent owners who made available a small amount of additional  acreage as artifacts have been discovered.   H.R. 1492, by Congressman Tipton of Colorado, would make a further  boundary adjustment of about 160 acres of donated land adjacent to the  monument that encompasses additional sites and provides for better  public access.   Unlike many recent national monument designations, this one has the  strong support of the local communities affected and is focused on  preserving actual archaeological sites from antiquity.   This bill should serve as an example for how monument designations or  adjustments should be made, always with local collaboration and  support. I applaud my friend for his diligent work on this legislation.  I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the author of this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
