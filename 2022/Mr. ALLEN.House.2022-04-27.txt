 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my most sincere  congratulations to Scottie Scheffler for his decisive victory at this  year's Masters Tournament.   For 88 years, the world's greatest golfers have traveled to Georgia  to play the world's greatest golf course, the Augusta National. Every  April, sports fans across the world get a glimpse into the beauty and  majesty that Georgia's 12th District has to offer.   This year, after shooting 69 in the first round and 67 in the second,  Mr. Scheffler held on to a 3-stroke lead heading into the championship  on Sunday.   As he made that walk to the 18th green, there was no doubt Scottie  would walk away with that iconic green jacket, something every golfer  dreams about.   Thanks to his strong play, he also had the luxury of being able to 4- putt his way to victory, something else that every golfer dreams about.  But Scottie shouldn't worry. In the words of past winner Seve  Ballesteros, when they asked how in the world did he 4-putt 16, he  said: ``I miss. I miss. I miss. I make.''                            ____________________
