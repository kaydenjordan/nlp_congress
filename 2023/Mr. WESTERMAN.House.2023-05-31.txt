 Mr. Speaker, Section 321 of the Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 2023 (FRA) employs the term ``reasonably foreseeable'' in four  instances. The intent of using the term ``reasonably foreseeable'' in  subsection (a) of section 321, which amends section 102 of the National  Environmental Policy Act, is to narrow the scope of NEPA's  requirements. NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare ``a detailed  statement . . . on the environmental impact'' of any proposed federal  project ``significantly affecting the quality of the human  environment.'' 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i). This detailed statement is  colloquially known as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). At  present, NEPA requires that an EIS must include, inter alia, a detailed  statement on ``the environmental impact of the proposed agency action''  and ``any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should  the proposal be implemented[.]'' 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) and (ii).   Ultimately, in amending NEPA to include the concept of reasonable  foreseeability, Congress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v.  Marsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992). In Sierra Club, the court stated  succinctly that ``[n]ot all impacts need be discussed in exhaustive  detail. First, only those effects that are `likely' (or `foreseeable'  or `reasonably foreseeable') need be discussed . . . and, as in other  legal contexts. the terms `likely' and `foreseeable,' as applied to a  type of environmental impact, are properly interpreted as meaning that  the impact is sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary  prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision.'' Sierra  Club at 765 (internal citations omitted). Through use of the term  ``reasonably foreseeable'' in section 321 of the FRA, Congress intends  to narrow NEPA's scope by establishing in statute the ordinary prudence  standard with respect to NEPA analysis.   Section 321(a) of the FRA amends 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) and (ii)  with the intent to narrow the scope of what must be included in an EIS.  Clause (i) is amended from ``the environmental impact of the proposed  action'' to ``reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the  proposed agency action''. The intent of this amendment is to narrow the  scope from ``any environmental impact'', which can be broadly  construed, to only those ``environmental effects'' that would be a  ``reasonably foreseeable'' result ``of the proposed agency action.'' In  executing this amendment to NEPA. Congress seeks to clarify that an  agency need not evaluate all effects of a proposed action, but rather  only those effects that are ``reasonably foreseeable.''   Clause (ii) is amended from ``any adverse environmental effects which  cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented'' to ``any  reasonably foreseeable adverse environmental effects which cannot be  avoided should the proposal be implemented''. The intent of this  amendment is to narrow the scope from ``any adverse environmental  effects'', which can be broadly construed, to only those adverse  environmental effects that are also ``reasonably foreseeable.'' In each  of these instances, it is Congress's intent to enshrine in statute the  ordinary prudence standard with respect to the content of an EIS.   Similarly, section 321(b) of the FRA also employs the term  ``reasonably foreseeable'' in establishing in statute levels of review  under NEPA. By qualifying the ``significant effect'' with the term  ``reasonably foreseeable'', Congress again intends to employ the  ordinary prudence standard to make clear the circumstances in which an  agency must issue an EIS. Specifically, Congress intends to limit  preparation of an EIS to only those instances where the significant  effect on the quality of the human environment is also ``reasonably  foreseeable'' as opposed to merely possible or any or all potential  significant effects. The term ``reasonably foreseeable'' is again  employed with respect to an ``environmental assessment'' for  consistency and to provide clarity in the distinction between  circumstances in which an EIS versus an environmental assessment is  required.
