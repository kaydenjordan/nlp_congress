 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  service of a distinguished Delawarean, veteran of the U.S. Army for 27  years, businessman, husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather,  and brother, Ed Scully.   I got to know Ed during my time as New Castle County executive and  worked with him on a variety of issues facing the aviation industry.   Ed was known for his persistence during my time in the Senate when it  came to bringing and keeping good, high-paying jobs in Delaware, and in  particular, he was passionate about helping veterans in our State get  jobs in the aviation industry.   After graduating from Wilmington, Delaware's Salesianum School, Ed  joined the U.S. Army in February 1961. Ed was no ordinary soldier; he  joined the Special Forces and earned his Green Beret. He was promoted  five times during his 27 years of service and retired at the rank of  lieutenant colonel. Ed received many awards and decorations, including  the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with Valor, the Purple Heart, the  Joint Services Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, the Combat  Infantryman's Badge, the Special Forces Tab, the Parachute Badge, the  Senior Aviation Badge, the Vietnam Jump Wings, and the Special Forces  Combat Patch.   After attending flight school, aviation became Ed's passion, and he  spent the rest of his life as a military and civilian aviation expert.   After he retired from the military and returned to Delaware, he began  a second career at Summit Aviation, a 500-acre airport in Middletown,  DE, where he continued supporting America's men and women in uniform.  Summit was an early supporter of the Delaware State Police Aviation  Branch, building a hangar and providing all aircraft maintenance. To  this day, Summit is a top employer of veterans in the state. Ed retired  from Summit in June, 2013, after 25 years. Prior to his retirement,  Summit named their new modification center after him: the Scully  Modification Center. There are few people who can say that they have  dedicated their lives to their country, but Ed certainly can.   Sadly, Ed passed away on December 24, 2018, and was buried in  Arlington National Cemetery, but he leaves behind an indelible legacy  and one he should be most proud of: his family. Ed is survived by his  loving and devoted wife of 45 years, Patricia, his brothers Robert and  Thomas, his daughters, Suzanne Gubich, Corynn Ciber, Kristin Stein, his  son Edward Scully IV, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren;  Danielle, Cole, Kyle, Maxwell, Julia, Connor, Ashton, and Kailani.   I am grateful for Ed's service to our State and our Nation, and I  hope that this tribute to his memory helps his family and friends know  what an impact his life made.                            ____________________
