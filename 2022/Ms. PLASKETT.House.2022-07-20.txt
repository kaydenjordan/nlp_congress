 Madam Speaker, the United States Supreme Court decision  in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization to uphold the  Mississippi Gestational Age Act and overrule the Court's prior decision  in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.  Casey, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion upheld for  nearly half a century no longer exists, ripped away women's right to  make their own reproductive healthcare decisions.   Nationwide, radical Republicans were prepared to immediately charge  ahead with measures to take away the freedom of choice. In Congress,  Republicans are plotting a nationwide ban to criminalize abortion, and  State legislatures are advancing the extremist agenda to criminalize  reproductive health decisions, including new laws to arrest doctors and  punish women and those who provide aid. Far-right politicians are  actively working to dismantle the legal protections afforded to women  and invading their bodily autonomy rights.   For centuries, women have fought tenaciously for their fundamental  human rights and we will not stop. On July 18, 1848, 174 years and 2  days ago, the first women's rights convention in the United States was  held in Seneca Falls, New York. The Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 was  the first platform for women to discuss their civil, social, and  religious rights and challenge their inferior status. Feminist leaders  and women across the country courageously voiced their collective  struggles and petitioned for change.   Elizabeth Cady Stanton, an ardent activist and leader, presented the  ``Declaration of Sentiments,'' demanding the same rights and freedoms  that the Declaration of Independence granted to men at that time. The  Seneca Falls Convention was a cornerstone of the women's suffragette  movement and paved the path for women's rights movements.  [[Page H6888]]    Today, women's freedoms are under attack, and the consequences will  reverberate as radical Republicans continue to push their political  agenda and curtail basic rights. My Democratic colleagues and I remain  unwavering in our commitment to defend the legal rights of women and  families to make independent decisions about their futures by  safeguarding access to reproductive healthcare services.   This week, House Democrats will vote to pass H.R. 8373, the Right to  Contraception Act, guaranteeing the right to obtain and use  contraception as established in Griswold v. Connecticut.   The alarming, extremist act of judicial activism in Dobbs v. Jackson  has created a dangerous blueprint for future attacks on our most  cherished rights. As an attorney who is a strict constructionist  myself, this cannot stand. In his concurring opinion overturning Roe v.  Wade, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that in future cases  the Court should consider substantive due process precedents which  legalized the right for married couples to buy and use contraception  without government restrictions, same-sex relationships, and marriage  equality. Calling into question the constitutional right to use  contraception is dangerous for American women and families, as well as  men, but also has the potential to disproportionately impact women of  historically marginalized communities who face health disparities at  higher rates.   Access to contraception can affect all aspects of a woman's life,  including educational attainment, employment opportunities, healthcare,  and economic success. The Right to Contraception Act recognizes the  social, political, and economic impacts on our country and takes steps  to protect Americans' right to make their own decisions about their  health and their families.   The Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs further emphasizes the need to  act now, to protect access to contraception, and women's right to make  reproductive health decisions. Contraception is essential to the health  and rights of individuals. Women deserve the right to make informed  decisions about their health, family planning, and future. It is 2022.  We should not still be fighting for rights that are essential to basic  health and bodily autonomy. Pass this legislation.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   It is so good to be here with you, to have this discussion about  Social Security, the importance of this safety net to so many  Americans, individuals throughout this country, but especially those  who need it most.   I'm going to give you some numbers. We have 17,036 retirees; 1,331  children; spouses, widows, disabled workers. Those are the people in my  district, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, who receive Social Security  benefits--almost 20 percent of our population.   On average, these individuals receive $1,230 per month in benefits.  That doesn't seem like a lot to so many Americans.   Yet, for many recipients, they are dependent on those Social Security  benefits to survive. Social Security payments put food on the table,  keep roofs overhead, furnish medication.   Indeed, for about half of senior beneficiaries, Social Security  provides the majority of their income.   Social Security is even more important, as you have stated, for  marginalized communities, particularly women and Black Americans.  Without Social Security, 43 percent of older women would be living in  poverty.   In 2014, 45 percent of all Black senior beneficiaries relied on  Social Security for all or nearly all of their income.   Even in light of these details, we all know the Social Security  system today is inadequate. The American people know it, my  constituents know it, and I suspect my colleagues across the aisle are  very much aware of that.    But I am grateful for you, Congressman Larson, Members of the  Democratic party, and, in particular, my colleagues on the Ways and  Means Committee who are exerting leadership, who are deciding to step  out and do something about it.   We are not waiting around for the perfect. We are going to do some  good. Benefits are insufficient. The Social Security trust fund will  start running dry in 2035. That may be around the time that I need it,  so we better get working on this. Waiting periods are unnecessarily  long. It is long past time that we act to repair Social Security.   So many things in this House we just take for granted that we are  going to work on, we are going to fix, whether it is roads,  infrastructure. My gosh. Those are the things that oftentimes it is  easy for all of us to get behind, but how do we not get behind our  elders? How do we not get behind those disabled workers, widows?   Many of my colleagues want to quote the Bible. If they are concerned  with the widows, if they are concerned with those that are elders, they  should be concerned with Social Security.   I am proud when I was approached by you, Mr. Larson, to act as a co- sponsor of this legislation, H.R. 5723, Social Security 2100, a sacred  trust.   This legislation would increase benefits for all Social Security  beneficiaries. It improves the cost-of-living adjustment, the COLA, to  reflect inflation.   My colleagues across the aisle want to talk about inflation all the  time, but when we try to give them measures to combat it, there is  nothing they want to do. They vote ``no'' each and every time.   I can almost expect that when we get to committee, and we are going  to mark this up as a means to deal with inflation for our elders, they  are going to say ``no'' to it as well.   It enhances benefits for widows and widowers, repeals provisions that  penalize public servants, and ensures that no one retires in poverty.                                time  1500    H.R. 5723 promotes fairness in our Social Security system. It  provides a tax cut for middle-income beneficiaries by raising taxation  thresholds, while also ensuring millionaires and billionaires pay their  fair share by applying the Social Security payroll tax to income above  $400,000.   Finally, this legislation makes practical improvements to Social  Security services to reduce access barriers. It ends the 5-month  waiting period to receive benefits, enhances access to legal  assistance, and prevents unwarranted closures of SSA field offices.   By increasing benefits, promoting fairness, and improving access,  Democrats are improving Social Security so it will not only help  beneficiaries today, but will also help future beneficiaries by  extending the trust fund's lifespan.   This legislation may not solve every problem in our Social Security  system and may not include provisions that every Member desires, but it  will make a tangible, positive impact on the lives of nearly 70 million  Americans.   I know that on the other side we hear things such as an 11-point plan  to rescue America, and among other things the plan calls for Federal  legislation to sunset after 5 years so Congress would need to reapprove  it. We see them discussing 20 percent across-the-board cuts to Social  Security. We say ``no'' to that. We want to support our elders, support  the system, give a helping hand, fight inflation.   As President Franklin Roosevelt stated in 1935 when he signed the  Social Security Act into law, ``This law, too, represents a cornerstone  in a structure which is being built, but is by no means complete. . . .  It is, in short, a law that will take care of human needs and at the  same time provide the United States an economic structure of vastly  greater soundness.''   I urge the House to lay another cornerstone in this unfinished  structure by passing H.R. 5723. Our moral character as a nation is  determined not by how we treat corporations and billionaires and the  powerful but, rather, how we treat the most vulnerable among us:  Hardworking seniors who have earned a peaceful retirement; people with  disabilities who need support; veterans who courageously defended their  country; widows; and children who have lost a loved one.   They are not asking for a handout or a free ride. Rather, they have  worked hard to support their families and their countries and have paid  into the Social Security system. Now they are simply asking their  government to maintain the promise of Social Security and extend a  helping hand during hard times.   I thank my colleagues for the work that has been done to bring this  to the floor. I also thank our tremendous staff, who have done so much  of the yeoman's work in bringing information, making sure that we are  doing the right thing with the numbers, that this is something that is  sustainable and is going to support not just those people who are  receiving the benefits, but there is a benefit to all Americans by us  doing this in the long run.
