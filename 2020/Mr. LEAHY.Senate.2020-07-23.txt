 Mr. President, every year, the Senate considers sweeping  legislation to authorize operations of the Department of Defense and  certain functions of the Department of Energy. The fiscal year 2021  National Defense Authorization Act provides a roadmap for spending for  national defense, spending which reflects over half of the annual  Federal budget. Its importance is enormous, and its consideration  important. Regrettably, the Senate in recent years has reduced  consideration of the NDAA to a perfunctory exercise occupying a couple  of weeks of debate, and little consideration of amendments. While I  support much of what is included in this authorizing package, I cannot  support its passage.   I am most concerned that the FY21 NDAA includes authorization for  testing of nuclear devices. Where our President fails to lead in global  diplomacy and common decency, he seems enthralled with an approach  favored by autocrats and dictators: demonstrations of military might  over strategic partnerships and alliances. I am concerned that, under  this administration, we are inexorably trending toward a new nuclear  arms race, where demonstrations of power have taken the place of  treaties that made the use of history's most dangerous weapons less  likely.   Coupled with authorization to build a new nuclear warhead, the  Senate's fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act goes  beyond the nuclear modernization plan set in action by the Obama  administration in concert with ratifying New START. Rather, it takes  scientifically dubious and strategically unnecessary steps to support  the President's seemingly exclusive interest in brandishing-- literally--our military might. Congress and Presidents of both parties  have worked for decades to help the world avoid repeating the  precarious situation of the 1960s; I worry we are starting a slow march  back to that edge.   Like many Senators, I am disappointed that a simple amendment I have  authored to provide resources through the Department of Defense to  communities who are the home to significant military missions through  our National Guard did not receive consideration. The men and women of  our National Guard are members of our communities. They are our mothers  and fathers, our husbands and wives, our coworkers and neighbors. The  important missions they serve help not only our  [[Page S4447]]  communities, but our national defense. The Department of Defense should  not only support the men and women who serve in uniform, but also the  communities in which they partner. This simple, straightforward  amendment would have provided $20 million for the Department of Defense  to support multiple communities where certain military missions that  serve the national defense are based. As communities across the country  support our military's missions, so, too, should our Department of  Defense serve their needs.   I am also disappointed that the Senate has rejected an amendment to  rein in the dramatically escalating budget of the Department of  Defense. As the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I  have worked with the Republican leadership and with Chairman Shelby in  recent years to strike budget agreements that have resulted in parity  between defense and nondefense spending. At the same time, amid a  national and international public health crisis, the time has never  been more critical to infuse more resources in public health,  education, and business development programs. The Sanders amendment  would have maintained full support for the personnel needs of the  Department, as well as the critical medical research supported through  the Department of Defense. It would, however, have also taken some of  the Department's sweeping budget and reserved it for underfunded  domestic needs. This is long overdue.   The Senate will pass this bill today, and we will need to reconcile  differences with the House. While I will not vote for the Senate bill  as it currently stands, there are many provisions that merit support.  The bill continues a streak in recent years of improving support for  the health and safety of military servicemembers and their families  and, this year, also authorizes $44 million for vaccine and biotech  research support for COVID-19 response that benefits everyone. The bill  includes limitations on the use of the military against protestors,  following the administration's actions against protestors in the  Nation's Capitol, and the photo-op that followed. It includes a  provision to begin the process for renaming U.S. military facilities  named after Confederate generals. Our bases today should reflect the  foundational belief that we are all created equal, not glorify those  who sought to perpetuate slavery and destroy the Union.   I am also very pleased that a project I have worked on many years to  heal the wounds of the Vietnam war has been advanced. Over the last 2  years, we have included an authorization and the Appropriations  Committee has funded a project to remediate dioxin contamination at the  Bien Hoa Airbase. This year, we also include an authorization for a  partnership with the Vietnamese Government for recovering remains of  missing in action in Vietnam. For more than 40 years, the Vietnamese  Government has provided indispensable assistance in locating the  remains of more than 700 U.S. MIAs. This provision will enable the  Department of Defense to reciprocate by providing archival data and  other assistance to Vietnam. I want to thank Senators Hirono and Kaine  for their help in sponsoring this amendment in committee and Chairman  Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed for accepting it.   I hope that an agreed upon fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act will address these concerns. While I cannot vote to  pass this bill today, I hope to be able to support a conference  agreement that supports our men and women in uniform and their  families, meets the defense needs of our Nation, and reflects the  values that have made American the beacon of hope for generations.    Mr. Presient, the global community has lost one of our  most active advocates for peace. On June 22, John Philip Dunfey passed  away. Known as Jack to his many friends around the world, he was a  World War II veteran, founder and CEO of Omni Hotels International, and  the owner of Parker House. His impact, however, was far wider. Jack was  an ardent supporter of social justice issues throughout his life.   Jack lead human rights missions to many corners of the world, helping  to free prisoners in Cuba, remove landmines in Angola and monitor the  election in South Africa won by Nelson Mandela.   Jack was the founder and chairman of the Global Citizens Circle,  fostering  [[Page S4461]]  cross-cultural and intergenerational dialogue about important social  change. Together with friends on both sides of the aisle, Dunfey was  appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the commission that founded the  U.S. Institute for Peace. He was also a founding board member of the  American Ireland Fund, an organization working to bring peace to  Ireland. These important organizations will far outlive Jack,  continuing his legacy and helping to improve lives across the globe.   He lived a life true to his favorite saying, ``We make a living by  what we get, but we make a life by what we give.'' Jack gave  abundantly, and the world owes him a debt of gratitude.   My thoughts are with Jack's wife, Lisa, and their family during this  difficult time.   I ask unanimous consent that the full obituary for John Philip Dunfey  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Dunfey, John Philip Founder and Chairman, Global Citizens Circle;    Founder and CEO, Omni Hotels International Also Owned and Renovated                          Parker House (1968-1988)         John Philip Dunfey, a World War II veteran who dedicated       much of his life to fostering world peace and social justice,       died at age 96 on June 22, 2020, in Hampton, NH. Known as       ``Jack'' to friends, he spent decades of behind-the-scenes       work in support of causes such as the peace process in       Northern Ireland and human rights efforts in South Africa,       Cuba, Central America, South America, and the Middle East.       Notably, Dunfey spearheaded his family's efforts in 1974 to       launch Global Citizens Circle. Originally known as New       England Circle, the not-for-profit entity continues its       mission almost 50 years later to ``. . . gather diverse,       intergenerational voices addressing critical issues and       building the trust needed for sustainable change in       ourselves, our nation, and our world.''        Dunfey was born in Lowell, MA, on January 7, 1924, to       former millworkers, Catherine A. Manning and LeRoy W. Dunfey.       The fifth of twelve children, Jack began his work career as       did all his siblings at a very young age in his parents'       small luncheonette in the Acre section of Lowell. After       graduating from Lowell's Keith Academy, Jack joined the U.S.       Air Force in 1943, attaining the rank of first lieutenant       while serving as a B-24 and B-29 pilot instructor.        Following his honorable discharge in 1946, he earned his       Bachelor of Science degree in business at the University of       New Hampshire in 1952. He also led his family's business.       From 1950 to 1988, the enterprise expanded from New England-      area luncheonettes, clam stands, and pizza shops to the       Dunfey Hotel Corporation, whose hallmark became refurbishing       downtrodden inner-city hotels. When the Corporation acquired       Omni Hotels International--with its dozens of properties       worldwide, including London and Paris--Jack kept the       corporate headquarters rooted in Hampton, NH, to help       preserve the close employee-management relationship that was       so much a part of the early family business. The acquisition       and restoration of the historic Parker House Hotel in Boston       in 1968--in the era of assassinations, the Vietnam War, and       Civil Rights Movement--provided Jack and his siblings a       prominent base to advance their beliefs in social justice.        For many years, he led human rights missions into neglected       corners of the world with his personal goal of releasing       political prisoners. His favorite saying was: ``We make a       living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.''       He was kind, thoughtful and generous with his immediate and       extended family and with the larger human family. The       missions to Cuba, for his meetings with Fidel Castro, led to       the release of 87 prisoners, the removal of landmines in       Angola, and the freeing up of food supplies to enter       Ethiopia.        While a staunch Democrat, Jack was noted for working across       party lines to achieve his objectives. In 1984 President       Ronald Reagan, a staunch Republican, appointed Dunfey as one       of the nine-member commission founders of the United States       Institute for Peace, tasked with promoting conflict       resolution and peace worldwide. Jack was also a founding       board member of the American Ireland Funds. He and his       brothers, Bob and Walter, were recognized as bridge-builders       and advocates of cross-community dialogue during the Troubles       in Northern Ireland. When John Hume and David Trimble were       awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, they invited Jack and       Bob to travel with them and their families to Oslo. That same       year, Jack was also appointed an independent, international       monitor in South Africa's historic first election of Nelson       Mandela as president.        Jack is survived by his wife, Lisa Timpe Dunfey, Boston,       MA; three children, Susan Dunfey, Rye, NH; David Dunfey,       Sebastian, Florida; Stephen Dunfey, Portsmouth, NH; and three       siblings, Eileen Dunfey Robinson, Bradenton, Florida; Jerry       Dunfey and his wife, Nadine Hack, Lutry, Switzerland; Eleanor       Dunfey and her husband, James Freiburger, Exeter, NH; and       many nieces, nephews and cousins whom he cherished. Jack was       preceded in death by his son, Philip; and Joan Lannan Dunfey,       the mother of his children, as well as eight siblings: Roy,       Paul, Kay, Mary, Bud ``Bill,'' Robert ``Bob,'' Richard       ``Dick,'' and Walter. Because of COVID-19 restrictions, the       family plans a Memorial to celebrate Jack's life at a later       date.                            ____________________
