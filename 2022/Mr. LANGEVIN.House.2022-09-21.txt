 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Presidential Election Reform Act.   January 6, 2021, will forever be known as one of the darkest days in  our Nation's history, which threatened the very survival of our  democracy. Incited by a former President, a violent mob stormed the  Capitol, intent on preventing the peaceful transfer of power upon which  our democracy depends.   Thankfully, they failed, and Vice President Mike Pence fulfilled his  constitutional duty to oversee the counting of the electoral votes. No  matter what President Trump and his cronies claim, the Vice President  of the United States has no legal authority to reject, delay, or  otherwise obstruct the counting of the electoral votes.   Yet, there are those who continue to spew the big lie and undermine  the legitimacy of future elections. So, today, we must reject these  dangerous voices and pass the Presidential Election Reform Act so that  we can safeguard our democracy from any attempt to overturn the will of  the people.   We came perilously close to losing our democracy on January 6, 2021.  Let us come together to protect the rule of law and prevent any similar  assault on our democracy from ever happening again.
