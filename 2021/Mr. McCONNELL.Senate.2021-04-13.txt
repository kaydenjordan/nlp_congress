 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we speak, for the second time this  year, a fallen officer of the U.S. Capitol Police lies in honor under  the Capitol dome.   This morning, Officer Billy Evans was welcomed here for a final time  by grieving comrades and a Senate family that is immensely grateful for  his life, his friendship, and his ultimate sacrifice.   Officer Evans died defending the Capitol, its institutions, and the  thousands of people who come here to do the people's business. The  circumstances of his killing remind us of the dangers that USCP  officers swear, train, and prepare to meet whenever they might arise.   Yet, to that serious task, to his intense responsibilities, Officer  Evans brought a spirit and strength of character that leaves us all at  the Capitol with memories of kindness and friendship.   Today, I know our colleagues are holding Officer Evans and his family  he leaves behind close in our thoughts and our prayers. His sacrifice  will not be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a completely different matter,  just moments ago, new reporting suggests the Biden administration plans  to turn tail and abandon the fight in Afghanistan.   Precipitously withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan is a grave  mistake. It is a retreat in the face of an enemy that has not yet been  vanquished and abdication of American leadership.   Leaders in both parties, including me, offered criticism when the  prior administration floated the concept of a reckless withdrawal from  Syria and Afghanistan. Those same voices in both parties should be  equally concerned about the Biden administration's announcement today.  A reckless pullback like this would abandon our Afghan, regional, and  our NATO partners in a shared fight against terrorists that we have not  yet won. It will also specifically abandon the women of Afghanistan,  whose individual freedoms and human rights will be imperiled.   It did not have to unfold like this. Today in Afghanistan the  fighting is borne almost exclusively by our local partners. We have  successfully solicited more buy-in and more support from foreign  partners as well. Our NATO allies have particularly been begging-- begging--the United States to stay by their side. As a result, there  was broad political support for a sustainable and residual presence to  backstop the progress we have made.   In 2019, Republicans and Democrats joined hands to support an  amendment I authored that cautioned against precipitous retreats from  Afghanistan and Syria. A supermajority of Senators voted for it. A  supermajority of Senators voted for it.   That amendment called upon the administration--the previous one--``to  certify whether conditions have been met for the enduring defeat of al  Qaeda and ISIS before initiating any further significant withdrawal of  United States forces from [Syria or Afghanistan].''   Can President Biden certify that right now? We have seen this movie  before, multiple times. Ten years ago, when President Obama let  politics dictate the terms of our involvement in Iraq, those failed  decisions invited the rise of ISIS.   It was our hasty abandonment of Afghanistan in the 1990s that allowed  the Taliban to grab power in a bloody civil war and create the safe  haven for terrorism that led to September the 11th, 2001.   Conflicts do not simply end. They are won or they are lost. America  and American administrations must be in the business of winning. Al- Qaida and other radical Islamist terrorists have not yet been defeated.   There is no reason to believe the Taliban will abandon al-Qaida if we  leave. We know we cannot conduct effective counterterrorism operations  without presence and partners on the ground.   Foreign terrorists will not leave the United States alone simply  because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them.  The President needs  [[Page S1881]]  to explain to the American people why he thinks abandoning our partners  and retreating in the face of the Taliban will make America safer.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, $865,000 dollars-- $865,000. That is roughly the cost of every new job the White House  claims their so-called American Jobs Plan would create, $865,000.   This is how the math shakes out if you use the most favorable  estimates that the Biden administration itself prefers. Figures  reported by Bloomberg News come out to about $865,000 per job. Other  analyses have found numbers actually north of $860,000.   Here is where the number comes from. The White House has tried to  claim their spending plan would create 19 million jobs over the next  decade. That is completely false. The Washington Post Fact Checker gave  Democrats multiple Pinocchios for this false claim.   Nineteen million jobs is one estimate of the total number of jobs the  entire country would add over the next decade, from all sources--all  sources. The same estimate says we are on track to add more than 16  million of those same jobs without the bill.   So this proposal to tax, borrow, and spend $2.25 trillion would only  create 2.6 million new jobs. And remember, these are the rosiest-- rosiest--best-case estimates that the White House itself has been  pushing.   Now, I know a whole lot of Kentucky entrepreneurs and business owners  who create more than one job if we gave them $865,000 to invest and  expand.   Mr. President, I am sure you represent a lot of smart people who  could turn an $865,000 investment into more than just one job.   The awful arithmetic just underscores how disappointing the proposal  is. When the American people think of infrastructure, they think of  honest-to-goodness public works projects that truly invest in the  public good--things that build our Nation's backbone. And when Congress  tackles real, tangible infrastructure issues in a smart fashion, there  is big, broad bipartisan support.   The 2015 highway bill, the FAST Act, was a huge bipartisan lift that  Senator Inhofe and former Senator Boxer hammered out together. I was  proud to play a major role in that accomplishment myself. It was the  first full 5-year highway bill that Congress had passed in 20 years.  And it won 83 votes in the Senate and about the same percentage over in  the House.   Even more recently, in 2018, the Senate passed America's Water  Infrastructure Act, 99 to 1--the new investments in water  infrastructure across the country to create jobs, grow the economy, and  ensure that American families get the safe drinking water they deserve,  99 to 1.   Just last year, another water infrastructure package came out of the  EPW Committee unanimously and cleared the Senate in a package that  passed 92 to 6.   So there is bipartisan appetite for smart infrastructure bills that  are built the right way. The Senate has proven that over and over  again. There isn't much appetite for using the word ``infrastructure''  to justify a colossal--colossal--multitrillion-dollar slush fund for  unrelated bad ideas.   A Harvard economist and infrastructure expert says, and listen to  this, ``It does a bit of violence to the English language'' to call  this an infrastructure proposal. That is a Harvard economist.   An expert at Columbia says big chunks of the proposal are ``really  social spending, not productivity-enhancing infrastructure of any  kind.''   One political analyst wrote:         [T]he plan . . . reads like a liberal wish list for       everything the left has wanted.    Less than 6--6 percent of the proposal goes to roads and bridges,  less than 6 percent. It would send more money to just electric cars  than it would spend on our Nation's roads, bridges, ports, airports,  and waterways combined.   And while this proposal chases every green fad, it would also slam  our economy with the largest tax hikes in a generation.   Experts at the Wharton School of Business have projected the plan  would decrease GDP, decrease capital stock, and reduce workers' hourly  wages 10, 20, and 30 years down the road.   Economists at Rice University recently looked at a similar package of  Democratic tax hikes and found it would lead to a loss of a million  jobs here in our country over just 2 years. Exactly when American  workers are counting on an economic recovery, Democrats want to slap  the economy with a massive set of tax increases.   So look, this noninfrastructure ``infrastructure'' plan is cut from  the same cloth as the Democrats' nonvoting rights ``voting rights''  bill.   Both these subjects are ripe for bipartisan work. Both are subjects  the Senate has addressed in the past with thoughtful compromises that  have earned broad support. And both are issues where the American  people will reject a far-left approach that makes their lives worse.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.
