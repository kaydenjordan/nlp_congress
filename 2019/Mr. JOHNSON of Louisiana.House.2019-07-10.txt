 Madam Speaker, it is my great privilege to  introduce my friend and Louisiana native, Reverend Asriel G. McLain, as  our guest chaplain to lead the opening prayer today.   Reverend McLain has held leadership positions in numerous churches  throughout the United States, including Louisiana, Michigan, and Texas.  He has written over a dozen books and frequently gives lectures on  equipping Christian education leaders for effective ministry and  discipleship.   Reverend McLain received his bachelor of arts from Bishop College in  Dallas, Texas, and his master of divinity from Princeton Theological  Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey. He is the proud father of four  children: David, Joseph, Desiree, and Danielle. Some of the family is  here today. He is also a lifelong member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.   In addition to his work behind the pulpit and inside the classroom,  Reverend McLain followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a leading  voice on advancing the cause of justice and equality for all Americans.  Having witnessed and endured the hardships of racism personally,  Reverend McLain has devoted much of his life to ensuring that future  generations can enjoy equality in all aspects of life.   It is a great honor to ask God's blessings over us, and I ask my  colleagues to help me in welcoming my dear friend, Reverend Asriel  McLain.                            ____________________
