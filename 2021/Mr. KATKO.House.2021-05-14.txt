 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   I was proud to join Chairman Nadler and Representatives Herrera  Beutler, McBath, and Scott in introducing this important bipartisan  bill.   This legislation addresses a seemingly simple issue that I have no  doubt everyone in this Chamber agrees with. No mother or mother-to-be  should have to choose between being a parent and keeping their job.   This commonsense notion is, unfortunately, not the reality in many  places in the United States.   Before my home State of New York passed a law prohibiting  discrimination against pregnant workers, I heard far too many stories  of pregnant women facing discrimination in the workforce and having to  choose between a healthy pregnancy and a paycheck.   There was Yvette, a single mother of three, who worked in the same  grocery store for 11 years. Having suffered miscarriages in the past,  she knew her pregnancy was high risk, and she gave her employer a  doctor's note with a lifting restriction.   Instead, she was fired, despite the fact that an employee with a  shoulder injury had been accommodated with lighter work.                                time  0945    She lost her health insurance and had to go on Medicaid. She and her  family survived on food stamps and savings.   Then there was Hilda, an employee at a Dollar Tree who worked there  for 3 years when she became pregnant. As her pregnancy progressed, it  became painful to stand at the cash register for 8 hours to 10 hours at  a time. Denied her request for a stool, she began to experience severe  complications, including bleeding and premature labor pains, and was  put on bed rest. With no paid leave, she and her family struggled to  make ends meet.   These women and others who have been subject to similar  discrimination in the workforce suffered an unthinkable physical and  financial toll. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act ensures that going  forward, no woman will face this type of discrimination.   This bipartisan bill provides pregnant workers with an affirmative  right to reasonable--and I stress the word ``reasonable''-- accommodations in the workplace while creating a clear and navigable  standard for employers to follow. These accommodations are minor, as  simple as providing an employee with extra restroom breaks or a stool  to sit on.   This bill is not a hiring statute and does not amend or eliminate  existing religious freedom protections. The arguments against this bill  made by  [[Page H2332]]  some Members of my own party are based on inaccuracies or wrongfully  detract from the importance of this commonsense policy.   This bill is a product of extensive bipartisan negotiation and  collaboration with advocates and the business community. Reflecting the  widespread support for this legislation, the bill has received numerous  endorsements from the business community, including the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, as well as over 180 women's health, labor, and civil rights  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from a  coalition of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  SHRM, and the National Retail Federation.                                                       May 13, 2021.        To The Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: We       urge Congress to pass H.R. 1065, the ``Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act.'' This bill would provide pregnant employees       with important workplace protections while also making sure       employers have clear and flexible options to ensure pregnant       employees can remain at work for as long as they wish.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, as reported by the House       Education and Labor Committee, is a balanced approach that       clarifies an employer's obligation to accommodate the known       limitations of employees and job applicants that accompany       pregnancy. This legislation uses an interactive, reasonable       accommodation process similar to the Americans with       Disabilities Act and specifies a pregnant employee may take       leave only after the employer and employee have exhausted the       possibility of other reasonable accommodations.        This bipartisan bill is a strong reminder that through good       faith negotiations, legislative solutions to important       workplace questions and problems can be found. We believe       that Congress should pass H.R. 1065 with no changes.            Sincerely,          Associated Builders and Contractors, BASF Corporation,             College and University Professional Association for             Human Resources, Dow, HR Policy Association,             International Franchise Association, National             Restaurant Association, National Retail Federation, pH-            D Feminine Health, Retail Industry Leaders Association,             Society for Human Resource Management, U.S. Chamber of             Commerce.     Fundamental protections for mothers and soon-to-be mothers  in the workplace are long overdue. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support this commonsense, critical legislation.
