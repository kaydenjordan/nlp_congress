 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Lieutenant Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal of the Harris County Sheriff's  Office, who was shot and killed in the line of duty 3 weeks ago today  on September 27.   As the first observant Sikh to serve in the Harris County Sheriff's  Office and one of the first in Texas to receive a policy accommodation  to practice his religion while serving as a police officer, Deputy  Dhaliwal was a role model for Americans of all faiths who want to serve  others.   Deputy Dhaliwal sold his successful business to join the sheriff's  office out of a sense of duty and a desire to build a bridge between  the department and the Houston area Sikh community. He was known for  his energy, his optimism, and his giving heart, coordinating relief  efforts for our community after Hurricane Harvey and traveling to  Puerto Rico to do the same after Hurricane Maria.   Deputy Dhaliwal's service to our community and to our country is an  example to us all. The people of Houston, Harris County, the Harris  County Sheriff's Office and the Sikh community across the country  celebrate the life and mourn the loss of this remarkable man, a  selfless hero who represented the very best of our country's ideals.                            ____________________
