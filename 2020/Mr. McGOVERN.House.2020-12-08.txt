 Mr. Speaker, December 10 is recognized around the world  as Human Rights Day.   This year marks the 72nd anniversary of the adoption of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights. In that spirit, I am here today to call on  the Government of Saudi Arabia to release blogger and human rights  activist Raif Badawi.   In 2014, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in  prison for operating a website that encouraged debate on religious and  political issues in his country.   Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is claiming to be a reformer intent  on modernizing Saudi Arabia. Raif Badawi's case plainly disproves that  claim.   Raif Badawi will soon celebrate his 37th birthday in prison, the  ninth birthday he will have spent away from his wife and children.   Mr. Speaker, the Saudi Government must immediately and  unconditionally release Raif Badawi and all other Saudi prisoners of  conscience.                            ____________________
