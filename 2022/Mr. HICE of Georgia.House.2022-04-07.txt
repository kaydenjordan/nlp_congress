 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of a great  Georgian, a staunch conservative, a lifelong patriot, and a dear  friend, Roy Roberts, Sr., from Walton County, Georgia. He was born in  Atlanta, December 13, 1940.   He was an incredible athlete, playing basketball for the University  of Kentucky, where he was credited as being one of their all-time best  defensive players. While at Kentucky, he met Suzanne Polk, and they  married in 1963 before putting their roots in Monroe, Georgia.   Roy was very active in his community. He was one of the biggest  leaders in the Republican Party, which was his passion. In fact, in  2001, he became the chairman of Walton County Republican Party, which  he proudly held that position for 20 years, leading Walton County's GOP  to become one of the leading counties in our State.   He was famous for hosting an incredible barbecue every year that drew  hundreds of people, and every candidate in the Republican Party really  had to be a part of that incredible event.   Georgia lost a giant last week. I and Walton County lost a dear  friend. We will miss Roy Roberts tremendously. To his family, we extend  our heartfelt prayers and love.
