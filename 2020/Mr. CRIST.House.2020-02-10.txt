 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of our ailing fellow  Americans in Puerto Rico as they recover from the devastating  earthquakes that hit the island this past month.   For weeks, we have heard horror stories from my constituents in the  Puerto Rican communities about what they are seeing and hearing from  their friends and families on the island: homes reduced to rubble;  families living in flooded camps; children sleeping on the streets; and  the earthquakes keep coming, one as recently as 2 days ago.   This is an ongoing crisis that demands an immediate and robust  response. But right now, we are seeing critical aid delayed.   We in Florida know that, when we politicize disaster relief, we put  people's lives at stake. The House passed a supplemental relief bill  Friday. Now it is time for the Senate to act for our Puerto Rican  brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
