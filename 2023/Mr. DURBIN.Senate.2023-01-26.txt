 Mr. President, I have served in the House and Senate for  a number of years. One of the issues that has always been of interest  to me is tobacco. I lost my father to lung cancer when I was 14 years  old. He was 53. Two packs of Camels a day, and he died of lung cancer.  I have thought about that a lot throughout my life.   When I was elected to the House of Representatives, I decided to  start asking a few questions about tobacco and government subsidies and  government policies. It was not the most popular position I ever took  within the House of Representatives. There was generally a rule--or at  least a custom--of never raising the issue. I did. It resulted in a  decision by the House of Representatives that surprised almost  everyone.   I introduced an amendment to ban smoking on airplanes. It was opposed  by not only my own party leadership but the leadership of the  Republican Party. Yet we prevailed. It turned out that the Members of  the House of Representatives represented one of the largest frequent  flier clubs in America, and they were sick and tired of secondhand  smoke in airplanes.   I called on Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to be my ally on  this side of the Rotunda, and he was successful in passing the  legislation with me, which was signed into law.   People started asking obvious questions about secondhand smoke: If it  is dangerous in an airplane, why is it not dangerous on the train, the  bus, at a hospital, in an office building, in a restaurant?   So, to my surprise, this measure to make clean air more prevalent on  airplanes ended up being a tipping point in American history on tobacco  policy. Everything started changing--and fast. Lives were saved. People  were discouraged from smoking. Tobacco companies, which had been  untouchable to that point, were not only touchable, they were  vulnerable. And they had to sit down and devise a new policy to make  money.   Now, the premise of tobacco was to entice young people to start  smoking at an early age, and the chemicals in tobacco, like nicotine,  were addictive. People knew, in the tobacco industry, that if you could  drag kids into smoking at an early age and get them addicted, they  might face a lifetime with that addiction and, ultimately, die from it,  but they would have loyal customers to the tobacco companies, and they  would continue to make money.    When we started raising questions about tobacco, the tobacco  companies needed an alternative. They found it. Do you know what it  was? It was e-cigarettes and vaping. The tobacco companies made big  investments in these companies--selling them as a new marketable  product that was a lot safer--though, it wasn't--and creating  addictions among children by advertising and selling fruit-flavored,  bubble gum-flavored vaping devices that looked an awful lot like  something you would carry around for your computer.   Visit a high school in America today in your State or visit a junior  high or a middle school, for that matter. Ask the teachers and  administrators what the prevalence is of vaping and e-cigarettes among  the kids in these schools. You will be shocked to learn that kids  mistakenly believe that these are harmless; yet they are extremely  addictive--e-cigarettes and vaping.   So I contacted the Food and Drug Administration, which has the legal  authority to regulate these products, and said: What are you going to  do about it? Well, they weren't quite sure what to do about it. That is  why I have come to the floor today--to tell you, up-to-date, what was  just announced.   The decade-long delay from the Food and Drug Administration to  properly regulate vaping and e-cigarettes is in a league of its own in  the modern history of that Agency. You see, under the law known as  premarket review, no tobacco product--and vaping is a tobacco product  using tobacco chemicals like nicotine--is permitted on store shelves  unless the producer, the manufacturer, proves--listen--proves to the  Food and Drug Administration in advance, prior to selling the product  on the market, that it is ``appropriate for the protection of public  health.''   For years, the Food and Drug Administration, despite this charge  under the law, has ignored it. Instead, they sit back as millions-- millions--of e-cigarettes in fruit, mint, candy flavors, even with  cartoon images, are illegally flooding the market and addicting  America's children. The Food and Drug Administration watched as this  happened. It was so bad that in year 2019--4 years ago--a Federal judge  intervened, ruling that the Food and Drug  [[Page S109]]  Administration ``decided not to enforce the premarket review provisions  at all.''   In other words, the court found what I have just said to be the fact.  The law said you need approval ahead of time before you can sell this  product. The industry--the tobacco industry, the e-vaping industry-- ignored it and sold these products nationwide, addicting these children  and ignoring their responsibilities under the law.   So, in 2019, this Federal court ordered the Food and Drug  Administration to enforce the law, to review all e-cigarette  applications, as the law requires, and gave them a deadline--a  deadline--to get it done that was almost 2 years later, September 9,  2021. That was more than 16 months ago, and, still, the Food and Drug  Administration has not finished its job. In that time, while the FDA  has dithered, dallied, and delayed, more than 1 million of America's  kids have started vaping.   How could our Federal regulators be so passive and so ineffective?   Then, on Tuesday, this last Tuesday, in a stunning filing to the  Federal judge, the Food and Drug Administration disclosed that it will  take another 6 months--another 6-month delay--to fulfill the public  health duty announced by the court years ago and that the Food and Drug  Administration will not finish reviewing applications for the most  popular e-cigarettes until the end of 2023--another outrageous delay.   I don't think I have ever heard of a Federal Agency defying a court  order for 2 years. I am going to leave it up to the Federal court to  assess this development.   How can this Federal Agency knowingly, willingly, ignore this court  order to protect America's children? How can they ignore the fact that  the law requires their approval of a product before it goes on the  shelf? And these products are being sold across America without that  approval.   To this Senator, the Food and Drug Administration's deference to the  tobacco industry, at the risk of 1 million more children getting  addicted to nicotine over the next year, is just plain outrageous and  indefensible.   The Food and Drug Administration has one choice, three words: Follow  the law. Immediately halt these unauthorized sales of these e- cigarettes on the market--not next year, not next month--immediately,  today. Otherwise, this Agency and the people who guide it bear a  responsibility for the result, and that result is the addiction of  children to a product which will harm their health. Otherwise, the Food  and Drug Administration is complicit in endangering the health of  America's kids.   Think about that for a second. An Agency created over a century ago  to protect American consumers is, in fact, failing to protect the most  vulnerable American consumers--our children.   The Food and Drug Administration has the authority today, before the  end of this business day, to order these vaping products off the  market--period.   Do it. Don't wait until some attorney talks you out of it at the Food  and Drug Administration. Protect America's kids. Tell the tobacco  industry: Sorry. The party is over. You must prove that what you sell  is in the interest of public health. We are going to protect kids first  and deal with the lawyers later. End the free pass. Follow the law. Do  not allow these tobacco companies one more day of preying on our  children.   (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 126  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, earlier this month, our Nation lost a  champion for justice. Her name was Kimberly Naranjo. She was a mother  of seven, a tireless advocate for her neighbors struggling with  addiction, and a hero for tens of thousands of consumers who had been  wronged by some of the most profitable companies in the world.   Tragically, Ms. Naranjo passed away after a battle with mesothelioma  on January 7, 2023.   While I can only imagine the grief that Ms. Naranjo's family is  feeling at this moment, I hope that they find some comfort in her  memory--and her indefatigable commitment to supporting and uplifting  our most vulnerable neighbors.   Ms. Naranjo had a difficult start in life, but she refused to let any  obstacle stand in her way. With the loving support of her family, she  overcame the disease of addiction--a great success itself--and then  dedicated her life to aiding others on their path to recovery. After  years of determination and hard work, she earned a degree in alcohol  and drug counseling, purchased her first home, and landed her dream  job: working for the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office as an addiction  counselor.   Ms. Naranjo's courage in drawing from her own challenges to help  others-and her determination to build a better life for her children-- is an example we should all aspire to. And even after she was diagnosed  with mesothelioma, a debilitating illness with no known cure, she kept  fighting for what she believed in.   Last February, for instance, she brought her campaign to Washington.  She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on  Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights on her  ongoing efforts to hold Johnson & Johnson--and other corporations that  have harmed consumers like her--accountable.   You see, Ms. Naranjo's diagnosis was not merely a tragic twist of  fate; it was the direct result of Johnson & Johnson's failure to keep  its customers safe. Like many young parents, Ms. Naranjo was a loyal  consumer of Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder--but in using the product,  she had no idea that she was exposing herself and her babies to  asbestos.   Soon after she was diagnosed with mesothelioma, Ms. Naranjo joined  tens of thousands of other consumers in filing a lawsuit against  Johnson & Johnson. But instead of facing these claims from consumers,  Johnson & Johnson engaged in a devious scheme to sidestep  accountability. They tried to exploit a loophole in bankruptcy law to  protect the company's profits and prevent consumers like Ms. Naranjo  who trusted Johnson & Johnson to produce products safe for consumption  from receiving justice.   In testifying before the subcommittee, Ms. Naranjo spoke for every  person who has suffered--and continues to suffer--from mesothelioma or  cancer after using Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder.   This decision to devote the remainder of her life to demanding  justice and accountability, not just for herself, but for thousands of  others exemplified Ms. Naranjo's selflessness and courage. She refused  to stop fighting for what she believed in even after being diagnosed  with a debilitating terminal illness. That is nothing short of  extraordinary.   In her powerful testimony, Ms. Naranjo summed up her character, her  strength, and her dedication to others in one short phrase: ``I will  not quit, no matter how tough this gets.''   Ms. Naranjo did not quit, and neither will we--thanks, in part, to  her example. Now, it is on all of us to carry her legacy forward--and  to defend those who have been left behind or denied justice.   Loretta and I join Ms. Naranjo's daughters Maria, Adrianna, Monaliza,  Faviola, Karina, and Angelica; her son Jayce; her brother Eddie; her  mother Cathy; her extended family; and her community in mourning her  loss. Thank you all for keeping her memory alive.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, Chicago lost a legend, a man  who devoted his entire life to his community, his family, and to his  passion--building a more equitable justice system in America. His name  was Larry Rogers, Sr. And over the past many years, I have been lucky  to count him as a friend, as well as a role model.   You see, to families throughout Chicago, Larry Rogers, Sr. was a  hero. He blazed a trail for generations of lawyers, especially African- American lawyers, and fought tirelessly to defend our most vulnerable  neighbors.   And if you really want to understand who Larry was, you have to start  with the person who raised him: his mother. Like me, sadly, Larry lost  his father at the age of 14. It is a loss that not only takes a great  emotional toll on a family, but a financial one as well. And after his  father passed, Larry's mom became the sole breadwinner for him and all  six of his siblings.   Growing up in the Rosedale neighborhood of the south side of Chicago,  Larry's mom worked two jobs to support her children and the cost of  their catholic school education. Her work ethic and deep belief in the  value of a good education molded Larry into the leader that so many of  us in Chicago knew and loved.   Following his mother's example, Larry excelled in school; he was even  accepted into law school after graduating college, but was forced to  put his legal career on hold due to a health issue. But like his mom,  Larry didn't  [[Page S117]]  have the luxury of slowing down. He was a young father with a family to  feed. So, after leaving school, he started working three jobs to pay  the bills.   One of those jobs was at a gas station across the street from  Comiskey Park. As fate would have it, that job ended up changing  Larry's life. It was while working at that gas station that he struck  up a friendship with a regular customer--a young lawyer named Joe  Power. After becoming friends, Joe encouraged Larry to finish law  school and even recruited him to the law firm where he worked.   It was the beginning of a 40-year friendship and professional  partnership. Together, Larry and Joe founded a personal injury law and  medical malpractice firm that has become an institution in in Chicago  and throughout the legal world: Power Rogers, LLP.   Soon after he began his career as a trial attorney, Larry swiftly  emerged as a mastermind in the courtroom, as well as a champion  pugilist in the fight for justice. In the words of his son, Larry Jr.,  Larry Sr. was, ``the Michael Jordan of law before Michael Jordan was  the Michael Jordan of basketball.''   Well, it is true. Back in 1985, for instance, Larry Sr. won the  largest personal injury victory in Illinois history-an eight-figure  verdict for families who had been wronged by a baby formula company,  which had sold chloride-deficient formula and hindered the intellectual  development of babies consuming it. Fifteen years later, Larry made  legal history once again: He won a $55 million verdict for a woman who  had suffered brain damage during a bronchoscopy exam; it was the  largest medical malpractice verdict that went to judgement in our  State's history.   Larry's record in the courtroom is remarkable. In just four decades,  he won major verdicts for victims of medical malpractice, motor vehicle  negligence, aviation accident cases, and more.   And with every victory, Larry didn't just climb the next rung of the  professional ladder; he looked back and offered a helping hand to young  lawyers hoping to follow his lead.   Larry paid his success forward in mentorship, guidance, and support  for African-American students and attorneys who had long been excluded  from the legal world. And nobody was better positioned to recruit a new  generation of change makers than Larry. After all, he served as the  president of the Cook County Bar Association--CCBA--the first African- American president of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association--ITLA--and  was awarded an endless list of accolades. He was even named one of the  top 500 trial lawyers in the entire country.   But above all, Larry was a dedicated and loving father and  grandfather. He instilled in his family the same values he learned from  his own Mom, like a strong work ethic and a deep commitment to serving  others. And Larry never pressured his kids to follow him into the legal  career; he simply encouraged them to pursue their passions like he did:  with diligence and determination.   Still, Larry's example as an accomplished and principled lawyer had a  strong influence on his children. Some years after Larry made history  as the first African-American president of the ITLA, another young  trailblazer followed in his footsteps: Larry Rogers Jr.--the second- ever African-American president of the ITLA. Like his Dad, Larry Jr.  also became the president of the CCBA and, eventually, a partner at  Power Rogers.   I have seen for myself how Larry Jr. has followed his Dad's example,  especially in his commitment to uplifting other, young attorneys of  color.   Altogether, there are now three generations of legal professionals in  the Rogers family. Besides Larry Jr., there is his brother, Dom--an  injury attorney--and his sister, Ann Marie--a court reporter.  Additionally, Larry Sr.'s stepson Frederic is also a lawyer, along with  his niece Carmen, his nephew, Sean, and his grandson, Trevor. And there  is another star attorney on the way, too: Larry Sr.'s granddaughter,  Erin, was recently accepted to several law schools.   For those of us who knew Larry outside the courtroom, we will always  remember his love of Chicago sports as well as his intrepid spirit. He  was season ticket holder for both the Bulls and the Bears.   And he was the captain of his very own Sea Ray sport boat. Larry  would often invite friends and family to join him on vacations to Lake  Michigan, Florida, and even the Bahamas--a testament to his generosity  and eagerness to spread joy to those he loved.   In the musical ``Hamilton'', legacy is defined as ``planting seeds in  a garden you never get to see.''   While Larry Rogers Sr. may no longer be with us, I am absolutely  certain that the seeds he has planted--as a lawyer, mentor, father, and  grandfather--will be blossoming for generations to come.   Chicago--and the entire legal profession--is better because of Larry  Rogers Sr.'s lifetime of service.   Loretta and I join Larry's life partner Pam, his children and  stepchildren--Larry, Jr., Dom, Anne Marie, and Frederic--along with all  of his nieces, nephews, and grandchildren in mourning his loss. Thank  you all for carrying his remarkable legacy forward.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to make individuals responsible for undermining free  and fair democratic elections inadmissible to the United States; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam President, America must never become a safe haven  for anyone who assaults the values for which this Nation stands--values  like democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and the sanctity of free  and fair elections.   We already deny visas to those who are human traffickers, drug  traffickers, money launderers, corrupt kleptocrats, and those who  commit serious violations of religious freedom. I agree with that  policy. We have passed laws to allow for the prosecution in U.S. courts  of anyone who has committed war crimes or used children as soldiers in  deadly conflict. I have written some of those policies, and I certainly  agree with them.   Today, I am introducing legislation to further align our immigration  system with our values as a nation. The bill I am introducing would  prevent foreign officials who interfere with democratic elections or  prevent the democratic transfer of power of their country from taking  refuge in the United States.   In recent years, autocrats around the world have used a toxic brew of  nationalism, authoritarianism, corruption, and social media to weaken  and attack the very foundations of democracy. Fortunately, democracy is  winning this battle. Much of the world is unified in support of  Ukraine, for example, against Putin's attempt to seize the sovereign  democratic nation of Ukraine, and we have the allies in the NATO  alliance and others who stand with us with strength and formidable  determination to stop Putin.   In late October, the people of Brazil--the largest democracy in Latin  America--chose a new President to replace the increasingly  authoritarian Jair Bolsonaro. After years of baseless lies by Bolsonaro  about the integrity of Brazil's elections, polls show that three- fourths of his supporters no longer trust the electoral process in  Brazil.   Sound familiar?   After Bolsonaro lost in October's Presidential election, his  supporters turned to violence. They blocked highways throughout Brazil.  Many called openly for the military to overturn the election.   Sound familiar?   And, on January 8, as Mr. Bolsonaro took selfies with his supporters  in the State of Florida, thousands of his far-right supporters  violently stormed Brazil's Presidential palace, Congress, and Supreme  Court--breaking windows and injuring dozens of police officers.   Sound familiar?   It was a disgrace. It was an assault on democracy--not only in Brazil  but an assault on democracy everywhere.   Under the bill I am introducing, if the Secretary of State determines  a foreign official has interfered with free and fair elections or has  sought to prevent the peaceful, democratic transfer of power, that  official cannot escape justice by fleeing to the United States.   I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this important measure to  hold those who interfere with democratic elections accountable. America  should never be a safe haven for enemies of democracy.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

We already deny visas to those who are human traffickers, drug  traffickers, money launderers, corrupt kleptocrats, and those who  commit serious violations of religious freedom. I agree with that  policy. We have passed laws to allow for the prosecution in U.S. courts  of anyone who has committed war crimes or used children as soldiers in  deadly conflict. I have written some of those policies, and I certainly  agree with them.   Today, I am introducing legislation to further align our immigration  system with our values as a nation. The bill I am introducing would  prevent foreign officials who interfere with democratic elections or  prevent the democratic transfer of power of their country from taking  refuge in the United States.   In recent years, autocrats around the world have used a toxic brew of  nationalism, authoritarianism, corruption, and social media to weaken  and attack the very foundations of democracy. Fortunately, democracy is  winning this battle. Much of the world is unified in support of  Ukraine, for example, against Putin's attempt to seize the sovereign  democratic nation of Ukraine, and we have the allies in the NATO  alliance and others who stand with us with strength and formidable  determination to stop Putin.   In late October, the people of Brazil--the largest democracy in Latin  America--chose a new President to replace the increasingly  authoritarian Jair Bolsonaro. After years of baseless lies by Bolsonaro  about the integrity of Brazil's elections, polls show that three- fourths of his supporters no longer trust the electoral process in  Brazil.   Sound familiar?   After Bolsonaro lost in October's Presidential election, his  supporters turned to violence. They blocked highways throughout Brazil.  Many called openly for the military to overturn the election.   Sound familiar?   And, on January 8, as Mr. Bolsonaro took selfies with his supporters  in the State of Florida, thousands of his far-right supporters  violently stormed Brazil's Presidential palace, Congress, and Supreme  Court--breaking windows and injuring dozens of police officers.   Sound familiar?   It was a disgrace. It was an assault on democracy--not only in Brazil  but an assault on democracy everywhere.   Under the bill I am introducing, if the Secretary of State determines  a foreign official has interfered with free and fair elections or has  sought to prevent the peaceful, democratic transfer of power, that  official cannot escape justice by fleeing to the United States.   I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this important measure to  hold those who interfere with democratic elections accountable. America  should never be a safe haven for enemies of democracy.                            ____________________
