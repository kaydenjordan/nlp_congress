 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the creation of the  Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States  and the Chinese Communist Party.   I rise as a research scientist who has participated in many  international collaborations, which included some brilliant Chinese  scientists; and I rise also as a businessman who founded a high-tech  manufacturing business that now provides over 1,000 good-paying  American manufacturing jobs and has kept those manufacturing jobs in  America despite having to compete in the world markets with cloned  Chinese products for over two decades.   I have watched with consternation as our businesses' electronic  supply chain has been increasingly dependent upon China.   Now, it was not a stupid thing for our country and the countries of  the free world to attempt to help China become a free and open country  by integrating it into the international economy and into the  international scientific research community and to open our doors to  Chinese students and scholars.   In the years since World War II, that approach has succeeded in  turning many previously autocratic countries into free democracies  around the world. In fact, in previous years, China took a number of  steps toward becoming a free and open country. But in recent years, it  has turned back toward autocracy. So it is time to respond to that  reality and to take thoughtful action.   On a personal note, my wife is Korean and is a scientist who has  contributed at the highest levels of scientific research and science  policy in the United States. The only reason that she is free today is  that two generations ago, the U.S. and the free countries of the world  stood up against Communism in Korea. But nothing is more self-defeating  than the anti-Asian racism that sometimes creeps into the debate in our  country.   The frontiers that we should be defending are not the good old U.S.  of A. but the free democracies of the world.   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this new Select Committee on  the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese  Communist Party, in particular in the clear distinction that it makes,  even in its title, between the Communist Party of China and the people  of China who are not the enemy.                                time  1245
