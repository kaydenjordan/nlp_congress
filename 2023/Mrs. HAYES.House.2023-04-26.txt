 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the default  on America act because I did not come to Congress to starve children.   Thirty-four million Americans struggle with food insecurity, 9  million of which are children. This bill would strip millions of  hardworking Americans of benefits by expanding so-called work  requirements in SNAP.   SNAP already has a work requirement for individuals ages 18 to 49,  but Republicans want to expand this to older Americans and seniors who  face age discrimination in the workplace already.   It is also important to note that the House subcommittee in charge of  nutrition programs, the one who would be in charge of this, has yet to  hold one hearing. So while proposing work requirements, the Committee  on Nutrition has yet to begin work. It is horrifying that Republicans  are choosing to hold the economy hostage and using vulnerable families  as a bargaining tool.   I urge my colleagues to have some compassion and vote against this  devastating legislation.  [[Page H2018]]
