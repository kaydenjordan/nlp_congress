 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump administration released  its NAFTA renegotiating objectives, which laid out its plan for how to  fix that bad trade deal for America's workers, but it lacks specifics.   Yes, America needs a better deal, better jobs, better wages, for a  better future for our people and the people of our continent. As  renegotiations begin in August, let us remember the devil is in the  details. The President's rhetoric alone is not enough. Action is what  creates jobs.   Nearly 30 years ago, NAFTA was sold as the epitome of a modern trade  agreement. Its supporters promised U.S. job growth. They guaranteed  trade balances and even surpluses. They said there would be increased  economic trade flexibility for North American industries and new buyers  of American goods.   But guess what. Those promises didn't materialize. Instead, U.S.  workers faced enormous job loss, declining wages, sublevel wage  competition from desperate millions in Mexico, whose workers have no  rights.   The recent tragedy in San Antonio with all of those desperate workers  in that truck is the tip of an iceberg of labor exploitation on this  continent that was caused by NAFTA, enhanced by NAFTA. It is so ugly.   The cold, critical measure of the job-hemorrhaging truth this country  has passed since NAFTA's passage is our trade balance. That is how many  more products and services our country exports rather than imports from  offshore sweatshops. That translates into jobs.   Since the inception of NAFTA, our trade deficit has ballooned to  unprecedented levels. This chart basically goes through what has been  happening recently. Each month and each year, we go deeper and deeper  into trade deficit, not just with Mexico, but a number of other  countries. But there has not been a single year of trade balance with  Mexico since NAFTA's passage, just more job dissolution and job loss.   Just in May, the United States experienced an overall $46 billion  trade deficit with the world, of which NAFTA is a part. But since  NAFTA's passage--get this--our country has accumulated nearly $2  trillion net negative balance with Mexico and Canada, and that  translates into lost jobs here at home, and the American people know  it.   This import deficit supports millions of jobs abroad, not U.S.  workers. It means less money left in the wallets of hardworking  Americans as consumer dollars feed the greed of rapacious corporate  interests that feed on desperate workers.   Look at NAFTA's job numbers. Between 1997 and 2010, our country bled  over 696,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico alone. You would recognize  the names of the firms. It is an alphabet soup of companies:  AlliedSignal, Lucent Technologies, Mr. Coffee, Rockwell Automation, UTC  Aerospace Systems, Weyerhaeuser, and so many more.                                time  1030    Unfortunately, the Midwest has suffered the most from this job  hemorrhage. For Ohio, the trade deficit with Mexico alone resulted in  tens of thousands of lost jobs. Ohio workers have had their net incomes  go down by $7,000 per family since NAFTA's passage. Neighboring  Michigan lost over 300,000 jobs since 2000 alone to Mexico.   There is little doubt the original NAFTA agreement failed to create a  modern opportunity for America's workers. It undercut them.   Today, the Trump administration has a chance to change this.  President Trump campaigned and promised to build high-quality jobs and  bring them back to the United States. How can a renegotiated NAFTA do  this? It must include the most modern and enforceable continental labor  agreements to yield rising standards of living so wages and job  training across borders are equalized. If NAFTA were working, more good  U.S. jobs could be created, outnumbering job losses.   Mr. Trump promised a good deal for Americans as a candidate. Now he  has to deliver on that promise. The old expression, ``Don't tell me  what they say, show me what they do,'' will be the true test of this  administration's renegotiation of NAFTA.   The President must take bold action in renegotiating NAFTA, and it  must resolve in reversing these negative balances and making them  positive. He must stand up for America's workers, for their jobs, not  just for global corporate interests, whose shareholders have been  making a fortune off the backs of desperate labor.   Making America Great Again was more than a slogan to the people in  Ohio and the greater Midwest, looking to shake up what was called the  swamp. We need a better deal for America, better jobs, better wages for  a better future, and we can start by renegotiating NAFTA.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Lowey for the time,  and I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen on his maiden voyage--not his  first voyage, but his first as chair of the full committee--and the  members of our fine subcommittee, and especially the staff.   I want to thank Chairman Simpson for his fine leadership and value  the hard work that he put into this bill and his congeniality  throughout the process.   I also want to thank our staff on both sides of the aisle for the  many hours of hard work and dedication: Taunja Berquam on our side,  Donna Shahbaz for the majority, and TJ Lowdermilk on my own staff.   I appreciate that the chairman has allowed robust funding to the  Corps of Engineers, which translates into real jobs from coast to  coast.                                time  1530    I also am pleased that this bill restores the more than $900 million  that the administration proposed to cut from the science account and  provides reasonable funding for energy-saving weatherization in both  cold and hot climates across our Nation.   Unfortunately, the artificially low allocation has forced the  chairman to make deep cuts to some of the most  [[Page H6361]]  important programs in the bill, most notably the Office of Energy  Efficiency & Renewable Energy.   Too many here in Washington have been fooled by the rhetoric that  poses a false choice between the environment and the economy. But,  today, 288,000 Americans work in auto industry supply chain jobs  manufacturing the parts that make vehicles cleaner and more fuel  efficient. In addition, 360,000 people work in the solar industry. The  single fastest growing job in America is wind turbine technician. An  investment in clean energy is an investment in American jobs and our  future.   The response of this bill?   An 83 percent cut from the Vehicle Technologies Office--now that is a  backwards move;   A 60 percent cut to the Advanced Manufacturing Office--and this  Member is unwilling to see that turn to the Chinese;   A 57 percent cut to solar energy--one of the fastest growing job  sectors in our country;   A 65 percent cut to wind energy; and   ARPA-E, the most complex new energy technologies, zero; the program  is eliminated.   These cuts cede the future to offshore competitors who are hacking  into our intellectual property and the bank accounts of firms involved  in these industries hundreds of times a month trying to coopt their  energy technology that American taxpayers have helped to develop.   In an era where Wall Street chases short-term quarterly profits and  ever-improving earnings reports, we owe it to our constituents and to  our progeny to play the long game--making investments that may take  decades to pay off, but they will. The longtime horizon in large  initial capital investments of the energy sector for America means  that, more than any other, path-breaking energy research needs Federal  support until it becomes commercially viable because energy research is  complex.   Though energy is an overlooked ingredient in economic supremacy,  those nations that master its dimensions are leading in economic  growth.   For decades, American Presidents have made statements targeting  energy independence. That makes national security sense. But this year,  that target is finally in sight. A recent Energy Information  Administration report expects the United States to be a net energy  exporter by 2026. The Department of Energy deserves great credit for  bringing us to this point.   Beginning back in the old 1970s and eighties when this all got  started, it took 30 years of Department of Energy support in concert  with the private sector to unleash the fracking revolution that has  helped change our world dramatically. Where was that technology  developed? At the Department of Energy, and it didn't happen in a year  or 2. It took years. The next revolution will be the clean energy  revolution. We must not forfeit that game.   Finally, I would like to raise my concerns over the controversial  riders that threaten not only the ultimate enactment of this bill, but  also our most precious resource: water. Exempting the repeal of the  Clean Water Rule from the Administrative Procedure Act cedes far too  much authority to the executive branch and is something that I cannot  support.   For that reason, and for the draconian cuts to clean energy, I must  urge my colleagues to oppose the Energy and Water portion of this  spending package. When those concerns are rolled together with busting  the spending caps and building an expensive border wall that doesn't  keep us safe or solve our immigration needs, I believe that there is no  excuse for any Democrat to support the overall bill before us.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in very reluctant opposition to this  amendment. I agree with the goal. I agree with the fine Congressman's  goal of getting that lock modernized, improving the access, and  securing the Great Lakes region for generations to come. My problem  lies in the offset coming out of the Energy Efficiency & Renewable  Energy accounts.   So I would only ask the gentleman to consider advising his  colleagues, who will go into conference, if we could find a different  offset, it would sure be a lot more comfortable on this side of the  aisle.   I want to congratulate him for his amendment and, again, reluctantly  rise in opposition.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    May I inquire of the gentleman, where does the offset  come from?    Well, that changes my position.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to  Congressman Mike Simpson and all the members of our subcommittee on  both sides of the aisle for completing our work on time and for  reaching agreement on many of these amendments that will save the  Members angst tonight, and, hopefully, we won't have to work beyond  midnight.   I want to say, with the mark that we have received, we continue to  move America forward on energy independence. We know that by 8 or 9  years it is projected that America will finally be exporting more  energy than we are importing, and we will be 100 percent energy- efficient and energy-independent here at home.   That is quite an accomplishment thinking back to the period of time  in our Nation's history in the last century when we, as a nation, were  subjected to rising oil prices because of embargoes, particularly in  the Middle East, and we fell into deep recession here in our country  back in the 1970s; and subsequent to that, every time gasoline went  over $4 a gallon.   So when we consider the Energy and Water bill, I think we all have to  pat America on the back for having had consistent enlightened leaders  on both sides of the aisle who understood what was important in the  Nation's best interests.   So as we consider this bill today--there were particular amendments  on subjects that range as far afield as the Soo Locks and the Energy  Information Administration, which we will get into in a moment, water  projects that are some of the biggest job creators across this  country--let's not lose sight of the big frame.   The big frame really is that this is a bill that makes America more  secure and that allows us to make progress here at home from coast to  coast. All of our ports and all of our water infrastructure that is so  vital not just west of the Mississippi, but the Great Lakes region and  our coasts, some of the challenges we face in the Everglades, these are  issues that all of America cares about, particularly when it is in your  own backyard.   This is a really important bill for the country. It is not the  largest bill that is considered as part of the appropriations process,  but it is one that is extraordinarily important. And, of course, over  half of our budget deals with our nuclear weapons complement and making  sure that that great asset that we have is maintained, is the finest in  the world, and is the best managed. So this subcommittee has quite a  jurisdiction from coast to coast.   I really want to compliment all the Members who worked so very hard  to bring our bill to the floor on time, within the mark that we were  given. I thank staffs on both sides of the aisle as we proceed forward  here.   I know that the efforts in this bill to fund the future and new  energy sources that are coming forward are in America's national  interests.  [[Page H6428]]    We look at the field of solar, for example. We have over 300,000  people working in the solar energy field, actually more than work in  the coal fields now. Some of those solar companies are in districts  that I represent. This is a new industry. Renewables now comprise 10  percent of all the energy that the country produces, and this has been  a major accomplishment in just the last few decades.   A lot of photovoltaic research goes back to the 1980s. We are now  looking at wind energy, the fastest growing job sector in America. It  is really for wind technicians.   I thank the members of our committee on both sides of the aisle for  appreciating the opportunity to grow this massive industry, including  with investments such as LEEDCo in the State of Ohio; capturing the  Saudi Arabia of wind, which is Lake Erie's complement.   So we feel a sense of accomplishment tonight as we bring this bill to  the floor and we look at the horizons ahead. We know that we have to  deal with the other body, we have to compromise out any of our  differences, but I have a hunch that we are going to be able to do that  very well.   I thank all those who may be listening this evening, particularly  those who are working in our National Labs, the finest labs in the  world that are inventing the future from coast to coast. Over a dozen  and a half of those labs have America's best scientists working on not  just energy research, but derivative spinoffs in the commercial sector  that eventually benefit the entire country.   As I mentioned, the natural gas discovery that has really been  responsible for leading us toward energy independence was made possible  by the fracking technology developed over many years at the U.S.  Department of Energy. So as you look at gas prices going down at the  pump and you look at the competition in the energy industry, we have a  lot of people, many unsung heroes across our country in these labs who  work tirelessly on behalf of the American people. Some are retired and  some are still in place, but we owe them a deep debt of gratitude for  serving the American people so nobly.   We are going to have several other amendments that come before us  tonight.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman if he wishes to make a  statement.    I think it is fair to say, Mr. Chairman, that you do such  a fine job and move the bill along that people were anticipating their  amendments would come up later in the evening. But, as usual, this is  not just an energy efficient committee, but a very efficient committee.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  also rise in opposition to this amendment.   I respect the gentleman from Michigan, particularly because he is  from the Great Lakes region, too, and we need him as a strong voice for  our Great Lakes, but I do think that cuts to these particular accounts  really are counterproductive, for the following reasons.   First of all, the most important step any country can take to deal  with the deficit is to grow the economy. This particular budget, this  particular set of accounts, particularly the Army Corps of Engineers,  has the type of construction and building accounts that produce income.  They produce income for people who do the work, but they also improve  our ports.   If you look all around Michigan, if you look at the Soo Locks, if you  look at the assets just in our region of the country, the progress that  a region can make, because it improves its ports and attendant roads  and rails and so forth, creates opportunity for companies to locate and  to grow.   We just had a phenomenal announcement in the city of Toledo this week  by the Cleveland-Cliffs company. We have been working for 30 years to  improve the port to connect rail and to have east to west, north to  south highway improvements. By golly, it worked with a $700 million  investment by the private sector. It was just so exciting to bring ore  from Michigan and Minnesota into the lower lakes. It was really quite  incredible.   So these dollars yield results. They don't happen in one year. They  take a while to happen, but they happen.    I also oppose the gentleman's amendment because there are $62 billion  of backlogged projects at the Army Corps of Engineers alone. I don't  know if you saw the stories about the Department of the Interior.  People are lined up to get into the national parks through those  turnstiles, trying to get into our national parks.   We need to improve those parks. We need to make sure that we are  doing things like dealing with the Forest Service so that the  underbrush is cut out and that our forests aren't burning up all over  the country.   We have such a maintenance backlog across this Nation, and with  budgets of this size, we don't want to be in a position where we under  account for the funds that are being spent.   So to reduce funding for critical oversight in the administrative  departments of these very large agencies, I think is not wise. In fact,  it is penny-wise and pound-foolish in the end.   Mr. Chair, for all of those reasons--our jobs, the security of  taxpayer funds, and for the sake of the future--I oppose the  gentleman's amendment and urge my colleagues to join me.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to add a bit to that.   I thank Congressman Mast very much for offering this amendment. I do  think we need to work with the Corps. Obviously, this is a growing  problem. We have heard from Florida colleagues. We have heard from  colleagues in Nevada, throughout the Great Lakes region.   These algal blooms are truly frightening. In the Midwest, in the  Great Lakes region, a major water system was shut down for 3 days in  the city of Toledo, denying water to over half a million people for 3  days. It is quite frightening.   At the moment, there is no--and I say this for the Corps' benefit,  because it would require cooperation with other agencies--ecosystem  satellite mapping or drone technology currently that is able to photo  large regions and home in on where the nutrients are that are causing  the problem.                                time  2000    As I have gotten into this more deeply, we need high science, whether  it is high-frequency infrared or whatever we use. We do not have the  ability to home in on where the causes are coming from and then target  the toxic portions of those algal blooms.   So a lot of work is needed, and I really appreciate the gentleman  rising tonight. I know you have gotten the Corps' attention as you have  gotten our attention, and we will work with the chairman to see if we  can't make progress on this really vexing issue.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Congressman  Beyer, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would essentially strike the  provision related to the waters of the United States, section 108.  Unfortunately, Republican insistence on the inclusion of poison pill  riders like this one has derailed several important pieces of  legislation over the last few years, especially clean water rural  riders.   However, let me be plain. This rider is worse than any of those  previous versions, and it will not gain the Democratic votes necessary  to become law. It actually is a roadblock in the way of us moving our  bills forward.   This rider would exempt the repeal of the clean water rule from laws  that would otherwise apply, including the Administrative Procedure Act,  essentially allowing the President to act unilaterally, the executive  branch to act unilaterally without any input from the public. That  doesn't sound like America to me.   The Administrative Procedure Act was a Republican idea to make sure  that government is accountable to its citizens and that their input be  considered. People have come to expect this in their own communities.  Exempting this action on clean water is a very slippery slope toward  government by fiat, by an administration which deserves more scrutiny,  I might add, on that front than any in our history.   So I urge all my colleagues to support the Kaptur-Beyer amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to comment, in asking my  colleagues to support this amendment, that the amendment itself is  intended to address the two Supreme Court decisions. And in addition,  if we leave this language in the bill, the chairman was correct, this  is at the policy level. This doesn't belong in an appropriation bill.  Let them deal with this in the courts and the authorizing committees.   I think it creates a very, very high speed bump that threatens our  bill's passage as we move forward, so I ask my colleagues to support us  on striking the provision related to the waters of the United States,  section 108 offered by myself and Mr. Beyer of Virginia.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    I respect Congressman McKinley's amendment and his desire  to help America and help his own State. And for my entire career, I  have voted for clean coal research and development because southern  Ohio has a whole lot of Btus underground in the form of coal.   However, I really object to the gentleman taking the funds from the  Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account. I would like you to know  that that account, in this bill, is cut $986 million below last year's  level, and that is a deep concern because that is the part of our  economy that is growing.   Ten percent of the jobs produced in the energy sector are in  renewables, and we actually employ more people in solar and in wind  energy than we do in coal extraction. So we know that a major part of  our future lies in new energy technologies, these developing  [[Page H6437]]  technologies which have been proving themselves.   An additional cut of $33.4 million in the EERE account would further  weaken these new technologies. And I will guarantee you that the  technologies are so valuable that the Russians and the Chinese are  hacking into these companies repeatedly because of their importance to  the future, and they recognize where the future is headed. And we have  got a real job on our hands to hold on to these technologies because of  that and because of their market manipulation.   China is a great market manipulator. She has a state-run economy, and  it is not fair. If they can't steal the technology directly--if you  invest over there and you take your technology there, they steal your  IT there.                                time  2100    So just since 2003, our country has spent $2.6 trillion importing  foreign petroleum. When you think about the importance of America being  energy independent here at home, coal, clean coal, has a role to play  in that, but these new technologies have a major role to play as well.  We all support a diverse energy portfolio to eliminate our reliance on  imported energy--some would say addiction to imported energy. We have  been breaking that addiction.   We should be advancing technology to clean up fossil energy, yes, and  this bill already does that with sufficient funding to the fossil  energy accounts. Our country should be leading investment in these  technologies, not just for our own energy security, but also for  economic opportunities and the jobs that this expanding market is  already providing us.   We can't really afford to cede this market to any other country in  the world, and I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment to support the growth of vibrant coastal economies and  creation of fisheries and agriculture jobs.   The National Ocean Policy is helping agencies and States collaborate  to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and one can  just take a look that the ocean policy supports almost 2 million  fisheries-related jobs in our country and $5.3 billion in commercial  fish landings, as well as enhanced tourism, and the National Ocean  Policy doesn't cost us anything.   I just want to remind people that our country currently imports 91  percent of consumed seafood, with half coming from foreign agriculture.  So this policy is extraordinarily important.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman so much for coming to  the floor tonight, and I want to thank all of our colleagues who have  spoken out so eloquently on the importance of National Ocean Policy in  supporting the Pingree, et al. amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman has a point of view  that I do not support, but in terms of this amendment, it really is not  necessary. It is redundant. On March 28 of this year, Executive Order  No. 13783, signed by President Donald Trump, has rescinded every one of  the analyses that the gentleman referenced in his proposed amendment.  So this amendment does less than nothing. It has already been dealt  with through executive order.   I would just encourage my colleagues to let's move the agenda along  this evening where we will have significant debate perhaps on other  matters.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because  it is redundant at this point, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the intent of the  gentlewoman's amendment. I am very glad to hear what the gentlewoman is  saying. She is trying to do everything she can to support American-made  products and particularly American-made anchor chain. I would be  willing to work with the chairman and the gentlewoman as the process  goes forward to ensure we purchase American-made products. I just  wanted to express that support. I thank the gentleman for his offer.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, with all the respect I have for Congressman  Burgess, I oppose this damaging rider which would block the Department  of Energy from implementing or enforcing commonsense energy efficiency  standards for lightbulbs.   This rider was a bad idea when it was first offered 7 years ago, and  it is even more unsupportable now. Why do I say that? Because every  claim made by proponents of the rider have been proven wrong.   Number one, we have been told, including by Dr. Burgess, that the  energy efficiency standards would ban incandescent lightbulbs. That is  simply false. You can go to the store today and see shelves of modern  energy efficient incandescent lightbulbs that meet the standard, and  they are the same as the old bulbs except they last longer, use less  electricity, and save consumers money.   Then we heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict  consumer choice.                                time  2345    If you have shopped for lightbulbs lately, which I have, you know  that isn't true. In fact, modern incandescent bulbs, compact  fluorescent lightbulbs, and LEDs of every shape, size, and color are  now available.   Consumers have never had more choice, and the efficiency standard  spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers. I  am amazed how many shelves lightbulbs now occupy in the stores.   Critics of the efficiency standards claim that they would cost  consumers money. In fact, the opposite is true. When the standards are  in full effect, the average American family will save about $100 per  year. That is pretty good. That is $12.5 billion in savings for  consumers and businesses nationwide every year. That is $12.5 billion.  But this rider threatens those savings. That is why consumer groups  have consistently opposed this rider.   Here is the reality. The 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards  for lightbulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to  enjoy overwhelming industry support. U.S. manufacturers are already  meeting the efficiency standards.   The effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell  old, inefficient lightbulbs in the United States that violate the  efficiency standards. That is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have  invested millions of dollars in U.S. plants to make efficient bulbs  that meet the standards.   Why on Earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign  manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalize U.S. manufacturers who  are following our laws?   But it gets even worse. The mere existence of this rider poses and  additional threat to U.S. manufacturing. The bipartisan 2007 Energy  bill required the Department of Energy to establish updated lightbulb  efficiency standards by January 1 of this year. It also provided that,  if final updated standards are not issued by then, a more stringent  backstop standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect, and  incandescent lightbulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard.   Well, we are well into 2017, and the Burgess lightbulb rider has  remained on the books. So, earlier this year, the Department of Energy  had to go forward with finalizing the 45-lumens-per-watt backstop  standard.   Approving this rider year after year is ultimately what blocked the  Department of Energy from issuing the required efficiency standards in  time to avoid such stringent measures. Ironically, it is this rider  that would effectively ban the incandescent lightbulb in 2020.   The Burgess rider directly threatens existing lightbulb manufacturing  jobs in the United States. It would stifle innovation and punish  companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing. This rider aims  to reverse years of technological progress, only to kill jobs, increase  electricity bills for our consumers, and worsen pollution.  [[Page H6459]]    It is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology. It is time to  listen to the manufacturing companies, consumer groups, and efficiency  advocates who all agree that this rider is harmful.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the Burgess  lightbulb rider, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this particular  amendment.   I say to the gentleman: For the company in your district, the  regulations include the opportunity for waiver. And I would hope that  the company in your district would be able to work that out.   The amendment that the gentleman proposes seeks to prohibit the  Department of Energy from implementing testing procedures for the  energy efficiency standards set for heat pumps and air-conditioners.   I, as the consumer, whether I am buying a heat pump, a furnace, a  refrigerator--and every American who now shops looks for those--that is  like the sticker. That is what you really look for, and you want to  know how much you are going to pay every year for what that product  will cost you for energy. And the better product you have, and you are  able to put that on a label and it is verified by the Department of  Energy, that helps sales.   The original standards that were created were supported and have been  supported by the Edison Electric Institute, the association which  represents all investor-owned utilities. The amendment, by the way, is  opposed by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute,  which represents manufacturers of HVAC systems that employ over 1.3  million Americans. And industry opposes the amendment,  environmentalists oppose it, because it would cost an average--a  cumulative cost to Americans of $12.2 billion over 30 years.   So there is a lot of opposition to this. It is important to note that  these standards were negotiated in a collaborative process by industry  groups, environmental nonprofits, and consumer advocates with the  Department of Energy. A rider like this one damages the integrity of  the negotiated rulemaking process, which is designed to provide  certainty and voice to the industry and education and information to  consumers.   Test procedures are simple and important. The Department of Energy  develops them to make sure companies are rating their product  accurately so consumers don't get stuck paying higher bills than they  expect, so you know what you buy.   Let's be clear. This amendment would effectively nullify the  efficiency standards for heating and cooling systems, in spite of the  fact that these standards project that it will save billions of dollars  over the period that they are applied, and that is equivalent to having  1 million fewer homes connected to the grid over the same period. It is  an enormous savings.   If there is a particular company that is unfairly impacted by these  rules, there are outlets for regulatory relief through waivers, as I  have mentioned, and this amendment would neuter  [[Page H6461]]  those standards and thereby allow cheap imports to undercut American  products by exploiting the lack of standards.   We don't want to go back to that. I look for those yellow labels. To  protect American manufacturers, to save Americans money on their  utility bills, and to reduce air pollution, I strongly oppose this  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   The gentleman may have a good intention in offering this amendment,  but I don't think you want to take away the benefits to the American  people for one company in your district when that company, in fact, can  negotiate and receive a waiver. I would just ask my colleagues to vote  ``no.''   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment  offered by my friends, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Huizenga and, I have no  doubt, many fellow travelers from the Great Lakes delegation on both  sides of the aisle. I find it somewhat unusual that it is the last  amendment this evening after midnight. I wish it had come up about 6  o'clock on the evening news.   This is an issue we know well, as Mr. Huizenga, Mr. Mitchell, and  certainly our chairman, Mr. Simpson, has heard a great deal about this  now, and our ranking members on the full committee as well.   We introduced a bill last month with the same ultimate effect of  preventing the spread of Asian carp into the Great Lakes. The Great  Lakes represent a $7 billion fishery, deeply threatened by these  critters, Asian carp, that shouldn't even be in this country but began  their movement up the Mississippi River when they were brought in to do  bottom cleaning in Mississippi in the special fish tanks that were set  up down there many years ago as bottom feeders. There was some type of  storm and they hopped out. The walls were breached, and they began  their journey up the Mississippi until now. They are within just a few  miles of Lake Michigan.   Just a few weeks ago, a 28-inch Asian carp was caught beyond the  protective barriers, which is a temporary solution, only 9 miles from  Lake Michigan. Yet, even in this time of greatest danger, the Brandon  Road Study, which Congressman Mitchell outlined, which merely  identifies options for preventing Asian carp from reaching the Great  Lakes, has not been released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   This amendment would prevent the administration from expending any  more funds to further delay the release of this study for public  comment.   My colleagues should know that this study is already completed. After  working on it for years at a cost of nearly $7 million, it now sits on  a shelf at the Corps, and they are unwilling to release it for reasons  we do not understand.   Asian carp represent a serious economic and environmental threat to  the entire Great Lakes. These mean critters are voracious eaters. They  destroy native species and overwhelm their new ecosystems. They have  gotten into the Ohio River, and they have gotten into rivers near  Peoria. They eat up everything in their sight. They completely upend  native ecosystems, and it is truly terrifying what they will do to our  lakes, as you can see in this photograph. They are prolific, they are  large, and they are predatory.    We should be aggressively pursuing action to prevent the spread of  the Asian carp to the Great Lakes, yet the roadmap to getting there is  locked in bureaucratic purgatory.   Finally, I would like to point out that this is not a partisan issue.  Our substantively similar bill has 15 Republican and 16 Democratic  cosponsors, who represent the vast majority of the Great Lakes  coastline. In these hyperpartisan times, our constituents are united in  their love for the Great Lakes, their desire to protect them, and their  understanding of how vital they are to the future of this country and  continent.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment from all of my  colleagues in order to save the national treasures that are the Great  Lakes.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Huizenga  for taking the lead this evening from the great Wolverine State--and we  Buckeyes don't often say that, do we--for embracing what is truly  important to all of us, and I urge my colleagues to support the  Mitchell-Huizenga amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
