 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Salem Rescue Squad  for being awarded the 2023 Volunteer EMS Service of the Year Award.   For the past 90 years, the Salem Rescue Squad has displayed selfless  service to the city of Salem. Today, under the leadership of Chief Glen  Gray and Captain Darlene Gee, the Salem Rescue Squad is the second  oldest all-volunteer rescue squad in the United States.   Operating out of one station, the squad responds to approximately  2,000 calls per year and provides standby coverage for large events in  addition to responding to any disaster in the area.   Recruitment and retention for a small volunteer service can often be  a challenge, but due to aggressive efforts, the squad has successfully  doubled its staff over the last 2 years and has 29 active members. The  volunteers serve as paramedics and offer prehospital care, giving up  their time and energy to help others in the community.   Congratulations again to Chief Gray, Captain Gee, and the entire  Salem Rescue Squad on receiving this incredible award.                            ____________________
