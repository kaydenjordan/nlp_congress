 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, my CRA on public  charter schools is a simple vote today. It is a vote for common sense;  it is a vote for parents; and it is a vote for kids.   Here is the truth: Everywhere in America, except for Washington, DC,  this is an 80-percent issue. Literally, 68 percent of Democrats, 67  percent of Independents, 68 percent of African-Americans, and 72  percent of Hispanics all agree with some form of school choice. This is  simply a public charter school issue stopping the Biden administration  from destroying one of the most important vehicles for human prosperity  for the kids of our country. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.    I ask unanimous consent for another 30  seconds.    This issue is an issue of America's  future and America's now. Today, our kids desperately need quality  education from sea to shining sea. This CRA provides us more momentum  in the direction of making sure the poorest kids in the poorest ZIP  Codes have quality education. That is all this is about.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading  and was read the third time.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 60     I ask for the yeas and nays.
