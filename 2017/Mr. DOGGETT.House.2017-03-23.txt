 Mr. Speaker, we are considering a bill so bad it was  kept under lock and key, hidden from Democrats and those Republicans  who would not pledge allegiance to it; a bill that was so destructive  that no witness would come to defend or explain it in all-night  committee sessions; a bill jammed through this House, logically, you  would expect this special rule to jam it through today.   What is at stake here is not only the crumbling and destruction of  health care, but it is the crumbling of our democracy.  [[Page H2359]]    Our Republican colleagues need to remember that this is Washington,  not Moscow. This is Congress, not the Duma.   We deserve a fair consideration of this bill open to discussion  because of its impact on millions of Americans who will lose their  access to a family physician. These heavyhanded tactics reflect the  fear of the American public getting an opportunity to look thoroughly  at this bill and understand what it does to each family affected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the rule.                                time  1015    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
