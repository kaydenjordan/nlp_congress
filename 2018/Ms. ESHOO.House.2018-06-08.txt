 Mr. Speaker, Monday, June 11, will be the first day  without net neutrality protections, thanks to the Trump administration.   For the last decade and a half, the internet has become the biggest  driver of our economy, of education, access to information, and the  conduct of commerce. It all happened under net neutrality, because each  of us had the freedom to go where we wanted to go, see what we wanted  to see, and read what we wanted to read.   On Monday, the rules to protect an open internet will cease to exist.  Consumers will no longer be guaranteed that they can choose to go where  they want to go or do what they want to do online. Businesses can be  made to pay tolls to reach their customers. The huge internet service  providers can reign with impunity over the most important tool in our  economy and our democracy.   Over all the years I have represented my Silicon Valley district, I  have never had a constituent or a company ask me to turn total control  of the internet over to the ISPs.   Congress can act to prevent this takeover. That is why I am a  cosponsor of the Congressional Review Act, a bill to disable the  administration's giveaway of the internet. Mr. Chair, I urge my  colleagues to stand on the right side of history with millions of  Americans and do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will prevent the Army from  moving forward with its plan to sell 17 acres of Federal land and 126  military housing units known as Shenandoah Square in the heart of my  congressional district.   Shenandoah Square is located next to Moffett Federal Airfield in  Mountain View, California, and houses 108 military and civilian  families serving in the Air National Guard, the Army National Guard,  the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Marine Corps.   Established in 2004, Shenandoah Square is part of the California  Military Communities privatized military housing entity, which consists  of 2,900 homes located at Fort Irwin, Camp Parks, Moffett Federal  Airfield, and Shenandoah Square.   This entity is overleveraged and is in hundreds of millions of  dollars in debt because of the Army's decision to overinvest in housing  at Fort Irwin that assumed greater than realized gains in the Basic  Housing Allowance provided to servicemembers.   Now the Army is justifying its sale of Shenandoah Square on the  grounds that there is declining demand for military housing in the bay  area, but this is hardly the case. In fact, it is absurd.   I have met with the families and servicemembers living at Shenandoah  Square who serve in the region with the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps,  Navy, and the Coast Guard. The residents have consistently raised  concerns that the property management company contracted by the Army  has been working to drive out the remaining military personnel living  in the Shenandoah complex to artificially depress military demand for  housing to justify its decision to sell the land.   My Silicon Valley district is facing one of the most severe housing  crises in the country, and the 17 acres of land that Shenandoah sits on  is some of the most valuable in our entire country. Clearly, the Army  is selling Shenandoah Square to pay down the debt it created and keep  the California Military Communities entity from going bankrupt. This is  really wrong and does a huge disservice to the military families living  in this housing.   This House is already on record expressing concerns about the Army's  plans to sell Shenandoah Square. I offered an amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act for 2019 expressing the sense of Congress  that the Army should explore all possible alternatives to a sale,  including subleasing the property to an entity that can better develop  affordable housing on the property, and the amendment was adopted by a  voice vote.   The Army can pursue a win-win situation by subleasing this land to  one of the many willing partners in Silicon Valley seeking to develop  housing and generate a regular stream of income to make this LLC whole  again, but they refuse to.   Mr. Chairman, I want to make something very clear. I would support  new housing for our military families if they included our military  families. They are offering housing for 8 families, when we have 109. I  think that this is really unacceptable.   We can't allow military families to be left without housing as they  serve our country in one of the most expensive housing markets in the  country. That is why I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. I urge my colleagues  to support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
