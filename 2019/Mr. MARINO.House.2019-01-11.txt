 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on Friday, January 11  due to personal reasons. Had I been present, I would have voted as  follows: ``yea'' for rollcall No. 26, ``nay'' for rollcall No. 27,  ``yea'' for rollcall No. 28, and ``yea'' for rollcall No. 29.                            ____________________
