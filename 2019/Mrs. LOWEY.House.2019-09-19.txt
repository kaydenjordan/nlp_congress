 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 564, I call up  the bill (H.R. 4378) making continuing appropriations for fiscal year  2020, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while the House did its work and passed 12  appropriations bills through committee and 10 off the floor, the Senate  appropriations process is far behind. Because of this delay, we must  pass a continuing resolution to avoid another government shutdown like  the one that started late last year which caused real harm to our  economy and to hardworking Americans.   With less than 2 weeks until the end of the fiscal year, a clean  continuing resolution that keeps government open and funds key  priorities is so important. This legislation avoids controversial  policy provisions that have slowed down the appropriations process and  that, if included, would jeopardize passage. For example, it does not  include an anomaly requested by the Trump administration to allow wall  building outside the Rio Grande Valley.   At the same time, the CR contains provisions that reflect shared  priorities, including allowing the Census Bureau to ramp up  preparations for the 2020 decennial Census, extending funding for the  Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative for another year, ensuring that  FEMA disaster relief can be spent as quickly as needed to effectively  respond to disasters, ensuring the Department of Agriculture can  operate rural water and waste loan programs, and extending the National  Flood Insurance Program and authorization for the Export-Import Bank.   In addition to these provisions, extenders that have been negotiated  by my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means  Committees will keep health programs that are critical to American  families up and running.   By extending these programs and government funding through November  21, this CR will allow additional time to negotiate our differences and  enact responsible long-term funding for priorities that help make our  country safer and stronger.   As we negotiate, families, businesses, and communities across the  country will have much-needed budget certainty with no disruption to  vital services or to the pay of Federal employees.   After we pass this CR and the Senate moves forward with their  process, Democrats will negotiate responsible appropriations bills that  uphold our values and give working families a better chance at a better  life.   Keeping government open and providing certainty for our communities  must be a top priority. Our continuing resolution is a necessary step  to that end.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.  [[Page H7793]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the distinguished  chairwoman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), an outstanding member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Without action, the government will shut down in the next 2 weeks,  causing undue harm for our economy and hardworking families. This is  unacceptable.   Our continuing resolution will provide budget certainty for families,  businesses, and communities while we negotiate long-term funding for  our priorities and fight to give every person a better chance at a  better life.   I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
