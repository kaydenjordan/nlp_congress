 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burr  and I be permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Biden  administration's nomination of Robert Califf to be the FDA  Commissioner.   As FDA Commissioner during the Obama administration, Mr. Califf  showed blatant disregard for the unborn and for the health and safety  of women and girls when he weakened safety and reporting requirements  for a dangerous chemical abortion drug.   In fact, this past December, the Biden administration went further  and announced it would eliminate entirely the in-person dispensing  requirement for the abortion drug. This very reckless decision promotes  mail order, do-it-yourself abortion-on-demand and disregards the  growing threat to women's health posed by chemical abortion drugs. For  example, without physician in-person screening, women are denied the  opportunity to be screened for dangerous conditions like ectopic  pregnancies, which can cause life-threatening complications.   Mr. Califf has refused to distance himself from the FDA's decision to  abandon vulnerable pregnant women to the reckless and predatory actions  of the abortion industry. Mr. Califf has a track record of putting an  extreme abortion agenda above the science.   The nomination of Robert Califf to be FDA Commissioner endangers the  well-being of unborn babies, women, and girls, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in opposing his nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Jane Lee Hamman of Jefferson County as Montanan of the  Month for her patriotism and dedication to serving her community,  State, and Nation.   Jane's selfless contributions began at a young age when she started  volunteering for Meals on Wheels with her parents. Jane also joined her  parents in supporting Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the  civil rights movement, believing in equal opportunity and advancements  for all people based on their character, not the color of their skin.  Her life mantra is, ``living to advance freedom, knowledge and justice  for all.'' I think I speak for all who know her when I say she truly  embraces these ideals.   Jane's love for her country is on full display in her monthly column  she writes for the Boulder Monitor newspaper. The goal of Jane's column  is to preserve liberty, educate readers about America's vision of the  Declaration of Independence, and celebrate our Constitution. She also  shares her values of patriotism and volunteerism with others while  serving as the lay leader of the Clancy United Methodist Church and as  the Oro Fino Chapter Registrar of the Daughters' of the American  Revolution. Additionally, Jane has been appointed by Governor Greg  Gianforte to the Montana State Board of Education and is the chair for  the North Jefferson County Public Library District Board of Trustees.   I have no doubt that her love for the great State of Montana and the  United States of America influences every person she meets. It is my  honor to recognize Jane for her commitment to serving her community,  State, and country while spreading Montana values of service and  patriotism.   Keep up the great work, Jane.                            ____________________
