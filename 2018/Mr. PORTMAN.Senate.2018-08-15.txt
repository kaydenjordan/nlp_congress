 Mr. President, I want to talk today about the opioid  epidemic that has gripped my State of Ohio and so many other States  represented by Members of the Chamber. This is now the No. 1 killer in  Ohio. It has surpassed car accidents. It is the No. 1 cause of death  for Americans under the age of 50. Unfortunately, although some are  saying we have turned the corner, we haven't turned the corner in a lot  of parts of my State. In fact, there are areas of my State where there  have been more overdose deaths this year than there were last year. As  tragic as last year was--and there was a big increase from the year  before--I do believe that in this Chamber, we have made progress in  passing legislation, which is beginning to make a difference. I will  talk a little bit about that today. I also believe we have much more to  do.   In the last couple of years, Congress has gotten busy on this issue.  In 2016, we passed legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act. It was the culmination of 4 years' worth of work-- conferences here in Washington; bringing together some of the best  minds from around the country; looking at some of the best practices to  say ``How do you actually focus on this issue of the opioid epidemic in  a comprehensive way?'' because we know that is what has to be done. It  was about evidence-based prevention, strategies, evidence-based  treatment, and longer term recovery. It was actually the first time  Congress had ever passed legislation dealing with longer term recovery,  and that is because we heard so much testimony--I, back home in Ohio,  and Members from around the country but also here in Washington--from  experts about the fact that when you go into treatment, particularly  for this opioid epidemic, the chances of success are increased  dramatically if you have longer term recovery. Think of sober housing  opportunities, for instance, after somebody comes out of treatment, to  help get them on the right track.   That bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Sheldon  Whitehouse is now working back home. It is now going out to programs  that are evidence-based, proven programs, to try to give them a little  boost, working with local government, State government, nonprofits, and  others, leveraging some of the Federal money so that it ends up making  a bigger difference in trying to turn the tide on this epidemic.   Maybe most important, this legislation, which is called the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA--maybe the most  important thing about CARA is that it recognizes addiction as a  disease. In some respect, it was the first time we had done that as a  Congress as well. Recognizing it as a disease changes the way you view  treatment because it is something that is not a moral failing. In fact,  it is often caused by an accident or an injury--somebody getting a  prescription pill that changes something in their brain, and they  become addicted.   The point is, in order to solve it, in order to address it, treatment  is the avenue that is going to be more successful. I think treating it  like a disease is one of the essential aspects of it. Also, pulling  away the stigma, getting some of the stigma out of the way, enables  more people to come forward to get treatment for their family members,  to seek treatment for a loved one, and enables doctors and others in  the medical profession to treat people in a way that helps get them on  the right path to recovery.   That legislation passed. In fact, earlier this year, in the  bipartisan budget agreement, there was additional funding put aside for  CARA and for other opioid programs, including one I will talk about in  second, and that was very important. That 2-year funding bill provided  $6 billion over 2 years. That is unprecedented. We have never done  anything like that around here.   Are we making progress? Yes. Are we there yet? No. In my view, the  CARA  [[Page S5604]]  legislation was the right first step, but there is a second step now  that is needed, which is called CARA 2.0, the Comprehensive Addiction  Recovery Act 2.0. It learns from some of the things that we have found  in the field as CARA has been implemented. It picks up some additional  provisions. For instance, it talks about the need to deal even more  substantially with overprescribing because most people who die in your  State or mine from an opioid overdose started with prescription drugs.  That was their first opioid.   Earlier, I mentioned that people who might have had an accident or  injury are given opioids. We need to stop that overprescribing in order  to get at the core of so much of this problem. Probably 8 out of 10  people in Ohio who overdose on heroin or fentanyl started on  prescription drugs--sometimes obtained legally and sometimes not.   It breaks my heart to have a young person come to my office and say  ``I had my wisdom tooth taken out''--this has happened to me fairly  frequently because people know I am focused on this issue--``and this  doctor gave me opioids, pills, for a wisdom tooth removal.'' In the  cases recently in my office, it has been a young person saying ``I was  too smart to take them.'' Thank goodness. Be careful. To the parents  out there and the kids who are listening, be careful.   Our CARA 2.0 legislation includes, by the way, a 3-day limit on  prescription drugs for acute pain. Acute pain would be after a  procedure like that, as an example. The dentists I know--including the  new head of the American Dental Association, who has a passion for this  issue because he is from Cincinnati, my hometown--understand the impact  of this. A lot of people I talk to say you should not be using opioids  at all in that case. When I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I wasn't  given opioids, nor were many in my generation. Yet that seems to be  normal today. This is an example in CARA 2.0 of going even further, but  in the meantime, we have the CARA legislation out there. It is being  funded. That is a good thing.   The other legislation is called the Cures legislation. That funding  goes directly to the State and then is delivered to various groups  around the State, usually through the Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and  Mental Health Boards, the ADAMHS Boards. Some of you know about those  and probably have been involved in those. That was passed at the end of  2016. It was passed as part of the 21st Century Cures legislation,  which was broader legislation, but we made sure that opioids were  included there.   I thank my colleagues for working with me on that. There were so  many, but Lamar Alexander, the Senator from Tennessee, stands out as an  appropriator and authorizer who knew we needed to get some more funding  out to these States, particularly States like mine and his that are so  hard hit. I thank Shelly Moore Capito from West Virginia, a State that  probably is, unfortunately, No. 1 now in terms of overdose deaths. Ohio  is right behind it. West Virginia is another State that has been hit  hard. So many colleagues of mine fought to ensure that there was  funding in that legislation. It is making a difference as well.   Last year, my home State of Ohio received $26 million, for instance,  in Cures funding and just recently, another $26 million, which is being  distributed now. These two laws, CARA and Cures, are helping and  encouraging innovative programs across Ohio. I have had an opportunity  to visit a lot of these programs around the State. I have been to  dozens of treatment centers and to roundtable discussions and  communities to talk about how this funding can be used most  effectively. Let me give a couple of examples.   The week before last, I was in the Columbus area, in a town called  Whitehall. I went to the fire station to have a roundtable discussion  about this with community leaders and to see how their program, which  is called SAFE, is working. It is called the SAFE Station Program, and  it was made possible with a $400,000 grant through the CARA  legislation. This funding has been used to train our firefighters, EMS  personnel, so they understand how to deal with the opioid issues so  that when there is an overdose, they can help somebody go into  treatment.   This is important for a couple of reasons. This seems very simple.  Unfortunately, there is a big gap right now in most of our communities.  I encourage you to plug in to your own community to find out whether it  is happening in yours because it probably is; that is, someone who  overdoses is now typically saved by this miracle drug called Narcan.  Our legislation, CARA, provides more funding for Narcan. We need this.  It is necessary, but it is not sufficient. So many people who overdose  are saved by this miracle drug that reverses the effect of the  overdose, but then what happens? In the vast majority of cases, these  people go right back to the old environment--maybe to a dysfunctional  family, maybe to a gang, maybe to the old neighborhood.   If you talk to EMS personnel, firefighters, and police officers, who  are the ones responsible for finding these people and treating them,  they will tell you that they are not happy about giving someone Narcan  again and again. They want to see that person get into treatment. It  makes no sense for any of us and certainly not for the taxpayer. It  also makes no sense for that addict and that addict's family and  friends and employer, if there is one, because that person is not  getting the help he or she needs.   How do you close that gap? They are doing it at this firehouse in  Whitehall, OH. They are doing it in two ways--one, opening up the doors  to the firehouse and saying: Come on in.   When I was there, just by chance, a young man, who described himself  to me as a heroin addict--and he had heroin on his person--had arrived  just before me at this firehouse. Just by chance, he had come in off  the streets because he felt it was a safe place. He wasn't going to get  arrested. No one was to going to ask him a lot of questions. But they  were going to get him into treatment. He said he was ready.   Of course I asked him, as I often do with addicts and recovering  addicts, how many times he had been through treatment and what worked  or didn't work. He had been through it three times already, and it  hadn't worked. He said that the difference now is that he believes he  is ready. You have to believe him. You have to get someone in treatment  when they are ready. That is why having the doors open at the firehouse  is very important. He was nervous, but he was transported right after I  had a chance to visit with him. I got to see how these EMS personnel  compassionately and professionally dealt with him as he was getting  ready to be transported to what is called the Addiction Stabilization  Center in downtown Columbus, run by Maryhaven.   Interestingly, CARA funded the fire station and their program. Cures  is what made possible the Addiction Stabilization Center--$1.2 million  in Cures funding--in downtown Columbus, which is taking people from all  over Franklin County and the Columbus area and making a tremendous  difference in getting people not just through the Narcan and saving  their lives but getting them into treatment and recovery. That is the  key, closing that gap. It is tragic to me that the gap is so prevalent  and is causing such a problem around our State and our country.   The other thing they do, of course, at this fire station is that when  they have someone who has overdosed and has been given Narcan, they  bring them through this system and take them to the Maryhaven  stabilization center and get them the help they need. It has worked  remarkably well. Not everybody agrees to go, but the vast majority do.  That is a huge difference from what normally happens in our country. It  is an example of the kind of comprehensive program that is going to  help close the gaps and catch those who are falling between the cracks.   It is no surprise that the Surgeon General of the United States, Dr.  Jerome Adams, said recently, when he visited this program in Columbus,  that this is ``one of the best programs in the country for lowering  stigma and enabling recovery.'' I appreciate the Surgeon General's  involvement and his willingness to come to Ohio to help us and see how  these programs we have passed in the Congress are working.   I have seen similar successes made possible through Cures funding and  CARA funding around the State. Recently, I was in Summit County, which  is in Northeast Ohio--going from Columbus, Central Ohio, to Northeast  Ohio--at Summa Barberton Hospital.  [[Page S5605]]  They just received a grant from Cures. They are using that for a pilot  program to employ a full-time addiction care coordinator during the  overnight hours and to ensure that there is medication-assisted  treatment available at the emergency room itself. It had not been  available previously. What they are finding is that somebody comes into  the emergency room, and typically that person walks right back out the  door after being saved by this miracle drug, Narcan--also known as  naloxone--never to be heard from again until there is another overdose.  Sometimes, by the way, according to the nurses, that overdose might  happen as soon as the next several hours in the parking lot at the  hospital.   That is no solution. So what they are doing instead is bringing  people in, sending them to a counselor, and I got to meet the three  women who are counselors there, incredibly empathetic women who are  taking these people in, saying: No stigma here. No questions asked. How  can we help you? Wouldn't you like to be back with your kids or back in  a job or back in a place where you can respect yourself?   They have had remarkable success by saying: We can provide you, right  now, right here--in their case--Suboxone, which is a medication- assisted treatment program where you wean somebody off a drug like  Suboxone in order for them to get off their addiction and not go  through the horrible pain of withdrawal, at least not as difficult a  withdrawal.   So they have had great success with that program as well--again,  closing that gap.   I encourage you to look in your community for these kinds of programs  and support them.   They are also collaborating with United Way of Summit County and  engaging the business community to help with this issue. That makes me  really happy. Every time I meet with business groups now, I try to  raise this issue. So we talked about the importance of tax reform and  tax cuts and regulatory relief, and all of that is great. Our economy  is picking up, but do you know what? It is incredible. The No. 1  problem we have in our economy right now is what? Lack of workers.  Every employer--small, large, medium size--is telling me: We need  workers. There is a skills gap, of course, and there are other issues,  but I think the single biggest issue is this opioid epidemic. That is  based on a couple of studies--one is from the Department of Labor, one  from the Brookings Institution--which show that those who are out of  work altogether, who aren't even applying for jobs--and, by the way,  among men, that may be at historic levels. About 8\1/2\ million men are  literally not trying to get a job--8\1/2\ million men between 25 and  55, prime working years, and you know what half of them say, 46  percent, based on one survey, 44 percent another survey--and that is  not overreported. In my view, that has to be underreported because  there is a stigma, there is a legal issue connected, but about half of  them say they are taking pain medication on a daily basis. Two-thirds  acknowledge it is prescription pain medication in one study.   So this is a huge issue in the business community. It should be. If  you want to have more workers out there who are ready to go to work,  able to go to work, help on this addiction issue.   Yes, provide funding for some of these programs that work but also  dig into it in your community. Find out what is working, what is not  working. If you have this gap--which I guarantee you do--between those  who are overdosing, getting the Narcan, and those getting into  treatment, address that. Find innovative ways to do it. If you are  finding there is another gap between shorter term treatment, say, 6, 7,  8, 10 weeks and the longer term recovery, help address that. Encourage  longer term recovery programs. It can be outpatient programs. It might  be residential programs, but we know that works to really get people  back on track.   Find out what is going on in your local community in terms of  prevention. Is anybody going to the middle schools and talking about  what a ruinous mistake this can be for your life to go down this path  and to be careful about prescription drugs?   If we don't all get involved--and we all have a reason to get  involved, every single one of us--to ensure that people can live out  their God-given potential in life, then we will not have done  everything we can to try to reverse this trend.   Again, what I am seeing back home is that what we have done here so  far is starting to work. I have to tell you, I believe we would already  be seeing a reversal and seeing fewer overdoses across the board if not  for one thing; that is, the influx, in the last few years particularly,  of this new drug. It is a synthetic form of opioids. It is not heroin.  It is not prescription drugs. It is usually called fentanyl, sometimes  carfentanil, but what it is, is something a person made.   Here is the shocking news. Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful than  heroin--sometimes worse. It is very inexpensive. It is readily  accessible. It is coming not across the Mexican border, and not, as far  as we know, being made in this country. It is coming from overseas,  mostly from China, and it is coming through our U.S. mail system.   Now, let's be clear. This is the new crisis. Probably two-thirds of  the deaths in my home State of Ohio from overdoses are now linked to  fentanyl.   We had a tele-townhall meeting earlier this month. The questions came  in. People were making statements and so on. One guy called, and he  wanted to talk about the drug issue. He was very professional and very  specific about what he wanted to talk about. Then, toward the end of  his comments and questions, I could hear his voice crack, and I just  knew something was up.   Sure enough, he said: By the way, my son died of a fentanyl overdose  just a couple of weeks ago. He talked about how his son thought he was  just taking heroin--not that heroin isn't incredibly dangerous in and  of itself--but the tragic story that Sam, from Shelby County, OH, told  me was that his son died of an overdose of fentanyl.   Now his father was on the call trying to figure out how to get at  this. He wanted to talk about the STOP Act, which is legislation we  have introduced in this Chamber to try to at least stop some of the  flow of this deadly poison into our community. Again, we know where it  is being made, we know where it is coming from. Law enforcement is  desperate for some better tools to be able to stop some of this poison  from coming in.   We spent about a year in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  studying this issue. It is a subcommittee I chair. We got some  undercover folks involved with us to help us from the Department of  Homeland Security. We were able to go online and find out how this  tragic criminal network works, and we were able to access a couple  hundred websites online that were happy to sell fentanyl freely online.   By the way, we were able to trace the payment systems for people who  had bought from these particular websites and, therefore, were able to  track who was actually receiving these shipments. We were able to find  six different instances where somebody had actually gotten fentanyl  from one of these sites, and then, by looking at the local news,  determined that person died of an overdose within a few days or a few  weeks of receiving that shipment.   We were able to do this just by going online and finding out these  people who had bought these drugs from these people, that they  themselves had died of overdoses of fentanyl.   Think of all the thousands of others who have died who have received  drugs through some of these criminal networks. Frankly, what we found  as we looked into this deeper and deeper was exactly what you would  expect, which is these traffickers are smart. There is a lot of money  in this. They know how to send these drugs into our neighborhoods, and  they want to do it through the U.S. Postal Service. Why? Because the  other carriers--think FedEx or DHL or UPS and private carriers--are  required by law, passed in the U.S. Congress, to tell law enforcement  what packages are coming in, from where they are coming, what is in it,  where it is going through advanced electronic data before the package  comes to this country. We required that after 9/11--frankly, not  because of fentanyl but because of the concern about people having  other contraband, including explosives in packages--all the private  carriers say to law enforcement: Here is  [[Page S5606]]  what is coming in. Here is where it is from. Here is what is in it.  Here is where it is going.    With that information, law enforcement can then find suspicious  packages, and I have seen them do it. I have gone to distribution  centers in my State and have been able to see some of these brave  personnel from Customs and Border Protection. They are brave because  some of this stuff is really dangerous.   By the way, when they take a package in to inspect it, they have to  put on a protective suit. They have to be in a room that is well  ventilated so they don't overdose and die from some of this fentanyl  that is coming in.   By knowing where it is from, where it is going, what is in it, and by  having access to Big Data all around the world--not just the country  but the world--to know where the hot spots are, where maybe some  Chinese company that has some evil chemists who are engaged in this,  maybe they are shipping it through another country, they find that out,  if they see it coming from another country, they can find those  packages as well. They are remarkably successful at finding some of  this stuff and getting it offline rather than having it go into our  community, but the Postal Service was not required to do this after 9/ 11. Instead, the Postal Service was told: You ought to study the issue  because it is important and get back to us. We are still waiting for  that study. That was over 15 years ago.   So when you go online, what we found out is, these websites are happy  to send it to you through the Postal Service. In fact, they virtually  guarantee delivery if you use the Postal Service. If you use one of  these other carriers, they don't. That is sad. A U.S. Government agency  is being used as a conduit to ship poison into our communities. It is  the No. 1 killer in my home State.   So our legislation is very simple. It simply requires the Postal  Service to provide 100 percent advanced electronic data to our law  enforcement so they can do the job they want to do. Law enforcement is  desperate for these tools. You can imagine. They want to stop this  poison.   By the way, the letter carriers I know--you ask your letter carrier-- they don't want to carry this stuff, and they certainly don't want to  have this poison going into the communities they serve.   We have about one-third of the U.S. Senate now as cosponsors of this  legislation. Will it solve the entire problem? No. We talked earlier  about the need for more prevention, education, treatment, the longer  term recovery, but at least--at least--let's keep some of this poison  from coming in. At a minimum, it is going to raise the price, which is  one of our huge problems with fentanyl today. It is not only 50 times  more powerful than heroin and people chase that high, but it is very  inexpensive relative to other forms of opioids.   So my hope is, we will have this legislation on the floor in the next  few weeks; that we will, in a bipartisan way, deal with this issue and  tell someone like Sam from Shelby County, whom I talked about earlier  who called into the tele-townhall that we are doing something, so the  next dad is not going to have this kind of tragedy befall his son.   By the way, 2 weeks earlier, at another tele-townhall meeting, a  woman called in--same thing. At the end of it, she talked about her  brother who had died of an overdose of fentanyl that had been put in  another drug. So it is being spread in not just heroin, not just  cocaine, not just crystal meth but other drugs as well, and that is one  of the great challenges law enforcement has today.   I appreciate the opportunity to talk about some of the positive  things this Congress has done, the CURES Act, the CARA Act, how I have  seen it back home making a difference in the lives of the people I  represent, but also there is a need for us to do more. Certainly fund  those programs, continue to provide the funding at these historic  levels because it is necessary, because the epidemic absolutely  deserves that kind of attention, and it is necessary.   Second, let's take these other steps. Let's stop this  overprescribing. Let's pass the STOP Act to ensure that we can deal  with this fentanyl crisis. Let's ensure that we can turn the corner,  turn the tide, begin to save lives. I think we can if we continue to  make progress and continue to focus on these issues that make such a  difference to our constituents.   I yield back.
