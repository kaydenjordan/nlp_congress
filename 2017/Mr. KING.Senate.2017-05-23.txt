 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 40th  anniversary of Longfellow's Greenhouse of Manchester, ME, a family- owned small business and a leader in the greenhouse industry.   Longfellow's Greenhouse opened during the winter of 1977. That year,  with the help of their son, Scott, owners Lawrence and Mavis Longfellow  built 12 large greenhouses and a retail shop on a meadow in Manchester.  In the years that followed, the business flourished and expanded. Scott  has been integral to that success, applying the knowledge and expertise  learned through his studies at the University of Maine at Orono and  holding the positions of grower and general manager up until this year.  Today Scott's son, Will, carries on the tradition as general manager.   Over the course of four decades, the Longfellow family and their  devoted employees have built more than a business. They have created a  seasonal destination, especially in the spring and holidays, where  families can gather to create gardens, landscapes, and traditions  filled with flowers, plants, and fond memories. In addition to  providing outstanding services and a great experience, they are widely  known for giving back to the community through both their time and  proceeds. Longfellow's has helped create new ideas that enrich the  gardening experience for their customers, all the while placing a  special emphasis on presentation and education by holding special  events that offer demonstrations, lectures, and hands-on classes.   Today Longfellow's stands out with 21 greenhouses, where they produce  40,000 geraniums, 22,000 fall mums, 15,000 flowering hanging baskets,  75,000 perennials, and 25,000 poinsettias. Among the diverse flowers  and plants they house are 800 varieties of perennials, 200 varieties of  herbs and scented geraniums--over half of which are grown on site--more  than 500 varieties of trees, shrubs, and vines, and 100 varieties of  roses.   Longfellow's Greenhouse has set the standard for horticulture in  Maine, and they have done so while promoting civic engagement and  practicing honest and ethical business--all of which will continue to  make it a special part of central Maine. Not only have they fostered a  positive culture around gardening, but their efforts have also engaged  the imagination of people of all ages. I am proud and honored to join  with all those who are celebrating this achievement and recognizing  their high quality of work on behalf of all Maine people. I thank them  for their tremendous contributions to our State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the efforts of  Ruth Libby and her work with Ruth's Reusable Resources. Her  organization operates in southern Maine and is dedicated to ensuring  that students ranging from preschool to 12th grade are adequately  prepared with the basic tools of learning.   When Ruth Libby's son was in kindergarten, she received a note from  his teacher requesting household items such as egg cartons, meat trays,  and juice can lids for use in craft projects. Ruth responded to this  request in full force and went above and beyond by not only getting  supplies to her son's classroom, but also for other classrooms in the  school. As time went on, she began receiving, sorting, and stocking  products donated by corporations, businesses, and individuals for use  by local classrooms. Ruth started by delivering these items to the  school, and a few years later, she established a ``storeroom'' in her  basement where teachers could come and ``shop'' at their convenience.  With financial assistance from the Unum Group and a grant from the  State of Maine Department of Education, Ruth was able to create a  unique and effective nonprofit organization and relocate to the  organization's current 21,000-square-foot warehouse and 7,000-square- foot teacher store in Portland, ME.   Since its inception in 1994, Ruth's Reusable Resources has provided  more than $60 million worth of surplus furniture, paper, books, office  supplies, and computers to nonprofits and schools. They have also  received donated furniture, paper, books, office supplies, and  computers from corporations, businesses, and individuals across the  State of Maine. In turn, Ruth's Reusable Resources allows staff members  of participating schools to ``shop'' for supplies at no charge. Ruth,  together with a diverse group of hard-working volunteers, ranging from  retired teachers, students, current teachers, corporate groups,  retirees, court appointed volunteers, civic groups, collegiate  ministries, and many more, work to ensure that every Maine student is  provided with the necessary supplies to succeed in school.   Ruth's Reusable Resources is a shining example of what can happen  when you have determination and a passion to make a difference. Ruth is  an outstanding example of a hard-working Mainer who is making a  difference in her community and across our State. She has played an  instrumental role in providing resources for classrooms in Maine which  has furthered the education of many students. Thank you. Ruth, for all  you have already done for both the students and their teachers in  communities throughout Maine. I look forward to following your  continued success.                            ____________________
