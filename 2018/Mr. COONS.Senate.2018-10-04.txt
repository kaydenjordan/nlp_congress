 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it was a week ago today that Members of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, were riveted by the  compelling and powerful testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. It was  a week ago today that Judge Brett Kavanaugh delivered his forceful  rejoinder and rebuttal.   Today I want to take a moment and share with Members of this Chamber  and folks who may be watching something else that was happening during  this entire hearing that I did not expect. It was powerful and unique  and special in my experience as a public servant, and I have heard, as  I have listened to other Senators of both parties who were present and  with whom I talked to afterward, it was their experience as well:   This conversation is bigger. It is bigger, it is pressing, and, I  would say, it is more important than the question of one Supreme Court  seat and one current nominee. It is a question that we, as a country at  the highest levels of power, believe victims and survivors of sexual  assault and are willing to listen to them, to believe them, and to take  action.   So what was it that happened last Thursday? As I tried to pay  attention to the remarkable testimony of Dr. Ford, my phone was blowing  up. I got texts, I got instant messages, I got phone calls, I got  emails, I got Facebook posts--I got messages in more ways that you can  connect with me than I knew was possible. These were stories--powerful  stories--stories that friends of mine, people I have known for years or  decades, people I barely know or people I hope to get to meet. They  were sharing with me stories of assault. They were told by classmates,  neighbors, friends, constituents, people who had carried these burdens  alone for years.   These stories are difficult to hear, but it is important that they be  heard. It is important to understanding why survivors stay silent, and  it is important to understanding why we, as a body and a nation, must  get this moment right. They are important to understanding why the  President and others are wrong when they say that if a victim's  allegations are true, she would have filed a report or come forward  decades ago.   In response to the question, why didn't Dr. Christine Blasey Ford  come forward earlier, I have just this experience to share. The texts  and emails, the conversations in person and over the phone, with  friends I have known for so long and friends I have just met, make it  powerfully clear to me that the many ways in which assault and  violation happens in our country between people have as many different  reasons why they hide them, carry them, and keep them in darkness and  quiet and in shame, and each one of those stories reminds me even more  powerfully the reasons we must--we must--demonstrate that they are  heard.   One friend from Delaware, a cancer survivor--someone I have spoken  about on this floor before because of her survival of a nearly life- ending cancer--confided in me she was terrorized and raped as a small  child. Living with the effects of that experience, she said, has been  way harder than cancer. She said to me early childhood trauma can be  murky and difficult to describe and  [[Page S6520]]  doesn't lend itself easily to a courtroom narrative understanding. She  is right.   A male friend, someone I know from high school, shared with me an  experience he had during a spring break trip. He shared how, on a  biology field trip to Mexico, when he sought help from a trip organizer  after snorkeling fins blistered his ankles, after administering first  aid in the hotel room, he was assaulted. His comment was he was too  shocked to call for help and did not tell anyone for over three  decades.   He is right. She is right. They are not alone.   Today I want to share a few more stories shared over the last weeks  by brave men and women who are shining a light on the challenges, the  fear, the shame, and the anger surrounding sexual assault. This is  under the hashtag ``Why I Didn't Report.'' I think it helps lend some  understanding to the dynamics of surviving assault.   Under the hashtag ``Why I Didn't Report'': ``I had known him for  years,'' one victim said.   Why I didn't report:         Because he was ``sorry.'' Because I was drunk. Because I       was young and ashamed and felt like I had somehow asked for       it even though I had said NO and STOP. . . . Because even       typing this still makes me feel it all again.    Another, in response to this hashtag, said:         Because my counselor said they won't believe you because       you're not a pretty girl.    Another said:         I blamed myself. I was humiliated and hurt. I thought they       were my friends. I felt safe until I wasn't and then it was       too late. I wanted to wash it away and never think about it       again.    Another said:         Because I feel ashamed of what happened and didn't want to       publicly ruin someone's life, even though they privately       ruined mine.   Because:         He was my boyfriend and I was sleeping. He told me he had       been accused of this before and it wasn't rape because we       were dating.    Another victim posted:         My mom did report my 18 year old cousin when I was 9. I had       to testify sitting across a table from him. I froze and       cried, couldn't speak. All charges were dropped.    Earlier this week, at a townhall at the Delaware City Fire Company,  someone I have known for decades got out of her car, came up to me,  gave me a huge hug, and, weeping, said: I never told my husband, I  never told my son, and today I have. In her voice, there was both heavy  emotion and an enormous sense of relief--and, I have to say, for me, a  sense of great pain that I was wishing I could do nothing except sit  and listen, to honor her story, to provide some sense of comfort and  support and recognition. Yet I had to move on to the townhall after a  few moments.   At a dinner here in Washington just last night, someone shared with  me an amazing story of her daughter's suffering. To hear a story of  that power and pain in the midst of a social setting is both wonderful,  in that they are trusting with a story they have held on to for so  long, and terrible, in that it is a reminder of the ways in which we  speak to each other of surviving assault in hushed tones and in dark  corners and on the internet and anonymously.   Whatever comes out of this week, whatever comes out of the  proceedings of this floor today, tomorrow, and this weekend, we must  listen and recognize that hundreds of thousands of American women and  men have been victims, are victims, and will be victims, of sexual  assault--and, according to our Department of Justice, at least two- thirds have never reported it.   There is an ocean of pain in this Nation not yet fully heard, not yet  appropriately resolved, not yet fully addressed. Everyone--everyone-- everyone within earshot of my voice--the women and men in this Chamber,  staff, journalists, colleagues, friends, members of the public, those  who think Brett Kavanaugh should be a Supreme Court Justice and those  who do not, those who have either themselves been victimized by assault  or know someone, a loved one, a family member, a neighbor, a classmate,  a fellow parishioner, a colleague, or a friend--we all--all--have an  opportunity here, a moment, to make it clear that we welcome and will  respect and listen to and act on stories that have been and will be  shared with us and that we will act.   If I could make one request, it would be that we come out on the  other side of these last few weeks with an awareness of those who are  in silent, deep, and lonely pain--often right next to us, all around  us, in our families, in our churches, in our workplaces, and in our  communities--and that we give them the listening, the understanding,  and the embrace to help them heal.   You know, in today's hyperpartisan environment, where we are quick to  question motives of others and search for any excuse to discredit,  devalue, and doubt, I also wanted to add one small but I think  important point: Every victim who has spoken to me in the past week was  not looking for anything. They were not looking for a settlement. They  were not looking for some lawsuit. They were simply looking for  acknowledgement. They were looking to share something they have carried  too long alone. They just wanted to be heard.   Our country is watching. This is a moment where the Senate as an  institution and the country as a whole need to show we can and will do  better. I hope we will listen--that we will listen as we continue to  move forward important legislation: the Violence Against Women Act,  which my predecessor, then-Senator Biden, helped champion in a  bipartisan way over several Congresses; the Victims of Child Abuse Act,  which even now I am working with a bipartisan team to try to get  through this Chamber to be reauthorized. There are many more things we  can and should do to work to combat sexual abuse and sexual assault and  to help prevent and heal.   What I most want to say today, to my friends and acquaintances, to my  constituents and my community, to my Nation and the world that may well  be watching this moment in the United States, to those whose stories I  have just shared and whose stories I have just heard, I simply want to  say this: You have touched my heart deeply. I hear you, and I thank  you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Hannah Smith  be given floor privileges for the remainder of this Congress.
