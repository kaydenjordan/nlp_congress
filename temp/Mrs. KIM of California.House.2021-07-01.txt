 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken  the lives of 4 million individuals across the world, including 600,000  Americans. It took the life of my mother-in-law, as well as the loved  ones of many of my constituents in the community that I represent.   As we safely reopen our communities and evaluate lessons learned, we  know no one wants to see another pandemic. As we hear of the new delta  variant, I know I am not alone in wanting answers regarding the origins  of COVID-19.   Reports of this virus having escaped from a lab must be taken  seriously and looked into, especially as CCP refuses to cooperate with  investigations into COVID-19's origins.   As we mark the CCP centennial, and it continues its quest to be the  world's top economic, technological, and military superpower, it is  more important than ever that we get to the truth.   This is a public health issue, economic issue, and a national  security issue that, as we saw over the past year, will impact each of  us.                            ____________________
