 Madam Speaker, 35 years ago, I fulfilled my American  Dream to own a business when I opened a small deli. I was only 20 years  old.   As a former small business owner, I understand how tough things can  be, even in the good times. Running a small business taught me two  important lessons: first, you are the first to work, last to leave, and  the last to be paid; second, your margins are tight, and high taxes too  often make it impossible for Main Street to beat the odds.   These lessons, which inspired me to enter public service, come to  mind as we mark tax day. We should be on track for an incredible  comeback. From jobs to vaccines, President Biden inherited an economy  that was moving in the right direction because of Operation Warp Speed  and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which created the best economy in more  than a generation.   But the policies of the current administration have squandered all  that progress. Bidenomics has made a mess of the economy, transforming  what should have been a strong comeback into a serious crisis in less  than 6 months.   First, Democrats jammed through $1.9 trillion of the so-called rescue  plan that continued to give taxpayer-funded handouts to people to stay  home and do nothing.   When he signed this spending package into law in March, President  Biden promised America that help was on the way. But for business  owners across the country, help wasn't on the way; ``help wanted''  signs were.   Describing his struggle to hire employees, Rod Harl, the CEO of Alene  Candles, told his local paper last week: ``We have had more than 100  positions open since the start of the year, and just recently, we  increased sign-on bonuses to $1,200 for hourly positions, in part  because we were competing with an entity that can print its own money-- the Federal Government--and its $300 extra per week additional  unemployment benefit.''   Sadly, this isn't unique just to Mr. Harl. It is the same story I  hear from businesses nationwide.   In a matter of months, we went from the highest job openings on  record in March, 8.1 million--remember, that is the same month that  President Biden signed his bill, that he thought help was on the way-- to the biggest jobs report miss in more than two decades. Unemployment  actually increased, despite the record number of openings.   For a brief moment during the pandemic, it made sense to encourage  people to stay home, but now in May 2021, it defies logic. We should  not tax the people who are working to continue to pay people who choose  not to.   Another concern I hear from businesses and workers is rising  inflation. Consumer prices in April saw their largest increase in a  single month since 1981, soaring by more than 1 percent. Inflation  taxes every single American and especially affects those with the least  income.   But remember what President Biden promised, that he wouldn't raise  taxes on families making less than $400,000. By causing inflation to  rise, President Biden has broken that pledge, and we are less than 5  months into this administration.   Madam Speaker, any economics class would tell you that the worst  thing to do is exactly what Bidenomics has done to this country. He  inherited one of the strongest economies, a GDP growing, and he  actually did the opposite. He paid people to stay home. He put more  money into the economy from government, which only drives up inflation.  We have not seen something like this since Jimmy Carter took this  country into stagnation.   Now, Americans are paying more at supermarkets, hardware stores, and  gas stations, and it has only been 5 months. In fact, we have a serious  gas shortage in a nation that was recently energy independent.   Could you imagine, Madam Speaker, becoming President of the United  States and having a country that is energy independent, that is  actually sending natural gas to other nations, to waking up to no gas  in the gas lines in America--not because Congress passed a bill but  because the President signed an executive order?   Madam Speaker, I remember wanting to see my grandmother one day. It  was back during the Jimmy Carter years, and my father told me no. I  asked why we couldn't drive to see grandma, and it was because our  license plate ended in an even number, not an odd. That is the only  other time that you can compare what is happening in America today.                                time  1915    17,000 gas stations nationwide were completely emptied out. The  average price of gasoline remains above $3. This is the highest  gasoline has been since the last time Biden was in office. In  California, the average was $4.12. In Virginia, prices were as high as  nearly $7 a gallon.   It didn't have to be this way. He didn't have to attack the  hardworking Americans in the energy industry. His own Secretary of  Energy said pipelines were good, even though he ended the Keystone XL  pipeline and went after the ability for Americans to even drill on  Federal land.   So now, Russia is sending gasoline to America? Does that make any  sense, to make our enemies stronger, while Russia builds up thousands  of troops along the border of Ukraine or enters into negotiations with  Iran, who supplies missiles to shoot at our allies?   Instead of priming the pump, Bidenomics has emptied the tank. From  inflation to gas lines, the American economy today looks more like it  did in 1979 than in 2019, when wages were rising, businesses were  growing, and unemployment was at record lows.   None of this is an accident, you see, Madam Speaker. It is a direct  result of bad Federal policies that have distorted incentives and  prices.   Yet President Biden, Speaker Pelosi, and other Democrats still want  to tax and spend more. Even the most liberal economists tell you that  is wrong, which very seldom happens. They decided to propose another  $5.2 trillion in new spending, as if there is a bottomless cash pit for  politicians to draw on.   They also decided to propose the largest tax increase in American  history, including making the corporate tax rate the highest in the  world; higher than France; higher than Venezuela, a socialist country;  and higher than Communist China.   Madam Speaker, why would the Democrats and Speaker Pelosi want to  give China a benefit over America? I don't understand why we wouldn't  look after American workers first.   These proposals reflect a fundamental difference between Republicans  and these new socialist Democrats. Republicans believe that there is  dignity and value in hard work and risk-taking. Democrats believe that  progress comes by forcing people to be dependent on their government.  That is not  [[Page H2406]]  progress, to force somebody to be dependent on government.   They want to control the decisions you make: when you can work, when  you can drive, whether you should wear a mask. It doesn't matter what  the science or the CDC says. If Speaker Pelosi has the power, she will  enforce it on you.   They want to control what you can read on the internet and what you  can teach your children. But look at history. I don't see a single  country where Democrat socialist ideas worked before. They have all  been failures.   My greatest fear is the direction you are sending America. In 5  months, America goes from energy independence to having gasoline  stations without gas; from an economy where you have done nothing but  grow back, to creating inflation we haven't seen in decades; to  empowering our enemies, who only harm our allies. You have more help  wanted signs in America--8 million--and you missed the jobs report, the  worst we have seen in decades, by the action taken on this floor.   The hard part about it, Madam Speaker, is we warned you. We told you  what would happen. We told you you were going to create inflation. We  told you you were going to kill American jobs. You are going to reward  people not to work. I have never been a believer in participation  trophies. They don't work. They don't help. Certainly, those small  businesses that have struggled to survive, you are crushing them.   Every indication, every number shows it. To sit here on the floor and  say you will not raise their taxes, you are doing it right now. You are  hurting the most vulnerable. Gas prices are higher. The bread, the  lumber to even build the house, you are pricing them out.   The recent surge of bad economic news, in what should be a robust  recovery, is a warning sign that your ideas are not working now. The  last time inflation was this high, Joe Biden was Vice President. The  last time gas prices were this high, Joe Biden was Vice President. We  found the common denominator: President Biden's bad policies.  Unfortunately, instead of learning from history, President Biden and  Democrats are choosing to repeat it.   That was one of the low points in America, when inflation was high,  interest rates were there, and the rest of the world questioned whether  America was what they used to be. We proved what policies could matter:  incentive to work, letting people keep more of what they earned; making  America energy independent.   What is so amazing to me, when President Biden was elected, he had  Operation Warp Speed, he got a vaccine, and he was vaccinated before he  was even sworn in. He had millions of doses of the vaccine being  produced. He had an economy rising, coming out of the COVID pandemic.  He had more help wanted signs. If he literally did nothing, America  would be stronger. But he took the wrong actions, led by the socialist  Democrats of this floor, Madam Speaker. Now America is hurting.   The only thing I ask: study history, listen to those who are creating  jobs, take the incentive away where government is everything, and  unshackle what holds us back. Let Americans have the freedom they  deserve and desire. Prove that the next century will be ours once  again.
