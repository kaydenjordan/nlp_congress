 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about the Black  Maternal Health Momnibus, an historic and comprehensive package that  tackles one of the greatest public health crises of our time.   My work on Black Maternal Health began when my daughter, a Black mom  herself, survived a complicated pregnancy that almost claimed her life.  How many people my age aren't as lucky, and now have grandkids who grew  up without a mommy?   I knew when I got to Congress, I had to make this a priority.   In 2018, Senator Kamala Harris and I worked with the Black Mamas  Matter Alliance to introduce resolutions honoring the first Black  Maternal Health Week, as well as the Maternal CARE Act. That effort led  to last April, when Congresswoman Lauren Underwood and I launched the  Black Maternal Health Caucus.   This issue was deeply personal for both of us. We wanted to raise  awareness, educate our colleagues, and shine a bright spotlight on the  maternal health crisis--of mothers needlessly dying during what should  be one of the most joyous times of their lives.    Our caucus has grown to more than 100 members in less than a year,  which I imagine might be a record feat, but it speaks to the importance  of this issue and how it resonates so deeply within Congress and across  party lines.   Black maternal health is not a partisan issue. It is a life-and-death  issue. The main goal of the caucus is to develop and advance evidence- based policy solutions.   The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2020 builds upon existing  maternal health legislation by filling gaps through nine new bills to  comprehensively address every aspect of the Black maternal health  crisis. Throughout the process, we were very intentional about  centering the voices of Black women and ensuring that Black women-led  organizations were consulted early and often.   The Momnibus makes investments in social determinants of health,  community-based organizations, the growth and diversification of the  perinatal workforce, improvements in data collection and quality  measures, digital tools like telehealth and innovative payment models.   In addition to direct efforts to improve Black maternal health  outcomes, the Momnibus focuses on high-risk populations, including  women veterans, incarcerated women, and Native Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a moment to speak about the bill  that I am leading within the package: The Kira Johnson Act.   Kira was an entrepreneur, she traveled the world, and she was a  mother to a healthy, little boy.   On April 12, 2016, she checked into a hospital with her husband,  Charles, to give birth to their second child, Langston.   Despite being in excellent health, despite being a successful  businesswoman, despite having health insurance, and doing everything  right, Kira did not make it out alive. She died from hours of neglect  and severe hemorrhaging, nearly 12 hours after safely delivering her  second son.   Kira Johnson mattered.   Kira deserved better.   And this legislation says, unequivocally, that Black Mamas matter. It  makes investments in community-based organizations that are leading the  charge to protect moms: By supporting maternal mental health conditions  and substance use disorders; by supporting doulas and perinatal health  workers; and addressing social determinants of health, like housing,  transportation, and nutrition.   It also supports research, bias and racism training programs, and the  establishment of Respectful Maternity Care Compliance offices to  address bias and racism.   At its core, this bill is about accountability and empowering our  community health partners who have been providing safe and culturally- sensitive care to Black moms for years.   Again, I am thrilled for the accumulation of nearly a year of  research, information-gathering, and collaboration with key  stakeholders.   For decades, the U.S. maternal mortality and morbidity rates have  gotten worse for all mothers, but especially for Black women whose  health outcomes are further compounded by systemic and structural  racism.   The Black Maternal Health Momnibus is an historic piece of  legislation that not only targets failures in maternal healthcare, but  also addresses pervasive maternal health disparities through solutions  that are culturally competent and proven effective.   It provides a roadmap so that our healthcare systems, our providers,  and society will finally make Black maternal and infant health a  priority. No one should have to lose another friend, auntie, sister,  daughter, or mommy to this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, let's get it done for all of the moms out there.                            ____________________
