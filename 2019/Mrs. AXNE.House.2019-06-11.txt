 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on June 11, 2019 because  I was returning to Washington, D.C. Had I been present to vote, I would  have voted YEA on H. Res. 430--Authorizing the Committee on the  Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings to enforce  certain subpoenas, and YEA on H.R. 2609--DHS Acquisition Review Board  Act of 2019.                            ____________________
