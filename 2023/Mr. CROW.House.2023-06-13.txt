 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of all in this  country who have been impacted by gun violence.   My constituents in Colorado's Sixth District know too well the deep- rooted pain caused by gun violence. It is a fracture in a community  that never fully heals. From Columbine to Aurora, STEM School, and  Arapahoe High School, ours is a community that has faced immense  tragedy.   Our children are afraid to go to school every day. Students in my  district ask me: What are you doing to protect us?   I want to tell them that Congress is doing everything we can to  protect them, but I can't. Unfortunately, many Republicans are failing  them and us by refusing to pass basic, commonsense, lifesaving gun  violence prevention legislation.   June is Gun Violence Awareness Month, encompassing six anniversaries  of tragic mass shootings in our Nation, including the horrific, hate- filled shooting at Pulse nightclub that took 49 lives 7 years ago this  week.   Mr. Speaker, I honor the lives of those that we have failed to  protect, and I ask for action.                            ____________________
