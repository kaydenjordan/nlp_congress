 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Swalwell of California moves to recommit the bill H.R.       4324 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions       to report the same back to the House forthwith with the       following amendment:        Page 6, line 23, strike ``and''.        Page 7, line 7, add ``and'' at the end        Page 7, after line 7, insert the following:        (iv) no financial institution participating in such       transaction is engaged in business with a foreign entity that       has been found by the Secretary, in consultation with the       Director of National Intelligence, to have engaged in or       authorized cyber-attacks targeting any election held in the       United States;                                time  1845    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment  to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to a final passage vote, as  amended.   My amendment would add an additional certification requirement from  the Treasury Secretary for financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleagues across the aisle. Iran is a  threat to our national security, and we should seek to hold them  accountable, protect Americans, and defend our allies. The first major  step in the last decade to do so was with the Iran nuclear agreement  taking a nuclear power off the table. But we should also seek to hold  accountable Iran's chief enabler and best friend in the world, Russia,  which my amendment will seek to do.   My amendment would add a requirement that the Treasury Secretary  certify that an institution financing the export of commercial aircraft  to Iran did not engage in business with any foreign entity which  engaged in or authorized cyber attacks targeting American elections.  This is a commonsense provision to ensure that companies are aware of  the effects their financial dealings have on supporting those who  engage in election interference.   We should think carefully about letting financial institutions do  business with countries that choose to conduct this new cyber warfare.  While it may have been unthinkable before 2016 that a foreign adversary  would interfere in one of our elections, we know now that the threat is  all too real.   Our intelligence community concluded that Russia interfered in our  2016 elections; and it also concluded that this was ordered by  President Vladimir Putin, with the goal of helping its preferred  candidate, Donald Trump. Why this is something that the President and  some of my colleagues across the aisle still question is beyond  shocking. It is also a slap in the face of the dedicated men and women  who serve and toil for our intelligence communities.   The 2016 election, Mr. Speaker, is behind us. We shouldn't relitigate  it. We should learn, though, from how a foreign adversary, a friend of  Iran, sought to influence the American voter. This is not a Democratic  Party or Republican Party issue. It is about our freedom of choice: who  gets to choose when we go to the ballot box.   Iran is not our friend. Guess who else is not our friend? Iran's  friend Russia. But if you don't believe me, if you are cynical enough,  as the President is, to dismiss the findings of our intelligence  community, then believe the Russians. Believe their own declarations.   In September, a Duma parliament member, Nikonov Vyacheslav, stated  that the United States intelligence community slept while Russia  elected a new United States President of the United States.   Does anyone in this House want to do something about that?   In this attack, did Russia work with the Trump campaign?   That is a serious question that remains outstanding. Every day seems  to bring new revelations about the connections between the Trump  campaign and Russia. We must do all we can to allow Bob Mueller and his  team to pursue that evidence unimpeded by Presidential obstruction.   We also must be able to conduct our investigations on the House  Intelligence Committee to do all we can to get to the bottom, to tell  the American people how we were so vulnerable, who in the United States  was responsible, whether the U.S. Government response was adequate, and  what we can do to make sure it never happens again.   I fear, Mr. Speaker, that the President and many of his own enablers  in Congress are seeking to fire Bob Mueller, which would set us back  and greatly affect our ability to prevent another attack by Russia. But  what we can do with this amendment today is not only stand up to Iran,  but also stand up to their chief enabler, someone who finances them and  assists the terror that they enact across the globe.   Vote for this motion to recommit, and, by doing so, Members will show  their concern not only about Iran, but also about their chief enabler.  Members will show their concern for our democracy and the interference  that Iran's best friend, Russia, carried out in our last election.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
