 Madam Speaker, this first speech that I am going to  give today is, as we used to say in church, something that the Lord  spoke on my heart. He speaks to me, just not in an audible voice. This  is something that has kind of been a burden with me for quite some  time.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise to express my great concern for the  disproportionate number of missing Black children in our country and  the way they are treated by our national media.   Every child is precious, Madam Speaker, and it is a tragedy whenever  a  [[Page H3678]]  child goes missing. The sad truth is that it happens to Black kids far  more often. Missing Black children made up over one-third of the  missing child cases in 2019--over one-third. Yet, it has also been  shown these children receive much less media coverage than their  counterparts from other demographics.   The media dedicates an enormous amount of time to discuss racism in  Congress, schools, police departments, and various other American  institutions, so why is it acceptable for the media to dedicate less  attention to missing Black kids?   We all know this is not okay, Madam Speaker, but the American public  doesn't know this is happening because our media is failing to cover  this story.   Every child is made in the image of God and legally equal under the  U.S. Constitution. We need to dedicate all the time and resources we  can to recover missing kids, regardless of the color of their skin.                Honoring Technical Sergeant Durward B. Swanson     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Technical Sergeant  Durward B. Swanson, a World War II veteran and survivor of the Pearl  Harbor attacks, as the Tennessee Second District's Veteran of the  Month.   Swanson joined the Army Air Corps in 1939 and was sent to Hickam  Field, adjacent to the Pearl Harbor Naval Base. He originally signed up  to do bomber maintenance, but a sergeant noticed he had skills on a  Harley-Davidson and asked if he would head the air police motorcycle  unit instead. He accepted that position, Madam Speaker.   On December 7, 1941, when Japanese bombers attacked the airbase,  Swanson jumped onto his motorcycle to search for his best friend,  Albert Jackson ``Stud'' Lloyd, who was standing in the middle of a  ballfield shooting at the planes and cussing up a storm. Swanson drove  onto the field and brought his friend back to safety.   After the attack, Swanson and Lloyd removed the damaged flag from the  Hickam Field flagpole and folded it to prevent it from being flown  overnight.   Following his service, Swanson played guitar for country music legend  Hank Williams before deciding the music business wasn't for him. That  would be Hank Williams, Sr., if anyone is wondering.   He went on to speak to schools across the United States and travel  with groups to Pearl Harbor and the World War II Memorial in  Washington.   In June, he celebrated his 100th birthday at the Ben Atchley  veterans' home.   There are true heroes in our country, and they aren't famous athletes  or movie stars. They are the brave men and women of our Armed Forces,  like Durward Swanson.   Madam Speaker, I thank Durward for his service.                            ____________________
