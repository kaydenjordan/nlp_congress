 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we stand on a  precipice in which shortly we are about to deliver truly a once-in-a- generation piece of legislation; action that will lower the everyday  costs that burden working families in my district in Pennsylvania and  throughout the Nation--from healthcare to childcare and more--and fully  paid for by making corporations and the richest 1/10 of 1 percent pay  their fair share.   Here is what it does: First, lower healthcare costs: negotiating  lower drug costs for seniors; halting Big Pharma's outrageous price  hikes well above inflation; and expanding the Affordable Care Act to  make coverage more affordable for those who buy their own insurance.   Second, lower childcare and family care costs: expanding the basic  promise of free schooling in America for the first time in a century  with universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. This is so  critical. In my State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, only 16  percent of 3- and 4-year-olds have access to universal pre-K. It also  will slash families' childcare costs; extend the landmark Biden Child  Tax Credit, which has helped reduce child poverty in this country this  year by 50 percent; and will expand access to affordable home care for  older adults and those with disabilities.    Third, we are talking about the largest investment to combat the  climate crisis in our Nation's history: cutting pollution; reducing  energy costs; creating good-paying jobs with a transformational  investment to ensure America leads the worldwide clean energy economy.   Why would we want China to take the lead on that? They are already  investing a ton of money in clean energy. It is time for the United  States to catch up and take the lead. We are the number one country,  but in order to remain the number one country, we have to get with it  when it comes to where the jobs will be in this century.   The Build Back Better Act lowers costs and fights inflation because-- and I hope everyone hears this--it is fully 100 percent paid for. Not  one person who makes under $400,000 a year will pay one extra dime in  taxes, not one. In fact, many, especially those families with children,  will see their taxes go down.   Mr. Speaker, I want to paraphrase--and I hope I have the quote  exactly right; I am going on memory. I remember when I was growing up  in Pennsylvania some decades ago in the 1980s, our Governor was Bob  Casey, Sr., a legendary figure in Pennsylvania politics.   He once said: What did you do when you had the power? That is a  question that will be asked of all public servants. What did you do to  help people when you had the power? That is what the Build Back Better  Act is about, answering that question; delivering in all of these  measures that I just cited.   Once this passes the House, passes the Senate, and is signed into  law, it will truly be the most important domestic bill in my lifetime.  It will help ordinary people, from the Second Congressional District of  Pennsylvania, to all 435 congressional districts in this Nation.  Working families deserve it.   Look at how hard it is today to achieve the American Dream. We know,  based on statistics, that working families and middle class families  are struggling out there. Yes, the unemployment rate is coming down. We  are in such a better position right now than where we were a year ago.  Every single statistic supports that. It is not enough. We need to  build back and we need to build back better.                            ____________________
