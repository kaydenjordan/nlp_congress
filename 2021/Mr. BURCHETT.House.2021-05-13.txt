 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear  friend, Steve Rose, who passed away on December 14, 2020.   He lived his whole life in Knoxville, served our country in the U.S.  Marine Corps, and went on to graduate from Fulton High School after he  left the Corps and attend the University of Tennessee.   Steve was known around town as a hell-raiser who never did anything  halfway. He was an adrenaline junkie who enjoyed things like boxing and  motocross racing, and he lit up Knoxville's music scene playing the  drums with local bands around town.   Above all else, Steve had a ferocious love for his friends and  family. He showed an unconditional love to Janice, his devoted of wife  of 52 years, until the moment he passed away with her by his side. He  was an amazing father to his children, Amy, Michael, and Tracy; and he  spent many years working hard to get Amy the best possible care for her  cerebral palsy.   Five years ago, a stroke left his body broken, but his strong-willed  spirit stayed intact. He never let his condition dampen his attitude,  and he kept on loving friends and family with the same vigor he always  had.   Mr. Speaker, he will be truly missed by those who knew him.                            ____________________
