 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the bravery  and initiative of the Congressional Workers Union.   On Monday, my staff became the first in the 233-year history of this  Congress to form a union, with a unanimous vote. I look forward to  bargaining a just contract to set strong standards for the years ahead.   The CWU has also announced that staff in the offices of Congresswoman  Omar and Congressman Khanna are voting to form unions, as well.   As it happens, the Jewish New Year began on Monday. It is a fitting  time to mark a powerful new beginning for workers here on Capitol Hill.   If we want Congress to have a workforce that reflects America's  diversity; if we want poor and working-class people to work here, not  just the children of the wealthy; if we want to reduce turnover and  increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our work, then it is high  time we afford our staff a say in their working conditions.   That is the journey we are embarking on, and I am delighted to be a  part of it. Friends, there is power in a union.                            ____________________
