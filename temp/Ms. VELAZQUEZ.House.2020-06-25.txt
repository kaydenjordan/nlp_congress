 Mr. Speaker, in nearly every city and town across this  country, the American people are raising their collective voice for  change. Our Nation is having a long overdue conversation about race and  policing, and we are finally acknowledging Black lives matter.   But it takes more than words and hashtags. The American people want  true reform. This bill takes tangible steps in that direction. It ends  qualified immunity. The bill bans chokeholds. No-knock warrants will  become a thing of the past.   We are all outraged by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,  Rayshard Brooks, Eric Garner, and so many others. However, anger is not  enough. The American people are demanding action.   This bill offers meaningful, transformative change, not lip service  or half measures being floated by the President and Senate Republicans.   The time is now. History will judge us on how we respond to this  moment. Vote ``yes.''  [[Page H2480]]
