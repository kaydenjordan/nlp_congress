 Madam President, it is so interesting being home for  July 4 and talking with Tennesseans, and it sounds like Senator Ernst  heard some of the same things from her constituents there in Iowa.   But what came up a lot in our conversations was the feeling and the  awareness that the Democrats and the media have spent the last few  months trying to convince the American people that oil companies are to  blame for Biden's energy crisis.   At one point, they even tried to blame the people running the local  gas stations, all the moms and pops, but Tennesseans know whose fault  it is. Tennesseans are smart. They are watching very closely. And they  know that President Biden became responsible for their pain the moment  he chose a radical, environmental agenda over the fully realized vision  of American energy independence.   That is right, we were energy independent the day he took office.   So President Biden canceled the Keystone Pipeline. He canceled leases  and energy infrastructure, and he got behind dozens of regulations that  have made it almost impossible for American energy producers to do  their job.   At the time, Democrats claimed this was all for the greater good. It  is temporary. It is transitioning to the liberal world order. But I  think any reasonable person would agree that what has happened is  things have gotten worse--terribly worse.   If you don't want to take my word for it, talk to the local leaders  who are responsible for keeping the lights on in their communities.  City budgets are stretched thin. School budgets aren't doing any  better. Parents want to know if the buses will keep running and what  will happen in August if the schools can't afford to turn the air- conditioning on. Everyone wants to know what will happen to public  transportation, to emergency services, and to law enforcement if the  price of a gallon of gas gets too expensive. They have no idea how far  the Biden administration will allow this to go, and that is what  concerns them the most.   Joe Biden hasn't just failed ``we the people,'' he has sabotaged the  pocketbooks of millions of Americans and given our adversaries a huge  advantage.   The Democrats gambled on the Green New Deal. It is evident they lost.  Their gas holiday was a gimmick, and that failed. Energy prices are  through the roof, but they still pulled a million barrels of oil out of  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and they sent it to communist China.   Now the President of the United States has gone hat in hand to Saudi  Arabia so that he can beg for oil. He is even trying to cozy up to the  Iranians with a new Iran nuclear deal, begging for oil. Our hard-fought  energy independence is gone, along with our Nation's credibility on  this issue.   The world is watching Joe Biden. They are watching the Biden  blackouts that are really taking a toll on American energy and American  consumers, and you and I both know that all the wrong people are seeing  this as an opportunity to profit.   If the Biden administration continues to squander our country's  resources, we will lose even more ground to the axis of evil. Russia  still has a stranglehold on European energy. American supply chains are  still hopelessly entangled with China. Iran is ready to steamroll Biden  for that new nuclear deal. North Korea is deploying hackers to the West  at an alarming rate. I don't think a Civilian Climate Corps has a  chance in this match-up.   I would admonish the President to remember that the new axis of evil  is playing by a different set of rules. Their only goal is to find our  vulnerabilities and exploit them to try to take us down.   I would remind my Democratic colleagues that Biden's energy crisis is  a vulnerability, and it is your duty to help lead the country out of  it. Don't be complicit. Restart the Keystone Pipeline, open up those  leases on Federal lands, get the regulators out of the way, and unleash  American energy before it is too late.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, each year, the Ellis Island  Honors Society recognizes individuals who have proved their commitment  to our Nation through outstanding achievement in industry, education,  entertainment, and the arts.   Today, I have the honor of congratulating my friend and fellow  Tennessean Igor Babailov, one of this year's recipients of the Ellis  Island Medal of Honor. Igor has earned a very special place in American  culture through his work in philanthropy and the arts. A celebrated  portraitist, he has immortalized on canvas Presidents, dignitaries,  royalty, and even three Popes, and earned the trust of the world's most  important curators. His philanthropic endeavors have changed the lives  of veterans and helped children realize their full potential.   On behalf of the State of Tennessee, I offer my heartfelt  congratulations to Igor and thank him for using his talents to make  America a more diverse, innovative, and beautiful place to call  home.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is my honor to  congratulate Coach Lamar Rogers of Clarkrange, TN, on winning the Fred  Russell Lifetime Achievement Award and joining the distinguished ranks  of the National Federation of State High School Associations Hall of  Fame.   Over the course of his long career, he has enriched the lives of  young female athletes by helping them reach their highest potential.  For 46 years, Coach Rogers has served as the architect of one of the  most impressive and well-respected girls basketball programs in the  Volunteer State, boasting a 1,289-290 record and eight Tennessee  Secondary School Athletic Association State championships. He is also  revered--and feared--as the winningest high school girls basketball  coach in Tennessee.   But more importantly, he is a mentor, a friend, and an inspiration to  the next generation of athletes and educators, and I consider it my  privilege to recognize him for his leadership. Congratulations,  Coach.                            ____________________
