 Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scout motto is ``Be Prepared.'' All  Scouts say it, but very few live it. A young Scout from Sugar Land,  Texas, lived it. His name is Ben Davis.   On July 2, 2018, Ben hears faint cries. He is horrified when he finds  the source: an 87-year-old neighbor lying in her yard. She had fallen  doing yard work. She had been lying in the hot Texas July sun for  hours. She was dying.   Being a prepared Boy Scout, Ben knew exactly what to do: go into the  woman's house, call 911. And that is exactly what Ben did. Ben stayed  with his neighbor until help arrived.   Ben Davis is the best in Sugar Land, in Fort Bend County, in Texas,  and in America. He is a prepared Boy Scout hero.                            ____________________
