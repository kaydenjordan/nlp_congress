 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dordt  University men's basketball Coach Brian Van Haaften on his 500th career  win.   Dordt, my alma mater, bested Governors State 113-82, clinching their  eighth win of the season and Brian's 500th all-time win.   In just four seasons, Brian has led Dordt to 79 victories, elevating  the Defenders to new heights.   Since 1988, he has dedicated his time and talents to developing young  men not only as basketball players but also as upstanding citizens and  men of faith.   A man of deep faith, he teaches his players the Christian values that  connect our families in Sioux County: teamwork, hard work,  sportsmanship, and humility.   Brian is a phenomenal asset to Dordt University and an integral part  of the community.   Congratulations again, Brian, on the incredible achievement. Here's  to 500 more.                            ____________________
