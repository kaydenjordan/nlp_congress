 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the en bloc  amendment, and to thank the Defense Subcommittee Chairman, Mr.  Visclosky, for including the Sherrill Amendment 58 in the en bloc  package.   My amendment reduces the Surface and Shallow Water Mine  Countermeasures program by $5 million in order to add $5 million for  the Navy to advance the qualification and certification of Advanced  Manufacturing processes for the integration of 3-D printed components  into undersea warfare platforms. This amendment furthers the Navy's  goal of embracing cutting-edge technologies.   3-D printing reduces the cost of manufacturing parts for which there  is limited supply. It also creates unique parts that would otherwise be  prohibitively expensive to make with traditional manufacturing.   I am very proud of the work Marotta Controls in Montville, New  Jersey, is doing to support this very effort. Marotta is a family-owned  business, now in its third generation of ownership. President and CEO  Patrick Marotta is proudly carrying on the work his grandfather began  when he founded the company during WWII. I thank Marotta Controls for  their work to ensure efficiency and quality control to enable our  Navy's submariners to continue to play their critical role in defense  of our nation.   I thank Defense Subcommittee Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member  Calvert for their leadership in adopting this important provision.
