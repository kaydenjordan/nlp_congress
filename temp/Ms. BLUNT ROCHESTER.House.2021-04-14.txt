 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his  tireless work to advance this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1215, the Fraud  and Scam Reduction Act. Bad actors preying on older Americans is  unfortunately nothing new, but in the midst of a global pandemic,  cracking down on those scams must be a priority of the Federal  Government.   That is why I proudly introduced the bipartisan Fraud and Scam  Reduction Act with my colleagues Mr. Walberg, Deutch, Buchanan, and  Welch.   The bill, as its name suggests, was aimed at cracking down on these  scams by doing two main things. It would create an advisory group under  the Federal Trade Commission made up of government agencies, consumer  advocates, and industry representatives, such as financial services and  retail, to help identify potential sources of fraud and create  educational materials for our Nation's seniors to protect them from  these dangerous schemes. It would also establish the senior fraud  advisory office, which would give seniors hope in recovering their  assets stolen by fraudsters and improve our understanding of senior  fraud by encouraging seniors to report this activity.   We are proud to say that the bill has broad support, including AARP,  the Retail Industry Leaders Association, Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and  Western Union, as well as many more.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most fundamental obligations of government is  to protect our citizens. The least we can do is protect already  vulnerable seniors from being taken advantage of by bad actors.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, for  their work in strengthening the bill, and I urge all of my colleagues  to vote in favor of the measure.                                time  1330
