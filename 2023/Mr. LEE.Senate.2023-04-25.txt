 Mr. President, I stand here before my friend and colleague,  the senior Senator from Alabama. He stands in opposition, as do I, to  the plan of the Department of Defense to use Federal funds to  facilitate the performance of abortions.   Now, let's remember what we are looking at here. This has been in  place for a long time. Congress enacted a law. Codified 10 USC section  1093. Let's just brief that here.   1093 part (a) says:         Restriction on use of funds. Funds available to the       Department of Defense may not be used to perform abortions       except where the life of the mother would be endangered if       the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the       pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.    Part (b) reads as follows:         No medical treatment facility or other facility of the       Department of Defense may be used to perform an abortion       except where the life of the mother would be endangered if       the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the       pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.    Look, this policy has been in place for a long time--for decades, in  fact. It is accompanied by other policies restricting the use of  Federal funds on issues related to abortion.   You know, the American people, yes, are divided on questions, many  questions, regarding abortion. There are a lot of gradations of that.  Some would put restrictions here; others restrictions there; others  would insist on no restrictions whatsoever.   But one thing that does tend to unite Americans, more than any other  topic within the area of abortion, is that we don't want the use of  Federal taxpayer dollars going to facilitate or fund abortions. We  don't want that.   Overwhelmingly, that holds really, really well. Democrats and  Republicans  [[Page S1327]]  alike believe that it is unfair, understand that it is unjust,  especially on an issue that is as divisive as abortion is.   To take money at the point of a gun, which is what we do when we  collect tax revenue, essentially. You know, that if you don't pay your  taxes, at some point people with guns will show up, and you have got to  do what they say.   So when you are taking money at the point of a gun--as you do when  you are collecting tax revenue--you have a sacred responsibility to  handle that well. And if the American people don't want it, that is why  they enacted a Congress that has put this in law, that we don't use  Federal funds to fund abortion.   So along comes Secretary Austin and the current Department of  Defense, and they decide, well, we really want to do this. And so I can  only imagine how this conversation must have gone internally.  Obviously, I wasn't part of those conversations. I was not made privy  to them. They didn't invite me to them, we will just say.   But I would imagine they more or less went something like this, hey,  what can we do to, you know, help people get abortions using Federal  funds. And I am sure someone brought up, well, 10 USC section 1093  prohibits that. So they said, what could we do that arguably could  circumvent that, something that Congress may not have specifically  identified.   And at some point, someone said, well, there is nothing in here that  directly categorically prohibits the use of travel funds or the  availability of leave time for people seeking abortions.   So, bingo, they came up with this idea. Let's just give people who  want abortions, women who want abortions in the military 3 weeks of  paid leave and an expense account to handle out-of-state travel during  that 3-week period, and that circumvents, technically speaking, the  restriction. This is, of course, a major policy change, and it is a  policy change on a topic that many Americans feel passionately about-- and, by many Americans, I mean not just Republicans. Republicans and  Democrats don't like the idea that U.S. taxpayer dollars should be used  for abortions, and they have put this in place--this being a major  policy change, a major policy change affirmatively at odds with the  spirit, if not also the letter, of various provisions of Federal law.  Respect for the Constitution itself, for the separation of powers, and  for the sacred role of the legislative branch to make laws should have  commanded that the burden of making this policy change should be on  those who would want Congress to act, and that we not give special  privilege to an executive branch Department--here, the U.S. Department  of Defense--to undertake such a major policy change that they knew they  could never get past the Congress. They couldn't. It wouldn't pass.  There is not a chance it would get past the House. It wouldn't get past  the Senate either. They knew this, and that is why they did it by  executive action--just executive fiat.    If Secretary Austin, the Secretary of Defense--if he wants to make  law, he should run for Congress. He should run for the House. He should  run for the Senate. I would welcome him here as a colleague or as a  counterpart, down the hall in the House. I genuinely would. Then he  would be in a position to do this. But he may not and must not be  allowed to legislate from the E-Ring of the Pentagon. That is not how  we do things in this country.   Now, as you look at the arguments that have been exchanged today, we  have talked about military readiness. I agree with my colleague from  Alabama. I haven't seen anything indicating that military readiness  commands this, much less commands it in a way that justifies departing  from the spirit, if not the letter, of Federal law.   I have also heard the argument made, quite counterintuitively, that  if the Senator from Alabama, Senator Tuberville, wants to change the  law, he should run legislation to that effect. He should be required to  pass a statute.   That is not how our system works. We have got laws. This is a major  departure from established policy set in existing law. The burden is  not on Senator Tuberville.   You see, it is this body that gets to change laws, to change policy.  We are the policymaking organ of the Federal Government, and to pass a  law--any law--article I, section 1, and clause 1, the very first  operative provision of the U.S. Constitution, right after the preamble  and all the initial language, it says that ``all legislative Powers  herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,  which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''   Article I, section 7, makes it clear how you make a Federal law, and  it is not made by the Secretary of Defense or any other executive  branch official. It is made, under article I, section 7--the only way  you can make a Federal law--when the House of Representatives and the  Senate both agree on the same legislative text, then presents that  legislation to the President of the United States, who may sign it or  acquiesce to it--after 10 days, if he acquiesces, it becomes law--or he  can veto it. If he vetoes, it can become law only after two-thirds of  both Houses have overridden that veto. Those are the only ways you can  change Federal law.   The onus is not on those of us opposing this policy. Nor should the  onus be on Senator Tuberville to establish that he is not the one  impacting military readiness. This is untrue. It is unproven. It is  contrary to fact. But even if it were not so, this is not on him. You  see, because to whatever degree this is impacting military readiness,  that argument goes right back on Secretary Austin in a heartbeat. It  goes right back on him because he doesn't have to impose this policy.  He doesn't have to force this change in policy amounting to a hostile  act against the spirit, if not the letter, of this law. He doesn't have  to do that. He could and should allow Congress to make this  determination in due course, as Congress does. And it just so happens  that we are coming up, in the coming weeks and months, on an  opportunity to do precisely that, through a committee--through  legislation that comes through a committee--on which both the Senator  from Massachusetts and the Senator from Alabama serve, the Senate Armed  Services Committee.   This legislative vehicle of which I am speaking, of course, is the  National Defense Authorization Act. It is an opportunity that we use  every year, for many, many decades, to make policy decisions involving  the Pentagon.   So, if this issue is so important to military readiness, let  Secretary Austin and those around him come to Congress and ask us to  approve that, to make that policy choice--recognizing, as they should  have done already without having to be told, that it is wildly  inappropriate for them to make this policy change so wildly in conflict  with the spirit, if not also the letter, of existing statute.   So that is what he could do. He can come to us and make that argument  in connection with the National Defense Authorization Act. If he can  persuade enough Members of the House and enough Members of the Senate  to get it passed, it would be done.   In the meantime, unless or until such time as he can do that,  especially to the degree that this is impacting military readiness-- these objections--then, what he should do is abundantly clear: Suspend  implementation of these policies until such time as Congress acts to  change them. That is not an unreasonable demand--not in the slightest.   Look, it is also apparent that Secretary Austin and the Department of  Defense have become hostile toward female members of the military who  choose to have children. That is the message this sends--undeniably,  unequivocally. When you tell people: You know, you are pregnant, and it  sure would be convenient for us if you didn't have this baby--so  inconvenient, in fact, that we will give you 3 weeks of paid leave and  a travel account so that you can go somewhere else, you know, so that  you cannot have that child--think about what that does. That creates a  hostile work environment for our female servicemembers, and I find it  repugnant, and so do the American people.   That is why we have a prohibition in law.   For these reasons, Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, first of  all, my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from  Massachusetts, a moment ago, referred to the Pentagon's policy as a  bill. Perhaps this was a Freudian slip, but one way or another, it was  an acknowledgment of the fact that it is a change in policy--a change  in policy that is in conflict with the spirit if not also with the  letter of Federal law. So, as a bill--and I think it is fair to  characterize it as such--it ought to have to be passed through  Congress.   Now, my friend from the State of Massachusetts has used the language  of the text of statute 10 U.S.C., section 1039 in much the same way, I  would imagine, that Secretary Austin and his advisers parsed it and  cribbed it and manipulated it in their development of this policy.   But let's remember the reason I say that it violates the spirit if  not also the letter of it. It is that there is an argument to be made  here that it is. Funds available to the Department of Defense may not  be used to support abortions. How is this money being used? Well, with  the extra leave time that you wouldn't get in the absence of this and  with the travel to another State, it is for the purpose of an abortion.  It is conditioned on your getting an abortion.   My friend and colleague from Massachusetts points out that it is also  there with respect to fertility treatments--IVF or otherwise. Well, all  that may be the case, and I have a couple of responses to that.  [[Page S1329]]    No. 1, I do not and would never object to that if that is what this  were. In fact, I would relinquish my objections altogether if this  policy were about helping military women gain access to fertility  treatments. There is no provision in Federal law--not in title 10 and  not anywhere else that I am aware of--that prohibits the Secretary of  Defense from doing that. That would, moreover, not amount to a major  departure from established policy. So, if that is really what is on the  table here, I wouldn't object to that at all.   But it is the part about abortion. The Senator is conditioning the  use of these funds--the receipt of additional leave time, the receipt  of an expense account, and 3 weeks off--to go have an abortion. That is  using Federal funds to get an abortion, to fund an abortion, because  that is part of that.   Moreover, the suggestion that this applies evenhandedly, equally-- that it was equally intended to promote access by military women to  fertility treatments--is at odds with and belied by the fact that the  President, ever since the Dobbs opinion was released at the end of the  last term of the Supreme Court, has been calling this an all-of- government cause--an all-of-government cause--to make sure that they  can get around Dobbs in any way that they possibly can. This is, was,  always has been, and always will be about abortion.   Like I say, the rest of it would be unobjectionable. I wouldn't raise  any objection to it. I can't imagine my friend and colleague from  Alabama would anyway. So that is a bit of a red herring, and it is a  bit of a smokescreen to say that this is about fertility treatment. It  is not about that.   With respect to the readiness component of it, look, I get it. As for  the hard-working men and women of the military, for whom I have deep  respect, in having gained promotions, we want to be able to promote  them and approve their promotions. Yes, that needs to happen. And to  the extent that any one of those people really needs to be processed  and approved very quickly, there are ways to do that. We could  tick these off one after the other. Senator Tuberville mentioned that  we took care of one just in the last week or so on the floor. We could  be doing that right now. If you want to see where the Senate's  legislative priorities are, they are not with this. They are with other  things. If this really were a priority, we would, through the  leadership of the Democratic majority leader, be in a position to do  that. He has chosen different priorities and not this one.    Look, at the end of the day, this thing--you could dress it up any  way you want, but this is a major change in policy that is utterly at  odds with the spirit if not also the letter of Federal law. As such,  changing it should require a change in statute. If he wants to push for  that, he is free to do so. If it doesn't pass, then he is stuck with  that. If he is not content with being able to advocate for it from the  outside, he should run for the House, or he should run for the Senate.  He must not be allowed to legislate from the E-Ring of the Pentagon.   Mr. President, I object.
