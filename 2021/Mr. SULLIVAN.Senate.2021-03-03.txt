 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is that time of the week that our  pages--when we had them--used to always look forward to. It is the time  of the week that I come down on the floor and talk about someone in  Alaska who is making a huge impact on my State, a lot of times for the  country. These two Alaskans I am going to talk about actually have  gotten national news for the great work they are doing, somebody we  call our Alaskan of the Week. It is usually about a group of  individuals, one, two, maybe a group of people who are helping make  Alaska what, in my view, is the greatest State in the country-- resilient, tough, generous, kind, unique.   Like so many States, this pandemic has really hit Alaska hard-- tourism for sure. The oil and gas sector last year was really hit hard  with low prices. Unfortunately, this year, with the Biden  [[Page S1020]]  administration's attacks on this sector of the United States and  Alaska's economy, it is tough; commercial fishing, tough. It has been a  tough year economically. But an area of good news during the pandemic,  one that I am very proud of for all of my constituents, involves how we  in Alaska have responded on the health side. Vaccines, testing, death  rates--we have consistently been the top State rated in all of these  categories throughout the pandemic, which is kind of amazing given that  we are a very, very big State with a very small population.   I know that so many Americans watching right now want to get back  out, visit Alaska. Our Governor, Mike Dunleavy, recently tweeted:         With the best vaccination efforts [in the country] & some       of the lowest COVID numbers in the country, Alaska is open       for business . . . safe for travelers!    So come on, America, get back up to Alaska. Love to have you.   So this is all very true. Our vaccination efforts are viewed as the  best in the United States of America, and the great lengths that so  many in Alaska have gone through to make it so have captured the  country's imagination. These efforts just in the last couple of weeks  have been featured all across the country--USA TODAY, ``Good Morning  America,'' the Washington Post, the New York Times, a great piece by  Bloomberg News, and so many others. So big thanks to the press corps,  the national press corps, for featuring my State's efforts and  importantly the heroic work being done to distribute lifesaving  vaccines to a State that is more than 2\1/2\ times the size of Texas.  Sorry there, Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz. It is true.   Most of the geography of Alaska is dotted with small villages without  roads in freezing-cold temperatures. I was in Fairbanks last weekend-- just a couple of weeks ago in Fairbanks. It almost hit 40 below. That  is cold.   All across Alaska, our healthcare workers are jumping on boats,  single-prop airplanes, snow machines, and, yes, in a couple of cases,  dog sleds to bring the vaccine and hope to their fellow Alaskans. And  it shows.   As of a few days ago, close to 160,000 Alaskans had received at least  their first vaccine dose. That is about 21 percent of our State's  population.   Now, in Southwest Alaska, what we called the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,  or the YK Delta--those are two giant rivers that come together--these  efforts have been particularly impressive. That is largely thanks to  the amazing people at the YK Health Corporation, or YKHC, which is the  YK Delta's Tribal health provider. The whole organization, consisting  of just about 90 healthcare professionals, serves around 28,000 people  in the YK region, which is about the size of Oregon, so a huge area,  not a lot of people.   Prior to the vaccine, the YK Delta had been stricken by COVID-19 with  one of the highest infection rates in the country, in a very far-flung  place in terms of the dispersal of the population. It is the efforts of  two women there in the YK Delta, Drs. Ellen Hodges and Elizabeth Bates,  who are our Alaskans of the Week, who have been in charge of getting  the vaccine to roughly 50 remote villages in Southwestern Alaska.  Spread out over a territory, as I said, about the size of Oregon, the  village populations in the YK Delta range from about 1,200 people to as  small as 10 in terms of population.   Let's start with Dr. Hodges. She is the chief of staff at YKHC. She  grew up in rural Minnesota. After graduating from the University of  Minnesota Medical School, Dr. Hodges came to Anchorage as a resident in  2002, eventually making her way to Bethel, which is the hub village. It  is a big community, the biggest in the YK Delta. She absolutely fell in  love with the area. She said it has everything--very friendly people,  authentic. It is beautiful. Soon enough, her patients turned into her  family. Also soon enough, she was--according to Tricia Franklin,  Alaska's director of the State Office of Rural Health Division--``the  go-to person for how things are working in rural communities'' and how  to get things done.    She worked in the emergency room tending cuts, bruises, broken bones.  She delivered babies. She worked tirelessly to contain a number of  tuberculosis outbreaks in the region. And then the virus hit, and as I  mentioned, it hit the YK Delta region very hard with some of the  highest COVID rates in America.   There are reasons for that: the multigenerational housing, very  crowded housing in this region; communal lifestyle; and also--here is a  big one, and it should be a shock for every American listening--about  50 percent of the households in this region of America lack running  water. Let me say that again. Some of the most patriotic communities in  the country, as Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in the military  than any other ethnic group in the country, live in communities that  don't have running water or flushed toilets--American citizens.   It is wrong. It is wrong. And we need--we the U.S. Senate, Congress-- to continue to work on this issue. How do you wash your hands five  times a day, as the CDC wants you to do during the pandemic, when you  don't have running water or flushed toilets? We need to keep working on  this. It is a disgrace, to be honest.   So what happened when COVID hit in this region? Because of a lack of  sanitation and many other problems, precious lives were being lost.  Elders, who are vital to pass on the traditional wisdom of the Native  Alaskan culture and heritage, were being lost. Because of a lack of  functioning sanitation, even young people, whom this virus doesn't  really impact, were starting to have respiratory illnesses and getting  sick, and some were even dying. That is horrible. It was terrifying,  particularly for an area that is still dealing with the  multigenerational trauma of previous pandemics, particularly the  Spanish flu of 1918, which in several Alaskan Native communities wiped  out entire communities; 60, 70 percent mortally rates from that flu. So  we needed to get to work fast, particularly in this region.   Enter another intrepid doctor and our Alaskan of the Week, Dr.  Elizabeth Bates. Dr. Bates arrived in Bethel in December of 2018--just  a little over 2 years ago--and she found a community that she loved.  She had experience working in women's health and infection control and  emergency care and disaster relief. She has great experience across the  country--really, across the world. As a doctor, she worked with  patients during 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and has spent time even in  refugee camps in Rwanda.   In Bethel, she was in charge of setting up testing centers for the  region. Working hand in glove with Dr. Hodges, she started one of the  first drive-through and airport testing sites in rural Alaska, much of  it outside in the cold weather under tarps.   But we all know that testing alone, particularly, as I said, when  people are living so closely together and don't live in places where  you can wash your hands frequently, wasn't nearly enough. They tried  everything--public service announcements, reaching out to villagers,  helping them use bleach to sanitize. It was a 24/7 effort, but, as I  said, it wasn't enough. The virus was spreading rapidly. They were  losing. People were dying.   Then on December 18, a few days before winter solstice--the darkest  day of the year--hope came to Bethel, AK, because the first vaccines  arrived. Thanks to the great work of so many scientists, government  workers, private sector workers, Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine  arrived on December 18 to the YK Delta. These two intrepid doctors I  have been talking about cried. They had seen a lot of death and  struggles in the region, and like a Christmas miracle, this vaccine  arrived. They hugged each other, and then they got to work.   As I said, there are roughly 50 remote villages in the YK Delta  spread out over a territory about the size of many States in our  country--as a matter of fact, bigger than most States in our country-- so they traveled on small planes, trucks, on ice roads, snow machines,  dog sleds.   Their operation, Project Togo, is named in reference to one of the  famous sled dogs that helped carry the diphtheria serum to Nome, which,  of course, is the original inspiration for the Iditarod Sled Dog Race.  Sometimes it was so cold that they had to keep the syringes filled with  COVID serum under their clothes, lest the serum froze.   The operation that they initiated and organized has hit every single  village,  [[Page S1021]]  all 50 in the YK Delta, bringing the vaccine to pretty much anyone who  wants it. In some villages, they have been able to vaccinate as much as  half the population. As a result, the numbers of COVID infections and  deaths are plummeting in this region, and hope is spreading.   This great team, Drs. Hodges and Bates, as well as all in the  community and all working at YKHC, have made a huge difference, and  this team has created a special bond that nobody will forget.   Dr. Bates, a relative newcomer to Alaska, says that the experience  has made her fall in love with the YK Delta region even more. She  bought a home. She intends on staying. She describes the beauty of the  region, something that she appreciates even more now, as ``Our sky is  huge. . . . We have a front-row seat to the entire universe.''   These two doctors also have a front-row seat in providing a front-row  seat to hope during this pandemic.   So I want to thank both of them again, Dr. Hodges and Dr. Bates, and  all those across Alaska who are helping distribute the vaccine.   As I mentioned, right now, Alaska is the No. 1 State in the country  per capita in terms of vaccine distribution and the No. 1 State per  capita in terms of testing and has one of the lowest death rates. This  is really amazing, really, when you see how big and widespread and  harsh the weather conditions can be in the great State of Alaska.   Our fellow Alaskans are tough, resilient, and innovative, and Dr.  Hodges and Dr. Bates are a huge and essential part of this effort. That  is why I want to congratulate them and thank them again for being our  Alaskans of the Week.   I yield the floor.
