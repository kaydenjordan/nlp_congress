 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss where we stand as a  nation and as a Senate on day 28 of the longest shutdown in the history  of the United States. Following my comments, I will offer by UC to pull  one of the House bills up, and I understand the Senator from Oklahoma  will be here to respond to that.   We were not scheduled to be in session today. We were supposed to  adjourn yesterday and then reconvene on Monday, January 28, but I  objected to the adjournment, just as I did last weekend, because our  government is closed. So we will be in today and tomorrow, off Sunday  and Monday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., and then return on  Tuesday, January 22.   I offer a partial apology to my colleagues and to our professional  Senate staff for any inconvenience they experience because we will be  in session during a time when there had been a scheduled recess. I have  never objected to the normal weekly adjournment before last week, and I  cannot imagine doing so under normal circumstances. But my apology is  only partial because the inconvenience experienced by anyone in this  Chamber--Senate or professional staff--pales in comparison to the pain  that this shutdown inflicts upon workers who are not getting paid,  citizens who are not being served, and a nation whose reputation is  being damaged. We are made to look like a laughing stock by this  needless shutdown, and the enemies of America around the world are  enjoying this immensely, just as our allies are deeply worried about  us.   Despite what some believe and despite the impression that some may  draw from recent history in the article I branch, I do not believe the  shuttering of the government of the United States is a normal  circumstance, and I, for one, will do anything I can to fight against  the normalization of the status we find ourselves in today. That is why  I am here today. That is why I will be here tomorrow. That is why I  will be here all next week. If our government is closed, I will be here  trying to open it.  [[Page S300]]    I am only one Senator, and I lack the power to compel anyone else to  be here with me other than the Presiding Officer. I lack the power to  force a floor vote to reopen government. I lack the power to call up  any legislative matter for a vote, save the two House bills that we  have agreed may be called up pursuant to the UC rules.   I do have the power to talk every day with my colleagues and the  administration officials to encourage the reopening of our government,  and I do have the power to stand on the floor and describe the  circumstances of my constituents and all Americans who are being  needlessly hurt.   Only a few will hear me as I describe their pain, but describe it I  will, and the Congressional Record will record for all history their  stories. If you want me to share your story in the days to come as I  take the floor, please reach out to my office at kaine.senate.gov,  where you will see a way to share your shutdown story, and I will try  to share as many of these as I can in the days to come.   Today, before I offer the UC on the homeland security short-term  bill, I want to do two things. I want first to elaborate on a point I  made briefly yesterday about the cardinal illogic of this shutdown,  and, second, I want to share stories just from meetings that I had  yesterday with affected Federal employees and veterans.   The cardinal illogic of this shutdown has at least three levels. The  cause of the shutdown is clear. President Trump does not believe $1.3  billion for border security funding contained in a bipartisan  appropriation bill is sufficient. He says ``I want more,'' and he is  willing to shut down massive sections of the American government to get  more. President Trump is not only willing to do this; he says that he  is proud to do this, even for weeks and months, and he invited cameras  into a meeting with congressional leaders and told America that he is  the sole responsible party for it.   The first level of illogic to the shutdown is this: Most of the  employees and citizens affected by the shutdown have absolutely  nothing--nothing--to do with the debate over the right appropriations  level for border security. What does the debate about border security  have to do with the food stamp program and those who work for it? What  does it have to do with the National Park Service? What does it have to  do with the Environmental Protection Agency, with the Internal Revenue  Service, with the chemical safety board, with national forests, with  mental health services, domestic violence programs funded through  Department of Justice grants, or with affordable housing programs  administered by HUD? Hundreds of thousands of workers and millions of  citizens who are served by the affected Agencies are being punished-- locked out of their jobs, deprived of paychecks, turned away from  services because the President believes that if he punishes enough  people, even those unconnected with the legitimate issue at hand, he  will get what he wants. This is tyrant behavior, not Presidential  behavior.   The illogic of this form of punishment struck me most vividly  yesterday, when I moved to reopen these affected Agencies and Leader  McConnell objected to my UC request. One of the Agencies covered by my  UC request was the Executive Office of the President of the United  States. At the White House, many of the President's own chosen staff  are furloughed or they are working without pay during the shutdown, so  I stood on the floor as a Democrat to ask that the President's own  staff be allowed to return to work to serve him, to serve the country,  and to be paid.   The majority leader, having previously described his motivation as  trying to support the President, stood and objected to the motion that  would have returned the President's own staff to work. You can't make  this stuff up.   The second level of illogic of this shutdown concerns the core of the  policy dispute: the appropriations level for border security. The UC  request that I will offer in a few minutes deals with that part of the  dispute that is pending before the body. I will offer in a few minutes  the UC on the House bill that would reopen for a short term the  Homeland Security Agencies that provide security while Congress tries  to find a bipartisan deal that can pass both Houses and earn the  President's signature, and Senate Republicans, again, in a few  minutes--at the request of President Trump, who does not yet want this  to happen--will object to that request as well.   If the issue in dispute is border security or, as President Trump  often says, ``the safety and security of the American people''--he says  that in speeches; he says in tweets that is the issue--then why punish  the very people who are providing that safety and security? How does it  help promote safety and security to not pay the very Border Patrol  agents charged with protecting the border? How does it promote safety  and security to not pay FBI agents, DEA agents, Federal prosecutors,  ATF agents, and U.S. marshals? How does it promote safety and security  to not pay members of the Coast Guard, who help interdict drugs and  also rescue Americans endangered at sea? How does it promote safety and  security to not pay TSA agents, who keep dangerous people off planes,  or air traffic controllers, who keep air traffic safety safely  coordinated in American skies?   The President has proudly taken paychecks away from the very  professionals whom we ask to guard the safety and security of the  American public every day, and in doing so, he has made our citizens  and our country less safe and less secure.   The third level of illogic is a consequence of actions that were  taken by Congress and the President in the last week. For this, I want  to offer thanks to my colleagues. I was able, through use of my  adjournment objection last week, to negotiate a successful vote on a  bill guaranteeing backpay to all workers affected by this or any future  shutdown. I appreciate the cooperation of all my Senate colleagues--the  majority leader, the minority leader and others and the House--in this  effort and appreciate that President Trump signed the bill in the last  few days.   Having guaranteed backpay, we are now faced with an unusual question  about continuing the shutdown. Now that we know the Federal Treasury  will stroke checks to all affected workers to make them whole at least  for the salary they have lost, wouldn't we rather have them at work  serving their fellow Americans rather than locked out of their offices  and unable to serve them? What sense does it make to guarantee payment  or prohibit them from doing the work for which they are paid? These  workers want to go back to work because they want to serve their fellow  citizens.   That brings me to the second part of my remarks before I offer the  UC. I had three meetings yesterday with large groups of Virginians  where I listened to them talk about the shutdown. Two of the meetings  were actually specifically designed to hear from Federal employees  about the shutdown. One was an annual coffee that Senator Warner and I  have for veterans to celebrate their service to the country, and as  they were waiting in line and taking pictures, they were talking to us  a lot about the shutdown.   In these three instances, I heard an awful lot. Just as I will share  stories next week, let me now summarize a few of the things I heard  from those I interacted with yesterday and tell you about them.   The mother of a newborn, 6 months old, who works as an air traffic  controller and can't afford to pay her babysitter, is working but  getting no salary. She started to cry because, she said: I have to go  to work and can't pay a babysitter. So the only thing I can do is--I am  not calling in sick. The only thing I can do is send my baby to my  mother who lives in another State.   She started to cry.   My baby is 6 months old. I have never been away from my baby for more  than 8 hours. I don't want to be away from my child. How long is it  going to go on? I may be away from my child for weeks.   She teared up as she told us about this.   There was a Federal employee who said: ``I signed up to serve  Americans but didn't realize that I was being drafted into a political  war I had no interest in being part of,'' a war in which Federal  employees are used as hostages.   There was a young married couple, both Federal employees, working  without pay, holding their newborn, a tiny baby in their arms, and  tearing up as  [[Page S301]]  they talked about their uncertainty over paying their mortgage and  other bills.   There was a furloughed Federal employee whose wife is a disabled  veteran with PTSD but is postponing her mental health appointments  because of her inability to pay copays or pay for medications.   The two Federal-employee couple whose 4- and 6-year-old children,  hearing in the background the news on TV and hearing their parents'  anxious discussions at night, came up to them the day after Christmas,  each holding their piggy banks and giving them to their parents,  saying: Maybe you guys need these piggy banks now more than we do.   There was a veteran who has successfully created an entrepreneurial  government contracting business and has hundreds of employees who are  out of work because of the shutdown.   All of these people express this: their love for public service,  their desire to continue public service, and their personal pain at  feeling disrespected just because they want to provide public service.   A repeated concern expressed by so many of them about the backlog  that is on their desks--they think they will be back at some point, but  it was really interesting: Sitting on my desk was this piece of work  that I really wanted to get done and how much more is going to be  there? It will be hard to serve people, and they will be mad because  the backlog is so big.   They are having anxiety about not being able to serve people well  because the backlog will grow during the 4 weeks of the shutdown.   Then, a deep concern shared by so many: Why would any young person  want to go into public service? Why would any young person, with a  heart for public service, want to do that as a Federal employee?   Before I offer the UC--I see my colleague from Oklahoma is here--I  want to tell one last story that, for some reason, of all the ones  yesterday, this is the one that stuck with me. There were others that  might have been more dire, but this one stuck with me because I think  it exemplifies a spirit I see in so many of our Federal workers.   There was an employee of the National Park Service who has been with  the park service for about 10 years, and his job is to physically  maintain the space around the White House: groundskeeping, trash  removal, anything, as he says, he can do to make those grounds around  the White House look really fantastic. He described why he loves his  job, and it wasn't sort of the tasks that he does.   He said: I want schoolchildren visiting Washington, DC, and I want  international visitors visiting Washington, DC, when they come to the  White House, to be able to look at this and see it and feel impressed  with the United States of America. It makes me feel proud when I see  the reaction on people's faces as they are there in front of the White  House.   That is how he described his work.   He is furloughed and without pay, so he is home. There are news  accounts about trash overflowing at national parks and things like  that, and that kind of causes him angst, obviously. He is angry about  the situation. He didn't mince any words with me as he described it.   Last Sunday morning he got a call. It was: Hey, we need you to come  shovel snow.   We had snow last weekend in DC. We had a lot of snow, 10 inches of  snow.   You have to come in and shovel snow. You are not being paid. I know  you feel the disrespect of being furloughed, and we are not going to be  able to pay you for shoveling snow, but can you come in and shovel snow  on Sunday so that at least the walkways are clear in front of the White  House?   He said: Boy, I really had something I wanted to say on that call. I  wanted to say no, but then I thought about this: What if somebody  because of the snow, like a kid, falls and breaks their leg or there is  an accident or something because the sidewalks aren't clear or there is  ice that causes some problem?   He started to think about the people he cares about that he wants to  be impressed by the White House because he wants them to be impressed  by the country, and he said: Well, I guess I better go shovel the snow.   I kid you not. We were having this conversation about 11:45 yesterday  morning, and some of you had seen there is a weather report this  weekend that is a little bit iffy in DC. During the middle of his  telling me his story, his phone rang, and he looked at it and said:  Yeah, that is my boss. I am not going to answer it. I know why he is  calling.   I said: Did you just time this for a stage effect because you knew  you were meeting with me right now? Did you tell him not to call at  10:30 but to call at 11:30?   He said: No, I know what the call is about. They need me this  weekend, even though I am being disrespected, even though I am not  being paid, no matter what I want to say, I know what I am going to  say. I am going to say: Yes, I will come in and make sure this White  House, this Capitol, this country looks as beautiful as it can look for  these schoolchildren and these visitors.   I think we have to up our game, all of us. I know we can do this. We  owe it to our citizens. We owe it to our workers. We owe it to our  Nation's reputation.                    Unanimous Consent Request--H.J. Res. 1    With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 6, H.J. Res. 1,  making further continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland  Security; I further ask that the joint resolution be considered read a  third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
