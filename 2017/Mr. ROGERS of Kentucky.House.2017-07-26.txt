 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  my long-time adviser and expert caseworker, Sarah Meece, upon her much- deserved retirement after dedicating more than 40 years of service by  my side. When I reflect upon Sarah's career, I stand in awe of her  loyalty, her unwavering patience, her persistent advocacy, and undying  compassion for those in need.   As Congressman, I have the duty and the privilege of assisting the  people of southern and eastern Kentucky as they grapple with Federal  agencies. At the heart of those cases has stood Sarah Meece providing  expert advice and staunch support for individuals in our region who  need help with Social Security, disability, and retirement claims,  among many other issues. In fact, over the last 36 years, Sarah has  worked on approximately 150,000 cases, representing an unmatched record  of assistance for more than 4,000 individuals each year.   Sarah has gained so much notoriety in her field that staff from other  congressional offices, and officials even from the administration,  contact her for guidance in case work. And in this line of work, there  are very few, if any, medals or certificates of honor to honor those  worthy of recognition like Sarah; nonetheless, her drive and  consistency has never failed.   Day in and day out, Sarah has answered countless phone calls, set up  personal meetings, listened to some of the most heartbreaking stories  from families who were denied benefits on multiple occasions, those in  desperate need of recouping benefits, others who lost hope in a  mountain of Federal paperwork. Sarah's reward has been the simple words  of appreciation from the thousands upon thousands of individuals who  she has helped over the years. In my eyes, she deserves so much more.   While I wish Sarah the best in her years of retirement, the absence  of her daily presence in the office will be insurmountable. When I was  elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle Counties in  1969, Sarah Meece was there. When I was the Republican nominee for  Lieutenant Governor in 1979, Sarah Meece was there. When I was elected  to Congress in 1980, Sarah Meece was there. In fact, she has been with  me every day since, even volunteering her personal time for campaign  work along the way, ensuring we both could continue serving the public  for another 2 years.   During her tenure, Sarah welcomed U.S. Presidents and Vice Presidents  to our region, befriended eight Kentucky Governors and their staffs,  and assisted hundreds of local leaders across southern and eastern  Kentucky as they navigated through Federal issues.   However, it is the people living in the hills and hollers of  Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District who have driven her passion- filled public service. With every call and every personal visit, Sarah  offered an encouraging word of hope to our constituents. Very few  people can find the silver lining in every cloud like Sarah does, or  bring a smile and a laugh to a broken heart. Her comical candor and  illustrative storytelling have been a bright spot in everyone's day.   I am forever grateful to have such a great friend and loyal adviser  over these last 4 decades. Sarah's life's work has given countless  families hope in their darkest hour and comforted them through lengthy  and complex Federal issues.   Simply put, Sarah is irreplaceable, both her institutional knowledge  of Federal casework and her kind, enduring spirit.   Mr. Speaker, if every congressional office and Federal agency had a  Sarah Meece, our Nation would operate much  [[Page H6306]]  better. She has been the jewel of my congressional operations and the  truest friend to the people of southern and eastern Kentucky.   My wife, Cynthia, and I wish Sarah and her husband, Bud, many joyful  and restful years of retirement with their children and grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, thank you for yielding the  time. Congratulations to you on your maiden voyage in this role that  you are occupying--very expertly, I might add. During the forced march  that we undertook in the committee for the last 3 weeks, clearing all  12 bills through the full committee in a historically record time, we  had a good drill sergeant, Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you for doing a  great job.   We held 74 oversight and budget hearings, heard from over 400  witnesses, with the overarching goal that each of the 12 bills we  passed out of our committee addressed the needs of our constituents. I  am proud to say that these bills do just that--advance our national  defense and secure our borders, take care of our veterans, provide  critical infrastructure funding, increase resources to combat the  opioid epidemic, maintain our presence as a leader in global  diplomacy--all the while maintaining fiscal discipline.   I am disappointed that we won't consider all 12 of these bills before  the August recess, but this security package is an important step  forward. It will ensure that we, as the Congress, uphold our most  sacred responsibility to provide for our Nation's common defense.   Under the previous administration, our Department of Defense faced  needless uncertainty. I am proud that we are now turning the tide,  providing our troops and their commanders with the necessary resources  to respond to threats from countries like Russia, China, and Iran, as  well as crush the violent extremists who wish to do us harm.   As promised to the American people, we are rebuilding and modernizing  our military as an international powerhouse by better equipping our  troops, strengthening counterterrorism efforts, and reestablishing  confidence with our allies. At a time when our enemies continue to  advance around the globe, the U.S. must remain at the forefront of  military readiness and advanced technology to strengthen national  defense at home and abroad.   This bill also maintains our commitment to those brave men and women  after their service has come to a close, providing for greater  oversight and accountability at the VA and modernizing electronic  health records to help our veterans receive the high quality of care  they deserve.   I am also pleased that this legislation includes the Energy and Water  Appropriations bill, which funds many of our national security  interests and builds upon our country's essential infrastructure needs.  In particular, this bill protects the Appalachian Regional Commission,  ARC, from proposed elimination, and ensures that its critical programs  will continue in our hardest hit Appalachian coal communities.   Since 1965, ARC has led efforts to innovate, partner, and invest in  the region to build community capacity and strengthen economic growth.  These investments have led to the creation of thousands of new jobs. It  has improved local water and sewer systems, improved our schools,  increased access to healthcare, and provided critical assistance to  emerging businesses. After 8 years of strangulation by regulation in  the Obama administration's war on coal, Appalachia needs the ARC now  more than ever.   Mr. Chairman, thank you again for allowing me to speak on behalf of  this bill. Is it everything we wanted? No. It is critical that we  prioritize our national security, and that is what this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, the motto of our Appropriations Committee is this: ``A  vision without funding is a hallucination.'' Now we have got a  visionary leader in our chairman, but we have got to provide the  funding to make the dreams that we have come true, and that is what  Appropriations does.
