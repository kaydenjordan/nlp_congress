 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, Mrs.  Napolitano, and all the leadership on both the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for  putting this bill together.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about the Energy and Commerce  jurisdiction, which is initially the Safe Drinking Water Act.   Our Nation's public drinking water system serves more than 300  million people, but aging and failing infrastructure threatens access  to safe drinking water in communities large and small.                                time  1330    The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that our water systems  will require $472 billion in infrastructure repairs over the next 20  years, but  [[Page H8226]]  investment simply has not kept pace with the need.   This bill reauthorizes the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving  Fund for the first time in 20 years and provides significant new  funding to State and local governments in dire need.   The bill nearly doubles the authorized funding from $1 billion to  almost $2 billion in 2021 and increases funding for public water system  supervision grants to States.   Important provisions in the bill ensure that this money gets to the  communities that need it most by raising the cap on special assistance  to disadvantaged communities under the State Revolving Fund and setting  a floor for such assistance to guarantee help for those communities.   I want to thank Representative Tonko, the ranking member of our House  Energy Subcommittee on Environment, who led the effort to reauthorize  and improve the State Revolving Fund for many years. Many of the  provisions in this bill were incorporated from AQUA Act, which he  authored.   The bill also contains a provision first introduced by myself and  Representative Rush establishing a grant program for replacing leaded  drinking water fountains in schools and requiring, for the first time,  a national inventory of lead service lines and the cost to replace  them.   The bill contains Representative Dingell's provision to make drinking  water quality reports to consumers more frequent, comprehensive, and  understandable.   Significantly, the bill incorporates Representative Peters' provision  to assist systems with resiliency to extreme weather, and it  establishes new requirements to assess and address vulnerabilities to  those threats.   It also provides $100 million for grants to extend access to safe  drinking water into areas impacted by natural disasters, responding to  concerns raised by Representative Green.   Additionally, the bill contains language championed by Representative  McNerney authorizing a water sense program to encourage consumer  product water efficiency, and it authorizes Buy America requirements  for iron and steel products for 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, this bill won't solve all our drinking water challenges,  but it makes important improvements and delivers real benefits.   I am also pleased that this final bipartisan bill includes important  energy provisions that I pushed, to include among them provisions  authored by Representatives Kennedy, DeGette, and Peters.   All in all, the drinking water and energy titles of this bill are  critical, significant steps forward that will benefit America's  families, industry, and the environment.   Mr. Speaker, America's Water Infrastructure Act is a victory for all  of us, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
