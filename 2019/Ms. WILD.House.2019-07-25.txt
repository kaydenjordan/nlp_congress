 Madam Speaker, 2 days ago, I received an email from a  constituent, a professor at a community college in Allentown,  Pennsylvania. Many of her students depend on SNAP benefits, and she  reached out to me, deeply worried after hearing reports of the  administration's plans to further undermine SNAP through extreme new  executive actions.   These changes would cut assistance to over 3 million people across  our country, including children, veterans, disabled Americans, and  seniors.   I wish I could send her a reassuring response. It is truly a shameful  time in America when we give tax cuts to billionaires and huge  corporations, but we can't help folks falling on hard times put food on  their tables.   Around 44 percent of SNAP beneficiaries, nationally, are children,  and research shows that SNAP not only reduces hunger and malnutrition,  but also improves American people's lives in a whole range of other  ways, including improving children's education outcomes.   We cannot turn our backs on those we were sent here to serve. Let's  stand together, Democrats and Republicans, alike, just as when we  worked together to protect SNAP benefits in the farm bill, and reject  these deeply immoral attacks on our most vulnerable fellow citizens.                            ____________________
