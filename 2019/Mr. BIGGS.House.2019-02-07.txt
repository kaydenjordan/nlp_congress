 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss, briefly, some of the  accomplishments of the Trump administration that were pointed out in  the State of the Union Address the other day.   I think it is imperative that we recognize that over 5 million jobs  have been created in the last 2 years, over 300,000 in the last month  alone. The economists had predicted and projected 170,000 jobs, and yet  almost twice as many jobs were created. There are now a record of 157  million Americans employed in this country.   The unemployment rate has remained at or below the 4 percent for 11  straight months. That hasn't happened in almost 50 years.   There has been half a million manufacturing jobs since President  Trump became President, and there were more manufacturing jobs created  in 2018 than any single year in the last 20 years.   We have seen the judiciary be restored to, in my opinion, normalcy,  with the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett  Kavanaugh, and more than 40 Federal judges confirmed just this week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Walker for holding this  Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I want you to know I continue to be astonished that our  Democratic Members--our colleagues--turned a blind eye to what is  happening in this country because of what is going on on the border.   Unlike many in Congress, I have been down to the border multiple  times. I grew up just a number of miles--60, 70 miles--from the border  myself. I have been down there many times. A couple of weeks ago I took  eight Congressmen with me. We toured the border. We met with multiple  ranchers, and their story is very similar. We got to talk to one guy-- four home invasions, more than 15 burglaries, endless vandalism, and  trespassing daily. He was not unique.   Another family has set up their own cameras and sensors so they can  see. We watched them. We watched the people coming across. This is hour  after hour of footage. Do you know what? These were young men coming  across with carpet slippers so you couldn't see their footprints. I  didn't see the moms and children coming across. I saw the young men  carrying bundles of drugs across.   On Monday the ``Washington Examiner'' published an article detailing  the fear of border residents living in New Mexico. They, like those in  Arizona, Texas, and California have been burglarized. They find groups  of illegal aliens squatting in their barns with bundles of drugs on  their land. But they won't call the authorities because they fear  retaliation from drug cartels.    Many of the people we met with said: we will meet with you on  condition that you don't reveal us meeting to the press because every  time the press reveals something, we are retaliated against by drug  cartels.   Yesterday at the end of a Judiciary Committee hearing about gun  violence, after going on a screed--a demagogic tirade--about the  importance of protecting every life, this Member said that every life  is valuable. I agree with that. But she is valuing some over others.   Why wouldn't she focus on policies that would help the lives of all  Americans through border security?   In 2015, a young man from my Congressional District, Grant Ronnebeck,  was shot and killed by an illegal alien. Not only should that murderer  not have been in possession of a firearm, he shouldn't have even been  in the country. He had been deported before, yet he comes back because  the border is porous.   For some reason, no Democrat is willing to ensure that criminally  violent aliens like Grant's killer aren't released back into our  community. I introduced a bill called Grant's Law to ensure no criminal  alien can be released from custody. I can't get a single cosponsor from  the other side of the aisle.   Two weeks ago 250 pounds of fentanyl and 400 pounds of additional  drugs were interdicted in Nogales. That is the number one sector for  drug seizures in this country. Forty percent of all drugs that are  interdicted are in the Tucson sector. Just today, in the Ajo region,  300 people crossed--today--2 hours ago.   I am told by experts that we only interdict 15 percent of dangerous  drugs and fewer than 50 percent of the people who are crossing.   Mr. Speaker, I call out for my colleagues across the aisle: Help us.  Help this country. I am telling you: Walls work. We have to stand with  the President.   I stand with the President. I stand with the people of America. I  stand with people in my district. I stand with the people who believe  and understand that we have to get border security and the most  foundational and fundamental thing we can do is build a wall.
