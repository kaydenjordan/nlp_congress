 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the  Burgess-Brooks-DeGette-Kuster am- endment that would increase funding  for the Keep Young Athletes Safe grant program.   Every young athlete who dreams of the Olympic stage should be able to  compete and train in an environment that does not sacrifice their  personal safety for athletic excellence.   Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.   In 2016, my home newspaper, The Indianapolis Star, published an  investigative piece that exposed extremely troubling allegations of  sexual abuse at USA Gymnastics programs across the country by a medical  provider, a trainer of our young, Olympic gymnasts.   The U.S. Center for SafeSport, although created in 2011, was finally  federally recognized in 2017. It provides services to sports entities  on abuse prevention techniques, policies, and programs. It also offers  a safe, professional, and confidential place for individuals to report  allegations of sexual abuse with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic  movements.   Our amendment today would increase funding for the grant program that  works to, as quickly and efficiently as possible, address the more  than, right now, over 800 claims of alleged abuse currently before the  U.S. Center for SafeSport. It would also allow more investigators to be  hired for expanded outreach and education efforts with athletes,  coaches, and parents across the country.   Protecting our young athletes from abuse is critically important.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.
