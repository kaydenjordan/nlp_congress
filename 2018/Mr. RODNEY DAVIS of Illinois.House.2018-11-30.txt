 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the grounds that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  Monticello High School Sages and Coach Cully Welter on winning the  State football championship last week.   The Sages capped off an undefeated season with their 24-20 victory  over Byron High School in the Class 3A championship game. This season's  championship was the first in Monticello's history, and also the first  time its football team has played in a championship game.   Monticello's 2018 season was a record-breaking season, and it will be  remembered for years to come. Before the championship game, none of  Monticello's opponents had finished within three touchdowns of the  Sages.   I want to send a special message to the Sages' defense. As someone  who watched this game comfortably from my home, I clearly saw that the  Byron running back fumbled the ball at the goal line, and it was a very  bad call. But you recovered, and you won the championship.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to follow the Sages' championship season,  and I congratulate the team and the entire Monticello community on this  well-deserved title.                            ____________________
