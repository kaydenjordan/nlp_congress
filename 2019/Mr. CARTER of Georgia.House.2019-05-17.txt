 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Stuart Sligh, Sr., for winning the Savannah Morning News Unsung Hero  Award for 2019.   Presented annually at the Best of Preps banquet in the First  Congressional District of Georgia, the award honors individuals who  unassumingly  [[Page H3930]]  offer their time and resources to local high school sports teams so  they can perform at the highest level possible.   This year's recipient, Mr. Sligh, Sr., founded the Stuart Sligh Jr.  Memorial Foundation in honor of his 16-year-old son, a standout athlete  at Savannah Country Day School in both baseball and football who  tragically passed away in a car accident.   Raising money in Stu Sligh's memory, the foundation has contributed  over $50,000 to school athletics across the Savannah area, as well as  other organizations in the State, like the YMCA.   The donations have gone toward purchasing pitching machines for  baseball teams, new jerseys for football teams, and much more.   I thank Mr. Sligh for his work in our community and congratulate him  on winning the 2019 Unsung Hero Award.                            ____________________
