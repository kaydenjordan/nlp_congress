 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1372 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1372         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 8873) to       amend title 3, United States Code, to reform the process for       the counting of electoral votes, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on House Administration or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1372, providing for consideration of H.R. 8873,  the Presidential Election Reform Act, under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House  Administration, as well as one motion to recommit.   This bipartisan legislation, brought forward by Ms. Lofgren and Ms.  Cheney of Wyoming, is the product of more than 2 years of work by the  Committee on House Administration and more than a year and a half of  deliberations and investigation by the January 6th Select Committee.   The electoral college, of course, has been with us from the beginning  of the Republic. In a sense, this is legislation America has been  working on since 1887, for the last 135 years, because that was the  last time that Congress legislated to try to lend statutory coherence  and legislative direction to the provisions of the Constitution  governing the electoral college.   The electoral college, as you know, Madam Speaker, is a Byzantine,  complex, and multifaceted institution, but it is clear, in the wake of  the debacle of January 6, 2021, that we must modernize it, update it,  and make it work as well as possible for as long as we have it.   That is why both supporters of the electoral college system and those  who would replace it with a national popular vote for President, and  that is a camp I am in, a camp that represents around two-thirds of the  American people, are strongly supporting this legislation and should be  supporting this legislation in order to clarify the mechanisms of our  Presidential election process.   First of all, this legislation reaffirms that the Vice President's  role at the count of the electoral college electors on January 6 is a  ministerial role and does not include any substantive authority to  count or reject or dismiss or nullify or vaporize electoral college  votes sent in by the States, nor does the Vice President have any  independent, substantive power to halt or delay the joint session or to  return electoral college votes to the States.   We believe there was never any ambiguity about that. Former President  Trump was told there was no ambiguity about it by his own Vice  President, by his White House counsel, by the Attorney General of the  United States, yet insisted that there was some kind of ambiguity and  wiggle room for the Vice President to step outside of his assigned  constitutional role and simply declare the electoral college votes of  certain States, including Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, null and  void and return them to the legislatures of those States for some  undefined further action.   All of that is clearly outside the history of the electoral college  and what is contemplated constitutionally. We clarify that in this  legislation.   Moreover, the current provisions in the Electoral Count Act governing  objections brought forward to the receipt of electoral college votes  from particular States would be changed in this legislation.   Under the current rules, all it takes is a Member of the House and a  Member of the Senate to bring an objection  [[Page H8023]]  to the receipt of electoral college votes from a State. That would be  changed to a requirement, under this act, of one-third of the House and  one-third of the Senate together raising an objection, obviously  meaning that this could not be done for purely fanciful purposes. There  would have to be a substantial body of Members in both Chambers who  agree that there is a serious objection being made.   By the way, the Senate proposal differs slightly in that they are  suggesting a one-fifth requirement on both sides as opposed to the one- third requirement that is being advanced in this legislation.   Furthermore, the rules in this statute define explicitly the  constitutional grounds upon which an objection to electoral college  votes can be made. These objections are limited to a very narrow set of  discrete issues that are grounded in the constitutional text of the  12th Amendment or other parts of the Constitution, such as whether an  elector has voted for two candidates from the elector's own State,  which is clearly in violation of the 12th Amendment.   The rules also clarify the denominator, or the method of calculating  the whole number of electors that have been cast for the purpose of  winning a Presidential election.   Our counting rules would also clarify the applicable parliamentary  procedure at the count, ensuring that strategic bad faith actors are  unable to exploit procedural loopholes in an effort to delay or subvert  the count.   Confusion has plagued electoral counts in Congress at different  points in our history, almost since the beginning of the Republic. We  are confident that under this bill, future counts will be far more  orderly and ministerial in nature, even during controversial elections,  and will act simply to certify the choice of the American people as  expressed through the State elections, which is the full extent of  Congress' counting role under the Constitution.   We want to make sure that Congress does not pretend to arrogate to  itself the power to decide who is going to be the President. The role  of Congress is simply to count the electoral college votes that have  come in. Maybe if I get a moment later, I can get into a little more  specificity about the grounds for objection.    There is also clarification of when a State's Presidential election  can be extended in case of a truly catastrophic event. Today's Federal  law allows a State legislature to appoint electors by itself if a State  has had a failure to elect at its November election. That very vague  provision is dangerous, dangerously unclear, and it was targeted by  former President Trump's supporters in 2020.   Our legislation provides, instead, that voting in a State's  Presidential election can only be extended if a State experiences a  genuinely catastrophic event, which we define specifically with respect  to natural disasters and terrorist attacks and like calamities. The  event must also be widespread enough to potentially affect the outcome  of the State's election. All of this is mediated judicially by  appearance before a Federal court. Any extension may only cover the  area that was directly affected by the event, and any extension cannot  last longer than 5 days after election day.   We know that a provision like this is, unfortunately, necessary. The  September 11 terror attacks on America occurred on primary election day  in New York City, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 very nearly derailed New  York and New Jersey's Presidential elections that year. We are  confident that our bill ensures that Federal law will account for  unforeseen emergencies in future Presidential elections.   There are other provisions that I hope to get into in a little more  detail, but I close, Madam Speaker, just by saying that this is an  absolutely necessary and urgent update of the Electoral Count Act,  which hasn't been touched since 1887.   We saw in January 2021 how some of the imperfections in the current  process can be exploited by actors who are determined to derail the  electoral college counting process or, indeed, overthrow the whole  election. We want to do whatever we can, within the confines of the  electoral college system, in this legislation to improve the situation  and to prepare for the next Presidential election.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I was delighted to hear my friend offer those  comments. I am afraid I don't really understand his objection to this  legislation. He says we are trying to ram this through. After 135 years  of doing nothing about the Electoral Count Act, I guess you have to be  a true conservative to see 135 years as moving too quickly in reforming  the provisions of this very opaque, and in places, vague and  inscrutable language.   But in any event, the gentleman from Pennsylvania argues there have  been times that Members of both parties have raised objections in the  past. That is absolutely right. Both Republicans and Democrats have  made objections on the floor in the past. Obviously, none of the  objections attributed to those on our side had anything to do with a  violent assault on the institutions of the country or an attempt to get  the Vice President to step outside of his constitutional role, or other  efforts to conduct what has been called a political coup in the  country.   In any event, the gentleman is correct that there have been a lot of  objections raised. If that is your problem, then you should be  absolutely supporting this legislation because we are proposing to go  from a situation where any single Member can raise an objection if he  or she can get a Senator to join them, to a situation where you need a  third of the entire House of Representatives and a third of the entire  U.S. Senate before an objection can be raised. The objections can be  raised only according to very specific constitutional criteria. They  have to be grounded in the text of the Constitution.   For example, if a State has not been admitted yet, and yet is  purporting to offer electors, that would be grounds for rejecting it  and for adjusting the denominator. If there are attempts by electors to  vote for two people from the same State, which is clearly in violation  of the 12th Amendment, then that would be rejected.    Right now, anybody can object for any reason he or she wants. There  were people in 2021 who were running around talking about precinct  problems in particular States or claims of votes appearing in the  middle of the night.   Now, there was nothing to any of those. More than 60 Federal and  State courts rejected every claim of electoral fraud and corruption.  But in any event, that is not the job of the House of Representatives  to be out trying to police the counting of ballots in Pennsylvania or  Arizona or Georgia, or any other State.   All we are supposed to do is take the certificate of ascertainment  that is provided by the Governor based on the State legislature's  determination of what the vote is in the casting of the electors from  the State. So once that certificate of ascertainment comes in, our job  is to accept it.   Now, if someone tries to not comply with what the will of the State  really was--say, if a Governor says I disagree with how the people  voted, I am not going to turn it in--then that person can be taken to  court by one of the Presidential candidates, or both, or all of the  Presidential candidates, and can be ordered to comply with the  political will of the people of the State. If the Governor still  refuses to do it, then the Court is empowered to give it to another  appropriate official like the Secretary of State, who would then have  the authority to file the certificate of ascertainment with the  Congress of the United States and with the archivist.   So what we are trying to do is take, shall we say, an antique kind of  instrument, the electoral college, and we are trying to bring it up to  date, so it works for us in America in the 21st century. If your  objection is it is too easy for people of any party to object, I think  you totally should be supporting this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the very distinguished chairman of the Committee on  Rules, who I should say was very much with us on January 6. He was  there that night. He was the last person at the dais before we were  forced to evacuate from the Chamber.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.  [[Page H8025]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here to fortify the integrity of American  Presidential elections, the process by which the people choose their  own President. One can only regard with amazement the gentleman from  Pennsylvania's casual assurance that the American people don't care  about this. The American people don't care about solidifying the  process by which we elect our own President? The American people don't  care about whether or not a Presidential election is going to be stolen  by a lot of backroom games and manipulation of the rules? I beg to  differ. Even the Wall Street Journal today endorsed the legislation  that we are bringing forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a very distinguished member of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I just want to quickly point out the false  equivalency just invoked by the gentleman from Pennsylvania.   On the one hand, you have people of both political parties pointing  out the 100 percent documented interference of Vladimir Putin in our  2016 Presidential election, with millions and millions of dollars spent  on his so-called Internet Research Agency to engage in cyber  surveillance, cyber espionage, and cyber sabotage of our election. On  the other side, we have a violent insurrection incited by the President  of the United States, where 150 of our officers were wounded and  injured, ending up with broken arms, legs, jaws, and necks;  concussions; contusions; and traumatic brain injury.   Those are two very different things. One is an exercise of people's  First Amendment right to speak. The other is a violent effort to  overthrow the electoral process and the constitutional order of the  United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the very distinguished gentleman  from California (Mr. Garamendi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the very  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, to my dear friend from Pennsylvania, if you think that  this legislation is an attack on President Trump, you simply haven't  read the legislation because there is nothing in there attacking  President Trump. This is about reforming the Electoral Count Act so it  works for the American people.   As long as we are going to have the electoral college, we must update  it and modernize it to make it work and to make sure that the will of  the people is vindicated at every level--at the State level, with the  Governor who has to provide the certificate of ascertainment; and then,  when it comes here, we have to be able to receive it and not have the  Presidential electoral process consumed by a bunch of ideological  antics and tantrums.   My friend mobilizes a number of episodes of Democrats raising  objections in the past. Of course, I could equal each one of those with  Republicans raising objections in the past because this has become a  fine bipartisan tradition in the history of the electoral college. But  if you think it is too easy for people to get up and object, support  our legislation because we are saying you can't make an objection until  you get one-third of the House of Representatives to sign the objection  to attest to its validity and its substance.                                time  1315    Then in order for it to be validated, you need not just a third of  the House, you need a third of the Senate. You need bicameral adoption  of the objection by a third of each body before it is even heard and  then debated. So if you think that too much frivolous stuff is going  on, well, then you should be supporting our legislation.   The rest of what you are saying is just complaint about political  rhetoric, and I happen to like the political rhetoric pointing out that  Vladimir Putin is an enemy of democracy not just in Ukraine but in the  United States and all over the world. Maybe we disagree about that. I  know that there are some cheerleaders for Vladimir Putin over on that  side of the aisle.   In any event, remember this: Today, you can object for any reason at  all, and one person can get up and do it if they can find one other  person in the other Chamber, but under this legislation, under the  Presidential Election Reform Act there will be a neatly cabined set of  approved constitutional objections, all of them grounded in the text of  the Constitution:   For example, if a State purports to submit more electoral college  votes than they actually have.   For example, an elector in the Presidential election process  constitutionally cannot hold another Federal office, so if they hold  another Federal office that will be grounds for an objection.   For example, a President must be a natural-born citizen at least 35  years of age. So it would be a valid objection to claim that the  candidate that a State is purporting to cast electors for is only 26  years old.   Also, under section 3 of the 14th Amendment, Federal office holders  must not be guilty of insurrection or rebellion against the Union;  something that was insisted upon by the radical Republicans after the  Civil War. Therefore, that would be a legitimate ground for objection.   Presidents are limited to two terms in office, so that would be a  legitimate ground for objection if a State purports to cast electors  for someone who has already served two terms in office. Under Article  II, section 1, clause 4, and the 12th Amendment, electors must vote on  the same day throughout the Nation distinctly by ballot for President  and Vice President, one of whom must not be an inhabitant of the  elector's State.   In other words, we finally have provided real precision and  definiteness as to what is a valid objection. That doesn't mean the  objection is necessarily ratified bicamerally by concurrent majorities,  which is what you need in order to uphold it, but it is not a free-for- all. You can't just start finger painting on it.   To the extent that the gentleman's only substantive objection I have  heard is that in the past it has been too easy for Members of both  parties to raise objections, then you should absolutely be supporting  this legislation.   This is a thorough legislative project that reflects the common sense  and the wisdom of people who are the real experts in this field.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler  is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1372         At the end of the resolution, add the following:  [[Page H8029]]         Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6592) to require the Secretary of Homeland       Security and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to       notify the relevant Federal, State, and local officials of a       jurisdiction before placing a covered alien in such       jurisdiction, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6592.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
