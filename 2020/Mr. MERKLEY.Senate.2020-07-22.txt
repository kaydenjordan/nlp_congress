 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise tonight to ask: What does  democracy look like in America? I have here a picture of what democracy  looks like--people showing up presenting their opinions with their feet  and their voices and their signs saying: We want change. And the change  they want is to pursue the important value that public safety in  America be a value that is applied equally to all citizens; that every  single person in the community is viewed as a client for the public  safety team; that the distribution of protection is equal and the  treatment of citizens is equal, so that when public safety officers  respond, they respond equally no matter what section of the city the  call comes from; that they respond the same no matter the color of a  person's skin; that profiling is a thing of the past; that viewing two  young Black men on the street is not viewed differently than viewing  two young White men on the street. It is that goal of having everyone  treated fairly that has led so many to come out and say: We need major  reform in our country. We need to set behind us the time period when  departments of public safety tend to look at the White community and  say, ``Those are our clients,'' and look at the Black community or the  dark-skinned community and say, ``Those are the threats.'' That is what  people are trying to change by turning out in America in this fashion.   It is an important moment in which we need substantive change, real  change--real change like the bill Cory Booker put together and led the  battle on, and Kamala Harris put together with him in partnership and  led the battle on. That is the type of change we need in America. That  is why people have been turning out in the streets.   But there is an unexpected twist on something we didn't anticipate,  in which the President of the United States hasn't listened to this  message about coming together so that everyone is treated equally.  Instead, he is doubling down on a strategy of racism, a strategy of  bigotry, a strategy of creating conflict in America with a determined  new effort.   This is a picture of protesting in Oregon. I was at a demonstration  much like this, where people chanted: ``This is what democracy looks  like. This is what democracy looks like.''   This is what democracy looks like, colleagues--people coming together  with their signs and their feet and their time, saying: We need change.  It is as fundamental as free expression under the First Amendment. It  is as fundamental to our Constitution as the right to assemble. This is  as fundamental to the vision of ``We the People'' as anyone can  imagine--that vision that Lincoln summarized as ``government of the  people, by the people, for the people,'' not of, by, and for some  dictatorial force, not someone who wants to consolidate power in an  imperial Presidency.   In fact, our Founders were really worried about authoritarianism.  They were really worried about an imperial Presidency.   Once they launched that Constitution, what would happen with that  first President? Would that first President say: I am now going to  consolidate power in this young Republic, hold on to the Executive,  ignore the balance of powers between the branches of government, and  consolidate power in the Executive. I am going to take the forces that  were the Revolutionary War forces, and I am going to turn them into a  force to keep in power regardless of the constitutional requirement for  elections.   They were very worried about this. One of the reasons they  particularly liked the idea of George Washington being the first  President is that George Washington was very worried about that, and  the example he set would mean a whole lot.   It is one thing to have a Constitution on paper. It is a whole other  thing to hold onto it, to keep it. Coming out of the Constitutional  Convention, the story goes that someone asked one of the convention  policymakers: What do we have? And he replied: A republic, if we can  keep it--if we can keep it.   This is what democracy looks like right here. There is another  picture of what democracy looks like. This is the ``wall of moms'' in  Portland, OR, coming out, standing side by side, creating a barrier  between the police and the Federal forces that had been allocated to  the city by President Trump and the people, creating that barrier, that  ``wall of moms,'' to say: Do not use flashbang on us or all the people  behind us; do not use tear gas on us or all the people behind us; do  not use impact munitions, a polite name for, essentially, rubber  bullets--they say ``nonlethal bullets''--we hope, right, because  sometimes they do enormous damage--do not use your batons to knock us  down and break our bones; do not pepper spray us in the face. We are  the ``wall of moms.''   This is what democracy looks like, but this is a message lost on  President Trump. We have something entirely different from the  President. The President said: I am going to send some forces out to  Portland to basically pour gasoline on the fire and turn it into,  basically, a much more intense conflict.   So you already have the basics of a challenge in which you have had  folks from the White extremists coming in camouflage to Portland to  create trouble and looking for a fight, and you have antifa coming to  Portland to look for a fight with the White extremists, the White  nationalists.   Well, that had calmed down enormously to where there was only a small  group left, coming in late at night and causing trouble. But Trump  said: If I can recreate conflict in Portland, well, I can run a  campaign on fear. Because what we have seen, in Presidential campaign  after Presidential campaign, is a Republican candidate saying: If we  run on fear, we will win because people think of us as stronger on  national security.   Well, we have seen the different strategies. There was the Ebola run- on-fear strategy. There was the ``immigrants, rapists, and murderers  are going to run across the border and swarm America'' run-on-fear  strategy. There was the ``ISIS is going to row across the Atlantic and  invade America'' run-on-fear strategy. There was the Willie Horton  ``you are going to be attacked by a dark-skinned person in an alley''  run-on-fear strategy.   And all too often it has worked, this effort to gear up division in  America, to play on racism in America.  [[Page S4409]]    But to that strategy of division and racism I say: No way. That is  too low, too wrong for America. We should be coming together as a  country. We should have a message of coming together as a people. We  should be taking on the challenges of healthcare and housing and  education.   Those are the bills we should have here on the floor of the Senate.  We should be taking on the issue of fair labor, good-paying jobs. We  should be working on rebuilding America's infrastructure.   We should be addressing the fact that, even today in States all  across this country, you can be discriminated against for being a  member of the LGBTQ community. You can get married in the morning, and  you can proceed to be thrown out of your apartment. You can be told you  cannot eat in this restaurant, you cannot sit in this movie theater,  you cannot receive this government benefit.   The Supreme Court just took one step forward on the employment  question, strengthening the ability to not be discriminated against in  employment.   We passed a bill here in the Senate back in 2013 to do exactly that,  to strengthen protections in employment, but the Republican-controlled  House wouldn't take it up and treat LGBTQ Americans fairly.   If we were doing our job, we would have a debate on the Equality Act  that would end discrimination in all of these areas because it is the  right thing to do that no door should be slammed in the face of an  American because of who they are or whom they love. Isn't that  something we should be doing here?   Shouldn't we be taking on this challenge of carbon pollution and  climate chaos? All the fossil fuel companies have worked hard to turn  this into a partisan issue. It didn't used to be a partisan issue. Back  when President Bush--not yet President but candidate Bush ran against  candidate Dukakis, it was the Republican candidate who ran on climate  change. It was the Democrat who ran on fossil fuels.   It is not so long ago, before Citizens United, that we had so many  climate champions on both sides, but then dark money was introduced,  and the fossil fuel community said: This is our chance to control the  U.S. Senate. They put hundreds of millions--not thousands, millions--of  dollars into the Senate campaigns 6 years ago, 2014.   I remember it well because I was one of the folks they were  targeting, and I saw their strategy of taking that money and putting it  into third-party campaigns and running tremendous numbers of assault  ads, negative ads, attack ads--doing it on social media all across the  board   Since then, what happened? Well, all the voices that were on the  Republican side of the aisle saying ``We need to take on climate''  disappeared. That is the corrupting power of Citizens United and dark  money.   Then we had a bill here on the floor. We needed 60 votes, under our  policy rules, to be able to pass it to close debate. It was  disclosure--to say at least we should disclose where money comes from.  But what happened? The fossil fuel lobby said no Republican can dare to  vote for this bill if you want us to keep you in power, and every  single Member across the aisle followed their lead and voted against  disclosure.   They voted for darkness. They voted for hiding these massive  contributions coming in from who knows where because they are hidden.   My point is that this is democracy here, people expressing their  views, and here in this Chamber we should have democracy as well.   We had it almost over our entire history, of people being able to put  virtually any issue on the floor and have it debated on and then to  have it voted on and then to have voters know how their Senator voted  so there was accountability.   But no more. We are in this incredible period in which there are a  record number--low--of amendments, and the amendments we do have are  basically not very significant to begin with or they are preprogrammed  by leadership, not by each Senator having power. The idea of 100  Senators having that power--that sounds like something out of just  another world, yet that was the Senate throughout its history until  recently.   Why do I keep emphasizing this? Because this concentration of power  where bills and amendments only go through the majority leader is an  absolute fit with government by and for the powerful--the opposite of  government by and for the people.   So if someone has a bill that says you can't gouge Americans on drug  prices, they can't get that bill to the floor because it is blocked by  the majority leader, and the drug companies don't want that bill on the  floor, so they give a lot of money to that team.   If someone says we should have reasonable gun safety laws--not  violating the Second Amendment--and we will make the world a little  safer for our children, well, that bill can't get on the floor because  it is blocked by the majority leader, and it is backed by massive  spending of dark money and the NRA.   Or if we have a bill that says we should do a lot more about housing,  I can't put that bill on the floor. How about we have a banking system  that serves the cannabis industry so that we don't have huge bags of  money opened up to the possibility of organized crime moving it around  the country and doing bad things? We should extend that coverage, but  we can't get that vote on this floor--which brings me to something more  important than just basically anything I have just talked about, which  is what President Trump is doing right now: deploying secret police  across America, secret police here in America.   Now, we know that President Trump admires authoritarian leaders. He  has spoken with admiration about Duterte in the Philippines. He seems  to be in love with Erdogan in Turkey. He loves the Crown Prince in  Saudi Arabia, who assassinated an American-based journalist.   He can't find anything wrong with how Putin runs Russia, as basically  an authoritarian-style dictator. But now he is doing something beyond  just this affection: He is bringing the tactics of authoritarian  governments to the streets of the United States of America.   This is what democracy looks like, but I am going to show you some  pictures of what democracy doesn't look like--instead, what  authoritarianism looks like, what paramilitary forces look like.   So let's take an exploration of the President's strategy. Well,  first, authoritarians don't want identity about the organization on  their police uniforms, and they want the police, in functioning, to  look more like warriors in some other fight across the sea.   So you dress them in camouflage. Here are folks deployed by President  Trump in the streets of Portland. What agency do these belong to? No  shoulder patch, no identity on this front, no identity on the other  shoulder, no identity on the helmet--no identity. Who are these people?   How about these people? Are these the same group here? These are  White extremists, nationalists, who come to Portland to get in fights.  So President Trump dresses up his Federal forces to look like White  extremists on the streets of Portland.   How is there accountability if you don't know where they are from?   Who can tell me if these folks are from Customs and Border  Protection? Are they from the Federal Protective Service? Are they U.S.  Marshals? How do we know? We don't because they are deliberately not  marked.   We are told that these are actually Customs and Border Protection. I  called up the head of Customs and Border Protection, and I said: What  is the story with this tactic of secret police on the streets? He said:  Oh, no, no, no; we insist they have ``CBP'' on them. We insist they  have a unique identifier.   In fact, he put this in a tweet. He told all of America: We don't do  that. But America has pictures, and those pictures tell us there is no  ID. They are being deployed as secret operators on the streets of  Portland.   That is going to be terrifying because you don't know who they are.  Is it just someone who wants to create trouble who puts ``police'' on  their shirt? Is it one of these folks? These folks have badges on them  that look a little more official. We see an American flag here. We see  an American flag here.   Are these White extremists coming to the streets to beat people up,  or are they Federal agents? And if so, who are they, and what is their  mission? We found out their mission in short order.  [[Page S4410]]    Here we have a picture of a Navy vet. That Navy vet said he came down  to say: What does it mean to honor your oath--your oath of office, your  oath to the Constitution? He wants to know. He was a veteran who served  in our forces to defend the Constitution.   How did President Trump's secret police respond? Here is a CBP agent  with a baton right here, striking him. Here is another one with a baton  coming around to strike him again. Here is another one spraying pepper  spray into his face. This man, just standing here--his hands are  basically hooked in his pocket, like this--he is just standing here  saying: I came down here to see what people thought about honoring  their oath to the Constitution. And he is attacked. He is attacked by  multiple members of this secret force Trump puts on the streets of our  Nation.   They had not just pepper spray and not just batons; they had other  weapons, impact munitions--in this case, U.S. marshals.   Here is a young man who is holding a boom box over his head--that is  what it looked like--and he is on one side of the street. On the other  side of the street are the marshals. As he stands there in the video,  you see him crumble and fall to the ground because from across the  street, he was shot right between the eyes. Critical condition.  Fractured skull.   Who in the world would expect a Federal officer to shoot a protester,  who is either holding up a sign or a radio, between the eyes from  across the street? Do you think that is accidental? They accidentally  shot him in the head? It wasn't accidental; it was deliberate. They are  sending a message. A lot of other people got shot with these munitions.  I am told that he is no longer in critical condition. Thank goodness  for that, but it could have been very, very different. We still don't  know the ultimate outcome of this assault on a peaceful protester.   Pepper spray, using batons on veterans, shooting a peaceful protester  in the head from a few yards away--that is not all that Trump's secret  police were up to. They decided to go through the streets and grab  people and throw them into unmarked vans.   Here is one of those vans on the streets of Portland. Here are  President Trump's secret police, unmarked, throwing another protester  into a van.   One of the individuals who was treated in this fashion said he was  terrified because he thought these camouflaged folks were the White  extremists who come to make trouble, and was he being kidnapped? They  would not answer the question when they were asked ``Who are you?''  They didn't answer the question.   Secret police, unmarked, using pepper spray, batons, impact  munitions, and tear gas on peaceful protesters, and then throwing  people--grabbing them and throwing them into unmarked vans. What does  that make you think of? What country are we talking about here? Are we  talking about Syria? Are we talking about Duterte in the Philippines?  Are we talking about Erdogan in Turkey? Are we talking about the Crown  Prince in Saudi Arabia? Are we talking about Putin running Russia? We  could be talking about any of those folks, as they use these tactics,  but this is unacceptable and outrageous and unconstitutional in a  democratic republic.   President Trump coordinated this deployment of secret police and  attacks on peaceful protesters to create a big conflagration, a big  explosion of protests in Portland. The protests had died down to just  less than 100 actors and some bystanders in the late evening, and then  I am told that on the days that followed these outrageous attacks, the  protests multiplied--not one- or twofold but fivefold or more. That is  exactly what Trump wanted because he wanted to say: There is this  dissent and trouble in the streets of Portland. I am your law-and-order  President; I will take care of that trouble.   You create the trouble. You escalate the conflict so you can say ``I  am the one who can deescalate it'' later. This is a horrific strategy  that no Member of this Senate should have the slightest sympathy for--a  strongman in the Oval Office adopting the secret police tactics of the  worst dictators from around the globe.   Some of the headlines that followed were things like this:   ``Federal Law Enforcement Use Unmarked Vehicles To Grab Protesters  Off Portland Streets.''   ``A Navy vet asked federal officers in Portland to remember their  [constitutional] oaths. Then they broke his hand.'' You saw the  pictures of them striking him with the batons.   ``Federal Officers Deployed in Portland Didn't Have Proper Training,  D.H.S. memo said.'' It says: Untrained, undisciplined folks, but they  knew what the President wanted and that was to create an escalation of  violence on the streets of our city.   You are probably wondering, didn't the President call and talk to the  Governor before he decided to deploy these secret police on the streets  of Portland? No, he didn't. Didn't the DHS Secretary? No. How about the  Department of Justice? The Attorney General? No. Surely they called the  mayor and said: Before we deploy folks to patrol the streets with tear  gas and batons and impact bullets, rubber bullets, pepper spray; before  we beat up peaceful protesters and shoot them in the head, we want to  talk to you, Mayor, about what is going on. Did the President call? Did  the Secretary call, the Secretary of Homeland Security? Did the  Secretary or the Attorney General call? Did the head of Customs and  Border Protection, CBP, call before they sent in their special  operating group? Did the Marshals' lead director, commissioner call?  The answer is no, no, no, no, and no. None of them called because they  weren't coming to coordinate, to help; they were coming to disrupt.  They knew that if they asked to come, asked whether they were wanted,  the answer would be no, you are not wanted because you are coming to  inflame the violence and disruption   The President was giving speeches, saying ``Look at what a wonderful  President I am because I am sending help to quell violence in  Portland'' while he was sending secret police to create violence. This  has to be one of the bigger lies he has told in his time as President.  By various accounts, he tells a number of them every single day. But  this lie to the American people is not just a little white lie; this is  not just a little misrepresentation; this is something of  constitutional input about who we are as a country. We don't do secret  police in our country. We don't grab people off the streets and terrify  them and throw them in unmarked vans in our country--at least not until  now.   You see, the President has looked at the polls that say we are not  very happy. Americans are not very happy with the way you have executed  the Presidency. We are certainly not very happy with the way you have  managed this really big crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. When there is a  crisis, you start to see someone--can they rise to the occasion? Can  they bring forth the best in people? Can they facilitate cooperation?  Can they mobilize resources? Can they make the case in an effective and  persuasive fashion?   The American people have seen that President Trump could not rise to  the occasion. He could not bring himself to bring people together. He  could not make the case for a national strategy on how to tackle the  coronavirus. He could not mobilize resources to address it in a timely  fashion. Millions more are going to get sick as a result of his  incompetence, and tens of thousands more will die because of the  incompetence of President Trump.   What is a President running for reelection to do when his  incompetence is revealed in its complete and total clarity to the  Nation? You create a war. That is what you do. You create a war because  a war might rally people to your side when we are being attacked. But  in this case, the President couldn't come up with an overseas war.  ISIS? Too weak. The scary Ebola? Too long ago. North Korea? A  completely failed strategy by the President of expressing his love for  yet another dictator and that love not being returned in any effective  policy changes. So what is left? Immigration. Oh, wait--he already  played the rapist and murderers at the border card. He already offended  people throughout our Nation by snuffing out the lamp of Lady Liberty.  What is left? You have to create a war inside the United States.   First came Washington, DC. He tried out the secret police strategy by  deploying forces onto the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, unmarked, and  nobody knew who the hell they were. Who  [[Page S4411]]  are these people who are on the Lincoln Memorial? Are they far-right  extremists carrying guns? Are they Customs and Border Protection? Are  they U.S. Marshals? Who are these people? Nobody knew. They were secret  police at the Lincoln Monument.    And then he decided to test the strategy of using weapons against  peaceful protesters across from the White House. There they are  gathered together. There is this great tradition in America. If you  want to protest where the President can see you, you go to L'Enfant  Plaza and you look up at the second story and you hold up your protest  sign and you scream your position on something that you consider very  important for America--the change you want to see or the man you object  to. The President and his family look out those windows and say: I sure  hate seeing those protesters.   But that is symbolic of the right to assemble and the freedom of  speech in our beautiful Nation under our extraordinary Constitution.  What did President Trump do? Well, he walled off L'Enfant Plaza across  from the White House so people couldn't protest there. That is what  this President thinks of protesters. He sees them as a threat to him.  He doesn't like freedom of assembly, and he doesn't like freedom of  speech, but what he does like is a good photo opportunity.   So the President decides to get the team together and we will go over  and I will stand on the steps of the church and hold up a Bible. I  still am a little confounded about what his message was to do that. The  thing is, to get to the steps of the church, he would have to come near  these protesters he hates because he hates protesters. He doesn't like  Americans calling for change or criticizing his policies.   I am thinking back about this ``wall of moms'' that I showed you  earlier--these moms coming down, forming a line, and saying: Don't tear  gas us. Don't do shock grenades. Don't shoot us with rubber bullets.  Don't pepper spray us.   And yet his forces did all those things.   Where did he try this out first? He tried it in that area behind  L'Enfant Plaza where the church steps were. His forces went out and  attacked those protesters. Nobody saw violence of any kind. This had  nothing to do with quelling a riot. This had to do with one simple  thing: The President hates protests and wanted to show what a strong  man he is, like those dictators he admires all across the planet--like  the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, like Duterte with his extrajudicial  executions in the Philippines, like Putin, whom he just can't say  enough good things about who suppresses the civil rights of the Russian  people. He wanted to show how strong he was so he sent his team out to  tear gas, use impact munitions, rubber bullets on the protesters so he  could stand at the church with a Bible.   I am still wondering what passage in the Bible he was there to talk  about. You can think for yourselves. You can imagine. You can ask  yourselves: What did the President want to say with the Good Book in  his hand? Did he want to say this book talks about turning the other  cheek, and I will show how much I admire that principle of turning the  other cheek by coming out and telling my team to tear gas and shoot  peaceful protesters? Is that what the President wanted to do, kind of  somehow demonstrate support for turning the other cheek by having his  team gas and shoot people in that area close to L'Enfant Plaza, close  to the steps of the church, or did the President want to come out and  say: This Good Book talks about beating swords into plowshares, and I  want to come out and show just how I believe in the principle of  beating swords into plowshares by having my team gas people and baton  people and do these explosive flashbang grenades. Is that what the  President was trying to do?   What message in the Bible was he trying to convey? Was he trying to  convey the message that Jesus Christ talked about time and time and  time again of helping the poor and the destitute, and he thought it was  such an important message to carry to the United States that he would  use force, tear gas, rubber bullets to clear the path so he could talk  about how important it was to help the destitute and the poor in  America and how his policies might help them? No. We don't know. I  don't think the President knew. He has never indicated that he is  actually familiar with the contents of that book he was holding up,  which makes it a particularly bizarre photo op.   But this was his first trial run of this strategy of using weapons  against peaceful protesters, of using unmarked uniforms on the steps of  the Lincoln Memorial. He loved it so much. He loved that sense that he  was so strong because he could clear the path with his Presidential  team so he could get to those steps. He was such an awesome man, such  an incredible President showing strength by attacking peaceful  protesters so he could have his photo on. It filled him with such  energy, he thought: Let's try this out elsewhere in the country--so he  comes to Portland.   He comes to Portland, and he proceeds to say: Let's use that secret  police strategy again, unmarked. Let's use those batons and pepper  spray again against a peaceful protester. Let's use those impact  munitions again against someone holding up a sign, shooting them from  across the street, giving them a fractured skull and putting them in  critical condition and into the hospital. Let's take it and even  amplify it a little bit and put them into unmarked vans and sweep them  away. This is what we have with the Trump secret police strategy.    As he did these things, he went out on the campaign stump and said:  Look what a mighty leader I am attacking these peaceful people with  these weapons. I did it to the protesters in Washington, DC, and I did  it to the protesters in Portland, OR, and now I am going to take my  strategy of attacking protesters and spread it all across America.   What does he talk about? He says: I want to take this strategy to  Baltimore. He says: I want to take this strategy to Philadelphia. He  says: I want to take this strategy to New York. And then he said: I  want to take it to Chicago and I want to take it to Detroit and I want  to take it to Oakland, CA. What do those things have in common? And  then he says: They are led by Democrats. I will take my strategy of  inciting violence with secret police, unmarked van abductions, use of  pepper spray, batons, and flashbangs--the whole arsenal--and I will  take it to all these cities where there are Democratic mayors. Then I  will say: Look at me. I am a law-and-order President, and I can quell  all that trouble I created across this country.   You are probably thinking I made up this list of cities that the  President talked about. Surely, the President wouldn't take this  incredibly horrendous secret police strategy and express that he wanted  to take it on a trial run all across America so he could create  violence in Democratic cities, but in his own words:         Who's next? New York and Chicago and Philadelphia and       Detroit and Baltimore and all of these--Oakland is a mess.    And he framed it as going to quell violence, but, instead, the  strategy produces violence. It enflames. It accentuates. It outrages.  It creates conflict.   I have here an article, and it is from FOX 32 News in Chicago:  ``Lightfoot confirms federal agents will help manage Chicago  violence.'' Chicago has a Democratic mayor. Let's go create trouble  there.         Mayor Lori Lightfoot had a different tone Tuesday regarding       President Donald Trump's decision to send agents to Chicago.       ``I'm hopeful that they will not be foolish enough to bring       that kind of nonsense to Chicago,'' the mayor said.    Well, what did she mean by ``nonsense''? It is the polite word for  attacking peaceful protesters with batons and flashbangs and tear gas.   I am certainly not saying that Portland didn't have some tensions.  The extremist groups on the right have made a favorite trip out of  coming to Portland to cause trouble and the anti-fascists have  responded in kind, and that is what the local team has to manage and  deescalate. They have succeeded in deescalating it to where it was a  small group late at night. And then Trump came in and blew it all into  a big crisis once again.   When I said that this is coordinated with his campaign, campaign ads  went up. His strategy of creating chaos in America, then campaigning on  it couldn't be more transparent.         As President Trump deploys Federal agents to Portland,       Ore., and threatens to  [[Page S4412]]       dispatch to other cities, his re-election campaign is       spending millions of dollars on ominous television ads that       promote fear. . . . The influx of agents in Portland has led       to scenes of confrontations and chaos that Mr. Trump and his       aides have pointed to as they try to burnish a false       narrative about Democratic elected officials allowing       dangerous protesters to create widespread bedlam.        The Trump campaign is driving home that message with a new       ad that tries to tie its dark portrayal of Democratic-led       cities.    There it is--campaign ads to fit his dark portrayal of Democratic-led  cities.   The idea that not only would the President bring those secret police  tactics to America--to our streets--he would deploy them in his effort  to create conflict so he can win reelection, so he can have something  that scares the American people. Don't we have enough to be worried  about already? Don't we have a pandemic to manage?   A number of us worked to say: Mr. President, you need to have a  national strategy on producing protective equipment to help stop the  spread of this contagion. Mr. President, that should probably include  taking available factories and putting them to work making protective  equipment and distributing it quickly. The President said, no, he's not  doing it. He is not activating the Defense Production Act to have a  national strategy to stop the spread of this disease.   I have two healthcare workers in my family. My son works in a  doctor's office recording the computer code on the symptoms and so  forth. He is a medical scribe. My wife goes house to house visiting  folks who are in hospice. They are in the final chapter of their life,  and she coaches them and their family on care and support during this  final chapter of our journey here on this planet. A number of the  people she sees are very high risk because they are fragile and sick in  that final chapter, so they would be very affected if this disease were  introduced. Some of them have the disease.   She has to be very careful that she doesn't pick it up and bring it  home to my elderly mother who lives in our house. My elderly mother is  in her nineties. She probably wouldn't want me to call her elderly in  her nineties, but she is fragile, and she would be affected. My son  doesn't want to bring it home or spread it. Both of them had trouble  getting the protective equipment they needed early in this pandemic  because we didn't have a national strategy. Trump failed the leadership  test.    How about another critical piece of this, which is testing?   We needed to crank up all of the biological manufacturing capacity of  America to produce the reagents so that people could be tested and get  the results within hours or a day so that, if they were infected, even  if they were asymptomatic--they didn't have the disease symptoms, but  they had the disease, and they could spread it--that they would be  quarantined, but the President said no.   So we put into the bill a requirement for the President to produce a  national test strategy and produce a report with his test strategy.  What did it read? It read our test strategy--our national strategy--was  to leave it to the States. What kind of leadership is that to have no  strategy on producing the reagents or the tests and getting them around  the country?   One thing we have done here is we have funded a lot of money to help  communities buy tests because they are expensive. We said they should  be free to the victims--to the people who are getting tested, that is.  Every health expert has said you have to crank up this testing so that  there is no wait time. It doesn't help to get the results 7 or 10 days  later.   I have been holding townhalls. I hold one in every county every year  in Oregon, 36 counties. This year, I only got 21 in before the  coronavirus made it impossible to hold them in person, but I have been  holding them digitally, electronically. I keep hearing the report from  the county health agents that now testing has increased to its taking 7  days to get a response, 9 days to get a response, 11 days to get a  response. Why is that? It is because we didn't have any national  strategy for producing tests. As the disease flares up and grows in  magnitude in the Southern States, more and more resources are getting  diverted to those Southern States. So there are not the testing  supplies because there is no national strategy.   Then the experts said: Well, you should have a contact tracing  strategy, so, when people test positive, you can immediately find out  who they have been in touch with so those people get immediately  quarantined before they can pass it on to other people.   Yet that doesn't work if you can't get test results quickly, and it  doesn't work if you don't have contact tracers. A number of us have  worked to provide funding for contact tracers. Elizabeth Warren and I  have introduced a bill that calls for 100,000 contact tracers across  this country. There is $75 billion in the House's bill for testing and  tracing across the country.   How did President Trump respond this last week? President Trump said:  I don't want any money for testing in this bill--no money for testing.  He wants this stripped out; yet it is an essential element for  controlling the coronavirus.   I don't think he will win on that one. I think the Members of this  Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, care enough about their  constituents that they want to help with testing and contact tracing,  but the President wants the testing stripped out.   Why does he want it stripped out? It is because, if you test more  people, then you get more positives, and if you get more positives, it  doesn't look good. So he is choosing to have things look good rather  than to contain the coronavirus.   If you proceed to offend people across the country by failing in  leadership on protective equipment and failing in leadership on testing  and failing in leadership on contact tracing, you need another plan,  and we have the plan.   The President has made it clear he will test out his secret police  and attacks on peaceful protesters in DC, magnify that experiment in  Portland, and see if it creates more chaos. If it does, he will deploy  that effort across the Nation. That is President Trump's plan, and it  is as wrong as anything could be. Secret policing has no place in the  United States of America.   I introduced a simple amendment to the Defense Authorization Act,  which deals with security powers and things like Customs and Border  Protection and deals with things like U.S. Marshals, and I said we are  on that right now on the floor of the Senate. Let's have this debate  about secret policing, and let's just ask a few simple things.   First, when the President sends agents anywhere in the country, they  have to carry identification about who they work for. It is not that  big of a request, and it is not expensive. Instead of putting a generic  ``police'' or no marking at all, you put ``CBP,'' or you put ``U.S.  Marshals,'' or you put ``Federal Protective Service'' or one of a dozen  other Federal police units that play different roles. That way, the  American people will know who they are. Then you put unique identifiers  on them so that, if they do something terrible, like walk up and shoot  a protester in the head, you would know who had done it. You could find  out.   Now, some of my friends have said: Well, we are not sure we want to  require names to be on the uniforms because there have been some cases  in which people have been so outraged that they have harassed the  families of the police officers or of these Federal agents. We don't  want that. OK. A number would work that could be used to identify  someone after an egregious act but would protect the families of our  Federal agents who are doing a good job. That is pretty simple. Have an  ID as to what agency you belong to and a unique identifier. You are no  longer secret.   Then you can't be deployed on some expanded mission of sweeping the  streets. Your legitimate mission should be to protect a Federal  monument or a Federal building, and you have to be at that Federal  building or in the near vicinity of it or of the monument. That is  pretty simple. If you want a broader mission, you have to coordinate  with the mayor and the Governor and get their permission   It is pretty straightforward. Have a patch with the agency, a unique  identifier, and pursue your mission in the near vicinity of the Federal  property.   What else?   The President would have to tell the people of America how many  people he is sending, from what agencies, and to what city for a little  bit of transparency. That is it.  [[Page S4413]]    This amendment that I am proposing to stop secret policing is simple;  yet my colleagues are blocking it from being considered in this bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in a moment, I will again ask for this  important issue of deployment of secret police to be debated and voted  on, on this floor. That is what the U.S. Senate is for, to address the  issues facing Americans, but I didn't want to ask until my colleague  was here to respond from the Republican Caucus. When he is ready, I  will make that motion.   I make this motion to send a couple of different messages. One, most  importantly, is that secret policing has no place in America, and all  Americans must stand arm in arm and say no. The second is, when there  is an important issue like this, this is the Chamber in which it should  be debated and voted on so we can hear the conflicting views.   There may be clauses in the amendment that I will propose that people  won't like, insight that they can provide, or modifications that they  would like to propose to my amendment, but it can't happen unless this  amendment is considered on the floor.   That is why, notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent to  call up my amendment to stop secret policing in America, amendment No.  2457, an amendment to limit Federal law enforcement officers for crowd  control; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided between  opponents and proponents; and that upon the use or yielding back of  time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment with no intervening  action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    And I would invite my colleague to stay if he would like  to and yield to him if he wants to jump into the conversation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes.    Mr. President, my colleague has said that the facts I  have presented tonight are a fabrication, to use his exact word. He has  called it a breach of protocol. He has called it a violation of common  decency.   I think we are here as a Chamber to address difficult, important  issues in America. This is a difficult and important mission.   This is a new use of force in a manner that doesn't belong in the  streets of America. It is important that we debate it.   I would be happy to have it be a standalone bill, come up right after  this National Defense Authorization Act, and have it debated for 2  hours and voted on, because then we actually have a conversation and we  have to take a position, and our constituents can see where we stand,  and folks could propose an amendment to it if they didn't like the way  I have written it. It is so simple. It says: Do what we have always  done. Put ID about where you come from. Have a unique identifier. And  don't go sweeping through the streets if your mission is to protect a  Federal property. Stay at that Federal property or work with the  Governor or the mayor if you have a broader effort.   Those are reasonable things.   I don't think that it was a breach of protocol to ask this Chamber to  consider that on this bill because there is a connection. We are  talking about a bill that involves the use of force and how we govern  in America.   I don't think it is a violation of common decency. My colleague does,  and I would prefer that we actually have that conversation about the  facts and about the arguments, about the simple solution I proposed  when we can actually take a vote or other people can offer amendments  to it and modify it. That is this Chamber doing what it should be  doing.   So I am disappointed that my colleague is blocking this from being  considered before this body.   I do love this body, and I first came here when amendments were  freely--    Thank you, Mr. President.
