 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the last 10 days, I have  conducted  [[Page S3819]]  emergency field hearings, giving my constituents in Connecticut an  opportunity to be heard, a chance for their voices and faces to be part  of considering the Republican healthcare or really, more accurately,  wealth care bill. Indeed, that label or characterization of the bill  came from one my constituents who said: This plan is not healthcare, it  is wealth care because it produces a massive transfer of wealth from  the poor and middle-class Americans, whose healthcare would be deeply  harmed, to the richest Americans, who would enjoy the benefits of  hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts.   That kind of voice and criticism deserves to be heard here. Yet my  Republican colleagues and their leadership have gone from total secrecy  to total chaos. They are in chaos because they have refused to heed the  voices and faces of ordinary, average working people--middle-class  people, the most vulnerable people--who would be deeply harmed by this  proposal.   One woman at one of my hearings in Connecticut, knowing what would  happen under this bill, said to me:         Do the right thing. Save the Affordable Care Act and save       our lives.    She was not exaggerating when she said lives are at stake. She is  right. This very eloquent woman, Amy Etkind, knows all too well what  this bill means for Americans like her, and the man she described,  literally, as the ``love of her life.'' She told me about him during a  hearing in New Haven Friday afternoon--about how he has struggled with  addiction, mental health issues, and now diabetes. He is alive today  because of Medicaid, and he has access to the services he needs. As she  said, ``If Medicaid were to go away, he would be literally dead in a  very short period of time.''   When we say the Republican plan would cost lives--it would kill  people--it is no hyperbole, no exaggeration. It is plain, simple fact.  As Ronald Reagan said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' The fact is, this  bill would cost the State of Connecticut nearly $3 billion in Federal  funding over the next 10 years. These cuts, mainly to Medicaid, cannot  and will not be replaced, as the CBO has predicted. It would leave  States like Connecticut in an impossible position: either raise taxes  to pay the difference or cut Medicaid enrollment to insurers, putting  people like Amy's husband at risk, literally, of death; putting out on  the streets the senior citizens living in the Monsignor Bojnowski Manor  in New Britain, where they are enjoying great care--a high-quality  environment because of Medicaid. Many of them are middle-class folks  who worked hard, played by the rules, and exhausted their savings. They  are vulnerable now because of the cost of healthcare and their care, in  particular. The focus ought to be on them, on the people who are  affected, not so much the numbers, but we know from the numbers that  the Republican plan would disastrously raise premiums by 20 percent and  would cut enrollment impact on the individual market--premiums and  enrollment, apart from Medicaid, on the individual market. These  numbers are from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They are  fact. Facts are stubborn things.   We know also what the effects would be--what the numbers are for  people who are middle income. The elimination of the tax credits for  middle-income people paying their premiums would be nothing short of  disastrous.   We focused on Medicaid. I talked to you about Amy and the love of her  life and what the effects would be of the decimation of Medicaid, but  here we are talking about the elimination of tax breaks that help  middle-income people. I don't need to explain this graph. For someone  with $26,500 in income, their premiums under the Senate plan would jump  to $6,500 from the present $1,700. For somebody earning in the  midfifties, the jump is even greater, and it is true even for people  who are earning $68,200. They will have to pay more, a larger share of  their income, and receive less. It is not only that the Senate plan is  disastrous because it is more costly, it is also going to impact the  quality of care by reducing the standards; eliminating the strict  requirements on preexisting conditions, the protections on annual and  lifetime caps for coverage, defunding Planned Parenthood, continuing  the war on women's healthcare. The long and short of it is that this  measure is bad for America.   Tia spoke to me at these hearings about the opioid epidemic. If there  is one example that breaks our hearts and wrenches our guts, it is the  effect on people who are trying to recover from opioid addiction and  abuse. Their recovery would be shredded--maybe stopped--by gutting  Medicaid coverage.    Another woman who spoke at my hearing, Donna Sager, called herself  ``the perfect example as to why our healthcare plans must include  preexisting conditions and not punish people like me with high  premiums.'' Donna, as she told me, is 63 years old and not yet eligible  for Medicare. When she was 36, she was diagnosed with a rare form of  hereditary colon cancer. For 27 years she has been undergoing major  surgeries, constant screening, doctor visits to make sure she can  remain as healthy as possible. Then she told me about her husband, a  man in his seventies, and she said this:         He would like to retire, but how can he with all my medical       expenses? I am frightened what I will do if the Republican       healthcare bill gets passed. Changes to preexisting coverage       will be extremely damaging to me, how will I pay these costs       and high premiums? The republican healthcare plan wants to       punish me for having cancer.    She closed by saying:         It is as though Washington wants to punish me again for       having cancer and being older. . . . I never would have       expected that the greatest country in the world would treat       me like this.    There is a path forward, and it requires our Republican colleagues  very simply to start over, to work with Democrats, to abandon this  misguided, myopic effort to repeal, repeal, repeal. That mantra simply  is not a policy for American healthcare.   What is needed is to build on the Affordable Care Act, to improve it,  to correct its defects. We can do it if we work together and if we  focus on the rising costs of medical care and try to bring them down,  if we focus on the regulatory barriers to entering insurance markets  and seek to eliminate them, if we focus on the FDA drug approval  process and seek to responsibly and safely expedite new drugs coming to  market, if we enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices as the VA does.  Those examples of improving the present system are doable. They require  leadership, which has been lacking and most particularly lacking at the  White House.   Yesterday, we saw a picture that is worth a thousand words: the  President of the United States sitting with Members of this body, but  only Members of this body from the other side of the aisle--only  Republican Senators. It was almost the entire membership on the  Republican side. Not a single Democrat was invited, not a single  Democrat consulted, not a single Democrat involved in the continuing  process now of producing yet another plan behind closed doors in  secrecy.   The majority leader announced it just today. The effort is to have  another version to be submitted to the CBO by Friday, but that process  simply continues the present fatal flaw in my Republican colleagues'  thinking, which is that they can do it with only one party. I want to  give credit to our Republican colleagues who had the courage and  strength to say no because they saw it was bad for America.   In closing, I want to say that my Republican colleagues will be going  home this weekend. They have been looking at themselves in the mirror,  at their consciences, and they have been seeing something they don't  like--a moral failing in this bill, not just a political failing or a  policy defect but a real moral failing.   Healthcare is a right, and even if my Republican colleagues disagree  on that point, they have to recognize that taking away healthcare,  decimating Medicaid, waging war on women's health, depriving children  of the preventive care they need so they can go to school and learn  properly, evicting seniors from nursing homes, putting the burden of  billions of dollars on my State of Connecticut and every State  represented in this body, and other grotesque, cruel, costly impacts of  this bill are the wrong ways to go. They know that when they look in  the mirror, but they will know it even more powerfully when they look  in the eyes of their constituents this week--if they have the guts and  courage and heart to do so.  [[Page S3820]]    This wealth care plan is doomed to failure. Even if it passes, it is  doomed to fail America. It is a moral failing, not just a policy  failing. The health of our consciences, as well as our physical well- being, hangs in the balance.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
