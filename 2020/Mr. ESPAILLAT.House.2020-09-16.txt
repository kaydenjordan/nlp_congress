 Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of a great lady,  Normandia Maldonado, an icon in Dominican culture, and my bill, H.R.  3870, which renames the post office located at 511 West 165th Street in  Washington Heights, New York, in her name. The bill passed unanimously  on this floor.   Maldonado is renowned for her decades of artistic leadership within  the Dominican diaspora in New York City. She founded Club Civico y  Cultural Juan Pablo Duarte and Centro Cultural Ballet Quisqueya, as  well as helped establish the first Dominican parade in New York City.   In the wake of the administration's unprecedented attacks on the  Postal Service, I am honored to enshrine Ms. Maldonado's altruistic  spirit, fortitude, commitment, and community service with this  designation. She was the queen of merengue, the queen of dance and  folklore.                            ____________________
