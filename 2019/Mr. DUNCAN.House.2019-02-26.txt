 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, as the former chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's  Caucus and an avid outdoorsman, I rise today in support of S. 47, the  Natural Resources Management Act.   But let's be clear. Where does most of the funding come from to fund  the Land and Water Conservation Fund? The Land and Water Conservation  Fund is overwhelmingly funded by royalties from offshore oil and gas  leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. It is funded mostly from money  energy companies that produce fossil fuels pay the Federal Government.   Even though we are going to overwhelmingly, even with bipartisan  support, permanently reauthorize a program that has enjoyed success  since 1964, it will remain in jeopardy. Why? Because many of the  Democrats supporting this have also supported this asinine, illogical,  and scientifically unfounded proposal called the Green New Deal. A  shift under the Green New Deal away from oil and gas to complete  dependence on renewables, and you can kiss this fund good-bye.   How will they propose to pay for the Land and Water Conversation  Fund? I can assure you it won't be from royalties generated by  renewable energy. It will be from higher taxes.   I support energy exploration. I support conservation and this bill  with as little cost to the American taxpayer. That is why I rise in  support, but I implore everyone to think about how counterproductive  the Green New Deal really is in actually conserving our precious  environment.   It is time we hold the Green New Deal's supporters accountable to the  lack of logic and science behind their proposals that have been  estimated to cost up to $93 trillion.
