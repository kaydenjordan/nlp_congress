 Madam Speaker, I thank my  incredible colleague from California, Congressman Aguilar. This is a  really personal issue to so many Members not only in this Chamber, but  in our neighboring Chamber, the U.S. Senate: the notion that, after  more than 6 months of bipartisan, bicameral efforts, this body cannot  hold an effort to have just a debate in an environment where we clearly  have the will of the entire body focused on the will of our  constituents in this Nation to find a permanent solution for Dreamers,  who, as my colleague so artfully stated, have no other country than  this one as their own and the fact that that effort will not be  undertaken because the leadership of this House refuses to do its job  by allowing us the opportunity to debate bills and to share ideas and  to move forward on pieces of legislation that truly make a difference  in the lives of our constituents and the lives of Americans in every  single community.   It is days like this I really appreciate that I have colleagues who  keep their hope and their faith, and they have got my commitment to do  the same.   But the nicest thing I can say is that it is really unfortunate that  we find ourselves here at nearly 9:30 p.m. because we don't have the  courage of Members to stay the course and do what is right,  particularly now in an environment where instead of moving forward on  the issues where more of us agree than not, in fact, we are seeing even  more draconian, anti-American, probably, unconstitutional efforts at  preventing asylum and refuge to others around the world, which is our  constitutional basis in this country. And this was an opportunity to  not only begin to deal with these issues, but to do what is right for  these young people.   For those folks who are watching us tonight in this situation, I want  to highlight who they are again.   In New Mexico, and, in fact, in my district, which is Albuquerque,  New Mexico, the teacher of the year is a Dreamer. In a country where  20,000 educators are Dreamers, in a State where 5,000 young men and  women are doctors, engineers, lawyers, educators, nurses,  entrepreneurs, long-term care caregivers, providing the very supportive  work for which this country has a serious shortage, because they are so  committed to their communities and their families that they are taking  on the challenges that too many of us are unwilling to do, yet this  body, this Chamber refusing to allow the majority to take an action  that would provide those young people with a protected, positive,  productive future, the same thing that they have done for our  communities, all of our communities, I find incredibly disheartening  tonight.   But I, too, want to add my voice that I will continue to fight and  work to find whatever pathways for a solution make the most sense in a  body that makes no sense, particularly now.   I thank my colleague and my Republican colleagues who had the courage  to work to force the debate when leadership refused to provide that  avenue, who had the courage to force the debate when leadership did not  hold their commitments to meet with members of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, including myself, who failed to hold meetings so that  we could work on ideas and strategies before getting to this point, who  failed to provide any meaningful legislative idea, effort, text, any  legislative solutions or strategy.   I want to thank Members like my colleague from California, and,  actually, I assume that my colleague from California will yield to our  colleague from Texas.   There are so many Members of this body who worked so incredibly hard  to do, finally, the work that we were elected to do. I certainly want  to give them my gratitude and my commitment that I will continue to do  everything in my power to force this Chamber to do the job that we were  all elected to do.
