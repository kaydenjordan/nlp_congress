 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a family  and a school community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is working  to keep the legacy alive for a young person taken too soon.   In 1998, Jason Rubin, then a 13-year-old student at Cecelia Snyder  Middle School in Bensalem, tragically succumbed to a bacterial  infection. Jason was a popular kid who loved sports and played on the  school's basketball team.   Shortly after Jason's passing, his parents, Richard and Gail, set up  a memorial fund in his honor. The fund assists our community in various  capacities, including through scholarships for Bensalem High School  students.   This year, the family wanted to do something different and special.  Realizing Cecelia Snyder's scoreboard was outdated, the Rubin family  dedicated a new scoreboard in memory of Jason D. Rubin, a fitting  tribute for their basketball-loving son. A dedication ceremony with the  Rubin family present was held last week.   Madam Speaker, we applaud the service of the Rubin family and members  of the Cecelia Snyder school and their community, and we are all so  proud to see Jason memorialized in such a meaningful way.                           Honoring Grace Godshalk     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of a woman who lived a life defined by service, faith, and  compassion.   Grace Godshalk passed away on December 15 at the age of 81. Born in  Queens, New York, Grace moved to Bucks County in 1965, settling in  Lower Makefield Township. Grace soon became a beloved member of our  community and began devoting her time and her energy to local causes.   Later, in 1977, Grace became the first woman elected to the Lower  Makefield Township Board of Supervisors. She served honorably for 30  years, retiring in 2008, and, during her tenure, developed a reputation  as a staunch supporter of open space initiatives, actively involved in  the preservation of the Five Mile Woods Nature Preserve and the  Patterson Farm.   Grace never lost her strength or her composure.   After her son, Bill, passed away in the terror attacks of 9/11, Grace  played a pivotal role in the dedication of the Garden of Reflection to  memorialize 9/11 victims.   Madam Speaker, our entire community sends our love to her daughter,  Jane, and to her grandchildren. Grace is now reunited with her husband,  James, and her legacy in our community will endure forever.                            Recognizing Jay Smith     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a native of  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and a community that has rallied around him  in support.   Jay Smith graduated from Central Bucks West and was diagnosed with  ALS in 2014. This month, a jazz concert, dubbed ``Jazz for Jay,'' will  be held to help Jay and his family pay for medical expenses.   Jay is a writer and an inventor, a husband to Melissa, and a father  to Loghan and Peyton. Despite his declining health, he currently serves  on the board of directors of a foundation, Every 90 Minutes, which  serves to promote research for a cure for ALS.   While he currently lives in Texas, his ties to Bucks County run deep,  and our community is proud to support him in this fight.   Madam Speaker, here in Congress, we must all do our part to ensure  that our medical research community has the resources needed to fight  and find a cure for ALS.   I would also like to thank those participating in the Jazz for Jay  ceremony and activities, and the Smith family for their advocacy.                            ____________________
