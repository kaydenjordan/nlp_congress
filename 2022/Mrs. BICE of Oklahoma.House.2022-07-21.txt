 Madam Speaker, I am offended that the other  side of the aisle would make false accusations about Republicans'  positions on contraception. This is fearmongering of the highest  degree.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8373, the so-called Right to  Contraception Act. This problematic legislation reinforces the left's  pro-abortion agenda by utilizing an overly broad definition of  contraception that includes pregnancy-terminating abortion drugs.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would incorrectly have  the American people believe that Republicans don't care about women's  access to contraception. This is false. In fact, a report released just  this week by the Independent Women's Voice demonstrated that 84 percent  of Republican primary voters support safe access to contraceptives.   I am pro-life, and I support a woman's right to access contraception.  That is why I introduced H.R. 8421, the Access to Safe Contraception  Act, which would preempt States from establishing a ban on  contraceptives while still respecting pro-life values. My legislation  would safeguard access to contraception for Americans, including my two  daughters, and importantly, does not protect the use of pregnancy- ending medications, such as chemical abortion pills.   I am also concerned that the bill we are considering today could  endanger women by allowing the use of products or methods that are not  FDA-approved.   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues that we should reject this bill  and instead bring up legislation to protect access to contraception in  a way that respects the pro-life values of millions of Americans.
