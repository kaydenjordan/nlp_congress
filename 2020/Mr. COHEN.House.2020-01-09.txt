 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the President's most  recent reckless actions. The killing of General Soleimani was a  provocation to war that made Americans less safe for years and maybe  decades to come.   The President has put his own ego over the strategic interests and  safety  [[Page H112]]  of Americans. What he has accomplished with these actions is to make  Soleimani a martyr for a generation of militant Middle Eastern foes  that we have.   It has united the Iranian people, not against their government, but  against us.    Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of the President and  Congress to keep us safe, and the Founding Fathers knew that the  collective wisdom of the people's Representatives was better at doing  that than one person.   I just visited the SCIF and there is still not any report on any  imminent danger claim that might have been made. The American people  and Congress deserve to know what the threat allegedly was, given the  inevitability of Iranian retaliation.   The two greatest powers Congress has are impeachment and declarations  of war. We are here today on both of those issues because of a  reckless, lawless, and impetuous President.
