 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of En  Bloc No. 2, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science,  Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General  Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,  Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.   I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including  several amendments in the Rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 30, included in En Bloc No. 2, reduces  funding for Operations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $5 million and  increases funding for Defense Health Care for PTSD by $5 million.   My amendment increases funding for PTSD by $5,000,000.   These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard  to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in  underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature wound  suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, and  far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.   For those of us whose daily existence is not spent in harm's way, it  is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen  and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see  daily.   In an instant, a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can  obliterate your best friend right in front of your face. Yet, you are  trained and expected to continue with the mission, and you do, even  though you may not have even reached your 20th birthday.   But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the  stress and trauma of battle is over, and you are alone with your  thoughts and memories.   And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the  enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   We can now add COVID-19 with the stress of watching the American  people fight off a foe they cannot confront and defeat.   We must address PTSD in all its forms so that it can be defeated.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31, included in En Bloc No. 2, reduces  funding for Operations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $10 million and  increases funding for Defense Health Care for Triple Negative Breast  Cancer (TNBC) by $10 million.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31 reduces funding for Operations and  Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $10 million and increases funding for  Defense Health Care for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) by $10  million.   My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's  research and development by $10 million. These funds will address the  question of breast cancer in the United States military.   The American Cancer Society calls several strains of breast cancer as  a particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates;  in this instance, it's a triple negative. But I raise an article that  says: ``Fighting a Different Battle; Breast Cancer and the Military.''   The American Cancer Society reports the following 5-year survival  rates for breast cancer:   stage 0 to 1--near 100 percent survival rate;   stage 2--about 93 percent survival rate;   stage 3--72 percent survival rate; and   stage 4 (metastatic)--22 percent survival rate.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer is more aggressive than other types of  breast cancer.   Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely  to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after  treatment.   The risk appears to be greatest in the first few years after  treatment.  [[Page H4136]]    For example, a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in  2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher  risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast--but only for the  first 3 years.   In 2013, the American Cancer Society Surveillance and Health Services  Institute estimated that 27,060 black women would be diagnosed with the  illness.   The rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in African American  women than white women--it is the type of breast cancer (Triple  Negative) that African American women contract that is alarming.   Because African American women are diagnosed in greater numbers with  Triple Negative Breast Cancer, we have a five-year survival rate of 78  percent after diagnosis as compared to 90 perent for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer:   Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancer  in the United States;   onset is at a younger age;   is more aggressive; and   is more likely to metastasize.   Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than White women.   African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16  percent in non-African-American women.   Funding to support women serving in the military to address the  incidence of Triple Negative Breast cancer can benefit from this  Jackson Lee Amendment.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 29, included in En Bloc No. 2, increases  and decreases the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund by $2  million to provide the Secretary of Defense the flexibility needed for  technical assistance for U.S. military women to military women in other  countries combating violence targeting women and children as a weapon  of war, terrorism, human trafficking, and narcotics trafficking.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 102, included in En Bloc No. 2, increases  and decreases by $2,000,000 funding for the Office of Justice Programs  grant in order to support programs to engage adult men and young  persons to reduce and prevent domestic violence against children.   I ask that my colleagues vote in support of these amendments by  passing En Bloc No. 2.                           Jackson Lee Amendments    Approved Under the Rule for H.R. 7617--Defense, Commerce, Justice,   Science, Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General         Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,     Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act     Jackson Lee Amendment No. 29 increases and decreases the Department  of Defense Military Retirement Fund by $2 million to provide the  Secretary of Defense the flexibility needed for technical assistance  for U.S. military women to military women in other countries combating  violence targeting women and children as a weapon of war, terrorism,  human trafficking, and narcotics trafficking.

Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  En Bloc No. 4, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science,  Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General  Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,  Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.  [[Page H4150]]    I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including  several amendments in the Rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.   The Jackson Lee amendments are in the following Divisions:   Division A--Department of Defense;   Division B--Commerce, Justice, Science;   Division F--Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and   Division G--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 319, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases  and decreases the National Infrastructure Investments account by  $2,000,000 to emphasize support for urban bicycle and pedestrian safety  programs.   I wish to thank the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO  and for voicing support for this Jackson Lee Amendment.   On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, at the intersection of  North Shepherd Drive and West 10th Street located in the 18th  Congressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, was driving with her  daughters when she saw Jesus ``Jesse'' Perez struggling to cross the  intersection in a wheelchair.   Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car to help Mr. Perez cross  the street when another vehicle struck them, and they were both killed.   On March 7, 2019, 23-year-old David Leon Loya was killed in a  collision with a school bus while riding his bicycle in The Heights  area of Houston.   Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike lane and tried to avoid  the accident by sliding under the bus, but unfortunately, he was run  over by the back axle.   This young man was greatly loved by his family, the lives of the  people he touched in his volunteer work, and the bicyclist community.   I offered the amendment in remembrance of Lesha White, Jesus  ``Jesse'' Perez, David Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians and  bicyclists who have lost their lives in accidents with motor vehicles  in urban areas.   In the past sixteen years, the Houston area has seen 2,000 deaths of  bicyclists and pedestrians, at an average of 100 a year, with the last  three years seeing the rate increase to 150 a year, according to  federal statistics.   In 2017, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are  available, according to the Texas Department of Transportation  (``TDOT''), the numbers were no more encouraging.   According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pedestrians were injured in  roadways crashes:   275 of them were injured seriously;   146 pedestrians were killed in roadways crashes;   639 bicyclists were injured in roadways crashes; and   82 bicyclists were injured seriously.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has called the  number of deaths a ``public health crisis.''   The problem is no more encouraging on the national level as Texas  ranks third nationwide in bicycle deaths, behind California and  Florida.   Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist accidents is rising and are  also amounting to a greater percentage of total traffic fatalities.   Cities are uniquely susceptible to this problem, as the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 70 percent of  bicycle fatalities occur in cities.   I offered this amendment that was included in the FY 2020  Transportation Appropriations bill that is law today because funding is  needed to make changes to the intersections to improve pedestrian and  bicyclists safety.   We must come together to tackle this problem and work to ensure that  we stem the tide in these fatalities.   The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian and bicyclists is  alarming and merits serious attention but as we know too tragically,  behind the statistics are stories about people who are treasured and  sorely missed by family, friends, and coworkers.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 251, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases  and decreases funds by $10,000,000 increase in funding to support  greater diversity in the pool of diabetes research professionals and  patients participating in clinical trials.   Diversity in medical trials is essential to ensuring that cures,  especially vaccines, and therapies work for the greatest number of  persons impacted by an illness.   34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the U.S. population, have  diabetes. An estimated 26.8 million people--or 10.2 percent of the  population--have been diagnosed with diabetes. Approximately 7.3  million people have diabetes but have not yet been diagnosed (2018).   Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds.   Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 percent of all diagnosed cases  of diabetes, affecting approximately 1.6 million people.   African American adults are 60 percent more likely than non-Hispanic  white adults to have been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician.   In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 3.5 times more likely to be  diagnosed with end stage renal disease as compared to non-Hispanic  whites.   In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 2.3 times more likely to be  hospitalized for lower limb amputations as compared to non-Hispanic  whites.   In 2017, African Americans were twice as likely as non-Hispanic  whites to die from diabetes.   This Jackson Lee Amendment focuses efforts on addressing lower  participation rates of African Americans with diabetes in clinical  trials that test treatments and therapies.   I thank those who are instrumental in setting up clinical trials of  the COVID-19 vaccine for focuses on increasing African American and  Hispanic participation in the trial involving tens of thousands of  Americans across the nation.   This work, like what is proposed by this Jackson Lee amendment, is  intended to make cures as effective as possible for the greatest number  of persons.   I am pleased to cosponsor Congressman Espaillat's Amendment No. 236  included in En Bloc No. 4 to provide the increases and decreases by  $10,000,000 to support greater minority patient outreach and minority  candidate inclusion by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases in clinical trial participation for any vaccine or  therapeutics to treat the novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 252, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases  and decreases funds by $10,000,000 with the intent of supporting  programs that provide outreach and support services targeting program  participants at greatest risk of not completing a college degree due to  COVID-19 education disruption.   I urge my fellow members to vote in favor of En Bloc No. 4 and  support these Jackson Lee Amendments.    Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  En Bloc No. 5, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science,  Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General  Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education,  Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.   I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including  several amendments in the rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.   The Jackson Lee amendments are in the following Divisions:   Division A--Department of Defense;   Division B--Commerce, Justice, Science;   Division F--Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and   Division G--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.   The Jackson Lee Amendments made in order for Division G provide  funding for Fiscal Year 2021 Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development and exemplify the House of Representatives' commitment to  making real policy change and upholding Black Lives.   Three Jackson Lee amendments to this Division are complementary  because they protect the history and culture of Black Lives from our  past into our present by protecting areas that are cited in Public Law  116-111, which enacts H.R. 434, the National Emancipation Historic  Trail Study Act.   The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act would pave the way for  the establishment of only the second nationally recognized historic  trail that chronicles the experience of African Americans in their  struggle for equality and justice.   H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historical Trail Act, designates  the 51 miles from the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in  Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and I-45, north to Freedmen's Town  and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas as a national historic trail.   The key amendments to Division G of H.R. 7617, are: Jackson Lee  Amendments No. 320, No. 321, and No. 323, which are included in En Bloc  No. 5.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 320, included in En Bloc No. 5, prohibits  the Department of Transportation from using funds for Section 106  Transportation construction projects in urban areas that have not been  determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary obligations of the  National Historic Preservation Act.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 322, included in En Bloc No. 5, provides  $1,000,000 in assistance to address challenges faced by communities  impacted by persistent poverty and are not included in decision making  when major highway construction threatens their homes, businesses, and  culturally significant structures.   These two amendments make a statement in support of preserving the  history of Black Lives, because this history matters.   Through these lives, a nation was forged out of what should have  taken hundreds of years for America to rival Europe in economic might,  industrial capacity, and military strength, it took less than a hundred  because of forced labor worked beyond human capacity, compassion, or  decency under a system of chattel slavery, which was more cruel than  any conceived form of forced involuntary labor prior to what was  created in the United States.   Some may ask, why do we need an H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and  Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, it is because  we have not, as a nation nor as a people, gotten to the truth about  what chattel slavery was, why those who created it thought it was  necessary, and what steps were taken to poison every institution known  to mankind to accept it as natural, normal and in many records as  ``compassionate''.   Until we understand what was done, why it was done, and how it was  achieved, there is no method to chart a course out of it, to get beyond  its influence, to fully eradiate it from our minds, institutions, and  way of life.   One of the vestiges of slavery is how government entities treat  African Americans' right to own property--a home is the single greatest  source of wealth for black people living within the United States.   Achieving homeownership is celebrated and the home becomes a source  of stability for the family over multiple generations.   Stable communities led to the establishment of places of worship,  businesses, as well as social and cultural centers of life within  residential areas.   One of these historic communities is Independence Heights, which  began in the 1900s, a time in which African Americans faced enormous  difficulties securing property and establishing a place to live in the  South.   Having faith in the message of self-determination advocated by Booker  T. Washington, the early pioneers of Independence Heights secured  property from the Wright Land Company, set up their own system of  governance, and became the first town incorporated by African Americans  in Texas in 1915.   Annexed by the City of Houston in 1929, Independence Heights remains  a community that reflects and cherishes its values, accomplishments,  and history to this day.   This area and others cited in Public Law 116-111 are under threat  from the Texas Department of Transportation starting after World War  II, when major highway construction was invoked nationally, and has  continued to the present day.   For more than 14 years, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)  has been planning the North Houston Highway Improvement Project  (NHHIP), a massive expansion of Interstate 45 that will completely  reshape freeway transit around downtown Houston, with major changes to  I-45, I-69, I-10 and Hwy 288 over the next decade.   These changes will threaten the Near Northside of Houston, taking way  the Leonel Castillo Community Center and Greater New Hope Missionary  Baptist Church along with seven other historic churches in Independence  Heights.   The proposed expansion of I-45 north of downtown to Beltway 8 will  result in impacts to neighborhoods along either side of I-45 North, as  hundreds of residents face displacement.   Located just northwest of the intersection of I-610 and I-45, the  historic neighborhood of Independence Heights is one of those  neighborhoods facing said impacts.   Unfortunately, in 2019 when TxDOT made public its report on the  Project's expected impacts to historical resources required under the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the agency completely left  Independence Heights out of its survey.   Independence Heights is listed in the National Register of Historic  Places as the first state chartered community of former slaves and is a  destination site on state historic heritage trails such as the Texas  Independence Trail and holds the distinction as the first town  incorporated by African Americans in the state of Texas.   After World War II, the construction of the I-45 and 610 Loop  isolated Independence Heights from the rest of the city of Houston.   Starting after World War II, the push to build highways accelerated  and the brunt of the pain for this growth was felt by black and brown  communities not just in Texas but everywhere massive projects were  undertaken.   Once again, I-45 has planned major reconstruction that could impact  communities of color, including historic black neighborhoods like  Independence Heights and the Fifth Ward, as plans call for demolishing  homes and businesses to accommodate more roadway space.   TxDoT has not been kind to Independence Heights or other communities  around the network of freeways and interchanges in the downtown area.   Over the decades, these same areas have lost hundreds of homes,  businesses and historic places to massive rebuilds and new construction  has taken hundreds of homes and historic sites from Independence  Heights.   TxDOT's plans for the I-45 massive rebuild seem to have relied on  previous policies of the past I-610 freeway construction for the  current plan to take neighborhood property.   Today, the world has changed--and the faith of historic places and  the community that cherishes them can take comfort in knowing that H.R.  434, the ``Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act,'' became  Public Law 116-111 on January 27, 2020.   The ambition of taking on the effort of building a national historic  trial was made possible by the dedication and hard work of local  historic preservationists who tell the story of the African American  experience.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 323, included in En Bloc No. 5, increases  by $1,000,000 the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to  address the fairness in the use of Community Development Block Grant  Disaster funding to repair or replace single family homes damaged  during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that multigenerational homes can  house the family at documented predisaster capacity.   This amendment addresses the unfair action taken to diminish the  quality of repairs or replacement of homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey.   The law providing the final supplement for disaster recovery for  Hurricanes Harvey and Maria disaster housing recovery provisions of the  bill allowed local jurisdictions to be in control over recovery or  repair of single and multi-family housing.   The City of Houston applied for and was awarded the grant to replace  or repair single and multi-family housing for city residents.   The state of Texas General Land Office is attempting to take back the  grant and replace the city's plan to repair or replace housing with a  plan to only repair two bedrooms no matter how many the home had at the  time of the storm's damage.   The City of Houston strongly opposes the Texas General Land Office's  (``GLO'') proposal  [[Page H4166]]  to eliminate all City-administered CDBG-DR 17 program funding for  several reasons.   First, the City's programs are successful and on schedule. For  example, even though the City is only 1.5 years into its grant: $446  million (35 percent) of total funds allocated to the City has already  been designated for the specific properties or projects at which the  assistance is to be used. $153 million (12 percent) is already under a  signed contract that obligates its use to deliver recovery services,  with more contracts being signed on a weekly basis.   The City's Single-Family programs have already fully served 234  homeowners, with another 246 families submitted to or approved by GLO  and currently being served.   At the current pace, the City will serve 1000 families for each of  the next 4 years before the end of the contract, for an estimated total  served of 4,480 families.   Second, the City's programs are better and more appropriate for the  citizens of the City than those the GLO has implemented.   As intended by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  (``HUD''), the City's programs are serving the most vulnerable families  first.   This prioritization addresses systemic racial inequalities that have  regularly occurred in prior disaster recovery efforts, including the  disaster recovery programs previously overseen by the State.   Specifically, the City has adjusted its approach to ensure Houston's  most vulnerable residents are not left behind because of regulatory or  bureaucratic barriers erected by the State or any other entity.   This number does not include contracts for third-party vendors.   The City's multifamily program will create units that are affordable  for more than twice as long the State's program, will serve far more  very low income families than the State's program, and is attracting  seven times the amount of funding leverage (a requirement of the CDBG- DR 17 program) as compared to the State's program.   The City's program provides more recovery choices to Hurricane  Harvey-impacted renters allowing them to use recovery funds to become  homeowners. The State's program does not provide this option.   The third reason the city of Houston is opposing the GLO's proposed  amendment to the grant award is because it violates the terms of its  subrecipient agreement, GLO Contract No. 19-147-001-B489, as amended,  with the City (the ``Contract'').   Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that amendments to increase or  decrease the amount of the subaward must be made by written agreement  of the parties and the City has not consented to any reduction in its  subaward.   Funding under the Contract has not been reduced or terminated.   The City is performing under the terms of the Contract and has not  defaulted under the Contract.   Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it has a difficult time  complying with HUD requirements and with establishing and communicating  its own bureaucratic and confusing requirements to the City.   Two years ago, as it was drafting its own plan for the $5 billion  recovery funds, the GLO failed to provide appropriate community  engagement in Houston and Harris County, jurisdictions representing  half of the state's total residential damage from Harvey.   Due to the above failure, HUD directed the State to allow the City to  submit its own action plan, directed by and informed by Houstonians. As  directed by HUD and agreed to by the State, the GLO's only role as the  passthrough entity for the funding was to ensure compliance with HUD  regulations.   The State has failed in this role, by making up requirements for the  City's programs completely unrelated to any set by HUD but especially  in its review of the City's home repair program.   Having decided to impose far more requirements than originally agreed  to by the City or required by HUD, the GLO failed to communicate these  additional requirements at the beginning of the program--using instead  its Requests for Information (``RFIs'') process to reject files and  repeatedly changing its process along the way in order to continue  rejecting files submitted by the City.   For these reasons, and to protect the homes of hundreds of Black  Homeowners, it matters that the city, so long as it meets or exceeds  the expectations for recovery of homes post Hurricane Harvey, they  should be allowed to continue the work.   I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of En Bloc No. 5 and the  Jackson Lee Amendments.                                                   City of Houston,                                     Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: On behalf of the City of       Houston, I am writing to express strong support of your       amendment #38 House Resolution 7617 regarding common-sense       approach to providing disaster recovery assistance to       households with homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey.        In Houston, many of our lower-income seniors live in single       family homes that are their only asset. Of course, homeowners       who have lived in homes with more than two bedrooms for many       years would want to retain the value of that precious asset,       even as they may need significant federal help to reconstruct       their homes. Our desired standard is to rebuild a three-      bedroom home for households of four of fewer people for       people whose homes had three of more bedrooms before the       storm.        While this is the standard outline in City of Houston       guidelines, we are subject to rules set by the Texas General       Land Office (GLO). GLO requires that occupancy as the sole       factor for determining the size of rebuilt homes. Under GLO       rules, people who have lived for many years in a three- or       four-bedroom home would be forced to accept a two-bedroom       home as a condition of receiving Harvey assistance.        This policy will have the unintended effect of depressing       property values across those neighborhoods, while this       amendment will help address that disparity and is consistent       with the feedback from Houstonians.        We must work together to ensure that Houston has a health       housing stock of the future, and that vulnerable Houstonians       who receive much-needed recovery funds after Harvey are not       forced to unreasonable downsize longstanding family homes as       a condition of receiving assistance.            Sincerely,                                                  Sylvester Turner,      Mayor.                                   ____                                                    City of Houston,                                     Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: The City of Houston       (``City'') strongly opposes the Texas General Land Office's       (``GLO'') preposterous proposal to eliminate all City-      administered CDBG-DR 17 program funding for several reasons.

As intended by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban       Development (``HUD''), the City's programs are serving the       most vulnerable families first.

The City's program provides more recovery choices to       Hurricane Harvey-impacted renters allowing them to use       recovery funds to become homeowners. The State's program does       not provide this option.        Third, the GLO's proposed amendment violates the terms of       its subrecipient agreement, GLO Contract No. 19-147-001-B489,       as amended, with the City (the ``Contract'').        Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that amendments to       increase or decrease the amount of the subaward must be made       by written agreement of the parties and the City has not       consented to any reduction in its subaward.        Funding under the Contract has not been reduced or       terminated.        The City is performing under the terms of the Contract and       has not defaulted under the Contract.        Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it has a difficult       time complying with HUD requirements and with establishing       and communicating its own bureaucratic and confusing       requirements to the City.

Due to the above failure, HUD directed the State to allow       the City to submit its own action plan, directed by and       informed by  [[Page H4167]]       Houstonians. As directed by HUD and agreed to by the State,       the GLO's only role as the passthrough entity for the funding       was to ensure compliance with HUD regulations. The State has       failed in this role, by making up requirements for the City's       programs completely unrelated to any set by HUD but       especially in its review of the City's home repair program.        Having decided to impose far more requirements than       originally agreed to by the City or required by HUD, the GLO       failed to communicate these additional requirements at the       beginning of the program--using instead its Requests for       Information (``RFIs'') process to reject files and repeatedly       changing its process along the way in order to continue       rejecting files submitted by the City.        1. The City's programs are successful and on schedule by       any measure and there is no reasonable rationale for taking       away City administration of the programs. Such an action only       creates delays and harms the citizens of Houston.                       Community Engagement & Outreach         The City's Hurricane Harvey recovery programs were designed       with significant community consultation, reaching nearly       4,500 citizens. In response to the destruction that Hurricane       Harvey caused, Congress allocated $5.024 billion to the State       of Texas in September 2017. In March 2018, the State of Texas       announced that the City would have local control over $1.15       billion of these funds. When the State of Texas released its       State Action Plan in April 2018, the City had a short window       of time in which to develop an Action Plan for its portion of       the allocated funds. To increase transparency in the process       and support community efforts that promote the ``right to       stay, right to choose'' framework promoted by housing       advocates locally, the City's Housing and Community       Development Department (``HCDD'') initiated its largest       community engagement effort to date. Partners, organizations,       and consulting teams, including building community WORKSHOP       ([be]) and the Community Design Resource Center, were engaged       to increase the success and reach of the engagement process.        What the City heard from Houstonians is summarized as       follows: Neighborhoods want a voice in the process of       prioritizing where the money goes. Housing advocates want to       ensure that Houston's low- to moderate-income residents are       prioritized in this recovery effort. Past recovery efforts       led by the State fell short and heighten the desire by       Houstonians for transparency and community participation in       the disaster recovery decision making process. Housing and       neighborhood advocates affirm the right of residents to have       a say in what happens in their neighborhoods. A partnership       approach between the City and community groups is the       appropriate model to pursue.                             Multifamily Program         The multifamily program that resulted from the City's       community consultation was designed to specifically address       community concerns and needs, including flooding concerns,       fair housing considerations, and replacement of affordable       rental units lost in the storm. The City's multifamily       program provides loans to local multifamily developments that       agree to reserve a certain number of units for families at or       above the poverty level for many decades. CDBG-DR multifamily       funding can be used to rehabilitate or build new, affordable       apartment buildings. While the City's programs respond to       basic HUD requirements for targeting the majority of       assistance to low-income families, the City's programs go       much further to fully address the unmet needs in Houston. The       City's multifamily programs are a model for how to spend and       leverage federal funds to maximize their benefit to low-      income Houstonians. Specifically, the City's multifamily       program achieves the following: More resilient design to       ensure these homes are not flooded in the next storm;       Equitable placement throughout the City to affirmatively       further fair housing; Long-term affordability through a       mandatory minimum affordability period of 40 years of       affordability; Reserving a significant number of units for       occupancy by extremely low-income and very low-income       families; Leveraging CDBG-DR resources to augment the Federal       dollars and attract tax credits, bank loans and philanthropic       funds; and Expanding workforce protections to ensure those       building the homes have a livable wage, a safe work       environment and a career path.        The program includes requirements to ensure that       developments constructed with City dollars are built to       withstand future storm damage. As part of its resiliency       planning, during Round2 of the City's multifamily application       process, the City instituted additional design standards to       ensure that the new developments would withstand future       flooding. These standards provide guidance for multifamily       building owners on a variety of retrofit strategies and       outline mitigation strategies against a variety of hazards.       Applicants were required to provide the City preconstruction,       design phase information showing the planned project will       incorporate resilient building measures to protect residents       from future disasters. For new construction or major       rehabilitation projects, this requires identification of a       minimum of 12 resilient project points. Resilient Areas where       developments were graded are based on the Enterprise Ready to       Respond: Strategies for Multifamily Building Resilience in       the areas of protection, adaptation, back up measures and       community as follows:        Protection--Applicants are required to design a minimum of       two distinct strategies to reduce a building's vulnerability       to extreme weather.        Adaptation--Applicants are required to design a minimum of       three distinct strategies that improve a facility's ability       to adapt to changing climate conditions        Back up measures--Applicants are required to design at       least one strategy that provide critical needs when a       facility loses power or other services.        Community--Applicants incorporate two strategies that       encourage behavior which enhances resilience        Green Building Standard--Applicants are required to build       their development to one of four energy efficiency standards       (HUD requirement)        Solar--Applicants are required to design buildings to be       solar ready (HUD requirement)        Electric Vehicles (``EV'')--Applicants are required to       incorporate standards to be ready to implement EV charging       stations        Substantial amendments are to be reviewed by HUD for       clarity. As shown above, Action Plan Amendment 7 is simply       not clear. It is confusing and misleading, especially with       regard to programs operated within the City.   Action Plan Amendment 7 does not adequately address fair housing needs                                in the City         We are further concerned that the GLO's efforts to replace       the City's CDBG-DR 17 programs with GLO's more limited       programs will expose the GLO, and potentially the City, to       potential fair housing claims. The City's programs were       specifically designed to address affirmatively furthering       fair housing objectives and nondiscrimination in the City.       The City prioritized our assistance in the single family       programs for our most vulnerable and impacted citizens, which       are often protected classes (including people of color and       persons with disabilities). The City prioritized the new       rental units created in the multifamily program in       neighborhoods of opportunity, ensured that more units are       available long-term to very low income families, and we have       maximized our investment of federal resources through       requiring developers to obtain significant leverage of other       private and public dollars. Both GLO and HUD are currently       being sued for fair housing violations by renters and low-      income families who believed GLO's allocation of funds and       program design discriminates against renters (who in Texas       are also disproportionately protected classes) and does not       properly take into account the needs of Texans impacted by       Hurricane Harvey. We would think that, rather than apply       programs that are already under fire for fair housing       violations in Houston, the GLO would welcome the continued       operation of programs that better address the fair housing       needs of the citizens of the City and are not the subject of       active fair housing litigation.                                  conclusion         These comments highlight the numerous flaws in Action Plan       Amendment 7. It is not approvable by HUD and requires       substantial revision. While the City urges the GLO to cease       its unreasonable efforts and revise the Action Plan Amendment       7 to allow the City to continue to administer its programs       and help the citizens of Houston, we note separately that any       substantive revision to this Amendment should be subject to       further public comment. The GLO should draft a sensible,       approvable Amendment 7 and re-issue for the required public       comment.        In the alternative, GLO should not submit Action Plan       Amendment 7 as drafted to HUD. If GLO chooses to do so, HUD       should reject the portions of the amendment that eliminate       the City's administration of its allocation of CDBG-DR 17       funds so as to enable the citizens of Houston to access much-      needed funds and services. HUD should reject the amendment on       the ground that it is incomplete and does not fully respond       to the applicable criteria governing the CBGD-DR program. In       the alternative, HUD should modify the grant such that it       becomes a direct grant to the City, rather than one       administered by the State.                                   ____                                                      July 22, 2020.

C of H.R. 7608. Div. C of       H.R. 7608 will provide Fiscal Year 2021 funding to the       Department of Interior, and the National Parks Service       (''NPS'') which manages our nation's parks, monuments, and       federally recognized historic trails.        As you are aware, Amendment #30 proposes that $6 million of       the funds allocated to the NPS should be used to address the       backlog of  [[Page H4168]]       national historic trail studies authorized by law, with       special attention to enacted trail studies, relating to the       history of underrepresented groups. Amendment #30 is of       particular importance to us as it relates to H.R. 434--      Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act and the       Emancipation National Historic Trail (the ``Emancipation       National Historic Trail'')--a 51-mile route showing the       migration of newly freed slaves and other people of African       descent in the 19th century. The Emancipation National       Historic Trail begins at the location of the famous June 19,       1865, Juneteenth Announcement, commemorating the ending of       slavery in Texas, and follows the route of the newly freed       and formerly enslaved persons into Houston, Texas, and ends       in Emancipation Park and the historic Independence Heights.       The Emancipation National Historic Trail will become only the       second trail in the 243-year history of the United States to       commemorate the history of African Americans. Currently, the       National Parks Service has only one other National Historic       Trail which centers on the African American experience. It is       the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which covers       a 54-mile path between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, and       which was named a national historic trail in 1996. The Selma       to Montgomery trail tells an important story about a pivotal       moment in the nation's struggle transitioning from a history       of segregation towards the modem Civil Rights Movement.        The goals of the Emancipation National Historic Trail are       the restoration, resurrection, and ascension of historical       memory. It is a remarkable story and one that all Americans       can be proud to share with the world. However, this cannot       occur without direct financial support as offered by       Amendment #30 to Div. C of H.R. 7608. Indeed, Amendment #30       would preserve critical periods of U.S. history not otherwise       represented in existing Federal trails or historic places.        Amendment #30 provides support for the commencement of the       Emancipation National Historic Trail study and will support       additional studies that have been approved by Congress and       signed into law. Your support and championing of       Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee's Amendment #30 is       appreciated as it will provide vital resources for this       historic endeavor.            Sincerely,                                             Samuel L.

Jim McGovern,      Chairman, House Committee on Rules, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Rules, House of           Representatives Washington, DC.      Re Support of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee's Amendment           #78 (``Amendment #78'') Division C of H.R. 7608, the           State, Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural           Development, Interior, Environment, Military           Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act,           2021 (``Div. C of H.R. 7608'').         Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: We write to       express our overwhelming support for Congresswoman Jackson       Lee's Amendment #78 to Div. C of H.R. 7608. Div. C of H.R.       7608 will provide Fiscal Year 2021 funding to the Department       of Interior, which includes the National Parks Service       (``NPS'') which manages our nation's parks, monuments, and       federally recognized historic trails.        As you are aware, Amendment #78 seeks to provide $2 million       to promote collaborations between Historically Black College       and Universities (``HBCUs'') and local historic societies to       identify, restore, and preserve places of historic       significance to African Americans that are at risk of being       lost. Amendment #78 is of particular importance to us as it       relates to H.R. 434--Emancipation National Historic Trail       Study Act and the Emancipation National Historic Trail (the       ``Emancipation National Historic Trail'')--a 51-mile route       showing the migration of newly freed slaves and other people       of African descent in the 19th century. The Emancipation       National Historic Trail begins at the location of the famous       June 19, 1865, Juneteenth Announcement, commemorating the       ending of slavery in Texas, and follows the route of the       newly freed and formerly enslaved persons into Houston,       Texas, and ends in Emancipation Park and the historic       Independence Heights. Amendment #78 would permit local       history preservationist to collaborate with students at HBCUs       on projects such as the Emancipation National Historic Trail       and other projects to reclaim treasures that would otherwise       be lost for future generations, and would train young people       in some of the vital fields that are needed to support the       protection of historic treasures in underserved communities.        We ask that you support Congresswoman Jackson Lee's       Amendment #78 to Div. C of H.R. 7608 because it is needed and       would contribute to the important work of saving historic       places of significance to African Americans by enriching the       lives of students and offer career opportunities to them in       history preservation.            Sincerely,      E.J. Scott                                   ____                                                      July 28, 2020.      Hon.

Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: We write to       express our overwhelming support for Congresswoman Sheila       Jackson Lee's Amendment #36 and Amendment #38, H. R. 7617.        As you are aware, Rules #36 Prohibits the Department of       Transportation from using funds for Section 106       Transportation construction projects in urban areas that have       not been determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary       obligations of the National Historic Preservation Act.        Also, the Rules #38 amendment provides $1,000,000 in       assistance to address challenges faced by communities       impacted by persistent poverty and are not included in       decision making when major highway construction threatens       their homes, businesses, and culturally significant       structures.        Amendment #36 and #38 are of particular importance to us as       it relates to H.R. 434--Emancipation National Historic Trail       Study Act and the Emancipation National Historic Trail (the       ``Emancipation National Historic Trail'') --a 51-mile route       showing the migration of newly freed slaves and other people       of African descent in the 19th century.

Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: On behalf       of the community of Independence Heights we are sending this       letter to show our support for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson       Lee's Amendment #36 and Amendment #38, H. R. 7617.        As you are aware, Rules #36 Prohibits the Department of       Transportation from using funds for Section 106       Transportation construction projects in urban that have not       been determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary       obligations of the National Historic Preservation Act. As our       community is one of the identified places on the National       Emancipation Historic Trail, we are facing extreme pressure       from gentrification and impending displacement and cultural       erasure as a result of the North Houston Highway Improvement       Project. More specifically, we are faced with the loss of       many key historic structures in our community that will       contribute to our placement on the historic trail. Supporting       this amendment is key for our community as it will help       protect the remaining historical and culturally significant       structures        Also, the Rules #38 amendment provides $1,000,000 in       assistance to address challenges faced by communities       impacted by persistent poverty and are not included in       decision making when major highway construction threatens       their homes, businesses, and culturally significant       structures.

The route includes historic places such as       Emancipation Park and our community, historic Independence       Heights. This historic trail will become only the second       trail in the 243-year history of the United States to       commemorate the history of African Americans.

It is a remarkable story and one that all Americans       can be proud to share with the world. It should also be noted       that without these proposed amendments, these communities are       in threat of losing the physical evidence of their existence.        We encourage your support of these amendments and invite       your direct support as offered by approving Amendment #36 and       #38, H. R. 7617.
