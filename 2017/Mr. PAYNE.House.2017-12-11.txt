 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Montclair  High School Mounties football team for winning their State championship  game against the Union City Soaring Eagles.   The Mounties' senior running back, Daniel Webb, returned the  championship game's opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown only 13  seconds after the game began. The Mounties never lost their lead. They  beat Union City 35-14 and won New Jersey's North 1, Group 5 State  championship. This was Montclair's third perfect season and fourth  State championship in the past 6 years.   The championship is a big win for everyone in Montclair, New Jersey.  For weeks, local businesses and community groups came together to  support the Mounties. At the championship game, on December 1, more  than 1,500 fans turned out to cheer their team on.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating head coach John  Fiore and the Montclair Mounties football team for their big win in a  stellar year.                            ____________________
