 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 77) opposing the decision to end certain  United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against  Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 77         Whereas thousands of Syrian fighters, including Syrian       Kurds, fought courageously with the United States against the       brutality of ISIS throughout Syria, liberating nearly one-      third of Syrian territory from ISIS' so-called       ``caliphate.'';        Whereas, on October 6, 2019, the White House announced       ``Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned       operation into Northern Syria'' while the ``United States       Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the       operation, and United States forces . . . will no longer be       in the immediate area.'';        Whereas, on October 6, 2019, the White House announced       ``Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the       area captured over the past two years . . . .'';        Whereas an October 10, 2019, White House statement said,       ``This morning, Turkey, a NATO member, invaded Syria. The       United States does not endorse this attack and has made it       clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.'';        Whereas Turkey has historically threatened, forcibly       displaced, and killed Syrian Kurds, including during military       operations in the Afrin District;        Whereas, on August 1, 2019, Special Envoy James Jeffrey       stated in reference to the Syrian Kurds and Syrian Democratic       Forces (SDF), ``We are committed to defeating ISIS in       northeast Syria. The SDF . . . is our partner there. We are       committed to those who have fought with us not being attacked       and not being harmed by anyone. The President made that clear       publicly. That includes our concerns about the Turks.'';        Whereas in January 2019, Director of National Intelligence       Dan Coats stated in Congressional testimony that ``The       conflicts in Iraq and Syria have generated a large pool of       skilled and battle-hardened fighters who remain dispersed       throughout the region . . . and the group has returned to its       guerilla-warfare roots while continuing to plot attacks and       direct its supporters worldwide. ISIS is intent on       resurging.'';        Whereas, during the counter-ISIS campaign in Syria, the SDF       captured thousands of ISIS fighters, including foreign       terrorist fighters from around the world who pose threats to       our allies in the region;  [[Page H8158]]         Whereas in addition to ISIS fighters in detention       approximately 70,000 women and children are currently held at       the Al-Hol internally displaced persons camp and at other       camps in northeast Syria;        Whereas the Lead Inspector General for Combined Joint Task       Force Operation Inherent Resolve stated in August 2019, ISIS       is already ``seeking to establish safe haven in al-Hol''       aiming to recruit individuals who are ``susceptible to ISIS       messaging, coercion, and enticement.'';        Whereas the SDF has warned the United States and       international community that a Turkish incursion into       Northeast Syria would significantly decrease the SDF's       ability to combat ISIS and to continue providing security and       management for ISIS detainees and their family members;        Whereas, on October 6, 2019, President Trump conducted a       call with President Erdogan in which, according to the       official White House press release, they discussed the       upcoming Turkish incursion, and soon after this call, a White       House press release announced the withdrawal of the United       States military from the immediate area, which was completed       within hours; and        Whereas an abrupt withdrawal of United States military       personnel from certain parts of Northeast Syria is beneficial       to adversaries of the United States government, including       Syria, Iran, and Russia: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That       Congress--        (1) opposes the decision to end certain United States       efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian       Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria;        (2) calls on Turkish President Erdogan to immediately cease       unilateral military action in Northeast Syria and to respect       existing agreements relating to Syria;        (3) calls on the United States to continue supporting       Syrian Kurdish communities through humanitarian support,       including to those displaced or otherwise affected by ongoing       violence in Syria;        (4) calls on the United States to work to ensure that the       Turkish military acts with restraint and respects existing       agreements relating to Syria; and        (5) calls on the White House to present a clear and       specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 77.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of this Congress, when I became  chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have tried to work across the  aisle to advance a bipartisan vision of what American foreign policy  should be, what it can be, when we are at our best. And that is a  foreign policy rooted in our values--values like support for human  rights and human dignity, a foreign policy that projects American  leadership as a force for good in the world, a foreign policy that  thrives on the power of partnerships and alliances.   I have worked with my friend from Texas, the ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee (Mr. McCaul) to make sure that this vision is  enshrined in the committee's work and that we do all we can to push the  administration toward this approach.   So, Mr. Speaker, for me, the last week has been just devastating. A  week ago, President Trump had a phone call with Turkey's thuggish  leader, President Erdogan.   Against the advice of national security experts and military  advisers, the President gave Erdogan the green light to charge into  northern Syria, unleashing what has become a brutal campaign of  violence against the Syrian Kurds--our partners, the Syrian Kurds, who  courageously stood alongside us for many, many months and years in the  fight against ISIS.   Mr. Speaker, that reckless and impulsive decision was a betrayal of  our partners. It was a gift to Russia, a gift to Iran, a gift to ISIS,  and a gift to Assad. And it was a blow to our national security.   Now, a week later, the same Kurdish forces who fought with American  Special Forces to combat ISIS are now fighting tooth and nail to  survive Turkey's slaughter. Russian and Syrian regime forces have  quickly filled the vacuum left by the United States.   President Trump's decision has allowed ISIS fighters in northern  Syria to escape from prison, paving the way for a resurgence of the  terrorist group. It is a ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card, if you remember  Monopoly from the old days.   And the humanitarian crisis is staggering. Already, tens of thousands  have been displaced: families, women and children. There are stories of  gruesome beheadings, torture, and abuse, all set into motion,  unfortunately, by the actions of the President of the United States.   What kind of message does this send to the world? How can America be  trusted to keep its word when we betray one of our close partners, our  loyal and faithful partners, just throw them out like an old shoe?   How can America be trusted to keep its word when we make impulsive  decisions that have such an immediate, catastrophic impact on so many  thousands of people?   Congress must speak out against this disgrace.   The measure we are considering today will send an unambiguous,  bipartisan, and, hopefully, bicameral rejection of Trump's policy in  Syria.   This measure calls on the White House to develop a strong, clear  strategy on how to defeat ISIS now that President Trump has sparked its  resurgence. It expresses strong support for Syrian Kurdish forces,  recognizing their commitment and sacrifices in the fight against ISIS.  And it calls on Turkey to immediately stop its military action in  Syria.   At President Trump's hands, American leadership has been laid low and  American foreign policy has become nothing more than a tool to advance  his own interests.   Today, we make clear that the Congress is a coequal branch of  government and that we want nothing to do with this disastrous policy.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say to our colleagues: It is on us. It is on us to  uphold our country's values, to strengthen our national security, to  defend America's standing in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all Members, on both sides of the aisle, to  support this resolution and make it clear where we stand, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), the vice chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the  Pacific, and Nonproliferation, a very senior and valued member of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in the years I have served in this body, I have watched  Presidents of both parties make a lot of tough foreign policy  decisions; many good, many bad, but I cannot think of a foreign policy  decision more reckless and short-sighted than this one. Through all the  years that I have been working on the Foreign Affairs Committee,  frankly, I have never seen a President do something that is as  aggravating and that should have never been done as what the President  did last week.   You know, when the President announced that we were going to leave  several months ago, it forced the resignation of the Defense Secretary,  Mr. Mattis at the time, who was so upset. That was unprecedented in  American history. This is something that is unbelievable and could have  been avoided.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, in the years I have served in  this body, I have watched Presidents of both parties make a lot of  tough foreign policy decisions, many good, many bad, but I cannot think  of a foreign policy decision more reckless and shortsighted than this  one that was made by President Trump.   The President of the United States, as a result, has empowered ISIS;  betrayed our loyal partners, the Kurds; and jeopardized our national  security.   Congress must condemn this loudly and clearly. Today's resolution  sends a resounding message to the White House and the world: We reject  President Trump's disgraceful failure in foreign policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to stand by our partners, stand by  our promises, stand by our values, and support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my partner on the Foreign Affairs Committee,  Mr. McCaul. It takes a lot of courage to do what he did today, and I  thank him for it. That is why, as he and I both mentioned, we are proud  that the Foreign Affairs Committee is perhaps the most bipartisan  committee in Congress.   When we go abroad, partisanship should stop at the water's edge. We  all, Democrat and Republican, feel outraged at what the President did.  We all feel that our allies need to be supported. That transcends any  kind of partisan politics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support this bipartisan  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
