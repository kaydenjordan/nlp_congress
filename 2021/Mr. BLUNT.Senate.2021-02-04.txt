 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 48 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I am offering an amendment today to  reopen our Nation's schools once teachers are vaccinated and the  potential for tying COVID funding to that reopening.   The evidence is clear, school closures are hurting students,  prolonged remote learning puts kids where they are at high risk of  falling behind, of failing classes, and of having mental health  problems. And even a greater number of students with disabilities in  underserved areas are impacted by not going to school.   Science confirms schools can and should reopen safely. Just this  week, the CDC Director said that vaccines aren't even a prerequisite to  getting kids back to school. There shouldn't be any further delay. This  amendment does include teachers vaccines as part of the criteria; but  with vaccines, we should get back to in-person school. The case is  strong. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.    Madam President, may I have additional time?    Vote yes on this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 48
