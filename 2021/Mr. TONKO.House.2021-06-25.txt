 Madam Speaker, nearly 40 percent of Americans before COVID  couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense without selling belongings or  going into debt. And no one pays a greater price for poverty than our  kids.   I am proud of our work to pass the American Rescue Plan and deliver a  lifeline for millions of struggling Americans. Starting July 15, that  lifeline gets stronger.   In a few weeks, and again every month throughout 2021, hardworking  families will get a check of up to $400  [[Page H3151]]  per child. That check will help millions of parents buy healthy food,  new clothes, shoes, and books for their kids, pay rent and utilities,  and even afford childcare so they can get back to work.   In my own home district in New York's capital region, these checks  will reach more than 37,000 households and help lift more than 5,000 of  our kids out of poverty. These are not just lasting investments in  America's recovery; they are the downpayment on our brightest future.   I urge every parent and family that has struggled to make ends meet  during this pandemic to visit childtaxcredit.gov and make certain that  you are signed up.                            ____________________
