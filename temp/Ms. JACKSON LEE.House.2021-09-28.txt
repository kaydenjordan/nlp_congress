 Mr. Speaker, we have often turned to Lincoln. My  good friends on the other side of the aisle have tried to be  Lincolnesque, but I don't think they have dug deep into the virtues of  Abraham Lincoln. They didn't delve deeply into his sense of courage and  integrity.   We know that his ultimate goal was to preserve the Union, as it  should have been. He was, in fact, the President of the United States  of America, not of the Union States, not of the Confederate States. But  often as they pretend Lincolnesque, it is abandoned along the trash  heap of highways of despair.   First of all, the Build Back Better Act is paid for over 10 years, in  contrast to the debacle voted on, to a one, by my friends on the other  side of the aisle, of the Trump tax cut, 83 percent for those who were  already flourishing in dollars, while it left the bus drivers and  teachers and paramedics, nurses and emergency room doctors, along the  highway with tin cups.   Any plan for embellishing, staffing--and that is what it is--for the  Internal Revenue Service, of which we should continue to have  oversight, is to ensure that those who have paid not a dime--not a  dime--not a dime, Mr. Speaker--pay their fair share.    Do you think any American is against that? I have seen Republicans,  Democrats, and Independents who are crucially asking the question: Am I  carrying the entire burden?   My friends stand stalwart, the Republicans; they are not going to  raise the debt ceiling. First of all, it is the full faith and credit  of the United States. Read the Constitution. It is to ensure that  America's bills, money already spent, are paid.   Just like you use your electricity, you are paying ahead of time; you  are paying for the bill already spent. The electricity, the light was  on for 20 days. You are paying for that light to be on.   I am sad to say that there are so many who can't make ends meet,  can't pay the light bill. I have heard it often. Can't pay rent; can't  pay the water bill.   So I am going to start with two icons from different eras about the  word ``courage.''   Abraham Lincoln eloquently spoke in 1862--he was a most visionary  writer--``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy  present.'' All that we talked about, all the contentiousness of  yesteryear, you need to put it aside. ``The occasion is piled high . .  .''--this day, this month, this 2021, this in the midst of a national  health emergency, is piled high ``. . . with difficulty, and we must  rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so must we think anew and  act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our  country.''   Is anyone here willing to save their country? Are they willing to  join as Americans to save the country?   I know 2022 is coming. Great campaign ads about what Democrats did. I  am glad that my terminology will be what an American did by the name of  Sheila Jackson Lee. What did she do?   ``Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without  courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently,'' said the  iconic and late Maya Angelou, who I had the privilege of teaching me.  What a great memory I have of her being my professor.   So I want to speak this morning on the cruciality of moving forward  on the INVEST Act and the Build Back Better Act. Without a doubt, I  want to be able to not give short shrift to the 2 years of free pre-K  and 2 years of free community college, paid for, giving Americans the  front-end and giving the opportunity to be able, for some, to be in  college for the first time. They are moving on to historically Black  colleges of their choice or other colleges of their choice.   What about the Federal Medicaid program, when 12 States failed to opt  in during the Affordable Care Act and left a trash heap of desperate  people. Not the people desperate, but on the heap of despair, no  healthcare, because they were below the threshold. Our friends as well  decided not to do anything.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, how important it is to have the INVEST Act,  with making sure we have broadband and making sure that we have high- speed internet as well as highways that work not against us but for us.   Let's do the right thing and have the courage of Americans. Let's  stand for America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of  the Judiciary Committee for yielding and with the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island, Judge Gohmert knows, and we know that  Texas knows how to lead. So I thank them so very much for bringing that  to our attention.   Let me take just a moment to turn and say thank you to Chairman  Jeffries for leading us on and providing the energy and the engine for  doing something that is and will continue to be lifesaving.   It is my life's work to use the criminal justice system as a reform  mechanism to save lives and to ensure that it is not a system that  unequally prides itself on supporting the rights sometimes of the  offender without acknowledging the rights of the victim.   In many instances in addiction, Mr. Speaker, you will find persons  who go awry of the criminal justice system as victims because they then  are not given the treatment that they should get, or they are not given  the recognition of the question of how you can  [[Page H5480]]  fairly address these laws. They are, in fact, becoming victims. They  are victims of the system. They become incarcerated. They lose their  right to vote. Their families are separated from them. They are  stigmatized. They may lose their life's dream of being a teacher or a  police officer or a lawyer.   We don't know what lives we lost in the so-called war on drugs and  how many fell by the wayside. So I am proud to support H.R. 1693, the  EQUAL Act of 2021, which will finally eliminate the sentencing  disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses and provide  retroactive relief to thousands of people who received harsh and unfair  sentences based on this disparity.   The crack and powder cocaine sentencing disparity is another  byproduct of our country's failed war on drugs. I have long championed  for the equalization of crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. The  evidence of the statement of support and comments of our co-manager,  Mr. Gohmert from Texas, and as well the letter from Mr. Armstrong  showed the bipartisan recognition of where we are today.   I want to thank the members of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland  Security Subcommittee who collectively have had a vision along with all  the members of the Judiciary Committee.   What are we doing there?   Yes, we are there to uphold laws to promote the legal process under  the system called criminal justice, but we are surely there to ensure  that criminal justice works.    Beginning in 2007 I introduced legislation that  would have ended the disparity, because we had learned that most of the  assumptions on which the 100-to-1 ratio was based turned out to be  unfounded. Those unfounded assumptions damaged communities of color for  generations. A higher percentage of Black Americans are convicted of  crack cocaine versus powder cocaine offenses and receive significantly  longer sentences for comparable offenses, and the percentage of  individuals serving unreasonably long sentences is because that  disparity exists.   Let me also indicate, I was happy to introduce an amendment to allow  the courts to grant sentence reductions absent the defendant's presence  as required today. This will eliminate the court's logjam, and some of  these individuals are, in fact, incarcerated still. Individuals like  William Underwood, Matthew Charles, and Cynthia Shank all testified  before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees about the devastating  impact that sentencing disparity and mandatory minimum laws have had on  them, their families, and countless others.   I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is long overdue. I am  excited that the introduction of my legislation now today will become  reality, and I am excited to be a partner and working with Chairman  Jeffries on this important legislation.   Finally, to conclude, I want just to say that race has been a factor,  and we are glad that we are moving beyond that. We must pass the EQUAL  Act.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone) for the work that he is doing.   Having served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and now serving on  Judiciary as the chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security  Subcommittee, I can affirmatively say that fentanyl kills. It kills  people. It kills our children, our mothers, our fathers. It kills the  family's infrastructure and system.   So let me just simply indicate that the idea of having an extension  of the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking to join in  the thoughtful discussion of what we are attempting to do on drugs that  kill.   We in the Judiciary Committee have been working and secured an  extension of fentanyl sanctions, and it was in acknowledgment that the  community is suffering by the harmful effects of fentanyl abuse and  usage. It was acknowledging that it is imperative that we find a  thoughtful resolution to address the grave tragedies that plague  communities like mine and those throughout the country.    Earlier, I mentioned names of individuals who were on the other side  in terms of incarceration because of the imbalance in drug enforcement.  But, again, we say that fentanyl kills.   Given the importance of getting this right, I am in support of  extending the measure in Judiciary, but I am in support of having the  opportunity for thoughtful discussion to deal with what our next steps  are.   Any way that we can come together to address the loss of life and, of  course, the acceptance that fentanyl kills, and other opioid substances  as well, used and abused, then I can assure you that we are doing the  right thing as Members of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I am most grateful for the  opportunity to join the gentleman from Colorado, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania.   I have just finished with a conference call with the director of the  CDC, but I just could not miss the opportunity, because I am almost in  a deja vu, having been here for--even shocking myself, because when you  are enjoying serving, you don't count the years--but more than two  decades. I have seen the dastardly results of government shutdown. So I  want to thank the gentleman for bringing this to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I believe that it is always important to know who  governs and how we are governed and what document do we yield to in  terms of being governed. And I heard my friend from Colorado make the  point that Democrats are ensuring that this government is governed.   This morning I was on the floor, and I made the point that I don't  stand here as a Democrat or a Republican but as an American, an  American that has the responsibility of government. And that means that  all of the shenanigans in the other body should be immediately  dispensed with.   One point of the Constitution that I always like reading is: We, the  people of the United States, in order to create or to form a more  perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide  for the common defense, promote the general welfare. This was the very  premise that the Founding Fathers--and everyone knows the Constitution  missed some elements on those who were slaves, missed elements on  women. They missed some elements; they missed some issues. But the  premise was that we gather for the general welfare, uniquely grounded  in some values of European principles but uniquely American.   Why did we form this government?   So having lived through government shutdowns, let me just, for a very  brief moment, capture the horrors of a government shutdown, which is  tied to ultimately the CR, but the effort that we, as Democrats, our  leader, our Speaker, our leadership, rightly so, were acting not as  Democrats but they were acting as leaders of this Nation, protecting  those who are most vulnerable.   So the full faith and credit is not something to dismiss. Let me say,  over and over again--I know it has been said on this floor--we are  paying bills. As I said, if you had the light on for the last 20 days,  you have a bill.   So to lift the debt ceiling--and I would like to characterize it some  other way--to provide the mechanism to pay your bills. If you had the  cable on for the last 20 days, you are paying your bill. So we are  simply paying the bill.   The lack of responding to paying bills creates inflation, puts a  damper on the view of America as an international destination for  businesses. It, in fact, crumbles the economy on the most vulnerable,  the hardworking bus driver, union worker, teacher. Because what you  have done is, you have not given their dollar substance. That is how  they make a living; that is how they pay for their responsibilities of  a quality of life.   I always think of the persons who cannot speak for themselves who are  doing great work. Teachers are doing great work; paramedics are doing  great work; nurses are doing great work. I always think of bus drivers,  because I think of school bus drivers. There is a shortage of school  bus drivers. They are all doing great work.   So let me say that I came on the floor because I clearly wanted to  emphasize the eloquent and important points that you are making, that  it is tomfoolery to make political points about the debt ceiling, which  is a responsibility that cannot be gotten rid of.   So it would be okay if I said: Well, we would want to say that. When  I say that, if you are playing politics, you say we don't want to do  that either, meaning those of us who are governing. But it is an  obligation of governing and governance, and it is constitutionally  vested not only in the language of full faith and credit but in the  opening statement of the Constitution. If we don't take care of the  general welfare, then who will?   I am grateful, as I close, to say that I support the INVEST Act and  one bill, the Build Back America Act. That is how I would proceed on  the unifying of those. The reason why I connect that, again, is to make  the point that, as I have read line by line of the Build Back--and I am  on the Budget Committee, and we sat on a Saturday to bring this bill  forward to you-all. And rightly so; we make no complaint about that.  But to get this bill here. It is ready. We passed it out of the Budget  Committee.                                time  1730    But as I looked at it, I have not deflected the gentleman here,  deflected families. But it is a justice for women act. It is finally  penetrating where women are in America, in terms of the care economy,  in terms of pre-K, in terms of child care, in terms of family  responsibilities. It is a bill that gives justice to women.   And so tie it to our responsibilities of governing, to lift the debt  ceiling for payment of our bills, and also this book, the Constitution,  doing our duty to create this Union that has been created to ensure  general tranquility and the general welfare of the American people. I  thank the gentleman for yielding to me and his leadership.
