 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  transformative and once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver for the  American public in a way that we have never seen before.  [[Page H6588]]    And to my colleagues, it is paid for.   The Build Back Better Act will create more than two million jobs each  year over the course of the next decade. It will also ensure universal  pre-K and extend the child tax credit to help lift thousands of  children out of poverty.   Democrats and Republicans, America, listen to me, we need to make  sure that everyone supports this. And for people who do not support  Build Back Better, there should be consequences because this is the  largest investment to combat the climate crisis in history.   It includes historical investments in HBCUs, it includes $150 billion  in our Nation's housing infrastructure.   This bill is a win for all. Do not be fooled. We have worked hard,  and this bill is for Democrats and it is for Republicans. People who do  not vote for this do not believe in America.
