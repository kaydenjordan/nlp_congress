 Madam Speaker, the American people have faced 52 weeks  of broken promises.   The President who promised to unite the American people instead has  pitted citizens against one another.   The President who promised to work with Americans across the  political spectrum has prioritized a radical agenda that caters only to  the extreme wing of his party.   The President who promised to protect the American people has left us  vulnerable at the southern border and across the world.   The President who promised to build back better has only hindered  America's economic recovery.   For a year, we have witnessed failure after failure. The American  people have paid the price. Day after day, Hoosiers and Americans  across the country experience the real ramifications of the Biden  administration's policy agenda.   With inflation at a 40-year high, we are paying the price of the  President's reckless spending during every trip to the grocery store  and the gas station.   Despite spending trillions of dollars on the President's so-called  rescue plan, we are facing escalating supply chain bottlenecks and  workforce shortages with no end in sight.   Thanks to the Biden administration's open border policy, every town  across America is a border town. As illicit drugs pour across the open  southern border, including a 1,000 percent increase of fentanyl last  year, every neighborhood is at risk.  [[Page H209]]    While Democrats work to defund the police, Americans are facing  dangerous crime surges in cities all across the country.   In the end, it all comes down to control. If you don't want to get  the vaccine, you are fired. If you dare to ask what your children are  learning in school, you are labeled a domestic terrorist.   This is America under 52 weeks of Joe Biden's leadership. The  American people deserve better.                                time  1930
