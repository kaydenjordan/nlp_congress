 Thank you very much for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to join my colleagues and people  throughout the United States to celebrate Black History Month. It may  come as a surprise to some that Black History Month is also celebrated  in Canada and the United Kingdom, although they do so in the United  Kingdom in the month of October.   Thanks to the hard work and persistence of Carter G. Woodson and the  Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, known today as the  Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the  celebration of Black history was inaugurated in 1926. In response to  Mr. Woodson's advocacy, it was to be for 1 week, the second week in  February, in order to envelope the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln,  February 12, and Frederick Douglass, February 14.   First proposed by students at Kent University in 1969 and 1970, the  week was officially expanded to a month in 1976. Gerald Ford was  President at the time. When the month was established, President Ford  urged the country to ``honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of  black Americans.'' There is a lot of talk about health care these days,  and in no area has the contributions of African Americans been more  neglected and dishonored as much as in the field of health care.   How many people are aware of the contributions of Charles Drew who  unlocked the secrets that led to the ability to perform blood  transfusions; or Daniel Hale Williams who performed the first  successful open-heart surgery; or Samuel Kountz who performed the first  successful kidney transplant not done on identical twins? Because of  these and many other slights in many other fields, Mr. Speaker, I have  not always celebrated this occasion with pleasure.   During those discussions back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I,  and many others, felt that the appropriate action was not just to  expand from 1 week to a month but to mandate the incorporation of  African-Americans' contributions and achievements throughout the  curricula of all of our schools year round.   But, with each passing day, I grow more and more appreciative and  respective of a lesson taught in 1 Corinthians 11:13, which I share  with you in Jim Clyburn's version. ``When I was a child, young and  inexperienced, I spoke with the reasoning and understanding of a child,  but as I grew and matured, I put those childish thoughts, expressions,  and ways behind me.''   I have come to understand, Mr. Speaker, that Black History Month is  not only about celebrating past achievements and contributions. It is  also a time for reflection and introspection.                                time  1945    Aristotle once intoned: ``A life without contemplation is not worth  living.''   I have spent a lot of introspective moments over the last several  weeks. Over the last several days, I have reflected on the comments  made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., at the annual meeting of the  Medical Committee for Human Rights back in 1966, when he said: ``Of all  the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking  and inhumane.''   That is what was on my mind when I addressed this House on the day  that we passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. On that  occasion, I referred to the Affordable Care Act as the civil rights act  of the 21st century.   It may seem a bit odd to some to hear the Affordable Care Act  referred to as a civil rights act, but that is exactly what it is. The  Affordable Care Act outlawed discrimination against children with  preexisting conditions, outlawed discrimination against people with  disabilities, and outlawed discrimination against women just because  they are women.   Mr. Speaker, I want to believe that we have grown and matured beyond  where we were when our country allowed insurance companies to  discriminate against women with breast cancer  [[Page H1119]]  and men with prostate cancer. I would like to believe, Mr. Speaker,  that we have put behind us the childish practice of kicking children  off of their family insurance policies as soon as they turn 21, even if  they are still in school or have not yet found employment. Mr. Speaker,  what could be more childish and immature than allowing insurance  companies to deny benefits to the sick and disabled in order to gain  big bonuses and payouts for executives?   These arguments are not new. In fact, they are reminiscent of an age- old debate.   Fifty years ago, during my years of student protest, there were those  who urged us to slow down. You are pushing too hard, too fast, they  would say. Some of those who wanted a slower approach claimed to be on  our side, like those eight White ministers who implored Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., to slow down, arguing that Christianity took 2,000  years to accomplish all it has. Those ministers believed that the  escalation of marches and demonstrations to secure civil rights was  unwise and untimely.   In 1963, while sitting in the Birmingham city jail, Dr. King started  penning a letter that, of course, he finished after leaving jail, but  in that letter he dealt with the whole issue of time. In his letter,  Dr. King said: ``Time itself is neutral; it can be used either  destructively or constructively.''   He continued: ``More and more I feel that the people of ill will have  used time much more effectively than the people of good will. We will  have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful word and  actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good  people.''   Dr. King continued: ``Human progress never rolls in on wheels of  inevitably; it comes through the tireless efforts of men''--and, I  might add, women--``willing to be coworkers with God, and without this  hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social  stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that time is  always ripe to do right.''   I believe these words ring true today, in our current situation. Our  Nation has waited for nearly a century to find a way to bring all its  citizens into the healthcare system. The time was ripe to do right for  the American people.
